The woman, who was in her 60s, contracted COVID-19 while aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship. She died in the Canberra Hospital. “I offer my sincere condolences to this person’s family and friends,” Dr Coleman said on Wednesday. Dr Coleman said the woman’s death – the 63rd in Australia – acted as a reminder at a time when new cases in Canberra remained flat. “While we have seen a flattening of the curve in Canberra, it is necessary that we continue taking physical distancing seriously to protect these vulnerable groups,” she said. There have been no new diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Canberra in the past 48 hours. There have been 103 cases identified in the ACT, with 77 of those people already recovered. On Tuesday, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr expressed his pleasure with the majority of Canberrans for following health advice over the long weekend. Just one new case was reported over the Easter long weekend. But Mr Barr warned against complacency, after ACT Policing noted some locations, such as IKEA and a popular walk around Lake Burley Griffin, were at times too crowded. “The fantastic work that people have been doing, day in day out for weeks, can all be undone by one large crowd gathering,” Mr Barr said. Some Canberrans who were headed to the coast were also turned back by police. However, no fines were issued."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Man jailed for breaking quarantine in Western Australia","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/wa\/2020\/04\/15\/man-jailed-breaking-quarantine-wa\/","transcript":"A man who defied a coronavirus quarantine directive, repeatedly sneaking out of a Perth hotel to visit his girlfriend has become the first Australian jailed for the offence. However, he will only serve one month behind bars. Jonathan David, 35, pleaded guilty in Perth Magistrates Court to two counts of failing to comply with a direction. He was sentenced on Wednesday to six months and two weeks in prison but the majority of the term was suspended. That means if he commits another crime over the next 12 months, he could be forced to serve the rest of the prison sentence. He was also fined $2000. David had travelled from Victoria and was sent into quarantine at the Travelodge Hotel in Perth for 14 days, but instead snuck out and used public transport. Police said he even wedged open a fire exit door at the hotel so he could leave and return without staff seeing him. A police prosecutor previously described David’s actions as “gross stupidity”. Magistrate Elaine Campione said David had been “more than foolish” and was “selfish in the extreme” during a state of emergency. “You chose to roll the dice with other people’s lives and that was breathtakingly arrogant,” she said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"More confusion for parents, students as term two gets underway","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/education\/2020\/04\/15\/term-two-schools-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Parents and students have endured another day of confusion and frustration as some schools opened and politicians insisted it was safe to attend during the coronavirus pandemic. Victorian parents complained of network outages and crashes as students in that state officially started term two through online learning on Wednesday. Premier Daniel Andrews acknowledged “some bumps” on the first day. “There’ll be challenges. We’ve never had day one of term two look like this before,” he said. “Every Victorian government school is open today and for those who can’t learn at home, that is an option.” Students and parents logging in for the new term reported school websites and online learning portal Compass crashing in the first hour of the day. Caroline Hamilton, who has three school-aged daughters, said there had been a few early “hiccups”. “The teenagers are actually doing all right with theirs, they’ve been able to get into Compass but a lot of their friends haven’t been able to, and the little one, her primary school’s Compass has completely crashed,” Ms Hamilton told the ABC. “She has been quite frustrated trying to get online but she is soldiering on as best she can.” Elsewhere, federal Education Minister Dan Tehan rejected suggestions of mixed messages about sending children to school during the pandemic. But less than 24 hours before his own children were due to start on Thursday, he wasn’t sure if they would attend. “I’ll be continuing to have discussions with them about that. We’ll wait and see what happens,” he said. The Victorian MP denied the indecision highlighted parents’ confusion. “I think it’s safe for children to be at school,” he said. “But obviously in Victoria they’re saying if you can learn at home, that’s their preference. I’ll have a discussion and see if they want to go to school.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison released a social media video, pleading with teachers to keep classrooms open. “The education of our children hangs in the balance,” he said.  Message to teachers Thank you to all our heroes on the frontline of our fight against the coronavirus, but especially our teachers. You do an incredible job educating our kids. During these tough times, your role has never been more important. Posted by Scott Morrison (ScoMo) on Tuesday, April 14, 2020 Mr Morrison said open schools were important for children who could not learn at home, such as those whose parents are essential workers. “We will lose many things in the course of fighting this virus,” he said. “One thing that I know teachers are united on, with their parents, is we do not want one of those things to be the loss of a child’s education, giving up a whole year of their learning.” Mr Andrews rejected the idea of conflicting messages, saying there was “no difference in our approach” between the state and federal governments. He said the message across the country was “stay at home, learn from home if you can. If, however, your circumstances mean that you can’t, school will be open for you”. But Labor’s education spokesperson Tanya Plibersek accused Mr Morrison of contradicting state and territory leaders. “Parents just want clear information. So do teachers. This mess must be cleaned up immediately,” she said. Political leaders will discuss the future of schools and how to protect teachers from the coronavirus when national cabinet meets on Thursday. Classrooms across the country are moving towards remote learning as a result of coronavirus. ACT: Term two starts April 28. Online learning for most students, schools will be open for the children of essential workers. Northern Territory: Starts April 20.

John-Paul Drake, the director of Drakes Supermarkets, posted a video on YouTube recounting the customer’s outrageous refund demand. “He said he wanted to get a refund yesterday on 150 packets of 32-pack toilet paper, and 150 units of one-litre sanitiser,” Mr Drake said. “I told him that,” Mr Drake said, sticking his middle finger up at the camera. “That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country.”  He said the shopper had bought the goods, worth around $10,000, with the help of a “team” of stockpilers when panic buying spiked about four weeks ago. “In that conversation [the shopper said] ‘my eBay site has been shut down, so we couldn’t profiteer off that’,” Mr Drake told ABC Radio Adelaide. The chain – which has 50 stores across South Australia and Queensland – has been hit hard by the panic buying in recent weeks and months. “We’ve sold eight months of toilet paper in four weeks… a year’s supply of flour in nine days,” revealed Mr Drake. “If everyone had just bought the things they needed in their immediate short-term, we would be fine,” he said. “We have have some staggering statistics.” Supermarkets across the country now have limits on particular items that have been subject to panic buying.

The package will include $420 million in land tax relief for landlords who provide tenants with rent discounts, while $80 million will go towards rental assistance for Victorians experiencing rental distress. During a press conference this morning, Mr Andrews said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had increased by eight since yesterday to 1,299 but the death toll remained at 14. He said 21 people were in hospital with a further 18 in intensive care. “All in all these numbers are stable, the strategy is working,” he said, and thanked Victorians who were “following the rules”. “These numbers are the product of people doing the right thing,” he said. He said “every single Victorian” would be “touched by tragedy” if the situation unfolded like it has in other countries. Mr Andrews said landlords would receive a 25 per cent discount on their land tax if they provided tenants impacted by the coronavirus crisis with rent relief, with any remaining land tax able to be deferred until March 2021. A new Coronavirus Relief Deputy Commissioner will be established at the State Revenue Office to manage claims. The government is also setting up a fast-tracked dispute resolution process for tenants and landlords, to be mediated by Consumer Affairs Victoria or the Victorian Small Business Commission. Mr Andrews said the government wanted landlords and tenants to have “good faith” negotiations and he was “very confident there will be agreements”. “It’s in everyone’s interests,” he said. But “even with a good faith agreement” there would be many Victorians under rental stress, he added. The $80 million rental assistance fund will be for renters facing hardship due to the coronavirus crisis. These payments will be capped at $2,000. To be eligible, renters will need to have registered their revised agreement with Consumer Affairs Victoria or gone through mediation, have less than $5,000 in savings and still be paying at least 30 per cent of their income in rent. Mr Andrews said the government was also introducing a temporary ban on evictions and pausing rental increases for six months. The changes required for the measures will be legislated during a special sitting of Parliament next Thursday. Treasurer Tim Pallas said his expectation was for landlords and tenants to work together “And what that means is essentially you have to sit down together and go through your arrangements,” Mr Pallas said. Mr Pallas said he expected more than 10,000 landlords would access the land tax relief. “You have to have reached an agreement,” Mr Pallas said. Measures welcomed by tenants’ advocates Tenants Victoria chief executive Jennifer Beveridge said the land tax relief would be a good incentive for landlords to enter into mediation with renters and the moratorium on evictions and rent increases was urgently needed. “Tenants Victoria especially welcomes the $80 million identified to provide relief for renters who are in rental stress,” Ms Beveridge said. “Every day of this crisis we are hearing stories of distress, including in one share house where three of the four renters have lost their jobs. “This issue has particularly impacted on young people and families who just don’t have the savings to get them through this period.” Victorian Council of Social Service chief executive Emma King said the new measures gave renters strong and necessary protections. However, Ms King said the detail of how negotiations would work was yet to be explained. “It’s also unclear whether renters who accept a payment deferral will end up saddled with a mountain debt at the end of the pandemic,” Ms King said. “That would be a tragic and dangerous outcome.” A statement from Victoria Police earlier said officers had conducted 824 spot checks and issued 52 fines for breaches of coronavirus restrictions in the 24 hours to 11pm on Tuesday The statement said examples of breaches included: During the press conference, Mr Andrews said the “vast, vast majority of people” were doing the right thing. He defended Victoria Police’s handling of fines and said while some mistakes had been made, the force had been doing a good job. He said fines were not issued for “trifling matters” but were matters of “life and death”. “You can have tens of thousands of warnings given out, well that just means that you’re telling Victorians you don’t need to follow the rules,” he said. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NZ PM, ministers take coronavirus pay cuts – but Morrison won't follow","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/15\/jacinda-ardern-coronavirus-pay-cut\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has ruled out following New Zealand’s move to cut pay for federal government ministers and public service chiefs. Mr Morrison said the government preferred the current pay freeze for politicians and top-ranking public servants, rather than a cut. “It’s not something that’s being considered,” he told 6PR radio on Wednesday. New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday she and her Cabinet would take 20 per cent pay cuts for the next six months to reflect tough economic conditions during the COVID-19 crisis. “I absolutely accept this is not going to change the government books but for us it’s about leadership,” she said. “It’s an acknowledgement of the hit many New Zealanders are taking right now.” The pay cut will also be extended to New Zealand’s senior public servants. Ms Ardern’s announcement was backed by NZ opposition leader Simon Bridges, who volunteered for the same reduction within minutes of her announcement. Ms Ardern is one of the highest-paid world leaders, taking home an annual wage of $NZ470,000 ($A447,000). “We acknowledge New Zealanders that are reliant on wage subsidies, taking pay cuts and losing their jobs,” she said. As Australia’s PM, Mr Morrison receives a base salary of about $550,000 a year, while the Treasurer is paid $396,000. Cabinet ministers get at least $364,000, depending on their responsibilities. The federal government said last week it had asked the Remuneration Tribunal to impose a 12-month freeze on pay rises. But a cut is not being contemplated. Mr Morrison said public servants were working hard to deliver important coronavirus response measures, including wage subsidies. “They do a great job and they’re as much on the frontline saving people’s livelihoods frankly as nurses working in hospitals,” he said. “Everyone is working hard here. Everyone who is in a job is in an essential job. I just want to support them in those jobs so I’m not keen to get into a competition.” Earlier, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also shot down suggestions Australia should follow New Zealand’s example. “We have frozen the pay increases for politicians here and for public servants,” he said in Canberra. “That’s the action we have taken.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'The animals we'll slaughter first': Zoos' terrible coronavirus dilemma","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/15\/zoo-coronavirus-slaughter-animals\/","transcript":"A desperate German zoo has drawn up a list of the animals it can slaughter to feed to others as donations and visitors dry up in the coronavirus crisis. “We’ve listed the animals we’ll have to slaughter first,” Neumuenster Zoo’s Verena Kaspari told Die Welt. European zoos should have been crowded as spring and summer looms. But instead, strict lockdowns have keep visitors away, and donations are also scarce. Ms Kaspari, the director of Neumuenster Zoo in northern Germany, said using some animals to feed others would be a last resort. But it was still possible – partly because closed borders across Europe mean the zoo’s residents cannot be taken anywhere else. But even such an “unpleasant” option would not solve the financial problems, she said. The zoo’s seals and penguins needed big quantities of fresh fish daily, she said. “I will have to euthanise animals before I starve them to death,” she said. “At the worst, we would have to feed some of the animals to others.” Ms Kaspari’s zoo is not covered by German assistance packages for small businesses. She estimates the zoo’s loss of income this spring would be about €175,000 ($A300,000). Elsewhere, the director of Schwerin Zoo, Tim Schikora, said there might be more complex problems ahead. “It would also be much more problematic for the animals if their keepers fall ill and can no longer care for them,” he said. Quarantine accommodation has been set up at Schwerin Zoo to prepare for keepers catching coronavirus. The BBC reports that Germany’s zoos have asked for €100 million in public aid. The country’s national zoo association (VdZ) said zoos, unlike many other businesses, could not go into hibernation and run down costs. Animals still had to be fed daily and looked after, while tropical enclosures have to be heated. VdZ chief Jorg Junhold said the coronavirus lockdown was costing a typical German zoo about €500,000 a week in lost turnover. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"High Court throws out AFP warrant against News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst | The New Daily","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/15\/high-court-throws-out-afp-warrant-against-news-corp-journalist-annika-smethurst\/","transcript":"The warrant used by Australian Federal Police officers to search the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst last year has been thrown out by the High Court. Ms Smethurst’s home was raided after the Sunday Telegraph published a story she wrote on plans to expand the powers of the Australian Signals Directorate. More than a year after the story went to print, the AFP obtained a search warrant for a range of general items belonging to Ms Smethurst and an order she provide her phone password. The raid sparked a national debate about press freedom, which intensified when AFP officers searched the ABC’s Sydney headquarters over a different story the same week. The High Court found the warrant was invalid as it misstated the relevant law and failed to specify the offence being investigated. As a result, the court did not consider whether the raid impacted freedom of political communication. The court ordered the AFP pay the costs of Ms Smethurst and News Corp. Lawyers for Ms Smethurst, and her employer News Corp, argued the court should issue an injunction requiring the AFP to hand back the seized materials or destroy any copies. While the court was unanimous in quashing the warrant, it was divided over what should happen to the material seized. The data taken from Ms Smethurst’s phone was identified through specific word searches for items including mentions of the ASD and story pitches. The Commonwealth had asked the High Court to find it should be allowed to keep the material, even if it was obtained illegally. While three judges said they thought the material should not be kept by police, the majority of the court declined to make an order, meaning police could keep the material for any future possible prosecution related to the case. The decision opens up the issue to further legal argument. If the case was ever to come to trial, lawyers could argue the data was not able to be used as evidence because the warrant had been thrown out by the highest legal authority in the land. But no trial is on the horizon, and Attorney-General Christian Porter has said any decision on prosecuting journalists will need to be signed off by him. A spokesman for the AFP said it was considering the decision and would “act in accordance with the ruling”."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Jeff Kennett nearly died in freak car accident | The New Daily","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/04\/15\/jeff-kennett-car-accident\/","transcript":"Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett feared he was about to die when he suffered an accident that saw him dragged under his own car earlier this year.

The federal government believes restrictions on the community could be eased in the months ahead if there’s more testing, greater surveillance of those infected by the coronavirus and much faster tracing of those they’ve had contact with. It is developing a mobile phone app with the private sector to help monitor Australians’ daily interactions. The ABC understands the app will be ready in a fortnight but the government believes it would need at least 40 per cent of Australians to voluntarily sign up for it to be effective. The app would be opt-in only and not mandatory. It is understood the app would plot who had spent 15 minutes or more in close proximity with a person who proves to be COVID-19 positive. The challenge facing the government will be encouraging enough Australians to sign up. Singapore, which is considered a more compliant society, has developed a similar app but only 20 per cent of its citizens have agreed to share their mobile phone data with the government. That app, called TraceTogether, uses bluetooth technology to record contact with other people, even if you do not know them. Prime Minister Scott Morrison discussed technological tactics in the fight against COVID-19 with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three weeks ago. Singapore even shared some computer coding to help with the app development. “We need a greater degree of tracing capability for contacts, and that can happen much more quickly than it does now,” Mr Morrison said on Tuesday. “We need a greater health capacity to be able to respond to these sort of outbreaks and respond very effectively.” Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy also indicated the app was in the advanced stages of development. “We’re very keen to use it and use it perhaps even more extensively than Singapore,” Dr Murphy said. “Obviously there’s a conversation to be had with the community on the acceptability of it. “But we think that the idea of the app is a really excellent one if you’ve programmed it properly, and got the right community buy-in, so we’re actively looking at that.” Attorney General Christian Porter is examining the privacy implications of the app."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Scott Morrison told to keep out of schooling debate | The New Daily","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/15\/scott-morrison-told-to-keep-out-of-schooling-debate\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been told to keep out of the schooling debate after saying the education of children “hangs in the balance” on Wednesday.

The Prime Minister pleaded with teachers to keep classrooms open during the coronavirus pandemic, as states mull when to fully refill classrooms. Mr Morrison said schools remaining open was important for the children who can’t learn at home, such as those whose parents are essential workers. “We will lose many things in the course of fighting this virus,” the Prime Minister said in a social media video. “One thing that I know teachers are united on, with their parents, is we do not want one of those things to be the loss of a child’s education, giving up a whole year of their learning.” Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk reckons parents should talk to their school principals about whether their kids should attend school next week. She has urged the community for patience ahead of the new school term. Ms Palaszczuk said each school is best able assess the needs of students, especially if parents are worried about homeschooling while they are working from home. “They should talk to their principal about whether or not they can continue to supervise from home,” she said. But Labor’s education spokesperson Tanya Plibersek hit out at the Prime Minster’s plea, saying he was contradicting state and territory leaders. “Parents just want clear information. So do teachers. This mess must be cleaned up immediately,” she said on Wednesday. In Queensland, where school resumes on Monday, an exam has been axed from the Year 12 curriculum because of the COVID-19 crisis. Education Minister Grace Grace says that instead of Year 12 students having four exams, they will now only have three in 2020. And for parents supervising their children just two to three hours of learning each day will usually be enough, Ms Grace has told The Courier-Mail. During a Facebook Live session on Tuesday afternoon Ms Grace told Year 12 students “Good news! You are only doing three exams this year”. “One has been eliminated, two internal – one has already been done – so one more internal and then you’ll have an external exam…We want to make sure that there is no Year 13.” Schools, kindergartens and childcare centres will remain open for vulnerable students and children of essential workers when term two begins. Ms Grace also clarified the definition of an essential worker. “If you are required in your workplace and unable to supervise your children at home or make suitable arrangements, then you are deemed to be an essential worker,” she said. Remote learning is locked in until May 22 although a decision on it whether is extended will be made by May 15. Meanwhile, learning packs are being sent to students across the state, with the minister saying teachers will be in contact with parents and carers while the tests and instructional papers will be delivered to households so they can learn remotely. “If you are struggling please contact the school and let them know where you are struggling and what the issues are,” she said. Staff at schools and childcare centres are now on the list of those who can be tested for COVID-19. An additional 11 COVID-19 cases have been recorded across the state overnight bringing the total to 998 cases. Five Queenslanders have died from coronavirus while 442 patients have recovered.

Mr Trump made the announcement at a White House briefing on Wednesday morning (Australian time). “I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organisation while a review is conducted to assess the world World Health Organisation’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,” he said. The President said “so much death has been caused by their mistakes”. “It would have been so easy to be truthful,” he said. “We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms.” Mr Trump said the world depended on the United Nations’ agency to work with countries to make sure accurate information about health threats were shared in a timely manner. The coronavirus has been blamed for more than 125,000 deaths worldwide, including more than 25,000 in the US. The US contributed nearly $US900 million ($A1.4 billion) to the WHO’s budget for 2018-19, according to information on the agency’s website. That represents a fifth of its total $4.4 billion budget for those years. In its most recent budget proposal from February, the Trump administration called for slashing the US assessed funding contribution to the WHO to $57.9 million. Mr Trump said he had deep concerns about whether “US generosity” had been put to the best possible use at the UN organisation. The coronavirus outbreak could have been contained at its source, sparing thousands of lives, if the WHO had done a better job investigating reports coming out of China, Mr Trump said. Instead, he accused it of promoting China’s “disinformation” about the virus. The announcement came a week after Mr Trump threatened the move. At the time, he said the WHO was “China-centric” and had “missed the call” on the coronavirus pandemic. There was no immediate comment from the Geneva-based organisation on Mr Trump’s announcement.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has appointed Sydney silk Bret Walker – who successfully appealed against George Pell’s conviction in the High Court – to conduct the inquiry. The barrister will be given “extraordinary powers” to investigate all matters and agencies involved with the Ruby Princess’ departure and its return to Circular Quay on March 19. On that day, 2700 passengers were allowed to disembark despite some showing symptoms of, and being swabbed for, coronavirus. Their test results had not yet been received when the passengers were allowed off the boat. State and federal health and border protection agencies, as well as the ship’s management company, have been locked in a slanging match as to who is responsible for the debacle. Eighteen passengers have died and hundreds of cases have been connected to the ship, including some who were infected by passengers in the community. The inquiry will be expected to report back to the Premier in three to four months, while the concurrent NSW Police criminal investigation will not conclude for another five months. “It is important that answers are provided quickly for the people of NSW,” Ms Berejiklian said. “I have decided that the quickest path to answers is through a powerful and independent inquiry.” The Ruby Princess docked at Port Kembla a week ago and a private health company, Aspen Medical, was in charge of assessing care on the ship. At least 128 crew on board have also tested positive to COVID-19. There have been numerous evacuations of crew from the ship requiring emergency care in hospital. The criminal investigation – launched last week – already has 220 leads. Police suggested the starting point of the investigation was assessing whether the Ruby Princess and its operator, Carnival Cruises, were honest about the illness onboard.

Mr Obama posted a video to his Twitter account to make the announcement, during which he spoke of Mr Biden’s role as his vice-president and praised him for having the “qualities we need in a president right now.” “Choosing Joe to be my vice-president was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend,” Mr Obama said. I’m proud to endorse my friend @JoeBiden for President of the United States. Let's go: https:\/\/t.co\/maHVGRozkX — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) April 14, 2020 “Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery,” Mr Obama said, referencing the current coronavirus pandemic. “Joe was there as we rebuilt from the Great Recession and rescued the American auto industry. He was the one asking what every policy would do for the middle class and everyone striving to get into the middle class.” Mr Biden responded to the tweet, saying the endorsement “meant the world to him.” Mr Biden became the Democratic nominee after rival Bernie Sanders stepped out of the race last week. Barack — This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We’re going to build on the progress we made together, and there’s no one I’d rather have standing by my side. https:\/\/t.co\/0mAjPZeYmd — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 14, 2020 Senator Sanders said his decision to end his campaign was not an easy one. “Please know that I do not make this decision lightly,” he said in a livestreamed speech to supporters. “If I believe we had a feasible path to the nomination I would continue, but I know that it’s just not there.” Although Senator Sanders said he fully supported Mr Biden as the nominee, he added he would remain on the ballots in remaining primaries and collect electoral delegates to influence the party platform at the nominating convention. Mr Obama may have stayed out of the primary race but Mr Biden frequently pointed to their time together in the White House during the campaign and often spoke of the Obama-Biden administration when talking about various accomplishments and referred to himself as an “Obama-Biden Democrat.” Despite that he also tried to insist he was running as his own man, telling anyone who asked that he urged Mr Obama not to endorse him out of the gate, or even in the thick of the primary. Mr Biden’s primary campaign also saw him attacked by fellow Democrats over his links to Mr Obama — Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke subtly jabbed Mr Biden — and by extension Mr Obama — by suggesting the party shouldn’t “return to the past”, while Mr Sanders and Elizabeth Warren said the 2010 Affordable Care Act hadn’t gone far enough. But Mr Biden was a staunch defender of that legislation and called it “bizarre” for Democrats, even faintly, to attack Mr Obama’s record. US President Donald Trump is yet to respond to Mr Obama’s endorsement. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Worker 'absolutely mortified' after virus cluster grows in aged-care home","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/15\/coronavirus-aged-care-nsw\/","transcript":"A western Sydney aged-care worker who worked six shifts with mild coronavirus symptoms is “absolutely mortified” at the cluster of cases that has spread to five other staff and four residents. The woman reportedly had only a scratchy throat before testing positive for the virus. NSW’s chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the staff member was distressed at the infections at Anglicare’s Newmarch House in Kingswood. “This person is absolutely mortified,” she said. “I would urge people to remember that the symptoms of COVID can be incredibly mild and the key point is do not go to work.” Dr Chant said those who worked with elderly or vulnerable people should be aware of “even minor changes in your health”. “It doesn’t matter how mild those symptoms are – runny nose, sore throat, just a scratchy throat in this case. Please don’t go to work,” she said. “But I would like to reiterate that that worker is incredibly distraught.” The aged-care facility cases were among 16 new coronavirus infections in NSW revealed on Wednesday morning. They took the state’s total to 2886. Anglicare Sydney chief executive Grant Millard said on Wednesday the worker had shown no symptoms during her last shift at Newmarch House. “Nothing was disclosed to us when she was last seen on April 6th, she did not display any symptoms,” Mr Millard told ABC TV. The woman was seen by a residential manager at the time, he said. “At that time they requested some time off work. We’re not sure why they did that,” Mr Millard said. Anglicare has traced all workers from the facility, including anyone who’d had contact with those infected at the home. Some 40 staff had been stood down to self-isolate at home, Mr Millard said. Approximately 100 residents – with an average age of 85 – are isolating in their own rooms. They are being tended to by staff wearing protective equipment. “We brought in extra physios, extra staff in order to deal with this very challenging situation – it’s very, very tough,” Mr Millard said. “People are rightfully upset. We’re very concerned, but the critical issue at this stage is to ensure that we have the testing results for everyone in the home who has been tested yesterday.” Family members of some residents were also distressed, Mr Millard said. Coronavirus is also crippling Tasmania’s north-west, where a 91-year-old woman became the state’s sixth person to die from COVID-19. Two hospitals in Tasmania’s north-west have been closed for disinfection and cleaning to try to halt the worrying clusters centred there. But it isn’t just Australia’s senior citizens who show great susceptibility to coronavirus infection. In England and Wales, 2000 care homes have suffered outbreaks of COVID-19. Northern Ireland resident Brenda Doherty’s mother, 82, died three weeks ago. She said the pain suffered by families was unspeakable. “One of the hardest things was not being able to be with mum at the very end,” she told the ABC. “But I know, I understand why that was. And I know it was about protecting the nursing staff and ourselves.” In New Zealand, there have been six COVID-19 deaths at an aged-care facility in Christchurch. New Zealand’s total toll from the deadly virus was at nine on Wednesday morning. The Rosewood Resthome and Hospital in Christchurch has a further 33 confirmed or probable coronavirus cases, including 18 among workers. In Sweden, where measures to slow the spread of coronavirus have been far more relaxed than in Australia, more and more nursing home residents are becoming infected or dying from the virus. Sweden has hit the grim milestone of more than 1000 coronavirus deaths. Many are the result of the virus spreading in aged-care homes. Anders Tegnell, an epidemiologist with the Swedish Public Health Agency, said one reason for the country’s comparatively high toll, despite its relatively small population of 10.3 million, was that the coronavirus had entered aged-care homes. “It is obvious that they are an environment that is sensitive to the infection, and that means that when you get the infection into that age group you get many deaths,” he said. Neighbouring Norway, which has introduced stricter coronavirus measures, including closing schools and kindergartens, has reported 138 COVID-19 deaths and about 6600 novel coronavirus cases."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Legal experts question \"messy\" coronavirus laws as police fine hundreds","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/15\/legal-coronavirus-laws\/","transcript":"Legal advocates have questioned the “unfair” enforcement of social distancing laws by police, with hefty fines being issued over seemingly harmless activities like sitting in a parked car. Across the nation, people have been fined more than $1000 for breaching stay-at-home orders by visiting friends, having dinner parties or simply being out in public without a “reasonable excuse”. New South Wales has issued more than 470 penalty notices since March 17, and Victoria issued 158 fines in a 24-hour period to 9am on Monday alone. Queensland police have dished out 827 fines since March 27, including 73 in the past 24 hours. Although it is vital police enforce social distancing laws to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, some Australians have been shocked to receive fines while trying to abide by the rules. In an embarrassing blunder in Victoria, a couple from the small town of Toongabbie were fined $1652 each for breaching stay-at-home orders after posting photos to social media that were taken on holiday last June. Police have since revoked the fine. In the Melbourne suburb of Preston, Victoria Police arrested a refugee advocate and fined dozens of others a total of $43,000 for staging a protest outside a hotel housing refugees and asylum seekers. Each protester was seated in a car by themselves to comply with social distancing rules while they protested against the crowded conditions inside the hotel. The police fined them, despite the activists arguing they did it for “compassionate reasons”. In NSW, a 21-year-old Newcastle man was fined $1000 for eating a kebab on a park bench after ignoring police warnings, and in the Hunter region a couple was fined $2000 for sitting in a parked car without explanation. Sydney criminal lawyer Annabel Wurth said many of the coronavirus laws were “rife with errors” and would not stand up in court if they were challenged. “Overnight, all these things people would do in their regular life suddenly became criminal,” Ms Wurth told The New Daily. “I had one call from someone who was sitting in a park having a coffee with their dad and police said ‘We can arrest you for this’. “It’s quite messy legislation. No one really knows how to interpret it and it’s quite unfair in its application.” To help inform Australians about their legal rights in the coronavirus era, Ms Wurth has created a legal service called COVID Rights. “There needs to be a lawyer to say, ‘I can answer your calls’,” she said. You have the right to remain silent, Ms Wurth said, although she would not recommend it. “Make sure you’ve got a clear list of excuses, and think about it beforehand,” she said. Under stay-at-home orders, there are only four reasons deemed acceptable for leaving the house: Shopping for essentials, work and school, exercise, and medical or compassionate reasons. “You need to know the legislation and have a clear answer,” Ms Wurth said. “I wouldn’t recommend having a car with more than two people. “Even if you all live together, one of you might not have an updated address and you could be fined.” Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International Australia and the Grata Fund have thrown their support behind a website by the Police Accountability Project that records “concerning” interactions with police over coronavirus legislation. In one report, a man with a severe acquired brain injury was taking a break from exercising at a northern Melbourne park with his carer when he was approached by police. He said the police told him move on because they “couldn’t just be lounging around”. In another report, a man terminally ill with cancer was taking a break in his car at Coffs Harbour Jetty when he was asked to move on by police.

Now he has to wait at least six months to be able to use his hand again – all to help save more lives. Mr Gibbons knows his unexpected wait for surgery is in the “greater good”, but that doesn’t lessen the excruciating pain. He’s not alone. Public and private hospitals have been temporarily banned from performing elective surgeries to ensure they don’t run out of beds or personal protective equipment during the coronavirus pandemic. The Morrison government’s expectation that the virus will cause significant disruptions for at least six months means patients may need to wait until after the outbreak has been contained to be operated on. But the Australian Patients Association is warning there could be a backlog that, if not managed properly, may leave people suffering. “It’s important to clear that backlog as quickly as we can,” CEO Stephen Mason said. With Victorians potentially being made to wait as long as 18 months, Mr Mason is proposing that the government continues using private hospital beds even after Australia gets on top of the coronavirus, to reduce public hospital elective surgery waiting lists. Their waiting is “not in vain”, said public health lecturer at La Trobe University, Adamm Ferrier. The qualified nurse called them “silent heroes” and praised “their sacrifice”. “I acknowledge their pain and their suffering at the moment but … their forbearance is so people that would die with COVID-19 have a chance of survival,” Mr Ferrier said. Mr Gibbons was pulling to safety a man who was in danger of drowning at Sydney’s Bondi Beach when he tore two ligaments in his right wrist. After getting an MRI and X-ray, the surf lifesaver was told he needed to be operated on “straight away”, and his surgery was deemed category 1. He drove from Sydney to Adelaide, where he knew of a trusted family friend surgeon that could perform the procedure. He then put himself through quarantine for two weeks at the surgeon’s request, only to be told in the end that the operation isn’t going ahead. “I can’t have it until the coronavirus has gone,” Mr Gibbons said. “Even though this is an urgent elective surgery … they [the hospital] basically said I’ve just got to deal with this for the next six months or however long it takes.” Aside from moving into a friend’s house for help with everyday tasks, Mr Gibbons is having to deal with the “constant pain” of a broken wrist, but understands “it’s for the greater good”. “Given this is potentially a mid- to long-term situation, six to 12 months, I don’t want to be reliant on painkillers because it is something that could go quite bad quite quickly,” he said. “I do know of people that have started taking it and have become reliant on it, so I’ve just been trying to suck up the pain.” Like Mr Gibbons, Catherine, 37, a fitness instructor and freelance journalist from Melbourne, understands coronavirus patients must take priority but that doesn’t make things any easier. After waiting nearly nine months for a hip replacement, Ms Woods was not far off the scheduled surgery date when she rang her hospital and was told it would be “indefinitely postponed”. “While the orthopaedic liaison unit has been extraordinarily compassionate, they couldn’t give me any information. That’s really the most difficult aspect of this,” she said. “More than the physical pain is that psychological buildup of going ‘right I’m going to be unconscious, someone is going to be sawing open parts of my body. I can do this. I’m ready. Let’s go do it’. “To be then told ‘we don’t know when it’s going to happen, we could call you a week before but then maybe it’ll be another six months’ – psychologically, that’s the difficult part … especially if you are my age and your job depends on your body and your income depends on your body being well.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"New Zealand Police release hilarious coronavirus series","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/15\/coronavirus-new-zealand-police\/","transcript":"As Australia’s police come under fire for being heavy handed with social distancing fines, their counterparts in New Zealand are being lauded for using song and humour. New Zealand Police has teamed with production company Wellington Paranormal to create a series of light-hearted videos addressing the importance of locking down properly. In the most recent instalment, the “acclaimed world hit Two Metres Please” is performed by Officer O’Leary, played by actor Karen O’Leary. “Two metres please, two metres please, I don’t want to breathe your Covid, if you start to wheeze,” she sings. The post alongside the video reads: “The two-metre song (it’s gone err, viral) now released as a single. Sing it all day, and tomorrow, and the next day …” The song makes up one part of a 10-episode series covering having fun at home during isolation and misconceptions around the virus. Deputy chief executive of NZ Police’s media and communications Jane Archibald said: “We have a powerful social media following and it’s essential we use it to maximum effect during this challenging period. “People have come to expect just a little humour from us. It’s part of our brand, so we wanted to engage with New Zealanders on our social platforms in a campaign-style they are used to. “So we’ve teamed up with Wellington Paranormal to share police and community messages, which we hope will reach everyone in the community so they understand they need to be doing the right thing around self-isolation, and not put themselves in a position where they could ‘pass it on’.” It is not the first time NZ Police has used humour to convey important social messages. Wellington Paranormal has previously worked with the police on a 2018 recruitment video, and a series of road safety videos."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"With poker machines offline, Australia's gamblers hit the jackpot","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/15\/poker-machines-offline-gamblers-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Gambling reform advocates say the coronavirus crisis provides a chance to break the poker machine industry’s hold on Australian society, but warn the shutdown also presents dangers through increased online wagering. The COVD-19 crisis is causing widespread economic chaos, but the closure of the multibillion-dollar poker machine industry is actually helping Australian gamblers save $34.2 million a day. Some campaigners say this in itself is an economic stimulus that could be continued by reducing machine numbers and bet limits once the pandemic passes. Although staff at casinos and clubs are suffering from the loss of work, Alliance for Gambling Reform chief advocate Tim Costello says research shows that $1 million spent on hospitality creates 20 jobs, whereas the same amount going through the pokies creates just three. With those figures in mind, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr has offered community clubs in Canberra $15,000 to hand back poker machine licences instead of re-opening them once the shutdown ends. The cash incentives would go to re-training and supporting staff through the transition from gaming. The Alliance for Gambling Reform is starting a petition to back up the ACT action and calling on state governments to introduce similar measures as part of coronavirus stimulus packages. Reverend Costello says the stimulus package from the GFC resulted in gaming bodies aggressively targeting gamblers who were receiving cash cheques from the government. He believes this time governments should have the courage to stand up to the poker machine lobby and impose new rules on bet limits and machine licences, saying business as usual cannot be justified when money is tight. “We mustn’t [go back]. The truth is that pokies have been our blind spots, like guns have been America’s blind spot,” Reverend Costello said. “We look at them and can’t believe how mad they are. “The rest of the world looks at us and says $13 billion a year lost, 20 per cent of the world’s pokies. How could they? Australian casinos and poker machine hubs were among the last hospitality venues to be closed down because of social distancing laws. Reverend Costello says politicians are so captured by the gambling dollar that he fully expects them to be the first to re-open despite the harm that will be done in the aftermath of an economic crisis. “Yeah, of course they will … You watch how high the pollies jump on them … The 2007 Productivity Commission report on gambling found that 45 cents in every dollar going through a machine comes from someone addicted. “Which is why gamble responsibly is just nonsense. It’s like saying use heroin responsibly. Really?” Reverend Costello says the lobbying that “bought” the Tasmanian state election and helped defeat the ALP’s plan to ban poker machines means it’s up to the public to demand reform. “The overwhelming majority’s view should prevail. And every survey on pokies … show 70 per cent of the population don’t want them. And so we say, well, how are they still here? “Because they’ve literally captured the political parties … with this much easy money at stake for them.” There’s also concern that the federal government’s changes to superannuation laws could enable people to access up to $20,000, which could be blown on online gambling. There have been signs of an uptick in online gambling, with the racing industry continuing to operate through the shutdown. Public health policy academics say steps must be taken to rein in online wagering as people look to relieve the boredom and stress of lockdowns at home. Writing in The Conversation, Associate Professor Charles Livingstone from Monash University’s School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, and Deakin University’s Professor of Public Health Samantha Thomas argued for new measures to restrict bet limits and the use of credit cards for gambling online. “What we call psycho-social stress is a key driver of high-risk and addictive gambling,” the doctors said. “There will be few situations more stressful – and at the same time boring – than what we can expect to endure over the coming months. “One of the acts of a caring and compassionate society is to help people avoid the potential harm that an uptick in online gambling may induce.” Anti-pokies campaigner Stephen Mayne has also detected a mood for change over poker machines, detailing the move by younger RSL veterans to edge the organisation towards fewer poker machine venues. “There’s a fair prospect RSL Victoria will also be substantially reducing its pokies footprint if a group of younger veterans are successful in sweeping the board elections at the upcoming AGM in July,” Mr Mayne wrote at michaelwest.com.au. Mr Mayne added that Victorians who supported pokies-free RSLs should donate to branches like Hawthorn, which has a progressive outlook and is now proudly pokies free. The other frontline for gambling reformers is sport, with the NRL and AFL still having many clubs who operate poker machine venues. Reverend Costello says it’s up to the members of sporting clubs to take back control and force change. “This is what you’ve been seeing with AFL clubs Geelong, Collingwood and the [Western] Bulldogs,” he said. “They really have said we cannot keep our community licence that we are doing good and [really] be doing damage with pokies. “The dinosaurs on this are Essendon, Hawthorn, Carlton.” The NRL, in particular, is facing a wipeout during the shutdown because clubs are so reliant on poker machine revenue and they have also lost games and broadcast rights. “They are the worst of the worst,” Reverend Costello said. “When you look at some of those NRL clubs, they are not pokies clubs –they are casinos. They have three to 400 machines. “They have blown it [their cash] anyway and ripped off the poor in their area. The New South Wales figures are just appalling.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Donald Trump calls the media 'fake' but he is the one who lies","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/15\/trump-coronavirus-lies\/","transcript":"There is plenty to unpick from US President Donald Trump’s bizarre tantrum on national TV during a White House briefing filled with false information, propaganda, and attacks on the media. Tuesday’s controversial performance has thrown new light on his administration’s pandemic response and raised fresh criticism that he is cracking under pressure. In an escalation of a row with states about lockdown laws, the President has been fact-checked on live morning television as governors joined forces to push back at his claims he “calls the shots” and has the power to reopen the economy. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told CBS “we don’t have a king; we have a president”. “If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn’t do it,” Mr Cuomo said in a separate interview with CNN. Mr Cuomo has teamed up with the leaders of nine other states (all Democrats except in Massachusetts) to coordinate how to open the economy once the COVID-19 outbreak is contained. But Mr Trump has insisted he has ultimate power and on Wednesday (Australian time) he took to Twitter with a message about “mutiny”. He singled out Mr Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the virus with another 3700 deaths announced on Tuesday (local time). “Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators,” Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. “I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!,” Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2020 It comes after an extraordinary media briefing, in which Mr Trump took to the podium to show a propaganda-style video before launching into self-praise and justification. “Everything we did was right,” Mr Trump insisted when responding to questions about his initial response to the pandemic. “I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press … and I don’t mind being criticised, but not when they’re wrong,” Mr Trump said. “Not when people have done such a great job.” So is the media right to question Mr Trump’s claims? The President of the US has ‘total’ authority over the governors of each state. What Mr Trump said:  The facts: There is no legislation that gives the President power to override states’ public health decisions. Without seeking his permission, governors, mayors and school district leaders can impose restrictions. \"You're so disgraceful.\" President Donald Trump called a reporter \"a fake\" and \"disgraceful\" as he was challenged about his reaction to the #coronavirus pandemic. More from the president's news conference here: https:\/\/t.co\/D5vqauyHhn pic.twitter.com\/eF1W3FkBpO — SkyNews (@SkyNews) April 14, 2020 During the briefing, Mr Trump said he banned travel from certain countries, thus acting swiftly against the spread of the coronavirus. What Mr Trump said: The facts: The travel restrictions imposed by the President were not total bans and contained multiple exemptions. Only foreign nationals who had been in China, Europe’s Schengen area (most European Union states), Britain or Ireland in the past 14 days were fully banned from entering. Governors across the US have the medical supplies they need. What Mr Trump said: The facts: One day earlier New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan both said they were struggling with ventilator stocks and hospital bed capacity. During Tuesday’s briefing, Mr Trump played a video that included audio from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman discussing how he was criticised for his early travel restrictions. It was made to look like she praised the President. The quote used: “He halted a number of flights from China into the US,” Ms Haberman said. “The idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. “At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus.” The facts: A key part of the quote was cut off. This is how the full sentence went: “At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus. Haberman also posted on Twitter that she went on to say the President: “treated that travel limitation as a ‘mission accomplished’ moment,” referencing former president George W. Bush’s appearance on a US aircraft carrier in the initial stages of the Iraq war. The US has surpassed Italy as the nation with the highest number of coronavirus deaths, with more than 25,300 recorded by Wednesday morning. The country has had more than 598,000 cases – three times that of any other nation. Only a month ago, Mr Trump claimed COVID-19 would go away on its own. Then, he said it would not be nearly as bad as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, which killed about 12,500 Americans. He followed that up with the now-infamous claim the crisis would be over by Easter. At the end of March, Mr Trump said that if the final US coronavirus death toll was 100,000-200,000, it would indicate that his administration had “done a very good job”. Those comments came after a study from the Imperial College showed in a worst-case scenario, 2.2 million Americans could die. Mr Trump’s positive result of 100,000 American deaths would be the equivalent toll of roughly two Vietnam wars or 38 September 11, 2001, attacks."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Business confidence falls to lowest level in history thanks to coronavirus","date":"04-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/2020\/04\/15\/coronavirus-imf-recession\/","transcript":"The global economy is “very likely” expected to suffer the steepest economic downturn since the 1930s Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Australia is predicted to experience one of the worst economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak, with our economy anticipated to shrink by as much as 6.7 per cent in 2020 alone. That’s according to the IMF’s 2020 World Economic Outlook, which further predicted a partial rebound of 6.1 per cent in 2021. As for the world economy, the IMF anticipates it could see a negative growth of 3 per cent in 2020. “Assuming the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that policy actions taken around the world are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, we project global growth in 2021 to rebound to 5.8 percent,” the IMF wrote. The report said forecasts were marked by “extreme uncertainty” and that outcomes could be far worse, depending on the course of the pandemic. The best-case scenario predicts $US9 trillion in output is wiped out in two years. That’s greater than the combined gross domestic product of Germany and Japan, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said. The predictions follow NAB’s release of its business survey, which showed Australia is headed for a “recession of unprecedented speed” after business confidence plunged to its lowest level in history. It said business confidence recorded its largest monthly decline (66 points) in March after governments introduced strict containment measures. The sharp fall in confidence has been felt across all industries – with recreation and personal industries suffering the most. Big hits to jobs and profitability have driven down business conditions to their lowest level since the global financial crisis. NAB chief economist Alan Oster said governments’ stimulus packages would support the economic recovery but were not enough to “offset the near-term pain”. “We expect a recession of unprecedented speed and magnitude for the Australian economy over the next three quarters. This will see a sharp increase in unemployment,” Mr Oster said.  “For now, more businesses expect it to get worse before it gets better. “It could well be that conditions fall to the lowest level since the 1990s recession in coming months.” Forward orders and capacity utilisation also recorded their largest falls – suggesting the worst is yet to come. Independent economist Stephen Koukoulas said the “shocking” survey results underscored the need for more government support. He told The New Daily the government should provide more rental assistance to people experiencing financial hardship, and expand the eligibility criteria for the JobKeeper payment to include all casual workers and temporary visa workers.  Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday the government had no plans to expand the $130 billion wage subsidy scheme to include all casuals as it would cost the federal budget an additional $18 billion. But Mr Koukoulas said now was not the time to be “quibbling about $10 or $20 billion when you probably have GDP going backwards by 5 or 10 per cent”. “I wouldn’t blame the government for one second about the recession that’s happening – that’s obviously a health crisis – but you can hold them to account for how deep and how protracted this is going to be, how many people are going to be unemployed, and how miserable the business sector is going to be,” Mr Koukoulas said. IFM Investors chief economist Alex Joiner, however, said the government had to “draw the line somewhere” when asked if it should announce more support measures. He told The New Daily the policies announced so far were large and well targeted. “What I think [the government] wants to do is just walk through some of the issues with the policies it’s got in place, and then be in a position, when the restrictions are lifted, to add a little bit more stimulus into the economy as and when we come out of the health crisis – because the economy is not going to snap back naturally,” Dr Joiner told The New Daily. “It will need a little bit of help. “I think that’s really the next point for government to get involved – unless things deteriorate materially from here.”  The massive fall in business confidence comes after Treasury released modelling forecasting Australia’s unemployment rate to jump from 5.1 per cent to 10 per cent in the next three months. It said the nation’s jobless rate would have tripled to 15 per cent had the government not rolled out its $130 billion JobKeeper program. But Mr Koukoulas said Treasury’s figures painted an inaccurate picture of the labour market as they ignored underemployment – when an adult is working less than 35 hours a week but wants to work more. Mr Koukoulas said Australia’s underemployment rate, which last year never dropped below 8.1 per cent, could conceivably rise to 15 per cent during the coronavirus crisis. That would mean a quarter of the workforce – or roughly 3.4 million Australians – would either be jobless or in need of more work. So far, more than 800,000 businesses have registered for the government’s JobKeeper program.

All of them carry a use-by date. And then they go stale. You may remember when Molly Meldrum breathlessly announced on Countdown in 1979 that a new American rock band was about to become bigger than The Beatles. For 15 minutes The Knack became just that. Four decades later their hit single My Sharona is only used for inducing comas and curing constipation. In 1981 the world embraced the Men at Work song Down Under. It was played on rotation every hour for weeks on end. It soon became the most annoying earworm of the decade. But when it comes to setting a record for nauseating repetition, We’re All In This Together must now rank as the undisputed world champion. If you haven’t heard this tedious refrain on television – or seen it pop up in endless postings on social media – then you have clearly not been in isolation and deserve a hefty fine. It reeks of insincerity and is about as genuine as a Gucci handbag at a car boot sale. It’s a facile expression that could only be possibly admired by those sitting smugly at home surrounded by mountains of hoarded toilet paper, bingeing on Netflix and regarding their courageous battle with coronavirus as similar to their grandparents’ struggle during the Great Depression. Sorry. But we’re not all in this together. And it begins at the top. Last week the latest Roy Morgan survey on Australian employment found that more than 27 per cent of Australia’s workforce – 3.92 million people – were either unemployed or under-employed. Hundreds of thousands of others have either taken significant salary cuts, or are about to. If we were all in this together you might think our federal politicians, so sensitive to any change in the public mood and its voting intentions, might have joined as one and declared they were taking a pay cut. But no. When the subject was raised in Canberra last week it was treated with the sort of contempt normally reserved for sweaty backpackers partying at a Bondi Beach hostel. “I think MPs and public servants are working very hard now,” Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said. “I’m not sure how this sort of suggestion would help. In the context of the budget challenge it’s essentially at the margin.” Well, Mr Cormann, why don’t you lean in closely with that tin ear of yours and we can tell you why it matters. A call for a pay cut for politicians during this pandemic has nothing to do with budgetary savings. It has far more to do with that most important and compelling ingredient in politics – perception. A 10 or 20 per cent temporary salary cut for our federal MPs would be a profound acknowledgement of the pain being suffered by so many Australians who have lost their jobs and now face losing their homes and hopes for the future. It would be a repudiation of all the cliched accusations that our representatives love nothing more than having their snouts in the trough. It would be a unique public relations boost for an occupation so often denigrated for its self-interest. And it might – just might – become a critical turning point toward establishing a new relationship between the electorate and those who are elected to serve it. Despite what Senator Cormann thinks, a call for MP salaries to be cut during this critical time is not a simplistic pollie-bashing exercise. Who could begrudge Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s annual salary of about $550,000, particularly at a time like this? There are CEOs paid four or five times that amount who enjoy comfortable lives with far less accountability, scrutiny and expectations. Who could dispute the workload experienced by an average backbencher on a base salary of more than $211,000? But if our federal and state parliaments are willing to enact regulations that, while striving to keep the nation safe from coronavirus, trigger a catastrophe in the workplace, then surely they should feel honour bound to experience some of the resulting pain. Yes, unprecedented and in many cases extremely generous economic stimulus packages have been launched to assist many of those affected. But whenever you next hear that insipid We Are All In This Together, just remember it is the shopkeepers and bartenders and cafe owners and waiters and airline stewards and cinema ushers who are really in it together. Don’t kid yourself that wrestling with another bag of popcorn while lounging in a beanbag is life on the front line. Instead, consider yourself part of the cheer squad for those who are fighting the real battle in our nursing homes and surgical theatres. And as for our politicians who stubbornly cling to their salaries and wage conditions? Sadly for them – and for us – the song remains the same.

Cardinal Pell said he had been “wounded” by his experiences but wasn’t deeply scarred because he knew he was innocent. The cardinal was convicted in December 2018 of five charges of child sexual abuse relating to allegations he raped a 13-year-old choirboy and molested another at St Patrick’s Cathedral in 1996. He was acquitted by the High Court last week and released from jail after 405 days behind bars. EXCLUSIVE: Cardinal George Pell has revealed throughout his sexual abuse trial and time incarcerated the thought of committing suicide \"never entered (his) head\" due to his strong faith and belief in his innocence. https:\/\/t.co\/AEEKcIPxFI — Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) April 14, 2020 The cardinal revealed he contributed savings to his defence, as did a lot of generous people including some wealthy people who “kicked in very solidly”. Cardinal Pell’s defence included two trials, neither of which he gave evidence at, though he considered it at his second trial. But he said he was concerned he would “come across as my nasty aggressive self” and have a go at prosecutor Mark Gibson SC, ultimately deciding it might be counterproductive. Cardinal Pell says there has also been speculation about whether his role uncovering corruption within the Vatican had played a role in his legal troubles. “Most of the senior people in Rome, who are in any way sympathetic to financial reform, believe that they are,” he said. “Going from possibility to probability to fact, I don’t have any evidence of that.” He said he doesn’t know how high up the corruption goes. EXCLUSIVE: Cardinal George Pell said he was taken aback by how prisoners in Barwon Prison were damaged by ice, telling Sky News many of them “were roaring in anger and anguish.”https:\/\/t.co\/bTz9Bgs8by — Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) April 14, 2020 The cardinal also spoke of ongoing support from Pope Francis who, despite their differing theological views, he believes values and respects him for his honesty. “He has been very supportive right through. Even my theological opponents in Rome didn’t believe the story,” he said. Cardinal Pell said the suggestion that he’s anti-victim or not sufficiently sympathetic toward abuse survivors grieves him, and that he worked hard “when it wasn’t easy or fashionable”. But he admitted he is ashamed of the church’s response and “occasionally” wished he had done things differently. He said priests were trained to think well of people and he didn’t regret that, but instinct in the past was to disbelieve allegations as gossip unless substantiated. But he said “it wasn’t as though we were alone in this” when asked about police working with bishops to move pedophiles. He said he didn’t know about that at the time. As for the future, Cardinal Pell said he would spend some time in Rome but plans to stay in Sydney, writing and growing cabbages. His time in prison gave him an interest in people who are “wrongly condemned”, including a friend he met in Barwon Prison who was convicted of murder. Cardinal Pell says he doesn’t believe that man, unnamed, is guilty. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Consumers warned not to fall for fake coronavirus ‘cures’","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/14\/coronavirus-fake-cures-warning\/","transcript":"Australian consumers are being warned not to fall for sham coronavirus products sold by unscrupulous retailers trying to cash in on people’s fears. From unproven complementary medicines, to $15,000 ‘subtle energy’ machines flogged by celebrity chefs, Australians don’t have to look far to find so-called cures for the deadly virus. But the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is warning worried consumers these seemingly miraculous products are no good – leaving customers out of pocket and sometimes worse. “The TGA is aware that the current pandemic has seen some people take advantage of the heightened vulnerability of consumers,” a spokesperson told The New Daily. “[We have] warned consumers to be cautious about products claiming to prevent or cure COVID-19 [coronavirus].” The fake cures identified by the TGA so far include air purifiers claiming to fight the disease, “unregistered products” claiming to kill coronavirus, and “a medical device that treats a number of serious diseases”. The agency is even investigating celebrity chef Pete Evans after he spruiked a device called the BioCharger NG that he said improves health and includes recipes for “Wuhan coronavirus”. Evans has no formally recognised medical qualifications or experience. Choice campaign and communications director Erin Turner said reports of unproven cures are flooding in. She told The New Daily Choice has also seen an “explosion in online advice from sources with little public health expertise”, including bad recipes for home-made hand sanitiser. “Remember: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is,” Ms Turner said. “Double-check claims made about products that say they’ll help prevent or cure any health issues with trusted sources.” Any company or retailer selling ‘medical’ products with “unclear or dodgy claims” should be reported to the TGA, Ms Turner added, or to Choice. Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive Gerard Brody also encouraged consumers to report unscrupulous businesses, and welcomed the steps the TGA has already taken to stop the spread of “snake oil” miracle cures. “It’s really important regulators get on the front foot,” he said. “It’s a difficult process for an individual to take on a case against a business. They have to take on a court or a tribunal. “You have to pay fees, you have to go to a hearing, so it can be quite a cumbersome process if you’re trying to get your money back.” Dr Chris Moy, a South Australian GP and chair of the Australian Medical Association ethics and medico-legal committee, told The New Daily the surge in fake products is disappointing but unsurprising. “The bottom line is that there’s currently no scientifically proven treatment – zero, none, forget it,” he said. “But given the anxiety-provoking nature of this condition it’s normal at this point for people to be grasping for straws. “And unfortunately it’s quite often in these circumstances people come out of the woodwork like cockroaches, frankly, to take advantage.” The financial toll of buying a dodgy product is only one of the reasons Dr Moy said Australians should be concerned. In some cases, people who require genuine medical assistance might use these products instead of seeing a qualified doctor. Or they could mistakenly feel invulnerable to the effects of the disease because of the confidence these cures instil. In either case, the risk of serious illness (or even worse) becomes heightened. “If a doctor was caught doing this kind of thing, it would clearly be unethical, but because there are no restraints on Facebook and the like people can get away with it,” Dr Moy said, while noting doctors who speak out against sham products are often accused of acting in their own self-interest. “I would ask the community to look past their anxiety and apply the same principles and ethical standards that a doctor would work by when assessing this kind of thing.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Nick Xenophon: New coronavirus powers threaten corporate accountability","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/14\/coronavirus-corporations-act\/","transcript":"As lawyers, we will always tell you to watch out for the small print. So, last week as the nation was transfixed with federal Parliament passing its record-breaking, ideology-defying $130 billion jobs rescue package, something else snuck through. That something is a piece of ’small print’ giving the Treasurer, at the stroke of his pen, extraordinary new powers to change the Corporations Act. Ostensibly, these powers are to help businesses deal with regulatory requirements during the unprecedented crisis caused by COVID-19 (coronavirus) – for instance, allowing public company AGMs to be conducted online, rather than in person, in this new world of social distancing. Fair enough. Yet barely 24 hours after the measures were passed, the Australian Financial Review reported that big business lobby groups were already pushing for these emergency powers to be used to amend the Corporations Act to “freeze class actions and provide protections for companies and directors on disclosure”. According to the AFR, Business Council of Australia CEO Jennifer Westacott wrote to her members just before 5pm on April 9 warning that: “The threat of shareholder class actions over disclosure obligations would place at risk the ability of companies to trade through this uncertain period and come through the other side in good shape to drive the economy”. Really? I don’t remember hearing that one during the GFC. Disclosure obligations under corporations law are all about companies being upfront and transparent. Or, as a Treasury publication way back in 2002 put it (arguably more valid now than then), continuous disclosure “is fundamental to market integrity and investor protection”. What’s more, Treasury highlights the types of abuses that are prevented by continuous disclosure: “An effective continuous disclosure regime should also minimise the potential for insider trading and other forms of market abuses that may arise as a result of entities withholding or selectively disclosing materially price sensitive information.” Class actions are still the last best hope for ‘mum and dad’ investors to seek redress against company directors and companies behaving badly. Despite the alarm from super funds and investor groups calling this a “legal land grab”, expect the lobbying efforts to continue unabated to exempt directors from their fundamental responsibilities to shareholders and to the market. And given that Parliament isn’t due to sit for the next four months, the ability to scrutinise any such changes is thwarted. Similar concerns have been raised at a state level, as the NSW government uses its COVID-19 emergency powers to fast-track a spate of controversial development applications. So, you may ask, what on earth does all this have to do with slowing and defeating the spread of the coronavirus? Your guess is as good as mine. Unless, of course, social distancing is morphing into ‘accountability distancing’ for the big end of town. And that could well leave millions of mum and dad investors not just isolated but stranded financially.

Kevin and Adele Hockey were the only residents in a group of holiday homes on the island’s eastern side at Poyungan Rocks and have found themselves living a kind of Robinson Crusoe existence as they navigate the normally packed beaches on their own. The couple have been travelling Australia for the past four years after they packed up their Brisbane home, bought a motorhome and created a travel blog, Indefinite Leave, sharing their journey and advising others on how to do the trip. Mr Hockey had already visited Fraser Island twice on fishing trips and when he and Adele were offered the chance to be caretakers of a group of holiday homes, they didn’t hesitate. They travelled to the island on March 4, expecting to be looking after tourists during one of the busiest holiday periods. At that time, coronavirus was only just starting to impact Australia. This changed quickly as the number of cases in the country started to increase. On March 25, the Queensland government closed all camping areas and campsites. The couple were visited by police on March 29 to explain the new conditions and social distancing rules. They would only be allowed to go for walks on the beach and fishing for food, and could not travel to other parts of the island except to get essential supplies. The resorts on the island quickly closed, with Kingfisher and Eurong resorts advising they would take no more guests until June. All visitors to the island have been banned until May 31, and travel to the island has been restricted to island community residents, resort caretakers, island businesses and essential services. The tour buses, four-wheel drive companies and adventure tours have stopped and the tourists who used to drive up and down the beach in front of the holiday homes have disappeared. The island’s townships of Orchid Beach, the Cathedrals, Happy Valley, Eurong and Kingfisher Resort have became ghost towns with only skeleton staff. “Eli Creek, Lake McKenzie, the Maheno Wreck and Champagne Pools are all normally bursting with people enjoying the island hotspots. Now there is no one,” Mr Hockey said. As the only residents in the Fraser Beachfront Holidays accommodation houses at Poyungan Rocks, located halfway between Eurong and Happy Valley, seeing a car travelling down the beach is cause for excitement. “It is so freaky, you are used to seeing all the backpacker tourist buses going up and down the island and if you would walk down on the beach, you would look up and down to make sure you don’t get run over. “Now you get excited if you see a car and wave to them. It’s usually police.” Even the island’s dingoes have disappeared. Fraser Island has become a hotspot for dingo activity and it was only during the last Easter holidays a toddler had his skull fractured by two dingoes at a campsite on the island. But Mr Hockey said they were seeing fewer dingoes than they normally would. “I saw one yesterday for the first time in a week. Normally I’d see them all the time,” he said. “They’ve gone into the centre of the island looking for food. “Normally they’d be nearer here looking for scraps left behind [by humans].” The lack of tourists on the island has been welcomed by Save Fraser Island Dingoes Association. Spokeswoman Cheryl Bryant said Easter was traditionally the “busiest time on the island”. A Department of Environment and Science [DES] spokesperson advised between 10,000 and 14,000 people normally visited the island over the Easter break. “This will be a reprieve for all of the wildlife and for the environment,” Ms Bryant said. “I know it will be difficult for the economy, but for the wildlife it is a win-win.” As for the Hockeys, they were expected to be on the island until the end of July. But the caretakers who were supposed to take over from them were in South Africa and may not get back in time. The Hockeys were prepared in advance for long stretches of time alone, with limited access to shops and resources. “We brought a lot of food over. We have a couple of months of supplies,” Mr Hockey said. “And we’ve been catching our own fish to stretch it out a bit. “There are shops here which had begun stocking up for Easter – they’ve been hit really hard so we are able to stock up there if we have to. “But we had worked out a meal planner for six weeks [before arriving there] and we shopped off that.” Even though the island is deserted, there is still work to be done. “There is a lot of maintenance,” Mr Hockey said. “We operate off generators and solar and we have to maintain the lawns and the yard. “We are having a big problem with lawn grubs and we are dealing with that.” Even though there were not many people on the island, they still were not allowed to travel around or gather in groups, and police and rangers were on the island ensuring everyone followed the rules. “It’s a little bit Robinson Crusoe,” Mr Hockey said. “We’ve also been asked where Wilson is a few times [from the Tom Hanks film Castaway].” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Victoria Police admits 'mistakes' on social distancing infringements","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/14\/victoria-police-social-distancing-fines\/","transcript":"Victoria Police is promising a common sense approach to fines for flouting social distancing rules after a string of reports of people being slugged for driving lessons, social media posts and even paddle-boarding. Deputy commissioner Shane Patton said he would also personally review every fine issued for failing to comply with coronavirus restrictions. “If some of those aren’t properly issued or don’t pass the common sense test they will be withdrawn,” Mr Patton said on Tuesday. Victoria Police issued 99 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions in the 24 hours to Tuesday afternoon, and conducted 507 spot checks. Among those fined were four people having a barbecue at a bathing box on Melbourne’s Brighton Beach, and 10 people partying in a backyard in Strathdale, in central Victoria. A further 10 people gathered at suburban Montrose were fined by police on Sunday. However, police have also fined a teenage L-plater $1652 for having a driving lesson with her mother – although the penalty was later withdrawn. A couple from Victoria’s east were fined $1652 each after one of them shared images of a previous holiday on Facebook. Elsewhere, a doctor was reportedly fined for going paddle-boarding off a Melbourne beach during the Easter weekend. “We’re human, we’re not going to get everything right all the time and we’ll make mistakes,” Mr Patton said. “We made a mistake to issue to a person an infringement from a social media posting and that was withdrawn. “We’re happy to admit when we get it wrong.” Almost 21,000 spot checks have been carried out since March 21, and police have issued 1249 infringement notices. “It is not us who are choosing to make up what we’re doing and say ‘let’s issue a tonne of infringements just for the fun of it’. We don’t want to issue one infringement at all,” he said. “The preference for us is to issue warnings, for the public to be compliant and the public to adhere to the chief health officer’s guidelines.” Under Victoria’s stage three restrictions, residents can leave their homes only to shop for food and essential supplies, medical care or caregiving, work or education, if necessary, and exercise. People can be fined $1652 if they leave home for non-essential reasons and businesses face a $9913 fine if caught doing the wrong thing. Health Minister Jenny Mikakos confirmed on Tuesday 10 people had tested positive for COVID-19 overnight, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1291. It follows just 13 new cases of the virus on Sunday and three on Saturday. Victorian authorities will make a concerted effort to tackle transmission in the community by significantly increasing coronavirus testing from Tuesday. Anyone who has had a fever or breathing symptoms will be able to get tested for the virus at 40 clinics across the state or by their GP. Previously, testing had been available only for those who had recently returned from travel or who had come into contact with a confirmed case. “We need to focus now on community transmission and by opening up the testing criteria, we think we’ll be able to gauge the level of infection,” Ms Mikakos said. “This will also help us to determine how we respond in terms of the restrictions going forward.” Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton said he hoped the broader testing criteria would capture any undetected cases in the community and “drive cases down to zero”. “There is the potential to walk back the most significant restrictions if we can drive numbers right down,” he said. Victoria’s state of emergency was extended at the weekend to May 11, which allows the government to keep up social distancing measures. Fourteen people with coronavirus have died in Victoria, while more than 1100 have recovered. About 40 people with the virus are in hospital, with 15 in intensive care. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Tasmania police will investigate dinner party rumour as CMO backtracks | The New Daily","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/14\/brendan-murphy-tasmania-dinner-party-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Australia’s chief medical officer has backtracked on an allegation a group of medical staff held an “illegal dinner party” prior to a coronavirus outbreak in north-west Tasmania. However, Tasmania Police will investigate the rumour, which began circulating on social media at Easter, that medical professionals in the state’s north-west attended a dinner party given the large number of COVID-19 cases in the region. Professor Brendan Murphy was part of a group of health experts addressing New Zealand’s newly formed Epidemic Response Committee on Tuesday when he mentioned the dinner party anecdote, discussed in the context of flattening the infection curve. “We thought we were doing really well in the last week then we had a cluster of 49 cases in a hospital in Tasmania just over the weekend, most of them went to an illegal dinner party of medical workers,” Dr Murphy told the committee via video link. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein immediately responded by saying the CMO was “commenting on a rumour”. And within a few hours Professor Murphy released a statement saying that contact tracing had not confirmed such a dinner party took place. “This morning in discussions with a New Zealand parliamentary committee, I referred to suggestion that a dinner party may have been the source of some of the transmission in the north-west Tasmania cluster of cases. “Whilst this possibility had previously been mentioned to me following initial investigations, I am now informed that the contact tracing has not confirmed that such a dinner party occurred.” On Tuesday afternoon, the nation’s deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly was asked about the alleged dinner party, saying his CMO had “clarified” the situation. “It was something that was mentioned to him at some point. But that is an ongoing investigation. I understand the police are involved. “The most important element of this really has been that there has been a disruption in healthcare services in relation to the north-west of Tasmania. Mr Gutwein said police would investigate the rumours but the state’s contact tracing had not identified a dinner party of health workers. “To be frank, Brendan was commenting on a rumour,” he said. “However, I accept that this is a serious allegation and it’s something that needs to be followed up. So we will retrace our steps.” “Importantly I have asked that Tasmania Police investigate this matter and that will be started today.” “We need to understand whether or not there is any strength to the rumour. At the end of the day, I’m certain that there are many hardworking health professionals on the north-west coast that feel that their reputations are being maligned,” he said. “Regardless of whether or not that party took place, it does not change the fact that we need to get on top of this outbreak.” Tasmania’s director of public health, Mark Veitch, said he “heard of some Facebook chatter” but “our contact traces have not identified a medical meeting or a medical dinner party as one of the sources”. The outbreak of the coronavirus in two hospitals in Burnie in north-west Tasmania led to the immediate quarantine of 1200 hospital staff and up to 4000 household members on Monday. Out of Tasmania’s 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 78 are linked to the outbreak in the state’s north-west. In-patients were moved to another hospital and Australian Defence Force personnel and Australian medical assistance teams were brought in to manage hospital admissions as the North West Regional Hospital and North West Private Hospital undergo a deep clean by specialist teams after shutting their doors. Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie told Melbourne radio station 3AW there could be dire consequences if the north-western part of the state wasn’t given enough resources. “If it turns really bad down here we’re going to need ventilators and a hell of a lot more equipment really, really quickly, otherwise we’re going to have a hell of a lot of deaths on our doorstep.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Regional media company halts publishing, stands down workers","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/14\/australian-community-media-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The country’s largest regional media company will stop publishing some of its newspapers and stand down workers as it grapples with coronavirus. Australian Community Media, which owns titles including The Canberra Times and the Newcastle Herald, will also shut printing sites in four states and territories. “We cannot sustain the same level of useful work or costs moving forward,” ACM boss Antony Catalano told staff on Tuesday. “At this stage it is not possible to say when we will be able to resume normal operations.” It is the latest in a string of cutbacks announced by media companies as the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak spreads. On April 1, News Corp said it would suspend printing of 60 community newspapers in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. It blamed the move on a rapid decline in advertising after restrictions were placed on real estate auctions and home inspections, and the forced closure of event venues and dine-in restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic. The papers will still be published online. In March, the Sunraysia Daily – the only daily paper in Mildura, in Victoria’s north-west – said it would also close. It was in its centenary year. Staff were also stood down at other papers owned by the same company. ACM said it would stand down some employees and reduce the hours of others. The shutdown is expected to last until at least the end of June. Non-daily newspapers will no longer be printed and instead run reduced coverage online. Daily publications such as The Canberra Times, Newcastle Herald and Ballarat Courier will still be printed. Weekly agriculture papers such as The Land and Queensland Country Life will also continue printing. The company has given notice to more than 30 landlords of offices across the country that it intends to exit leases to reduce rental costs. Printing sites in the ACT, South Australia, Victoria and NSW will be shut. Mr Catalano said the company intended to register for the JobKeeper payment as soon as it could.

Two new books, and one in a smaller paperback format, will tick the box for readers keen to learn more about this extraordinary moment in 20th Century history. Lots to learn while in isolation… The Gravediggers: The Last Winter of the Weimar Republic Rudiger Barth and Hauke Friederichs What were the political and economic circumstances in Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s which led to the rise of Adolf Hitler as a dominant political force? This compelling new book examines the harshness of post-WW1 Germany which, despite bursts of cultural creativity, was a time of political unrest and social anxiety, compounded by a crushed post-WW1 German economy and a weakening Weimar Republic led by its elderly president Paul von Hindenberg. The authors reveal a cast of wannabes and potential political rivals who saw themselves as Hindenberg’s successors. Unfortunately for them, so did a disaffected former art student and member of the German Workers’ Party whose charisma, rhetoric and gang of thugs powered through the legal obstacles in their way and captured an angry nation’s soul. Appeasing Hitler: Chamberlain, Churchill and the Road to War Tim Bouverie This Sunday Times  bestseller by history writer and former political journalist Tim Bouverie draws on previous unseen documents to track the rise of Hitler in 1933 Berlin, to Neville Chamberlain’s failed Munich peace mission in 1938, and on to the start of World War Two. “The desire to avoid war by reaching a modus vivendi with the dictator states extended well beyond the confines of government,” writes the author in his introduction. “Therefore, while the characters of Chamberlain. Edward Wood, Winston Churchill, Édouard Daladier and Franklin D Roosevelt are central to this story, I have also examined the actions of lesser-known figures, in particular the amateur diplomats.” A thorough and fascinating study. The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family and Defiance During the Blitz Erik Larson This new tome by one of our favourite non-fiction writers presents an alluring behind-the-scenes picture of life in London during the Blitz, and the intense daily challenges which faced the newly-elected Winston Churchill, his government, his close associates and his family. Larson tells history with a fiction writer’s narrative touch; his research, and his attention to the facts, however, ensure his stories have their own “document of record” significance.

Before you lower your standards and rewatch all of How I Met Your Mother (for the third time), consider holding out for these upcoming April releases. Ricky Gervais returns with his uncomfortable ‘tragicomedy’ later this month. This dark comedy follows Tony (Gervais) as he decides to give up on the world and punish everyone around him after the death of his wife. Witty and offbeat, this show will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions in each 20 minute episode. Where to watch: Netflix Release date: 24 April  Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s cat and mouse spy series is back for a third season. The series follows two women and their obsession with one another – Villanelle, a psychopathic trained assassin, and Eve, the MI5 agent tasked with tracking her down. If the stunning cinematography (and wardrobe) hasn’t already convinced you to binge-watch, the fact that Killing Eve has already scooped up just about every award under the sun should do the trick. Where to watch: ABC iView (but you can catch seasons one and two on Stan) Release date: 13 April  Fans of the occult, rejoice as Natalie Dormer stars in the spooky spin-off series to Penny Dreadful. Viewers will take a dip across the pond from Victorian-era London where the original series was set, all the way to Los Angeles in the late 1930s. The historical horror series begins with a grisly murder investigation, and basically all hell breaks loose from there.

The New Abnormal The Strokes  The opening notes of The Adults Are Talking are like fairy dust, transporting us back to the glory days of 2001 when The Strokes debut Is This It? took us back to the glory days of 1979 where we shared a back table at Max’s Kansas City with Lou Reed and Richard Hell and Terry Southern. Is This remains a classic for the ages, but the next six albums were varying stages of heart break as the five Strokes pursued different styles and fought each other. Finally we have the follow-up to the debut. Julian Casablanca’s weary vocals are still fatigued in contrast to the energy of the band on tracks like Brooklyn Bridge. Conversely, he sounds positively emotions on Ode to the Mets.  The Loves of Your Life Hamilton Leithauser When the singer’s kid’s preschool teacher is doing back-up vocals, this tells you everything you need to know about the vibe of this album – it’s comfy. Leithauser fronted alt-rock group The Walkmen and this is his second solo effort. Leithauser tasked himself with telling a bunch of stories about New Yorkers and his friends. No lawsuits or blood feuds have come forth; these are not edgy songs but well-observed, often witty and always generous stories, even when in the case of Isabella the subject is somewhat damaged and dangerous. Could Leithauser be to New York middle class apartment living what Bruce was to the haunted New Jersey turnpike? Maybe.  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v12951Kclw0 Calm 5 Seconds of Summer  Few people who saw 5SOS emerge from Sydney’s West, bright eyed and bushy tailed, pumping out pop punk like a boy band in 2012 expected they would last beyond two albums or the 1D teen pop enthusiasm. Yet here they are at LP 4 and outgrown their gangly adolescence. Youngblood from their last LP suggested a harder edge to come and Calm, isn’t quite it. They have taken a rockier road and there are touches of alt rock electronica, Latin flavours and retro dance music. It’s all solid pop music though with more hooks than a bait shop. B  Far Enough Cable Ties  Another Melbourne punk trio fronted by an outspoken woman. Jenny McKenchie is possibly more direct and politically sophisticated than most of her contemporaries. Although Cable Ties fit into the rubric of punk there is a strong Germanic flavour and a post-punk sensitivity. McKenchie is certainly angry but it’s not, like so many punk trios, one dimensional. Nick Brown’s thundering bass powers so many of the songs but then they’re not afraid of the piano or an acoustic guitar. There’s a retro punk sound that invites retro feminist slogans – the personal is political. These are songs about gender and feminism and capitalism and the whole ball of wax.

However, Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein was quick to respond, telling reporters on Tuesday morning he had spoken to Dr Brendan Murphy, who was “commenting on a rumour”. “To be frank, Brendan was commenting on a rumour. Our contact tracing has not identified a dinner party of health workers. “However, I accept that this is a serious allegation, and it’s something that needs to be followed up, and so we will retrace our steps, but, importantly, I’ve asked the Tasmania Police to investigate this matter. The COVID-19 outbreak forced the closure of two hospitals in Burnie on Monday morning and the immediate quarantining of 1200 staff and 4000 household members. The cluster involved than 60 COVID-19 cases, including 47 staff associated with the facilities. Dr Brendan Murphy was appearing on Tuesday before the Epidemic Response Committee, a select committee set up to run in the place of parliament, which has been suspended under New Zealand’s lockdown. “We thought we were doing really well in the last week then we had a cluster of 49 cases in a hospital in Tasmania just over the weekend, most of them went to an illegal dinner party of medical workers,” Dr Murphy told the committee via video link. Mr Gutwein said the allegations would be investigated. “We need to get on top of this. We need to understand whether or not there is any strength to the rumour because, at the end of the day, I am certain that there are many hard-working health professionals on the north-west coach who feel that their reputations are being maligned, people that have done the right thing, and we need to understand exactly what’s occurred here. “But I do want to make this point, regardless of whether or not that party took place, it does not change the fact that we need to get on top of this outbreak,” he told reporters. Meanwhile, the two hospitals closed, the North West Regional Hospital and North West Private Hospital, are undergoing a deep clean by specialist teams after shutting their doors. Tasmania has also called in members of the Australian Defence Force to help progressively get services back online, as well as Australian Medical Assistance Teams. Patients from the two hospitals have been moved to Mersey Community Hospital at Latrobe. There were six cases statewide on Monday, all in the northwest, bringing the island’s total to 150. Virus testing is also being increased in the outbreak region. Five elderly people have died from the virus in Tasmania, four of them at the North West Regional Hospital. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Ruby Princess coronavirus probe will take months: NSW Premier","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/14\/ruby-princess-coronavirus-probe\/","transcript":"The criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle is expected to take another five months as authorities probe Australia’s number one COVID-19 killer. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Tuesday the police investigation would take at least six months, with a month already passed. Police are working with federal authorities to collect evidence from the ship and are looking into hundreds of calls made to CrimeStoppers. NSW Health said 128 crew members on board the docked vessel had tested positive to the coronavirus with 69 of them symptomatic while 59 were no longer showing symptoms. The Ruby Princess, which departed Sydney on March 8 for New Zealand and returned on March 19, is responsible for hundreds of COVID-19 cases nationwide including 369 in NSW and at least 18 deaths across the country. Some 2700 passengers were permitted to disembark in Sydney without adequate health checks, an action blamed by the Australian Border Force on NSW health authorities. When asked about a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the Ruby Princess, Ms Berejiklian said it was important not to compromise the criminal and coronial inquiries already underway. “Whilst the police investigation is focusing on potential criminal activity, it will be reporting on a whole range of issues so everything from go to whoa is included,” she said. “I don’t want anyone to feel the criminal investigation the police are conducting isn’t robust.” She said her government would seek legal advice this week before considering the establishment of a commission of inquiry. “If the police are able to publicly provide to the community in five months’ time about everything they’ve uncovered … that is a positive for the community because any commission of inquiry would take at least six to 12 months,” Ms Berejiklian said. “We will not be leaving a single stone unturned.” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he was willing to release all findings to the public if permitted, and that authorities had interviewed 200 witnesses over the weekend. He said COVID-19 testing was still underway for crew members on the ship – which is docked at Port Kembla – and daily conversations were taking place with NSW Health on moving the ship. Once NSW Health gives the all-clear on the health of crew members, Mr Fuller will ask the ABF to instruct the ship to return to its port of residence. Authorities have evacuated an additional 11 infected crew members from the ship to Sydney health facilities. The commissioner on Monday said the disease was most likely spread on board by an ill food handler. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard, meanwhile, on Monday said it was “unfortunate” 2700 passengers boarded the ship at a time when the coronavirus pandemic was already front and centre in the community’s consciousness. “It is a very unfortunate outcome but at the time that that ship sailed, which was March 8 from memory, there was COVID-19 well and truly,” Mr Hazzard told reporters. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Relaxation of restrictions ‘many weeks away’: PM | The New Daily","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/14\/coronavirus-restrictions-scott-morrison-states-numbers\/","transcript":"Australians are being warned the restrictions put in place to contain the coronavirus will remain for many more weeks, despite the nation’s infection curve improving. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Seven’s Sunrise program on Tuesday that state and federal leaders would meet again this week to discuss when restrictions could be relaxed. “I do want to caution Australians that we’re not in that phase yet … we’re many weeks away from being in a place like that,” he said. “You’ve seen in places like Singapore and Sweden and other parts of the world where the virus has just taken off again.” Mr Morrison said any relaxation of restrictions would need to be backed up by a strong health system and even stronger testing regime. “If you take your eyes off this thing, [it] gets away from you. So we do need to understand what the prerequisites are and the things we need to achieve before we can start to ease some of those restrictions,” he said. On Tuesday afternoon, the nation’s deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly said it was important to “look at where we are in terms of the epidemic”. “We have flattened that curve and decreased to a very large extent the new cases each day. “The question is what do we do next? We definitely don’t want to just open up everything that we’ve dampened down on so far because we’ve seen in other countries what has happened with an uncontrolled epidemic and we cannot afford to do that in Australia. “And so there will be a range of matters that we will put to national cabinet to consider, but particularly the strategies moving forward and then within that would be what to look at in terms of the restrictions which may be least risky in relation to increasing the number of cases and on the other hand having the most benefit for the wider society. On Tuesday, the number of Australians infected with COVID-19 had risen to 6366. The death toll was 61. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said it was important Australians kept up social distancing measures for the time being, as every single undetected community transmission could further infect a lot of people. “The scale of measures at the moment is something that we clearly do have to review … but it’s not now, it’s within the next few weeks,” he told ABC radio on Monday. “I think we need to look at all of the data, look at our preparedness, and the national cabinet will be making a lot of decisions about what, if anything, can be relaxed in the coming weeks.” Professor Murphy said he would be concerned if social restrictions were relaxed before public hospitals were fully prepared and the country had enough personal protective equipment. Despite the official caution, WA Premier Mark McGowan has said the state could consider relaxing coronavirus restrictions as early as May 1. “We’ll review it monthly. The first major review will be coming up in a couple of weeks.” WA, which has closed its borders to even returning residents, has been reporting lower infection rates for some time. It has 527 confirmed cases. Of those, there are 32 people with COVID-19 in Perth hospitals, 12 of those in intensive care. In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said there had been a major drop in new infections at the Easter long weekend. In the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday, there were seven new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number since Saturday to just 23. The total number of people infected is 2870. About 150,000 people across NSW have been tested. “If you look at other countries in the world … and you look at where they have gone compared to where we have gone, I think we should feel satisfied that we have contained the spread to the extent that we have,” Ms Berejiklian said on Tuesday. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said testing for the remainder of this week would focus on Penrith, Sydney’s inner-west, Liverpool, Randwick, Waverley, Woollahra, Blacktown, Cumberland, Westmead, Ryde, Manning and Lake Macquarie. “In those areas we have diagnosed identified cases of COVID-19 where there aren’t clear links to clusters and so we want to assure ourselves that there is not broader community transmission occurring in those areas,” she said. State Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said 40 patients with COVID-19  were in Victorian hospitals, with 15 in intensive care. A further 1118 had recovered and about 71,000 had been tested. “We are announcing that from today, Victoria will have the widest testing criteria in the nation,” she said on Tuesday. “Anybody who has relevant symptoms, a fever, or acute respiratory symptoms will be able to be tested for COVID-19.” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk confirmed an additional 11 COVID-19 cases had been recorded across the state overnight, bringing its total to 998. Ms Palaszczuk said 74,013 tests had been conducted, five Queenslanders had died from the coronavirus and 442 patients had recovered. Although the daily rate of positive tests has fallen to single figures, public gathering restrictions will remain. Meanwhile, Treasury modelling released on Tuesday shows Australia’s unemployment rate is expected to nearly double to 10 per cent because of the pandemic. Mr Morrison said the jobless rate could have been much higher without government support, but acknowledged mass job losses were taking a “heartbreaking” toll. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Noice, courageous': Magda Szubanski's hilarious tribute to health workers","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/04\/14\/magda-szubanski-covid-tribute\/","transcript":"Kath and Kim comedy favourite Sharon Strzelecki has returned to the airwaves with a special shout-out to Australia’s health workers battling the coronavirus outbreak.

During his daily press briefing on Tuesday (AEST), Mr Trump presented a timeline touting his response to the pandemic, which included cable news clippings. CNN reported the president had a “meltdown”, calling The New York Times report a “total fake” and set out to present a timeline of his travel restrictions on China and Europe as evidence of a rapid response to contain the virus. The network halted its live coverage of the briefing when Mr Trump began playing a compilation of news clips portraying his handling of the pandemic in a positive light. “To play a propaganda video at taxpayer expense in the White House briefing room is a new – you can insert your favourite word here in this administration,” CNN anchor John King said. CNN also aired a chyron saying, “Angry Trump turns briefing into propaganda session”. Rival MSNBC also cut its coverage of Mr Trump’s briefing. It reported former NY Times executive editor Howell Raines called the video “one of the most astonishing acts of disinformation from the White House since the Vietnam era”. But Mr Trump was undeterred. “Someday hopefully in five years when I’m not here, those papers are all going out of business because nobody’s gong to want to read them,” he said. Mr Trump’s tirade was sparked by speculation he had medical expert Dr Anthony Fauci in his sights after Dr Fauci said in that earlier mitigation efforts against the coronavirus outbreak could have saved more lives. At the daily briefing – which often last more than 90 minutes – Mr Trump said he and Dr Fauci had been on the same page “from the beginning” about the virus and he did not intend to fire him. Mr Trump, who played down the seriousness of the coronavirus in its initial stages, has been angered by media coverage suggesting he did not do enough to prevent its spread. On Sunday, Mr Trump retweeted a call to fire Dr Fauci after the top US expert on infectious diseases said lives could have been saved if the country had shut down sooner during the novel coronavirus outbreak. At Tuesday’s briefing, Dr Fauci said he was answering a hypothetical question in the interview, and made clear that Mr Trump had listened to him when he recommended mitigation efforts that included strict social distancing measures. “I think he’s a wonderful guy,” Mr Trump said of Dr Fauci, while adding that not everyone was happy with him. The retweet fuelled speculation Mr Trump was running out of patience with the popular scientist and could fire him, prompting a White House denial. Dr Fauci has assumed national prominence as a leader in the fight against the coronavirus. He has contradicted or corrected Mr Trump on scientific matters during the public health crisis, including whether the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is effective against the virus. Last week, at another White House coronavirus briefing, Mr Trump prevented Dr Fauci from answering a question about hydroxychloroquine. Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked on CNN about a New York Times report documenting early warnings issued to the White House about the novel coronavirus. The scientist acknowledged shutting down the country sooner could have saved lives, but cautioned that several factors were involved. “Obviously, it would have been nice if we had a better head start, but I don’t think you could say that we are where we are right now because of one factor,” Dr Fauci said. “It’s very complicated.” Already a target of the far right for his contradictions of Mr Trump, Dr Fauci drew more opprobrium after the interview. Mr Trump also denounced the Times story in tweets on Sunday, calling it “Fake.” Dr Fauci, 79, has led the federal infectious disease agency since 1984 under Republican and Democratic presidents. Republican George W Bush honoured him with the presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008. Some polls during the public health crisis have shown Americans trust him more than Mr Trump. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"French man, 64, accidentally ejects himself from fighter jet in mid-air","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/europe-news\/2020\/04\/14\/french-man-eject-fighter-jet\/","transcript":"A French defence worker’s surprise retirement gift has gone terrifyingly wrong, with the panicked man ejecting himself from a fighter jet more than 2500 feet above the ground. The accident happened after fellow employees at the 64-year-old Frenchman’s company got him a joyride in a Dassault Rafale B jet to mark his retirement. But the surprise gift fell very flat, with the unnamed man being incredibly stressed, rather than delighted, when he arrived at the Saint-Dizier air base in north-eastern France in March 2019 and learned what he was in for. Air safety investigators later said the man had never expressed a desire to fly in a fighter jet and had no previous military aviation experience. Thanks to a watch he was wearing that could measure his heart rate, investigators found the man’s “heart was in full tachycardia” before the flight, with a recorded rate ranging from 136 to 142 beats per minute. Nonetheless, apparently “feeling social pressure”, he went ahead with the ride – joining a three-plane training exercise as a passenger in the Rafale B. The French air force jet has a maximum speed of nearly 1400km\/h. The investigators said the man got into the rear of the plane’s two seats. Safety checks were a bit lacklustre, and he adjusted his own gear – when they took off, his helmet and oxygen mask were not attached, his visor was up, and his seat straps were loose. Panic set in as the plane levelled out at 2500 feet. The “insufficiently strapped and totally surprised passenger” panicked, and reached for something to hold to – unfortunately finding the ejector seat button. The pilot’s canopy shattered and he flew from the plane, losing his mask and helmet in the process. Fortunately, the man’s parachute opened and he managed to land in a field near the German border, avoiding serious injuries. Investigators concluded that the accident was caused by an involuntary reflex, prompted by stress and the jet’s sudden movement. The pilot, who was not ejected, managed to land the plane safely. He suffered some minor facial injuries from the shattered canopy. His stressed passenger, meanwhile, was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and to recover."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Sanders says he endorses Biden's campaign to unseat US President","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/14\/sanders-endorses-biden\/","transcript":"Senator Bernie Sanders has formally endorsed Joe Biden as the US Democratic Party unifies in a bid to take on President Donald Trump in November in the race for the White House.

Now Australian researchers have come come up with an idea to help combat the global shortage. In a study to be released on Tuesday, the research team reveals how ‘splitting’ a ventilator could make it possible for two patients to be hooked up to one machine. The coronavirus has been shown to lead to severe respiratory failure and viral inflammation of lung tissue which can kill. In severe cases, patients need to be hooked up to a ventilator machine in hospital to keep their breathing going while their bodies fight the virus. Using the machines involves sedating a patient and sticking a tube into the throat so that oxygen can be forced into the body. Hospitals across the globe are experiencing ventilator shortages amid COVID-19. In response, Australian government has set up a task force to investigate ways to manufacture the devices. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration have already passed emergency use authorisation for the splitting of ventilators. Ventilator splitting is when two or more patients are connected to one ventilator and both are exposed to the same circuit dynamics. While the researchers from Monash University, The Alfred and The Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne do not condone ventilator splitting, they argue in the new study that it could be done in extreme emergencies such as COVID-19. “Patients with COVID-19 may develop progressive viral pneumonitis leading to severe respiratory failure,” study lead Alexander Clarke writes in the international journal Anaesthesia. “While ventilator splitting has, at face value, validity in addressing ventilator shortages, we agree that on sober reflection, it is a solution that needs to be weighed up carefully as it may cause more harm than good.” The process is challenged as ventilation needs differ between patients and splitting could make it difficult to monitor individual oxygen flow and pressure. There are also concerns the infection could be passed between patients via the equipment. The study researchers warn the findings need to be interpreted and applied with caution. “We are hopeful of one day being able to get great surety with this approach to ventilator splitting so we can help save lives in dire cases of emergency,” Monash University’s Shaun Gregory said. Until there are further trials, researchers warn against wider use. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Donald Trump retweets call to fire top coronavirus expert","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/14\/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-comments\/","transcript":"Donald Trump has retweeted a post calling for the firing of the US’s top infectious diseases expert, who argued lives could have been saved had the country shut down sooner during the coronavirus outbreak. And a top adviser to the US president has publicly declared that some health professionals “appear tone deaf” to the risks lockdowns will have on the health of Americans. The comments give further insight into how the Trump administration is weighing up the American economy and human health as it decides on the future of COVID-19 lockdown measures. The US remains the worst hit place for the virus, recording more than 23,000 deaths by Tuesday morning (Australian time), including the deaths of 671 New Yorkers on Easter Sunday alone. According to Johns Hopkins University, New York has more confirmed coronavirus cases than any other country in the world. Facing criticism for his virus response – including his false comments about vaccines and comparing COVID-19 to the flu – Mr Trump appeared to try to defend himself against White House health adviser Anthony Fauci’s comments on Sunday that he acted too slowly to curb the spread. Mr Trump circulated a tweet by former congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine, which claimed Dr Fauci had contradicted himself by telling the public on February 29 “there was nothing to worry about”. She ended the tweet by saying “Time to #FireFauci …” The White House has since moved to hose down speculation that Mr Trump might be about to fire Dr Fauci. Sorry Fake News, it’s all on tape.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2020 “This media chatter is ridiculous — President Trump is not firing Dr Fauci,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Tuesday morning (Australian time). Mr Gidley said Mr Trump was merely defending himself against what he considered to be unfair attacks on his coronavirus response. “Dr Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser to President Trump,” he said. The controversy arose when Dr Fauci was asked on CNN’s State of the Union about a New York Times report documenting early warnings issued to the White House about the coronavirus outbreak. The scientist acknowledged shutting down the country sooner could have saved lives, but cautioned that several factors were involved. “Obviously, it would have been nice if we had a better head start, but I don’t think you could say that we are where we are right now because of one factor,” Dr Fauci said. “It’s very complicated.” Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has said many medical experts “appear tone deaf” and have failed to account for the health effects of keeping non-essential services shut down. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr Navarro argued an extended economic shutdown could pose far greater health implications than the coronavirus itself and would lead to “very significant losses of life” and “blows to American families”. He said “medical experts and pundits pontificating in the press” were thus “speaking only half of the medical truth without reference or regard for the other half of the equation”. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the coronavirus death toll has topped 10,000. The milestone was reached only about a month after the US state recorded its first fatality. The 671 new deaths on Sunday was the first time in a week the daily toll dipped below 700. Hospitals are still getting 2000 new patients a day and people are still dying at a “horrific level of pain and grief and sorrow”, Mr Cuomo said during a state news briefing. “This virus is very good at what it does. It is a killer,” he said. As a hopeful sign, Mr Cuomo said the number of people hospitalised with the virus had flattened to just under 19,000. “The worst can be over, and it is over unless we do something reckless,” Mr Cuomo said. “You can turn those numbers on two or three days of reckless behaviour.” Across the country, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday reported 554,849 cases of the coronavirus and said the number of deaths had risen to 21,942. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus and pregnancy: Pandemic magnifies concerns of mums","date":"04-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/04\/14\/coronavirus-pregnancy-australia\/","transcript":"As if creating a new life wasn’t daunting enough any day, pregnant women are now preparing to give birth in an uncertain world brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Then there’s the rumours spreading across social media, adding a whole new dimension of fear and worry. Melbourne psychologist Dr Nicole Highet said mental health workers are battling to stop the spread of misinformation as services are inundated with calls from women and families concerned about the virus’s impact on babies. “The most common questions we are getting from women are ‘I’m pregnant, if I get COVID-19 will I miscarry or will my baby be at risk of having a major health problem?’ and ‘What if I have a newborn and I get infected or my baby gets infected?’ [and] ‘Is it still safe to breastfeed if I’m infected?’” Dr Highet said. Recognising the time from conception through to one year after delivery  is when women are most at risk of developing mental health problems, Dr Highet – the former deputy CEO at Beyond Blue – launched the not-for-profit organisation Centre of Perinatal Excellence (COPE). The centre has never been so busy in its seven years than in recent weeks. “Already there is a high level of anxiety for pregnant women and mothers, but this has significantly increased with fears of what COVID-19 means for the woman, her baby, and her family,” Dr Highet said. Melanie Kaye, 30, whose second child is due in June, said she is having trouble sleeping due to her concern that Australia will follow the US’s lead in restricting hospital visitors. “I had PTSD after the birth of my son,” Ms Kaye said. Although it’s wise to read up on the risks and stay abreast of virus research, some news being shared in mothers’ groups has been found to be fake or irrelevant to an Australian context. One of the videos circulating in recent days shows a heavily pregnant woman hospitalised in the UK due to COVID-19. Stories of some hospitals in the US banning visitors from entering delivery wards have spread like wildfire through networks that were established to support new and expectant mums. Bene Joseph, who is due to have her first baby in August, said she was distressed by a barrage of information – some of it false – on social media. “I’ve unfollowed a few Facebook groups set up for women due to have babies this year,” the 26-year-old said. “I would look into a lot of the posts and see it wasn’t even relevant to Australia.” Dr Highet’s centre has responded by gathering and sharing the latest evidence from peak bodies for maternal health in this crisis, together with messages of reassurance and support. Women are also being directed to the RANZCOG website. “We don’t want people trawling through Facebook for information or tuning into sensational media,” Dr Highet said. She said it’s important to share reassuring information from trusted sources and resources that are underpinned by national guidelines. “The good news is that at this time, pregnant women do not appear to fall severely unwell when contracting COVID-19,” Dr Highet said. “They have mild to moderate symptoms, and there is no evidence it negatively impacts unborn babies or that it will cause abnormalities.” But while the virus itself may not be a major risk for otherwise healthy pregnant women, Dr Highet is worried that the fallout of the pandemic will magnify mental health triggers for new and expectant mums. They include not having supportive networks, financial instability, family violence, and the life changes that go hand in hand with having a baby. “Now more than ever, we need to screen new and expecting mothers to make sure they have the mental health support they need,” she said. Her COPE team is busy adapting its digital health screening tool (iCOPE), a psychosocial questionnaire developed to help identify at-risk mothers, to make it fit for purpose in the changing health landscape. Last year, COPE received $16 million from the federal government to roll out the screening tool in every public maternity hospital. For privacy, the questionnaire – available in 12 languages – is completed on a tablet that sends an individual report to the woman and a clinical report to her health professional, identifying her risk factors and providing advice on mental health support. But as hospitals move to shift face-to-face appointments online, the tool is being adapted so that the screening can be undertaken remotely via a secure link. “One of the things we ask women after they have a baby is whether their birth experience was frightening or difficult,” Dr Highet said. “A lot of people are going to be very frightened going into hospital or disappointed that it wasn’t the experience they wanted. “These are all going to be magnified by the pandemic.” The centre is also “starting to look at working with others around using this as a way for women to socially connect, but also have expert advice, and guest speakers on areas people will be worried about”. Intervening in the social media conversation, providing quality information relevant to Australians, is a key priority. “It’s important to focus on our national context,” Dr Highet said. “We have taken a far more early prevention approach than [countries such as the US and UK] and focusing on them is not helpful for anxiety levels.” Dr Highet says that friends and family of expectant and new parents can also play a powerful part in helping reduce stress. “Whilst it is difficult, we need to be thankful that we live in a time where we have social media and can still connect with others” Dr Highet said. “Make it an ‘occasion’ in your day to FaceTime or Skype a friend or family member and share your thoughts and feelings and support for each other. Connection is key.” For more information about coping with COVID-19, visit www.cope.org.au. To speak to a professional, call the PANDA helpline on 1300 726 306.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Treasurer Josh Frydenberg are, as it were, hiding behind the skirts of their conservative idol John Howard to justify plunging the Budget deep into the red to contain the economic ruin wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. At the weekend Mr Frydenberg rightly said “extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures”. And as if this statement was not strong enough to stand up on its own two legs, he hastened to add “and John Howard who has seen everything in politics said to me, and he’s spoken to the Prime Minister and said there are no ideological restraints at times like this.” And the Treasurer said “that is the advice we have taken”. Indeed they have. With a cumulative spending frenzy approaching $300 billion, these self-proclaimed champions of tightening the purse strings have thrown off their Scrooge-like habits. There is a six-month time limit to the programs funded by this spending, with suggestions since modified somewhat that we would then “snap back” to business as usual. Even allowing for the more considered “staggered” return to what used to be considered normal, having ditched the prevailing  system of ideas that have driven Liberal governments from John Howard’s up until today, surely it will dawn on this one that these ideals have been found wanting. The signs are not promising. Ironically it is the government’s refusal to apply the JobKeeper payments to a million casuals and two million foreigners on temporary visas that is evidence of this. Mr Frydenberg’s explanation is that if you add an extra million people to the JobKeeper program that’s an extra $18 billion. So Australian citizens who miss out can apply for JobSeeker payments, foreign workers can go home if their employers don’t keep them. The $18 billion in this context is according to economist Stephen Koukoulas “a piddling amount”. But what it shows is an almost pathological fear of the path they have embarked on. Mr Koukoulas says he’s “surprised the government does not want to make the recession shallower and shorter, with a wider range of stimulatory and rescue packages”. With Trade and Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham warning there is no chance of overseas travel resuming before the end of this year at the earliest, the impact on immigration – the greatest single driver of economic growth in recent years – will be severe. Then there is that other source of huge export income: Foreign students that we are putting in jeopardy by doing little to look after the reduced numbers who are here. It’s in stark contrast to Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a YouTube message said “we are playing close attention to the welfare of foreign workers. They came to Singapore to work hard for their living and provide for their families back home”. That attention goes to assuring their incomes and providing health care. Mr Frydenberg says the government has “to draw the line somewhere”, but Mr Koukoulas isn’t the only economist fearing the line has created a too narrow, self-defeating boundary. Wayne Swan, the treasurer who guided Australia away from recession in the Global Financial Crisis, says the government’s stimulus package will have “to be sustained” and one “that remedies the inequalities” that were weakening the economy before COVID-19 smashed into it. Mr Frydenberg appears to be hearkening after remedies closer to his conservative heart. On the Insiders program on Sunday he pointed to the government’s record of 1.5 million new jobs, though he did not acknowledge the huge role immigration played in that. He boasted “we were able to get welfare dependency to its lowest level in 30 years. We halved the growth in government spending” and he added “we are going to have to climb that mountain again”. The daunting task for for him and the nation is that climb will begin from the bottom of a very deep ravine, deeper than many believe it needs to be.

Readers of The New Daily have shared what their little monsters are getting up to, with their stories revealing it’s not just children getting stuck into hilarious stay-at-home activities. Ryland Mitchell, 10, from Yarraville in Victoria, is a singer in the prestigious Australian Boys Choir. With rehearsals cancelled due to the coronavirus, Ryland has used his extra time at home to keep performing by making video clips. Although the songs might sound familiar, the lyrics have been updated with a twist.  Ryland’s father and co-star Paul told The New Daily the pair had been spending more time together since school holidays started last week. “I wanted to get the little fella busy because he’s in the Australian Boys Choir and he hasn’t been doing much singing because of the coronavirus,” he said. “As a performer, you need to be doing stuff to make people laugh and have fun.”  Mr Mitchell said the extra time in self-isolation meant the pair had more time to “come up with crazy ideas”. “Sometimes it seems like a lot of effort, but part of it is just keeping them entertained and doing something,” he said. “He wrote out a sheet [of lyrics] from the start of the idea to getting it on YouTube. I think that helps with his education, with organising processes and planning.” Another family in Victoria has been hosting home dance parties, which is easier when you have a big merged family. Kelly Bettridge, a part-time teacher and full-time student from Berwick in Melbourne, has eight children living under her roof. “It’s been chaotic, to say the least!” Ms Bettridge told The New Daily. “We’ve kept busy by creating our own weekend social events at home to keep the seven teenagers entertained.” On Saturday night, the family’s social events reached a new level by hosting a dance party\/trivia night at home. “It’s been hard on our older teens and 18-year-olds because they’ve got partners who they can’t see and social lives that have ground to a halt,” Ms Bettridge said. “You just let the kids blow off steam, especially the older ones who are usually out with mates or partners, but you let them do it safely.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Unemployment rate tipped to reach 10 per cent amid coronavirus","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/work\/2020\/04\/13\/unemployment-rate-coronavirus-recession\/","transcript":"Unemployment is set to soar to its highest rate in almost three decades, with 1.4 million Australians expected to be out of work. New Treasury figures forecast the jobless rate will double in the June quarter from 5.1 per cent to 10 per cent, all but confirming Australia will enter a recession as it deals with the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be the first time the unemployment rate has hit double digits since April 1994 and the figure is a fraction below Australia’s peak unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent in 1992. But Treasury’s estimates show the unemployment rate would be much higher, and peak at 15 per cent, had the government not intervened with the $130 billion wage subsidy program known as JobKeeper. “The economic shock facing the global economy from the coronavirus is far more significant than what was seen during the global financial crisis over a decade ago,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement. “Every arm of government and industry is working to keep Australians in jobs and business in business, and to build a bridge to recovery on the other side.” Treasury’s estimate follows a similar prediction by Westpac, which had anticipated the economic impact of coronavirus could see Australia’s unemployment rate rise as high as 17 per cent – a figure it revised down to 9 per cent once JobKeeper was introduced. Economist Chris Richardson, from Deloitte Access Economics, said studies from Australia and overseas had shown if a person did not regain employment within two years of losing a job in a recession, they were unlikely to ever work again. “So you’re not just saving a job today … this is a lifetime of savings,” Mr Richardson said. More than 800,000 businesses have registered for the JobKeeper program, which will provide $1500 per employee per fortnight to eligible businesses. The first payments are expected early next month, backdated to March 30. Up to six million workers, almost half the Australian workforce, are expected to benefit from the six-month wage subsidy. Treasury’s unemployment forecast comes just one week after credit ratings agency Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed Australia’s AAA credit rating but predicted Australia’s economy would plunge into recession for the first time in three decades. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Internet affordability a ‘significant issue’ amid coronavirus crisis","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/2020\/04\/13\/internet-coronavirus-digital-divide\/","transcript":"The internet has become so commonplace that most Australians barely remember life without it, but for many it is an unaffordable luxury. And social isolation measures risk making that worse, especially for families with school-aged children. RMIT media professor Julian Thomas told The New Daily internet affordability is a pervasive problem for the country. And now that students’ lessons are going digital, being unable to access the internet is leaving less well-off families even further behind. “This is a really significant issue,” he said. “Internet and communications costs actually make up a pretty significant proportion of people’s household budgets when they’re on very low incomes.” Professor Thomas noted that unemployed Australians are much more likely not to have an internet connection at home (72.5 per cent) than those with jobs (95.1 per cent). With the coronavirus driving up unemployment, the number of homes without internet access could increase, too. ABS data shows that between 2014 and 2018, the amount of homes without an internet connection hovered at roughly 14 per cent – and Professor Thomas said price played a big part in that. “While we have over 90 per cent of the Australian population connected, there are big gaps and a very significant set of digital inequalities,” he said. “We talk about the digital divide narrowing and deepening at the same time – there’s fewer people who are less connected, but the costs of not being connected are getting higher because people are reliant on the internet.” The monthly cost of a fit-for-purpose broadband connection is around $60 at the moment, Professor Thomas said. That price would need to fall to $40 or even $30 a month before Australia makes real progress on the affordability problem. “We need a more comprehensive digital inclusion strategies,” Professor Thomas said. “We’re making progress, but we’re yet to see the outcome of recent initiatives. I hope we’re making progress, but we haven’t seen the evidence. “The scary thing is that we could be going backwards rather than forwards now because everything has changed.” For school-aged children, the digital divide is particularly worrying according to children’s charity The Smith Family. The charity’s chief executive Dr Lisa O’Brien told The New Daily without adequate support to get them online, disadvantaged children will fall even further behind their peers. “Right now, disadvantaged students around the country need support more than ever,” she said. “Some parents are also unable to help their children with their schoolwork, due to low educational attainment themselves or having English as a second language. “Parents may also not have the confidence or skills to support their children with technology.” Almost one-quarter of the children in The Smith Family’s Learning for Life program alone (roughly 12,000 children) don’t have access to a computer with a reliable internet connection at home. “This means they’re missing out on an essential learning tool during this period of remote learning that most Australians take for granted,” Dr O’Brien said. “Schools are doing their best, but schools in communities experiencing high levels of disadvantage have the least resources to support home learning for the many families who need it.” Dr O’Brien said “governments, businesses and communities all have a role to play” and will need to collaborate to fix the problem. “We will keep an open mind as to what’s needed, but whatever it is, it’s needed fast,” she said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"US weather: Tornadoes kill dozens, flatten homes across southern states","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/13\/13-dead-homes-damaged-tornadoes-southern-us\/","transcript":"Dozens of people are feared dead after severe weather swept America’s southern states.

USA Today reported that 11 people had been killed in Mississippi, nine were found dead in South Carolina, and six more died in northwest Georgia. Others had been killed by falling trees or became trapped inside collapsed buildings, in Arkansas and North Carolina. The Chattanooga, Tennessee area and several counties in northwest Georgia appeared to be particularly hard-hit. Murray County, Georgia, fire chief Dewayne Bain told WAGA-TV that two mobile home parks were severely damaged, with five people killed and five others hospitalised after a narrow line of storms left an eight kilometre-long path of destruction.

At least 14 people were hospitalised in the Chattanooga area, where search-and-rescue teams from at least 10 fire departments were going door to door responding to more than 300 emergency calls for help, the fire department said. The storms blew onward through the night, causing flooding and mudslides in mountainous areas, and knocking out power for about 750,000 people in a 10-state swath ranging from Texas to Georgia up to West Virginia, according to poweroutages.us. The National Weather Service tallied hundreds of reports of trees down across the region, including many that punctured roofs and downed power lines.

Mr Hunt said while Australia’s rate of infection was promising, it was “too soon to make changes” to social distancing and other restrictions. He said the focus was on consolidating the containment phase of the virus and working toward its “effective eradication”. Mr Hunt’s comments came as up to 5000 Tasmanian hospital staff and their households have been ordered to spend the next two weeks in quarantine, and as Australia’s death toll from the coronavirus rises to 61. Speaking to reporters, the Health Minister said Australia was “currently on the road through [the outbreak], but at the same time we’re planning the road out”. Mr Hunt said the way out of self-isolation restrictions would depend on  “three elements”. “One is clear indication that we are suppressing the case numbers in Australia – it could be case numbers, the re-transmission rate, that’s all being developed into an assessment protocol,” he said. “Two is ensuring we have rapid response capability – testing, tracing. Thirdly, once those things are achieved, is planning the steps out, which will always be gradual.” Mr Hunt warned that countries who have been successful in dealing with coronavirus, including South Korea, Singapore and Japan, had eased restrictions only to have to raise them again. “We want to ensure the more we do now, the greater our ability to manage in the future,” he said. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein announced on Monday that 1200 hospital staff would be quarantined along with about 4000 household members as health authorities battle a major COVID-19 outbreak in two hospitals in north-west Tasmania after 34 health workers became infected. “Never before has a premier had to ask a community to do this,” Mr Gutwein said. “I’ve got to admit, the responsibility rests heavy on me in having to make these decisions. But I would ask that you work with us. “This is the best way that we can get on top of this, that we can stop the spread of this insidious disease.” The North West Regional Hospital and North West Private Hospital in Burnie closed at 7am, with patients being transferred elsewhere. The latest lockdown comes as NSW health authorities identify new hotspots across Greater Sydney and China records a spike in coronavirus cases, fearing a new outbreak. NSW Health confirmed two more passengers on board the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has been linked to hundreds of COVID-19 cases nationwide, have died. The state recorded nine new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total confirmed cases to 2863. NSW Health acting director Dr Christine Selvey said authorities urged people in areas where it’s unknown how people became infected with COVID-19 to get tested even if they have mild symptoms. Mr Hunt said Australians have “responded magnificently” to the new restrictions and social distancing measures announced three weeks ago. “Australians have done what we hoped and more. They have stayed at home, they have self-isolated,” he said. “Our transport movements have been below 13 per cent over Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I couldn’t be more impressed, more honoured and more heartened by the work of Australians over the last week and more. “We are now seeing consolidation of the flattening of the curve. That doesn’t mean we’re out of our challenge. There could at any time be outbreaks and spikes. “We are getting through this. I believe absolutely that we will get through this.” So far, there have been 6325 confirmed cases of COVID-19 around Australia with 61 deaths and 3141 patients totally recovering from the virus. There are 239 people in hospital with 81 of those in ICU. Of those, 35 are ventilated. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says we are in a good position in the fight against the coronavirus but we must maintain the pressure. “The scale of measures at the moment are something that we clearly do have to review … but it’s not now, it’s within the next few weeks,” he told ABC radio on Monday. “I think we need to look at all of the data, look at our preparedness, and the national cabinet will be making a lot of decisions about what, if anything, can be relaxed in the coming weeks.” The low number of new infections could be due in part to less testing over Easter. Looking forward, Professor Murphy said he would be very concerned if social restrictions were relaxed before public hospitals were fully prepared and the country had enough personal protective equipment. “The thing that worries us most at the moment is complacency,” he said. “Every single community transmission that’s undetected can infect a lot of people, and that’s why it is so important that we do maintain measures for the time being.” The rate of the coronavirus’ spread in Victoria is slowing, but Premier Daniel Andrews warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early as hundreds of return travellers from New Delhi, Cambodia, Peru and Uruguay remained in quarantine. “Essentially, much like yesterday and recent days, we’re seeing some stability in our numbers in terms of the number of additional cases,” he said on Monday. He said 13 people tested positive for COVID-19 overnight, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1281. It follows just three new cases of the virus on Sunday. Mr Andrews said Victoria’s curve is flattening “but it is fragile”, noting 122 confirmed cases may have been acquired through community transmission. “That’s always been our principal concern as we’ve seen less and less people returning from overseas travel,” he said. On Sunday, the premier extended the current state of emergency for four weeks to midnight on May 11. It comes as police fined more than 150 people, including six bikies, eight people at a party in St Kilda East and overseas tourists at a short-stay property in Cowes on Phillip Island. Fourteen people with coronavirus have died in Victoria while the national toll stands at 61. State Disaster Co-ordinator deputy commissioner Steve Gollschewski said police handed out $660,000 worth of infringement fines and turned away 906 vehicles at the border where authorities found the people had no good reason to enter Queensland. “There are still those people who don’t get the message and do the wrong thing,” he said. Queensland recorded seven new positive COVID-19 cases, taking the state’s total to 987. Sunday’s figure was revised to nine and there have been 35 cases over Easter with 13 on Friday, six on Saturday and nine on Sunday. People are largely following the strict new regulations, but a keen helicopter pilot and about 500 other people have run foul of the rules. “The fellow with a helicopter who thought it would be OK to fly to an area against the requirements of the directions, not only once but twice,” deputy commissioner Gollschewski said on Monday. Police issued 496 fines and turned around 906 vehicles at state borders in what they say has been the quietest Easter for a long time. There have been 364 international arrivals over the weekend and all have gone into quarantine, police say. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW identifies infection hotspots, implements stricter coronavirus testing","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/13\/coronavirus-nsw-hotspots\/","transcript":"New South Wales has revealed its emerging coronavirus hotspots, urging residents to get tested for COVID-19, even if they have only mild symptoms. NSW Health acting director Dr Christine Selvey on Monday said she met with staff from all of the state’s local health districts and they identified new areas to focus on virus testing. “These are areas where there have been cases with people where we are unable to find out where they got their infection from, and some other areas where we are concerned that if the spread of the virus was occurring, we would certainly want to know about that everywhere, Dr Selvey said. The vast majority of Australia’s virus infections so far have been traced to returning overseas travellers. The prospect of community infection, where no overseas contact can be traced, would represent a troubling new development in the nation’s COVID-19 response. “In order to be sure that we are not having widespread community transmission in these areas, we are asking that everyone – if they have even very mild symptoms – to present to their GP or to one of the COVID-19 clinics or to a hospital and seek testing,” she said. The areas of concerned identified as potential community transmission hotspots were in the Penrith local government area, as well as the  Liverpool, Blacktown, Cumberland and the Westmead areas. The in the inner west of Sydney was also identified, as well as the city’s east, including Waverley, Woollahra and Randwick, and Ryde in the north. Outside of Sydney, residents in Manning, Lake Macquarie and Newcastle were also being asked to get tested if they experience symptoms. “Particularly I emphasise on testing in those areas because we want to make sure that if community transmission is happening, that we are able to know that and that people with COVID-19 are identified early and their contacts traced to interrupt any more spread of the virus in those areas,” Dr Selvey said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"China's spike in Coronavirus cases triggers fears of fresh wave of infection","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/13\/coronavirus-china-infection-spike\/","transcript":"China has reported the highest number of new daily coronavirus cases in nearly six weeks sending a warning of a second wave of COVID-19 infection. Of the 108 new cases reported on Monday, 98 were imported from returning Chinese nationals or by overseas visitors, according to Chinese authorities. The new imported cases were up from 97 a day earlier. The number of asymptomatic cases – which Beijing does not count as a confirmed case – fell to 61 from 63 a day earlier. There are now a total of 82,160 confirmed cases in mainland China. The spike in cases has triggered fears that infected travellers could cause a second wave of the virus, just a week after the city of Wuhan – the epicentre of the virus – was reopened after 11 weeks in lockdown. China has reported two new deaths, bringing the country’s toll to 3341. It also recorded 61 new asymptomatic cases While the number of daily infections has dropped sharply from the height of the epidemic in February, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March 12 as the virus spread globally. Beijing is concerned that infected people entering the country could trigger a second wave and push the country back into a state of near paralysis. The northeast Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia, reported 56 new cases – 49 from Russia. Chinese cities near the border with Russia said on Sunday they would tighten border controls and quarantine measures on arrivals. The border city of Suifenhe and Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, said they would require all arrivals from abroad to undergo 28 days of quarantine, as well as nucleic acid and antibody tests.

Ms Ardern revealed on Monday that she used “the informal tactic” of finding Jenny McGee, 35, on Facebook and sending her a Facebook message to give her New Zealand’s support. “We have thanked our frontline health workers in New Zealand many times and rightly so but I wanted to add an acknowledgement that many, many Kiwis work in health care around the world,” the prime minister said. “They show the same commitment, same care, same work ethic that they do here. “We are all very proud of them, especially you Nurse Jenny.” The Southland nurse, who has been living and working as a nurse in London for the past eight years, was one of two nurses credited by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, with saving his life during his hospitalisation with the coronavirus “when things could have gone either way”. Mr Johnson said Jenny from Invercargill “to be exact”, and Luis from Portugal, were the reason that “in the end, my body did start to get enough oxygen”. “Because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed. “So that is how I also know that across this country, 24 hours a day, for every second of every hour, there are hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis,” he said in a message from his country estate Chequers, where he is continuing to recover. Nurse Jenny’ was quickly identified by Kiwi media as 35-year-old Jenny McGee. The Otago Daily Times reported that while Ms McGee was “overwhelmed by messages”, her parents Mike and Caroline back in New Zealand were extremely proud. Mr McGee said his daughter “would give the same level of care to whoever it is that’s in that bed needing care and that’s what we’re so proud of. ‘‘She says ‘my job is to get people well and get them back home again’ and she does her best.’’ Ms McGee spoke to her parents by phone on Monday morning saying the UK press was on her doorstep wanting to talk to her, however she was now back at the hospital working in the ICU on a night shift. Her brother, Bobby McGee, spoke to The New Zealand Herald about her work on Monday. “We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris – but what she has been doing helping everyday people,” he said. “We spoke to her this morning – evening in the UK – and she was about to head off to do another night shift. She just saw it as another day and kept just saying she is just doing her job. “Whilst she is blown away by Boris’ recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing – that made her really proud.” A former student at Verdon College in Invercargill, McGee was described as “absolutely delightful” with a “caring and humble nature”.  Our sincerest admiration for the work and dedication of past pupil Jenny McGee who was singled out by UK Prime Minster… Posted by Verdon College on Sunday, April 12, 2020 And now, among the dozens of messages of support waiting for Ms McGee’s attention is from her prime minister back home. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Mercy flights arrive as Australian travellers return from overseas | The New Daily","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/13\/mercy-flights-coronavirus-overseas\/","transcript":"Hundreds more Australians stranded overseas during the coronavirus pandemic are returning home on chartered flights. A flight from India arrived in Melbourne with 450 on board and another special flight from Cambodia carrying more than 100 people landed in Sydney on Monday morning.

People planning to travel overseas when the crisis is over are being encouraged to holiday at home instead. There is speculation international flights will not return until at least the end of this year, if not well into the next. “It is impossible to tell at present precisely when travel restrictions will be removed because that will be a matter dependent upon the health advice at the time,” Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham told the ABC. Senator Birmingham is wary of people going overseas and bringing the virus home, as well as potentially infected international visitors coming into Australia. “The international travel restrictions have played a key role (in stopping COVID-19’s spread) and will continue to play a key role,” he said. “The only people returning to Australia at present or entering the country are effectively those Australians receiving assistance through a range of different ways or undertaking their own flights to get back to Australia. “They are going into strict 14 days’ quarantine.” Senator Birmingham said the unfortunate reality was people would not be able to go overseas for some time, with no guarantee international flights will resume by December. “There may be a slightly earlier point in time where it becomes feasible to think about domestic travel again,” he said. “We’re not there yet but certainly this time is a good time for a bit of dreaming, planning, thinking about the Aussie break that you might take when we finally get to the other side of this.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Up to 5000 hospital staff, households quarantined in northwest Tasmania | The New Daily","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/tas\/2020\/04\/13\/tasmania-quarantine-hospital-staff-households-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Tasmanian government has closed two hospitals at the centre of a worsening coronavirus outbreak involving 49 cases in the state’s northwest in a bid “to crush this virus at its source”. At least 1200 hospital staff from two hospitals – and their households of about 4000 people – were placed into quarantine for two weeks on Monday morning as a “super clean” of the facilities is undertaken. The North West Regional Hospital and North West Private Hospital in Burnie closed at 7am, with the majority of patients transferred to the Mersey Community Hospital at Devonport. “There will be around 1000 staff, probably closer to 1200, who will be quarantined with their families,” Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein told reporters on Monday morning. “That will mean that we will have somewhere between, we expect, 4000 and 5000 people in the north-west that will be quarantined for the next 14 days. He said the move was “unprecedented”. “Never before has a premier had to ask a community to do this … the responsibility rests heavy on me in having to make these decisions. “But I would ask that you work with us. This is the best way that we can get on top of this, that we can stop the spread of this insidious disease, and importantly, that we can save lives. “We need to ensure that we can crush this virus at its source, and with this outbreak we need to take these steps,” Mr Gutwein said. State Health Commander Kathryn Morgan-Wicks said the decision to temporarily close the North West Regional Hospital was not taken lightly. There has been an increase of 11 new cases, including eight health care workers, one patient and two close contacts of people who previously tested positive, bringing the state’s overall figure to 144. The ABC reported 72 are linked to the north-west coast and 43 are healthcare workers at the hospitals Five people have died of the coronavirus in the state. The state government aims to reopen the hospitals after two weeks. It hopes the emergency department, maternity, cancer and intensive care unit services can return after 72 hours. Retailers in the northwest have also been hit with tougher restrictions with all shops not providing essential services or goods closed, including Kmart, Target and Harvey Norman. Pharmacies, supermarkets, service stations, newsagents, banks, vets and takeaway food outlets were exempt. The state recorded its fifth virus death on Sunday. Meanwhile, Australia’s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy told ABC radio on Monday morning the nation was in a good position in the fight against coronavirus but must maintain the pressure. More than 6300 Australians have been infected with coronavirus and 61 people have died. Two more deaths were recorded overnight but there were only 33 new cases in the past 24 hours. There are 239 people being treated in hospitals around the country, with 81 in ICU and 35 patients ventilated. While the coronavirus infection curve is flattening, Professor Murphy says it is still too early to relax strict social distancing rules. “The scale of measures at the moment are something that we clearly do have to review … but it’s not now, it’s within the next few weeks,” he told ABC radio on Monday. “I think we need to look at all of the data, look at our preparedness, and the national cabinet will be making a lot of decisions about what if anything can be relaxed in the coming weeks.” The low number of new infections may be due in part to less COVID-19 testing over the long weekend. Professor Murphy said he would be very concerned if social restrictions were relaxed before public hospitals were fully prepared and the country had enough personal protective equipment. “The thing that worries us most at the moment is complacency,” he said. “Every single community transmission that’s undetected can infect a lot of people, and that’s why it is so important that we do maintain measures for the time being.” Premier Daniel Andrews extended a state of emergency by four weeks to May 11. It was originally due to expire on Monday. This extension allows the government to keep the strict enforcement of social distancing, isolation and directions from the state’s chief health officer to slow the spread of coronavirus. “We are aggressively tracing our outbreaks, and making sure this virus does not get away from us,” he said. “If it does, our health system will simply be overrun and people will die.” There have been 13 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Victoria overnight, bringing the state’s total to 1281 and 14 people have died. Some nursing homes have completely banned visits to stop the spread of coronavirus, but Professor Murphy does not agree with that approach. He said aged care residents should continue welcoming guests, so long as they have no more than two visitors practising social distancing for a short period of time, and not allow children into the facilities. The federal government has launched contingency measures to ensure older Australians continue to get the care they need during the pandemic."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"FBI eyes Aussie broker in virus mask scam","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/13\/coronavirus-mask-scam\/","transcript":"The FBI is investigating an Australian “broker” accused of being involved in a scam that promised to deliver 39 million desperately needed N95 masks to US doctors and nurses fighting to keep coronavirus patients alive. The Australian allegedly claimed two million of the masks were sitting in a warehouse in the US state of Georgia and the product had been inspected by a certification company. California’s powerful Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West had been on a frantic search to connect hospitals with a potential supplier which led them to a Pittsburgh businessman and a potential stockpile of 39 million N95 masks. The 39 million masks and the two million in Georgia were a ruse, the FBI and prosecutors believe. “There are opportunists who are looking for any victim,” Scott Brady, US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, told the Los Angeles Times. The FBI and Mr Brady have declined to name the Australian or the Pittsburgh middleman. The scam was detected when the FBI and prosecutors investigated whether they could intercept the huge stockpile of masks under the Defense Production Act invoked by US President Donald Trump. The US government has the power under the act to seize supplies. The union launched the global search for masks and other personal protective equipment in response to pleas from frontline healthcare workers who needed protection. It led them to the Pittsburgh businessman. The businessman had been using WhatsApp to connect with the Australian broker and a supplier in Kuwait. The Australian and the Kuwaiti supplier are now targets of the US investigation. Prosecutors said the union and the Pittsburgh businessman appear to be among a string of middlemen fooled by the scam. No money was exchanged but desperate hospitals were hit hard by the ruse. Healthcare company Kaiser Permanente had placed an order for six million masks, but received nothing. “We believe we disrupted fraud,” Mr Brady said. “We are seeing (personal protective equipment) fraud in every variation, but mostly in respect to N95 masks. “We have an anxious public, and resources are strained.” SEIU-UHW spokesman Steve Trossman said hospitals desperate for equipment for their employees are encountering roadblocks and fraudsters. “We know hospitals and others are facing the same issues as states, counties, cities and everyone else: shipments delayed, deals falling through, bidding wars, suppliers committing the same stock to multiple buyers, fraudulent actors and federal government intervention,” Mr Trossman said. “One major health system has since told us that for every 100 leads they get on supplies, 99 fall through.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australia's coronavirus death toll jumps to 59","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/13\/australia-coronavirus-death-toll\/","transcript":"Australia’s coronavirus death toll has risen to 59 after three more deaths were recorded across the country on Easter Sunday. The latest person to die was an 82-year-old Sydney man who contracted the virus from a confirmed COVID-19 case – not linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The man who died at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on Sunday is believed to have had a number of underlying health conditions. His passing brings the state’s fatality count to 24. It followed the death of a woman in her 70s at North West Regional Hospital in Tasmania, bringing the state’s total to five. “It’s again a stark reminder that this virus is deadly, it’s taken lives and as I said it will take more yet,” Premier Peter Gutwein said. Also on Sunday, a 74-year-old man who caught the coronavirus on the Ruby Princess cruise ship succumbed to the infection in the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia. It marked the state’s fourth coronavirus death, with no new virus infections recorded for the first time in more than a month. In confirming the man’s death, SA Health said: “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man.” A charter flight carrying 444 Australians, including 33 infants, who were stranded in India arrived in Melbourne on Sunday, just after 8 pm.

The children and the baby talk, the cries were an orchestral synchronised soundscape of entertainment,” she said. A special Singapore Airlines flight with almost 200 Australians on board has finally left Phnom Penh with passengers desperate to get home amid a lockdown in Cambodia and neighbouring countries due to the coronavirus. The embassy said in a statement that 164 Australian citizens, plus 20 permanent residents and family members boarded the flight as regular commercial options “were drying up fast”. “So we decided to facilitate this one-off non-scheduled flight to a transit country, which then connected to a scheduled flight on the same plane to Sydney,” it said. “Passengers paid for economy and business seats.” The embassy said it took “a lot of work to make this happen” in “challenging circumstances” adding this would also help relieve pressure on Cambodia’s healthcare system, which Australia continues to support through its aid program. All on board are expected to go immediately into self-isolation upon arrival in Sydney. While Australia is “in a good place” in the fight against COVID-19, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the pressure must be kept up to beat the coronavirus. And despite strict lockdowns and social distancing measures, people in the community were still transmitting the coronavirus, he told reporters in Canberra on Sunday. Still, Dr Murphy said there was nowhere else he would rather be than Australia at the moment. “That is why we have to keep our pressure on and make sure that we don’t end up like countries in the world that you have all seen on the news.” There were 6315 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia as of Monday morning, according to John Hopkins University. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Julian Assange’s secret kids revealed as fiancee tells of coronavirus fears","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/13\/julian-assange-children\/","transcript":"Julian Assange secretly became engaged and fathered two children all while in hiding in a London embassy, it has been revealed. On Sunday, the WikiLeaks founder’s fiancee outed herself as she expressed fears the Australian’s life may be “coming to an end” at Belmarsh Prison. “It’s been … 10 years of breaking someone down, of trying to destroy his life,” Stella Moris-Smith Robertson said. Ms Moris-Smith Robertson showed off photographs and videos of the couple’s sons Max and Gabriel as she issued a teary plea for the UK to bail her 48-year-old partner, one year after he was taken into custody. The trained lawyer, who said she spoke fluent Swedish, explained that she met Assange in 2011 when she was a legal researcher looking into Sweden’s legal theory to help in his rape case. The pair formed a close friendship that by 2015 developed into a romance. “Falling in love is kind of an act of rebellion in a context where there’s a lot of attempts to destroy your life,”  she said. “I compare it to being in a war zone … constant, relentless attacks.” WATCH: Julian Assange's newly revealed partner, and mother of their 2 young children, speaks for the first time: Urges UK government to bail her vulnerable fiance amid #coronavirus fears#FreePress#DontExtraditeAssange #COVID19 https:\/\/t.co\/Uy6Kbsj55K — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 11, 2020 Having children brought Assange “peace”, Ms Moris-Smith Robertson said. He already has an adult son, named Daniel, to a previous relationship. There have for years been rumours circulating that Assange has fathered multiple other children. In his book Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World’s Most Dangerous Website, former WikiLeaks spokesperson Daniel Domscheit-Berg wrote that Assange would “boast” about how many children he had fathered. “He seemed to enjoy the idea of lots and lots of Julians, one on every continent. Whether he took care of any of these alleged children, or whether they existed at all, was another question,” Mr Domscheit-Berg claimed. Ms Moris-Smith Robertson said the couple had planned to have a family as a way for Assange “to break down those walls around him … and imagine a life beyond that prison (the Ecuadorian embassy)”. “And so while for many people it would seem insane to start a family in that context, for us it was the sane thing to do,” she said in the video. The couple has managed to keep secret the relationship and the existence of the whistleblower’s newest children, aged one and three, despite the intense media scrutiny surrounding Assange. But Ms Moris-Smith Robertson said she now wanted to make a public statement because their lives were “on the brink” and she feared Assange could die. Assange has been held in prison in London since he was dragged out of the embassy a year ago, and is awaiting an extradition hearing on behalf of the United States, where he is wanted for questioning. From the window of a prison van, Assange was initially putting on a show of strength, holding up a fist to the waiting media in vision broadcast around the world. But behind the scenes his health has quickly been deteriorating. In February, independent MP Andrew Wilkie told The New Daily after visiting the Australian in London: “From time to time you’d get a glimpse at a broken man. “He was doing his best to put on a brave face, but I think it was theatre because every now and then he’d sink into quietness – he’d look down and close his eyes. “Particularly when we were touching on things like his family, you could see he was really struggling.” Friends have recently expressed fears the coronavirus spreading through Belmarsh is threatening Assange’s life – on top of his delicate mental state. One prisoner has died, and a number of prison officers are off sick, suspected of having the virus, according to his friends. Ms Moris-Smith Robertson said her fiance is in isolation for 23 hours a day and can’t have visitors. As well as releasing a video, Ms Moris-Smith Robertson has written a statement to the courts supporting an application for Assange to be bailed. The extradition hearing is fixed for May 18 after a court rejected calls for an adjournment until September when his legal team said there were “insuperable” difficulties preparing his case because of the COVID-19 pandemic. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Loss of taste and smell could mean you have COVID-19","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/13\/coronavirus-loss-of-smell\/","transcript":"Did Sunday’s home-made hot cross buns taste unusually bland? Is your hand soap missing its floral whiff? You could have COVID-19. Anecdotal accounts of the new coronavirus causing a loss of smell have been travelling around the internet since before the spread of COVID-19 reached pandemic levels. Now doctors have mounting evidence the rumours are true, with the latest case study being from French doctors who have treated a woman in her 40s who suffered a ‘sudden and complete’ loss of smell. The woman had previously had a cough, but no fever. The doctors tested the woman’s ability to smell five differ odours: Roses, caramel, goats cheese, fruits and manure – none of them registered. “None of these [odours] were identified or detected by the patient,” the study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found. To see why this was happening, the doctors performed an MRI and CT scan on the woman. They found her olfactory cleft, the upper part of the nose which air travels through, was swollen. This was stopping air carrying scents reaching her olfactory epithelium, the mucous membrane that detects smells. Interestingly, she had no fever or runny nose, which typically cause a loss of smell in cold and flu patients. “To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with COVID-19 presenting essentially with an olfactory function loss,” the study found. And luckily, the sense should return. Viruses are believed to cause inflammation in the sensory neurons in our noses. This takes away the nerve cells’ ability to transfer the information about what we are smelling, nice or otherwise, to the brain. The good news is that damaged nerve cells in the nose can grow back. The study adds to the growing reports that along with fever, a dry cough, and difficulty breathing, COVID-19 can wipe out a person’s sense of smell. In fact, it might be the most common symptom. In the United Kingdom, a team from King’s College London recently analysed more than 400,000 people reporting suspected coronavirus symptoms. Of those 400,000 people, 18 per cent said they had no taste or smell. But of the cohort who has tested positive for COVID-19, 59 per cent said they had lost their smell or taste – making it a stronger predictor of the virus than fever. In a statement, ear, nose and throat experts from the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, said the symptom was concerning, as it meant patients presenting with just a loss of smell might be unknowingly spreading the virus. “There have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms,” the statement read. “These patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"On This Day: Handel debuts famous Easter concert piece Messiah","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/13\/on-this-day-in-history-handel-messiah\/","transcript":"On this day in 1742, the renowned concert piece Messiah by German composer George Frideric Handel was performed for the first time in Dublin. The 260-page oratorio, recognised for its famous ‘Hallelujah Chorus’, still awes listeners more than 250 years after Handel’s death.  It is believed King George II (1683-1760) was so moved by the Chorus when he heard it for the first time that he rose to his feet when it was performed. Obediently, everyone else followed suit and joined him. From then on, it became a tradition that everyone must stand when the Chorus is performed. Remarkably, Handel is believed to have composed the enormous concert piece Messiah in just 24 days, beginning on August 22, 1741. Apparently he was so absorbed in his work that he barely ate or slept. When servants checked on him, they often found him in tears. “Hallelujah,” he reportedly told his servant when the masterpiece was finished. “I did think I did see all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself seated on His throne, with His company of Angels”. The debut performance of Messiah in Dublin on April 13, 1742 was a knockout success, but it didn’t excite audiences in London the following season. Handel abandoned performances in London until 1749, when he was invited to perform at a fundraising concert at London’s Foundling Hospital. At the concert, he played some old and new pieces, including the ‘Hallelujah Chorus’. The next year he played the entire Messiah oratorio and it became an Easter tradition at the hospital, where earnings from his performance were given to the needy and sick. Though there are few details of the first performance, reports suggest it was played by a chorus of 16 men, 16 boys, two women, a small string orchestra, a chamber organ and a harpsichord played by Handel. The ensemble was tiny compared to later performances of the masterpiece, including a London presentation in 1879 on the centenary of Handel’s death, where it was performed by a choir of 2765 accompanied by a 460-piece orchestra. Ludwig van Beethoven reportedly said of Handel: “He is the greatest composer that ever lived.

Last week more than 2700 people, including judges, mentors, observers, volunteers and participants, took part in a two-day #flattenthecurvehack organised by the Australian Computer Society (ACS). “It was a global challenge,” said Steve Nouri, hackathon leader and ACS head of data science. Of the 2300 participants, 80 per cent were from Australia, 5 per cent from India, 3 per cent from the United States, two per cent from China, and the rest from 10 more countries. A hackathon is “an online competition that normally runs for a limited time, usually 48 to 72 hours”, Mr Nouri explained. The #flattenthecurvehack was a “social good” challenge focused on solving issues associated with the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s something that everyone right now relates to, not just in Australia, but globally,” Mr Nouri said. The hackers were tasked with solving five major challenges involving: “We’re looking to emerge stronger from the current difficult situation caused by the coronavirus, driven by the best that Australian innovation has to offer.” The #flattenthecurvehack was participant Mengyao Wang’s first hackathon. “I always thought that it was something more for computer science wizzes or programmers,” she said. “But this challenge was different.” Ms Wang said the plight of those affected by the pandemic had motivated her to take part. “So, I stood up.

When it comes to implementing the winning ideas, Mr Nouri said there has already been support from business partners and interest from federal ministers. “We are hoping to be a connecter and inspire others to learn from the ideas and maybe enhance them or add to them,” he said. “[The hackathon] saw people around the world coming together, making change, and delivering ideas … and the quality is amazing.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Dressmakers sew scrubs for healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus","date":"04-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/13\/sewing-scrubs-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Dressmakers and hobby sewers across the country are putting their skills to good use by sewing scrubs for frontline healthcare workers preparing to fight the coronavirus. The Scrubs Co-Op Facebook group connects makers with healthcare workers who need a fresh pair of scrubs. The group’s mission? “To provide the only thing worth remembering from the COVID pandemic beyond 2020 – the super stylish attire”, the page reads. Founder Louise Parry works as a doctor in a specialised COVID-19 ward at The Austin hospital in Melbourne. She said the hospital has been busy preparing for the coronavirus pandemic to peak in coming months. “We know what’s going on in other parts of the world, so we’re trying to be as prepared as we possibly can,” Dr Parry told The New Daily. After relocating to the new ward, she realised she needed to find a pair of scrubs. “I used to wear normal plain clothes to work but given we’re in PPE all day now, I thought it’d be easier to wear scrubs and save my clothes from getting sweaty,” Dr Parry told The New Daily. She said she started The Scrubs Co-Op after receiving an “overwhelming response” to a post on Facebook asking if anyone could make her a pair of scrubs. “I knew it wasn’t just me that wanted them. A lot of people have been struggling to find them,” Dr Parry said. “Certainly a lot of people have said they’re very happy to be helping, particularly professional dressmakers who thought they couldn’t do anything.” Some makers are donating scrubs for free, while others are taking orders and selling them for about $30 to $50 per piece. Victoria Trott from Point Cook in Melbourne is one of those willing makers. The former nurse rose to the challenge of scrub-making after spotting a post from an ER registrar who wanted a scrub with a rainbow design. “I thought, I’ve got rainbow fabric so I went ‘OK, I’ll do that for you’,” Ms Trott said.

His comments come after the United Kingdom’s coronavirus death toll rose by 737 in 24 hours, pushing the total number of fatalities past 10,000. After spending a week in London’s St Thomas’ hospital, three days of which were in intensive care, the prime minister said he witnessed firsthand “the pressure the NHS [National Health Service] is under”. Speaking in a video message posted on Twitter on Monday morning (Australian time) – just hours after being discharged – Mr Johnson thanked the doctors he said “took some crucial decisions” that saved his life. He mentioned by name several nurses who had watched over him all night to ensure he kept breathing. “And I hope they won’t mind if I mention in particular two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way,” the PM said. “They are Jenny from New Zealand – Invercargill on the South Island, to be exact – and Luis from Portugal, near Porto. “And the reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed.” It is hard to find the words to express my debt to the NHS for saving my life.

The coronavirus death toll has risen to 10,612 across hospitals in the UK after a recorded daily rise of 737, the health ministry said. The two previous daily increase figures were both more than 900. On previous weekends since the outbreak began, figures have dipped, which can reflect longer delays in registering deaths. The UK has recorded 85,175 cases of COVID-19, according to the latest count by Johns Hopkins University. According to the Wellcome Trust, Britain could be “one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe,” with its director Jeremy Farrar telling the BBC that government experts were expecting a second and third wave of infections. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Boris Johnson discharged from hospital after stint in intensive care","date":"04-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/12\/boris-johnson-discharged-hospital-coronavirus\/","transcript":"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been discharged from a London hospital where he was treated in intensive care for COVID-19.

Lobby group Universities Australia said a quarter of the sector’s workforce could lose their jobs, despite the government on Sunday reaffirming its commitment to $18 billion of funding this calendar year. Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters the government would maintain the same level of Commonwealth Grant Scheme (CGS) and HELP funding payments despite a projected drop in student enrolments. He said the government would also offer $100 million of regulatory fee relief, and slash the price of university short courses to help jobless Australians move into in-demand industries such as nursing and allied health. “We want to enable people, rather than bingeing on Netflix, to binge on studying,” Mr Tehan said of the 20,000 heavily discounted places. “The cost of these courses has been reduced by over 50 per cent, and in some instances [by] up to 74 per cent.” But although the changes were a welcome “first step in ensuring the viability of the nation’s universities,” Universities Australia chair Professor Deborah Terry said they weren’t enough to stop a tsunami of job losses. “We estimate a quarter of all jobs at Australian universities will go within the next six months – that’s more than 21,000 livelihoods,” Professor Terry said. “Individual universities are already cutting costs across the board through very substantial reductions in operational spending, deferral of vital capital works, and reductions in senior staff salaries. Universities would continue to seek low-interest loans from banks and state governments, while offering “crisis support” to students who have lost part-time jobs, Professor Terry added. The lobby group had previously asked the government for hardship payments to international students struggling to pay their bills, and a relaxation of the JobKeeper eligibility rules. The current legislation states that businesses with annual turnover above $1 billion can only claim the JobKeeper wage subsidies if their revenue falls by at least 50 per cent. But Universities Australia wants the government to lower this threshold to 15 per cent for universities, like it has done for charities. The government has so far declined both requests. Its funding guarantee comes after University of Sydney vice-chancellor Michael Spence told staff on Wednesday the university expected to lose $470 million as a result of the coronavirus. Dr Spence said in an email that domestic enrolments had dropped 9.9 per cent and international enrolments had plunged 16.8 per cent. A University of New South Wales spokesperson, meanwhile, told the Sydney Morning Herald the number of international students for its first trimester had fallen 30 per cent. Greens education spokesperson Mehreen Faruqi said the falling international enrolments, which for many universities account for more than a third of revenue, followed years of funding cuts. She said the government’s relief package had failed students and universities – many of which had been forced to “become food banks by a government that refuses to give desperate international students any form of income support”. “The terrible decision by the government to abandon university staff means they will continue to face uncertainty and instability,” Senator Faruqi said. “Higher education providers should be eligible for JobKeeper payments and all staff, including all casuals, should be supported through this very difficult time. “Stop-gaps like regulatory fee relief and online short courses aren’t enough, nor can they justify the government passing the buck on student welfare.” National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) national president Alison Barnes, meanwhile, said the “smoke and mirrors” relief package failed international students and would do nothing to prevent massive job losses. “The $18 billion that Dan Tehan is trumpeting is already budgeted for,” Dr Barnes said. “We’re extremely disappointed that the government will not enable universities to access the JobKeeper subsidy. Without it, tens of thousands of jobs in the sector are still threatened.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘I owe them my life’: Boris Johnson hails ICU team that snatched him from death's door | The New Daily Boris Johnson hails ICU team: 'I owe them my life'","date":"04-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/12\/johnson-thanks-team-that-saved-his-life\/","transcript":"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thanked staff at a London hospital for taking care of him while he recovers from COVID-19. “I can’t thank them enough.

The reason: Some hospitals have reported unusually high death rates for coronavirus patients on ventilators, and some doctors worry that the machines could be harming certain patients. The evolving treatments highlight the fact that doctors are still learning the best way to manage a virus that emerged only months ago. They are relying on anecdotal, real-time data amid a crush of patients and shortages of basic supplies. Mechanical ventilators push oxygen into patients whose lungs are failing. Using the machines involves sedating a patient and sticking a tube into the throat. Deaths in such sick patients are common, no matter the reason they need the breathing help. Generally speaking, 40-50 per cent of patients with severe respiratory distress die while on ventilators, experts say. But 80 per cent or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines in New York City have died, state and city officials say. Higher-than-normal death rates also have been reported elsewhere in the US, said Dr Albert Rizzo, the American Lung Association’s chief medical officer. Similar reports have emerged from China and the United Kingdom. One UK report put the figure at 66 per cent. A very small study in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease first emerged, said 86 per cent died. The reason is not clear. It may have to do with what kind of shape the patients were in before they were infected. Or it could be related to how sick they had become by the time they were put on the machines, some experts said. But some health professionals have wondered whether ventilators might actually make matters worse in certain patients, perhaps by igniting or worsening a harmful immune system reaction. That’s speculation. But experts do say ventilators can be damaging to a patient over time, as high-pressure oxygen is forced into the tiny air sacs in a patient’s lungs. “We know that mechanical ventilation is not benign,” said Dr Eddy Fan, an expert on respiratory treatment at Toronto General Hospital. “One of the most important findings in the last few decades is that medical ventilation can worsen lung injury, so we have to be careful how we use it.” The dangers can be eased by limiting the amount of pressure and the size of breaths delivered by the machine, Fan said. But some doctors say they’re trying to keep patients off ventilators as long as possible, and turning to other techniques instead. Only a few weeks ago in New York City, coronavirus patients who came in quite sick were routinely placed on ventilators to keep them breathing, said Dr Joseph Habboushe, an emergency medicine doctor who works in Manhattan hospitals. But increasingly, physicians are trying other measures first. One is having patients lie in different positions – including on their stomachs – to allow different parts of the lung to aerate better. Another is giving patients more oxygen through nose tubes or other devices. Other physicians are experimenting with adding nitric oxide to the mix, to help improve blood flow and oxygen to the least damaged parts of the lungs. “If we’re able to make them better without intubating them, they are more likely to have a better outcome – we think,” Habboushe said. He said those decisions are separate from worries that there are not enough ventilators available. But that is a concern as well, Habboushe added. There are widespread reports that coronavirus patients tend to be on ventilators much longer than other kinds of patients, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. Experts say that patients with bacterial pneumonia, for example, may be on a ventilator for no more than a day or two. But it’s been common for coronavirus patients to have been on a ventilator “seven days, 10 days, 15 days, and they’re passing away,” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, when asked about ventilator death rates during a news briefing on Wednesday. New York State Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker said on Wednesday that officials are looking into other possible therapies that can be given earlier, but added “that’s all experimental.” “The ventilator is not therapeutic. It’s a supportive measure while we wait for the patient’s body to recover,” said Dr Roger Alvarez, a lung specialist with the University of Miami Health System in Florida, who is a leader in the effort to use nitric oxide to keep patients off ventilators for as long as possible. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews pours cold water on hopes of AFL season kicking off anytime soon | The New Daily Victoria's Dan Andrews pours cold water on AFL season hopes","date":"04-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/sport\/afl\/2020\/04\/12\/andrews-nixes-hope-for-afl-season\/","transcript":"Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has quashed any talk of the AFL following the lead of the NRL and restarting its competition any time soon. Premier Andrews announced on Sunday the state of emergency in Victoria will be extended until at least May 11, meaning strict enforcement of social distancing and isolation measures remain in place to slow the spread of coronavirus. The NRL has announced plans to resume playing on May 28 but with 10 of the 18 AFL clubs based in Victoria the extension of restrictions and border lockdowns affecting interstate clubs means they are unlikely to follow suit. The AFL has so far taken a cautious approach and hasn’t set a resumption date, saying it will be guided by government measures. Andrews said while the decision was ultimately for the AFL, he feared there were “many weeks and months to go”. “Many people would love to see footy back as soon as possible but that’s ultimately a matter for the AFL,” Andrews said on Sunday. “I’m very confident the AFL will be in close contact with the Department of Health and Human Services and particularly the public health team. “Everyone wants to get our state back to something approaching normal and footy is a really big and important part of the way our state functions. “I do fear, though, that we have many weeks and months to go with quite extraordinary measures and the good thing is that the strategy is working.” 🐯What do you miss the most about being at the footy?🐯I can’t wait to hear our theme song in front of a big crowd. 🏟 🐯This is my favourite – pure joy after beating GWS to make the 2017 Grand Final. 😁🐯And they initially played the wrong song. 😂#GoTiges #AFL pic.twitter.com\/ayGncez7CY — Cheryl Critchley (@CherylCritchley) April 4, 2020  Meanwhile, AFL heavyweight Jeff Kennett has slammed NRL’s plans to resume playing next month, calling it “irresponsible”. Hawthorn president Kennett, the former Victorian premier, says the NRL is putting money ahead of player health and welfare by committing to a restart for their competition. “I think what the NRL people have done is totally irresponsible … absolutely irresponsible,” Kennett told the Sunday Herald Sun. “It shows no regard at all for the welfare of their players and hopefully the government will step in and put them back in their place. “That just shows you that they are putting commercial considerations ahead of their players, and to me that is unforgivable.” Carlton coach David Teague has revealed another obstacle in the AFL clubs’ quest to belatedly re-launch the 2020 season – clubs are unable to remotely track their players’ training. Teague said that under an AFL ruling, clubs can’t use any equipment to remotely monitor the efforts of players. “You’re not allowed to track them with any GPS or anything like that,” Teague told ABC Grandstand on Sunday. The first-year coach said many of his players used technology such as smart watches but any feedback flowing back to the club was on a voluntary basis. “In terms of that (GPS) feedback coming back to the club, that is whether a player wants to volunteer it or not,” Teague said. “We can’t demand it of the players – and that’s an AFL rule. “We’ve got no real issue there and most of our boys are feeding back information but it’s an AFL rule, not a club rule.” Teague believed mental health was behind the ruling so players didn’t feel under constant scrutiny while away from the club. He trusted the Blues would stay in good shape while they were away from the club after impressing through the pre-season. “I’m really confident with our group that they will do the work – we’ve got a highly driven group who are really motivated,” Teague said. “The way they applied themselves over the pre-season, I was super impressed with.” Teague said had been given no official timeline for the resumption of the AFL competition, with the governing body telling coaches they would get an update later this month. “The AFL said on April 27 they will come out and let us know whether we come back in early May but my gut feel is that it probably won’t be then and it will get pushed back,” he said. Meanwhile, Teague was against an idea floated by ex-Carlton coach Mick Malthouse that round one points should be scrapped. With such a time lag between rounds one and two, Malthouse said the opening round should be considered a practice round, with the competition starting properly with the next game. Despite Carlton losing to Richmond, Teague said the result should stand. “We went out there to win and Richmond were too good on the day so I’m comfortable with them starting with four points and us with zero,” he said. “We went out and lost, so I’m happy to wear it on the chin.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Man dies while under quarantine in Melbourne hotel as fresh infection cases fly home | The New Daily Man dies while under hotel quarantine in Melbourne","date":"04-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/12\/man-dies-in-melbourne-coronavirus-quarantine\/","transcript":"A man has died while under quarantine in a Melbourne hotel, while a plane carrying more than 100 stranded cruise ship passengers infected with COVID-19 has landed in the city. “Police are not treating the death as suspicious at this time,” a health department spokesperson confirmed on Sunday. “The coroner will be investigating the incident and as such we are unable to comment further.” It is unknown if the person had tested positive for coronavirus or if his death has been included in the national death toll, which now stands at 59.. The latest development comes as a flight from Uruguay touched down at Melbourne Airport just before 7am on Sunday, carrying about 112 passengers from the Greg Mortimer cruise ship whose Antarctica voyage was cut short. Vision from the airport shows crews in hazmat suits boarding the plane, while a handful of passengers wearing masks are also seen disembarking then walking towards a smaller aircraft. It is believed that plane is bound for New Zealand. The COVID refugees arrived as officials confirmed a 74-year-old Adelaide man, a former passenger on the Ruby Princess, and a Tasmanian woman in her 70s have become the latest Australian victims of COVID-19. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced the state of emergency in Victoria will be extended for another four weeks as the number of new coronavirus cases continues to decline. Addressing a Sunday morning press conference, Mr Andrews revealed three cases of coronavirus had been confirmed overnight, bringing Victoria’s total to 1,268. It is the fewest number of new cases in the state since early March. The state’s death toll remains at 14 with 28 people in hospital and 16 of those in intensive care. The ship’s operator, Aurora Expeditions, confirmed this week that 128 of 217 people on board the Greg Mortimer, nearly 60 per cent, had tested positive for the coronavirus. Uruguay’s Foreign Minister Ernesto Talvi said two Australian passengers could not be transported as they were fighting for their lives in intensive care. The ship had been stranded in the South American nation for more than two weeks, after leaving Argentina on March 15 for a 16-day return trip to Antarctica. Victoria’s Deputy Chief Health Officer Annaliese van Diemen told reporters on Saturday the flight would be met by medical staff and ambulances. “Everybody who needs to go to hospital will go to hospital and the remaining passengers will go into quarantine in hotels,” Dr van Diemen said. Any passenger displaying coronavirus symptoms would be taken to hospital, whether or not they have tested positive for the virus, she added. The group is among 1200 Australian nationals being flown home from overseas to land at Tullamarine this weekend, with flights from India and Peru touching down on Friday and Saturday. All incoming passengers will be shuttled off to hotels to start 14 days of quarantine. Meanwhile, the first group of quarantined travellers were released on Sunday morning after their mandatory two-week quarantine ended. Victoria’s total recorded COVID-19 cases stands at 1265, with 14 deaths. The number of new cases on Saturday rose by 24, compared to a rise of 13 the day before. Of those infected authorities say 118 may have been cases of community transmission. Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, called on people not to look for loopholes in physical distancing laws and not leave the house unless for an essential outing. While most people have heeded Dr Sutton’s advice to have a quiet Easter, many have been fined for hosting gatherings at their homes.

Likening the pandemic’s impact to the fear experienced by Jesus’ followers in the days after the crucifixion, the Pontiff urged the faithful not to surrender hope in “the darkest hour”. “They, like us, had before their eyes the drama of suffering, of an unexpected tragedy that happened all too suddenly,” Francis said during Saturday’s late night Mass. “They had seen death and it weighed on their hearts,” he said of the apostles. “Pain was mixed with fear. Then, too, there was fear about the future and all that would need to be rebuilt. “For them, as for us, it was the darkest hour.” Easter vigil Mass in the basilica is among the Vatican’s more evocative ceremonies. Celebrants enter in darkness, except for candlelight. The Pontiff holds a tall Easter candle, which is lit for him, then the basilica’s lights are turned on — a  symbol of joy and redemption. But this night, when the basilica was illuminated, its emptiness was painfully visible, and the footsteps of the Pope and his small entourage on the marble floor could clearly be heard as they walked in slow procession toward the altar. Francis encouraged the faithful to sow “seeds of hope, with small gestures of care, affection of prayer”. “Tonight we acquire a fundamental right that can never be taken away from us: the right to hope,” Francis said. He acknowledged the difficulty of obtaining optimism, saying “as the days go by and fears grow, even the boldest hope can dissipate”. Describing the Easter message as a “message of hope”, Francis urged Christians to be “messengers of life in a time of death”.

Stella Moris-Smith Robertson said there were now genuine fears for the health of the WikiLeaks founder. Assange has been held in Belmarsh prison in London since he was dragged out of the embassy a year ago, and is awaiting an extradition hearing on behalf of the United States, where he wanted for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks. He has been in poor health for months, but his friends say coronavirus is now spreading through Belmarsh. One prisoner has died, and a number of prison officers are off sick, suspected of having the virus, say his friends. In a statement to the courts supporting an application for bail, Moris-Smith Robertson reveals that she met Assange in 2011 when she was a legal researcher, and was asked to look into the Swedish legal theory and practice. “Over time Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I become his,” she wrote. The friendship developed, and despite the “extraordinary circumstances”, a close relationship began in 2015, she said. The couple have two young children aged three and one. “My close relationship with Julian has been the opposite of how he is viewed – of reserve, respect for each other and attempts to shield each other from some of the nightmares that have surrounded our lives together.” She said she was making the statement because their lives were “on the brink” and she feared Assange could die. He is in isolation for 23 hours a day and all visits have stopped, she added.

Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, is leading a team of researchers in the development of a vaccine that would protect the world against coronavirus. In an interview with The Times, the professor said that she and her team have already created a potential vaccine that is due to begin human trials within two weeks. She told the paper she is “80 per cent” confident of its success, “based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine”. Most industry experts say that a vaccine could take as long as 18 months to be developed and distributed globally. However, Professor Gilbert believes that by letting volunteers from places that have not imposed lockdown measures become infected naturally as soon as possible, will accelerate the clinical trial process. “If one of those (places) turns out to have a high rate of virus transmission then we will get our efficacy results very quickly, so that is one strategy for reducing the time,” she said. “Total lockdowns do make it harder. But we don’t want the herd immunity either. We want them to be susceptible and exposed for the trials purely to test the efficacy.” In order for the vaccine to be distributed in the autumn, Professor Gilbert says the Government will need to start production before it is proven to work.

Meanwhile British Prime Boris Johnson still needs time to rest and recuperate following his stint in intensive care with coronavirus, the nation’s home affairs minister says. “The message to the prime minister is, we want him to get better and he needs time and space to rest, recuperate and recover,” Home Secretary Priti Patel told a daily press briefing at Downing St. “It is vital that our prime minister gets well.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cut-price online courses to retrain jobless Australians","date":"04-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/education\/2020\/04\/12\/coronavirus-cheap-education-courses\/","transcript":"Jobless Australians will be encouraged to “use their time” during the coronavirus outbreak to retrain online as nurses, teachers and other vital professions. The federal government says prices will be slashed on a range of tertiary courses by more than 50 per cent in a bid to fill skill shortages once the pandemic is over. Education Minister Dan Tehan will on Sunday announce measures to assist the university sector which is forecast to lose up to $4.6 billion in revenue. For the first time, the government says it will provide 20,000 greatly reduced places in six-month diplomas or graduate certificates delivered remotely by universities or private institutions. The online courses starting in May will focus on what are deemed to be “areas of national priority”, such as nursing, teaching, counselling, IT and science. “This plan will help Australians who have lost their job or are looking to retrain to use their time studying nursing, teaching, counselling, allied health or other areas considered national priorities,” Mr Tehan told the ABC. “The cost of these courses has been reduced by over 50 per cent, and in some instances up to 74 per cent,” he said. “There has been a disruption to the economy, so we are providing an opportunity for people to re-skill or to look at other areas to advance their careers.” Mr Tehan said the Morrison government would guarantee $18 billion funding for universities even if there was a fall in domestic enrolment numbers and $100 million in regulatory fee relief. It comes amid forecasts of an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent – the highest in four years – when the March jobs data is released on Thursday, compared with 5.1 per cent in February. However economists expect the jobless rate could almost double towards 10 per cent by the middle of the year as the economy sinks into a deep recession, the first in nearly 30 years. Mr Tehan said the education package would help shape the new economy that would emerge from the pandemic. “This plan will help Australians who have lost their job or are looking to retrain,” he said. “It will also provide a revenue stream for universities and private providers to assist their financial stability.” He said like the rest of the Australian community, the higher education sector had taken a financial hit because of the coronavirus and lost income from a drop in international students. “The university sector came to the government about three weeks ago and said that their No.1 priority was to be able to get a guarantee for their domestic student load,” he said. “We have done that now, this will put ballast into university funding for the rest of the year,” he said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"USA death toll the highest in the world | The New Daily","date":"04-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/12\/coronavirus-usa-death-toll\/","transcript":"The USA has overtaken Italy with the world’s highest coronavirus death toll – more than 20,000 victims – as president Donald Trump considers when to re-open the country. New York is faring the worst, with more infections than any country, while CNN reports more that 700 members of the New York fire service have tested positive for COVID-19. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said deaths were stabilising but at a “horrific rate” with more than 700 daily deaths for five days. Mr Trump, seeking re-election in November, has said he wants life to return to normal as soon as possible. He says the decision will be the biggest he has ever had to make as public health experts warn the death toll could spike to 200,000 over the summer if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days. The sweeping restrictions on movement aimed at curbing the spread of the COVID-19 disease carry their own economic and public-health cost, Mr Trump says. “I’m going to have to make a decision, and I … hope to God that it’s the right decision,” he told reporters. “It’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.” Mr Trump said the facts would determine the next move. Asked what metrics he would use to make his judgement, he pointed at his forehead. “The metrics right here, that’s my metrics,” he said. The US has seen its highest daily death tolls to date in the epidemic with roughly 2000 deaths a day reported for the last four days in a row. Italy has the second most reported deaths at 19,468 and Spain is third with 16,353. The US has five times the population of Italy and nearly seven times the population of Spain. Globally, there have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases, with the death toll surpassing 106,000. The current federal guidelines run until April 30. The president will then have to decide whether to extend them or start encouraging people to go back to work and a more normal way of life. Mr Trump said he would unveil a new advisory council next week that will include some state governors and will focus on the process of reopening the US economy. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits in the last three weeks surpassed 15 million, as weekly new claims topped six million for the second straight time last week. The government has said the economy purged 701,000 jobs in March. That was the most job losses since the Great Recession and ended the longest employment boom in US history after it started in late 2010."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Airline refunds: What are a (would-be) flyer’s rights? | The New Daily Airline refunds: What are a thwarted flyer's rights?","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/11\/coronavirus-airlines-refunds-rights\/","transcript":"Air travel in Australia is as good as grounded as we fight to fight back against the coronavirus spread. International flights have been scrapped, and domestic routes are a shadow of their former selves. Virgin Australia on Thursday announced it was suspending all of its flights, bar a lone Sydney-to-Melbourne route. But there’s still confusion over what rights travellers have if their flight has been cancelled, or if they choose not to fly for their own reasons. In the US, the government this week mandated that airlines must refund passengers in the event of cancelled flights or heavily rescheduled flights. The move was in response to an overwhelming amount of complaints from travellers who were being offered credit rather than direct refunds. In Australia, it’s still up to individual airlines to pass on refunds or credits where they see fit – and it’s a minefield to navigate. For example, Qantas and Virgin Australia will refund passengers in some circumstances, but it’s up to you to know which circumstances and then follow the refund up yourself. (Keep reading for a break-down on what the airlines offer.) Melbourne Law School consumer rights expert Jeannie Paterson said the disparity between airlines, and even fare types, was creating an uneven playing field for consumers. People who fly regularly – for business, for example – will probably be happy to take credit or a voucher to use down the track, Professor Paterson told The New Daily. But for people who had a flight booked for a one-off occasion, a voucher could be virtually useless to them. In her view, Professor Paterson said all airlines should be offering refunds for all passengers, on all fare types. “Vouchers have a lot of restrictions attached to them,” she said. “I would take a hard line and say consumers are entitled to refunds because they’re not able to fly. “It shouldn’t be left to the consumers to chase refunds – the airlines should be offering.” Monash University aviation expert Greg Bamber said it was understandable why airlines were opting for vouchers where they could – they’ve been dealt a massive financial blow. However, it was still a rich ask. Most airlines try to delay such refunds so they can hold the money for as long as possible and also to try to insist on the customer accepting credit rather than a refund, Professor Bamber said. “Passengers are already helping through taxes, so if airlines are keeping money through vouchers, passengers are helping them twice,” Professor Bamber told The New Daily, referring to the government bail-outs given to airlines. He agreed with Professor Paterson that airlines should be refunding passengers for their tickets in full – including all booking fees. Consumer advocacy body CHOICE has compared which airlines are offering refunds and which are offering vouchers. The New Daily also reached out to the airlines to check their refund policies in this unprecedented time. Qantas The national carrier is offering credit vouchers for non-cancelled flights (so if you just choose not to fly, understandably) until July 31. These vouchers will be valid until the end of next year. The voucher comes with restrictions: It’s only valid for fares equal to the original fare you bought. If you want a flight that costs more, you’ll pay the difference. Oh, and you have to claim your voucher by the end of this month. Qantas did not respond to TND’s inquiry, but here’s the airline’s conditions of carriage to wade through. Virgin Australia “Our guests have the option to change their flight to a later date without incurring a change free; receive a travel credit, or receive a refund if their fare-type allows,” a spokesperson for the carrier told The New Daily. CHOICE says passengers booked to fly before June 30 can change their flights or seek a voucher. While Virgin Australia will waive cancellation or change fees, the difference for higher fares will be on the customer. Check Virgin’s details here. Jetstar A Jetstar spokesperson referred TND to this site, in response to our inquiries. By all information, it’s pretty hard to get a refund on Jetstar, which is pretty standard for low-cost carriers. If you’re booked to fly – but don’t want to – before July 31, you can claim a voucher. It’ll only be valid for a flight that departs within 12 months of the booking date and you’ll need to use your voucher before the end of April. Tiger All of Tiger’s flights are suspended. Tiger is owned by Virgin Australia, so the same policies apply. Here’s a statement from Tiger for affected passengers."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Should we wear face masks? An epidemiologist's verdict","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/science\/2020\/04\/11\/coronavirus-face-masks-advice\/","transcript":"The coronavirus pandemic has caused a worldwide shortage of face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) that health care workers rely on. The expert consensus in Australia has been that mask wearing is only necessary for health care workers and COVID-19 patients. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reiterated that there is no evidence that face masks provide the general public with protection from COVID-19 infection. “We don’t generally recommend the wearing of masks in public by otherwise well individuals because it has not up to now been associated with any particular benefit,” Michael J. Ryan, chief executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program, said recently. Panic buying of masks can also jeopardise the supply available to frontline health care workers. However, the consensus on mask wearing is changing in some places, with the United States’ Centre for Disease Control now telling Americans that they can make their own cloth face masks. So what should we do in Australia? Professor Mary-Louise McLaws is a Professor Epidemiology of Hospital Infection and Infectious Diseases Control at the University of New South Wales. She is also a member of the WHO’s expert advisory panel for infection prevention and control preparedness, readiness and response to COVID-19. Professor McLaws broke down the latest WHO advice on face masks: “In summary, the WHO Advisory [released on April 7] re-iterates their previous advice, which is that hospital grade masks are needed most by frontline healthcare workers to help prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Professor McLaws explained. “There is good evidence that wearing a medical mask is beneficial when you are a healthcare professional and in close contact with people who have COVID-19. “However, there is no evidence that healthy people wearing masks out in the community generally are protected from COVID-19.” Read Professor McLaws’ detailed responses to more key face mask questions below: Q: Not all masks are created equal. Can you give us a 101 on masks? “There are two types of masks that are effective in filtering droplets from the air: surgical (sometimes called a medical mask) and N95. The design of the surgical mask is tested in a lab to ensure it effectively resists at least 95 per cent of a standard laboratory sized particle and is resistant to blood. “Our healthcare workers wear surgical masks that repel at least 98 per cent or more of those sized particles. “Surgical masks provide protection against droplet spread for all healthcare workers providing routine care to COVID-19 patents. A high quality surgical mask can resist smaller particles like the N95 but the N95 mask has the additional safety of a seal against the face while the surgical mask is open at the sides. “N95 are required when healthcare workers perform an aerosol-generating procedure (causing small particles to be expelled by the patient such as placing a breathing tube into a patient). “Then there are masks that are being produced that do not conform to these standards and cannot be relied on to prevent the spread of disease through droplets.” Q: What issues do we currently have with the supply of masks? “The Australian guidelines stipulate that healthcare workers must use a new mask with each new patient, when the mask becomes moist during caring for the patient, and the healthcare worker must remove the mask when leaving the patient’s room so a new mask must be used for the next patient. “This means the number of masks used will be very high. Prior to the pandemic the number of patients who required care from a healthcare worker needing to wear a mask was much lower. “A pandemic creates a surge in patient numbers who can infect healthcare workers and so there is a surge in demand for masks. All countries that have a high number of COVID-19 patients are concerned that their supply of masks will not meet the required demand for masks.” Q: Can people safely reuse masks? “During the SARS 2003 outbreak healthcare workers reused their own masks because of the surge in demand for masks associated with the high number of SARS patients and the high number of procedures that required the healthcare worker to wear a mask. They placed their N95 mask into a labelled bag and re-used it the following day until the mask was moist or damp and then they replaced it with a new one. This is not an ideal situation but is an emergency response to severe disruption to the supply chain. We can’t yet safely reprocess N95 masks because research has reported reprocessing degrades the strands within the mask. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is right now working with global experts to identify the safest method of extending the use of masks until a reprocessing method that does not degrade the mask is identified.” Q: Can people safely make their own masks? “No. The production of masks is complex, for example some masks are made up of polypropylene central layers that are charged to prevent penetration of particles and designed to fit the face to provide a seal to prevent small particles from entering the mask. “Both N95 and surgical masks are lab tested to ensure they filter at least 95-98 per cent of lab particles (referred to as the ‘most penetrating particle’). “It is understandable that people in places like New York City where the COVID-19 infection rate is very high are nervous and may resort to making their own masks. “While a mask made out of cotton may provide a small amount of protection from droplets, it is incredibly important that this does not give people a false sense of security. “If you want to wear a mask, remember it may not be hospital grade. If you wear a mask don’t forget to hand hygiene, avoid touching your face and apply social distancing as these simple actions are still the best ways to avoid being infected with COVID-19 even while wearing a non-hospital grade mask.” Q: With global shortages reported, what are our options for increasing supply? “Longer term has to be local production of masks.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Easter message from Father Bob: Coronavirus can bring us together","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/11\/coronavirus-easter-father-bob\/","transcript":"Easter looks a little different this year. As the new coronavirus wrecks havoc across the world, Easter lunch is celebrated via Zoom, congregations gather online as priests preach to empty pews, and the Easter Bunny has been declared an essential worker. We are living in an extraordinary time. We are grieving for those lost to the pandemic, yearning for connection and celebrating little things, like the perfect sourdough starter. All, while staying 1.5 metres away from each other. Although this may feel hard, overwhelming, lonely, even scary sometimes – we will get through it, together. Australians get knocked down, but they always get up again. That is the message Father Bob Maguire, Australia’s larrikin priest, wants us to remember this Easter. “We’ve already got the strategy. It is don’t leave anyone behind,” he told The New Daily. “I got a little bit nostalgic the other day thinking about bodyline bowling and the naughty British who were against the Aussie team. They said ‘listen, bowl at the body, forget the bloody stumps, bowl bodyline’. “Australian Bill Woodfull was batting and he got hit in the chest. The question is, was he was so badly hurt he had to leave? No, he didn’t. He was hit, hurt, but he batted on. “I think that is what we have to do. Because we’ll all be hit and we’ll all be hurt. “So are you going to the pavilion, or are you going to bat on? He batted on and it was magnificent. “We’re hit, hurt, but not out.” Instead of the usual Easter lunch, which the Father Bob Foundation has been putting on for 40 years, they are running a campaign to help end digital poverty. He says his foundation has seen a surge in people who can’t access internet at home – so this Easter he is giving out STEM kits for children alongside takeaway hot meals. “We’ve seen people outside public buildings trying to access internet. That’s real poverty. It breaks my heart. “We’re in the trenches. We’re listening to their heartbeat and we know they’re suffering in silence.” “For all Australians, religious or secular, the message of Easter offers the prefect reflection at this time. “When the stones rolled back, in the grand narrative of the Resurrection, Jesus was standing there, the women went to attend to embalming and they said, ‘Oh hello’. “And one thing lead to another, he probably said ‘G’day, mate’. And they would have said ‘G’day, mate’ back, and I think that is what we need to do. “Keeping in touch with one another no matter what. “It’s about spirituality, not religion. I don’t want people to think you need to go to church to worship. “The moon came out last night – magnificent! That’s a spiritual experience. It’s the same around here, in Albert Park —  you’ve got birds and trees. ,They’re reminders that this thing is bigger than all of us, the cosmos.” This Easter is different. And although we have never spent this time of year so distant from family and friends, connecting has never been easier, Father Bob said. “We’ve got technology, we’ve got iPhones. The message is: don’t leave anyone behind. “Especially the grumpy old uncle, who we say, ‘Oh bugger him’. Ring him up – briefly! – ring him briefly and just say, ‘Welfare check, comrade, g’day’ and then hang up. “That’s all you have to do.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Red Symons has a yen for what he cannot have: Hard rubbish Red Symons' aching yen for lost treasure of hard rubbish","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/04\/11\/red-symons-hard-rubbish\/","transcript":"What do you need? I was once in a milkbar on a Saturday night waiting behind a dishevelled man seeking cigarettes. “I’ll have a pack of Winfield Gold, thanks”, he said. “Winfield Yellow”, corrected the shopkeeper. “Nah. Gold thanks”, he insisted. It was once the case that cigarettes in gold boxes sold better on the weekend because they conferred status and success. What you thought you needed is surprisingly easily dispensed with. It turns out it’s not guns or toilet paper. At this point in time, the populace, stripped of the usual accoutrements of identity, are going to the supermarket in the clothes that they wear to lie on the couch watching television whilst occasionally venturing outside to put out the rubbish. I have seen them in their pyjamas. I once met a gentleman filling up at a petrol station and observed that his car looked expensive. “No”, he said, “Two hundred dollars down and the rest on summons.” He showed admirable detachment about his status and identity. That car, once worn to dress and impress, is now closeted at the kerb. I rode on a tram yesterday and it was like a stretch limousine. The driver was singularly devoted to achieving my destination and I had the entire passenger area to myself. I tipped my forelock to him as I disembarked and I suspect if I asked him to hover while I ducked into a shop for some Winfield Gold he would have happily complied. What do you need? Everyone has their own list and, as the days of lockdown accumulate, I wonder if our needs simplify and converge. The streets are increasingly filled with pop-down shops, empty shops that once sold things now no longer needed. Yesterday I saw one that, until recently, specialised in baby formula to be sent over the seas; no longer needed. A bookshop normally filled with moderately uninteresting books at heavily reduced prices was offering them at $50 a box. The box was free and could carry enough weight to require two people or a trolley. Is it time to read the books you already bought but have never read? The pace of pop-down shops is accelerating as need diminishes. What do I need? It once seemed to me that, along with news, traffic and weather, daily broadcasts should include notification as to which suburbs hard rubbish was available each day. To me, hard rubbish is like the specials at Aldi. Even if I have no use for it, it’s hard to resist at that price. I was warned off the idea of a broadcast notification because it’s not free for everyone. It’s baggsed by the council. Hard rubbish is yer objets trouvés. Just like Picasso’s bicycle seat and handle bars. There’s yer posh art, right there. I have spent some time in the centre of town amongst the canyons of apartments and from time to time noticed middens of belongings piled on the pavement. TVs, microwaves, beds and tables have been thrown out, perhaps by the landlord uncomfortable with the 20 people he found living in a two bedroom apartment, I may be wrong but it’s hard to resist creating an imaginary narrative to explain the world. I recently walked past a pile of hard rubble on which was a rusting bike. Interested, I squeezed the tires and found them firm and inflated. Without a helmet, I rode\/pushed it home. One of my sons, recognising my penchant, came home with a No Parking sign complete with pole. “Yes,” I agreed, “ It could come in handy.” At my retreat, I have taken possession of a giant padlock, a giant match and a giant pair of jeans. I like things that are not to scale and I can’t remember where they came from. I have twice recently seen superheroes in the hard rubbish. This is not a hallucination. It is not an unconscious need for the world to be set to rights nor an abandonment of earlier hopes. I can draw no meaning from it. I feel compelled to provide documentation. I saw a pair of calipers discarded on the street yesterday. There is no narrative thread that I can concoct to explain this. They were available but maybe I would catch what had finished off the previous owner? A genuine regret about the current lockdown is that I must also isolate myself from other people’s discarded things. Hard rubbish has become the forbidden midden."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'He's at it again': Health authorities probe chef Pete Evans' anti-COVID quack machine | The New Daily 'He's at it again': Doctors rip Pete Evans' anti-CORVID quack machine","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/04\/11\/pete-evans-anti-corvid-quack-machine-slammed\/","transcript":"The Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) has announced an investigation into a $14,990 device spruiked by celebrity chef Pete Evans as a treatment for the coronavirus. Evans shared an Instagram video, since taken down, discussing the BioCharger NG — a “hybrid subtle energy revitalisation platform” which claims to “optimise and improve potential health, wellness and athletic performance”. It is listed under the lifestyle products section of Evans’s website and claims to replicate light, frequencies, harmonics, pulsed electromagnetic fields and voltage that are found in nature. The My Kitchen Rules judge said he used the device most days and claimed it could help with the coronavirus, which has been responsible for 55 deaths in Australia and more than 95,000 overseas. “It’s programmed with a thousand different recipes and there’s a couple in there for the Wuhan coronavirus,” Evans said in the video. The TGA said it would investigate the product, warning that advertising of therapeutic goods needed to meet certain requirements. “The TGA will investigate the product you have referred and take action in relation to any illegal advertising of therapeutic products, including advertising on social media,” a Department of Health spokesman said in a statement. “The TGA is monitoring non-compliance, particularly in relation to the advertising of products that claim to prevent or cure COVID-19.” The creators of the BioCharger NG, Advanced Biotechnologies, released a statement distancing themselves from Evans’s claims. The Massachusetts-based company reiterated a disclaimer on the product’s website that “the BioCharger NG is not a medical device” and is not intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases or any other conditions. “Recent coverage points to the BioCharger as a cure or treatment to the novel coronavirus,” the company said in the statement. “The BioCharger is not a medical device, and for that reason, Advanced Biotechnologies suggest that anyone seek medical attention from their primary care provider if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and all other diseases, infections and ailments; and follow guidelines put in place by your local governments including social distancing, strong personal hygiene, and contacting your primary care provider when experiencing any symptoms. “BioCharger NG supplies through sales contract and influencer guidelines to urge owners, users, and promoters of the BioCharger NG to exercise their best judgement when speaking about the BioCharger NG, and above all else — to not make claims.” Australian Medical Association ACT president Antonio Di Dio told the ABC he had “significant concern about any person promoting a product which claims to be curative of COVID-19”. “I can say with some confidence that there are 220-odd countries around the world which have absolutely no cure for the COVID-19 virus and scientists around the world are desperately looking for a vaccine or for a cure and there is none,” he said. “If Mr Evans is promoting a product which claims to be curative of the virus, he is quite simply, very wrong.” Dr Di Dio said an investigation was within the TGA’s remit, but said it was disappointing its time and resources needed to be diverted at this time. “If he is claiming he has a product, whether it’s cheap or expensive … is going to cure COVID-19 then it should be fully investigated and if it is demonstrated to have absolutely no evidence supporting its curative claims, then all of the appropriate apologies should occur,” he said. “It’s very disappointing it’s taking time and energy away from the people who should be devoting their time and energy to the scientific pursuit of the cure of this disease.” Dr Di Dio’s comments came after the association hit out at the “fancy light machine” on social media. “This guy just doesn’t get it. Pete Evans is trying to sell a $15,000 fancy light machine to vulnerable and frightened people to protect them against #COVID-19,” the association said on Twitter. “He is not a doctor. He is not a scientist. He is a chef.” Harry Nespolon, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, also criticised Evans’ claims. “A few months ago I advised anti-vaxxer\/celebrity chef Pete Evans that he should stick to talking about ‘activated almonds’ and leave vaccinations alone,” Dr Nespolon wrote on Twitter. “He’s at it again, [t]his time on #COVD-19 and he needs to stop.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"More than $600,000 in Qld COVID-19 lockdown fines","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/queensland\/2020\/04\/11\/covid-19-fines-windfall-queensland\/","transcript":"Queensland police have issued more than 460 fines for coronavirus-related transgressions, raking in more than half a million dollars for the state government. Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll says the majority of people have been compliant, while officers have shown compassion before issuing a $1334 fine. “However, we have issued over 400 penalty infringement notices,” Ms Carroll said on Saturday. “Most people are doing the right thing but if there is blatant disregard, and there have been many examples of that, people will be issued with an infringement notice.” In total 462 infringement notices have been issued, raising $616,308. Police have also been patrolling the NSW border and vehicles travelling southbound on the M1 to the Gold Coast after tighter restrictions came into force overnight. The new 14-day isolation period for Queenslanders means those returning to the state will require a new pass and exemptions to strict coronavirus regulations to get home. Previous passes issued by the state government have been voided. Queenslanders entering the state must have an amber or red pass, the latter indicating they are returning from one of the 13 COVID-19 hot spots declared by the state government. Exemptions apply for freight and commercial vehicles. “There has been a dramatic change and every individual must have a pass,” Ms Carroll said. “If you have a red pass, as has happened to two people, you will be put into self-isolation.” She said from her experience, having driven past the Gold Coast beachfront on Saturday morning, people were adhering to social distancing rules. Three beaches were closed on the Gold Coast, at Coolangatta, The Spit and Surfers Paradise, which were being policed both physically and through the use of drones. “People are out there going for a swim or having that walk but we are not seeing people loitering, lingering or hanging around in groups,” she said The Gold Coast District Chief Superintendent Mark Wheeler said they had intercepted 200 vehicles heading south on the M1. “We have been very targeted with our interceptions … and we have had to turn 11 vehicles around containing 19 people.

The passengers were allowed to evacuate via a humanitarian sanitary corridor, a DFAT spokesperson said. Aurora Expeditions, the operator of the Greg Mortimer ship, has chartered an evacuation flight from the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. The company will foot the bill for the cost of the flight. It is scheduled to leave on Saturday morning (local time) and arrive in Melbourne on Sunday, with passengers to go into 14 days of isolation in a hotel. The ship’s operator confirmed this week 128 of 217 people on board, nearly 60 per cent, had tested positive for the coronavirus but all were asymptomatic. “Our priority remains getting everyone on board disembarked as soon and as safely as possible,” an Aurora Expeditions spokesman said in a statement. “It has been a very harrowing time for all involved.” Victoria’s Deputy Chief Health Officer Annaliese van Diemen said the flight would be met by medical staff and ambulances, and anybody who needed to be tested would be. “Everybody who needs to go to hospital will go to hospital and the remaining passengers will go into quarantine in hotels,” Dr van Diemen said. Kiwi passengers will undergo medical assessments before being transferred directly to a charter flight to New Zealand. However, the Foreign Affairs Department told AAP on Friday five Australians had been evacuated from the Greg Mortimer and hospitalised in Montevideo. Foreign minister Marise Payne said the support of the Uruguayan government was “indispensable”. “Uruguay’s pragmatic and compassionate approach has helped us bring about a solution for these passengers, including those who have had to be hospitalised,” Senator Payne said. Uruguay had originally refused to let passengers off the cruise ship but later sent medical teams on board and monitored the situation via WhatsApp. Most of the ill crew and passengers have mild symptoms and are stable, Uruguay public health ministry director-general Karina Rando said. “We have intensive care beds, doctors are available and we are not putting the care of our population at risk,” Ms Rando told the Associated Press. “We have the logistical and professional capacity to serve these people.” A sign hanging from a balcony on the ship said “Thank you, Uruguay”. The Greg Mortimer departed on March 15 on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia but has been docked off the coast of Montevideo since March 27. The evacuated passengers, comprising 96 Australians and 16 New Zealanders, will be repatriated using a “humanitarian corridor” with strict biosecurity measures. They will be driven in four buses to Montevideo’s Carrasco airport escorted by police and have their luggage disinfected prior to boarding. A refitted plane operated by charter airline Hi Fly will take them to Melbourne. Medical personnel would also accompany them on the repatriation flight, with the company footing the bill for the journey under insurance. “The plane will be set up into risk zones, with passengers seated by test results and level of care required by the passenger,” Aurora Expeditions said. The New Zealand government plans to reach out to its citizens directly to organise a transfer upon arrival in Australia, Aurora Expeditions said.

Police said they received multiple triple-0 calls after the fire erupted in Biggera Waters about 1:30am and when they arrived, one of the units was already engulfed in flames. Senior Sergeant Brett Macgibbon said officers had evacuated residents from neighbouring units but had been unable to find the missing pair. “The fire was very extensive at that stage and police were unable unfortunately to get into the unit,” he said. “The fire was just horrendous when we’ve arrived — massive flames coming out of all the windows, neighbours were actually giving us ladders to try and convince us to go in. “However it was just extremely dangerous and no-one could have gone into that unit.” Forensic testing will be carried out to confirm their identity. Police said a man aged in his 40s was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said six crews were needed to contain the blaze. Half of the eight units at the complex sustained severe structural damage. QFES Inspector Kerry Cumner said the extent of the fire had made evacuations and fighting the fire extremely challenging. “We gained external access reasonably quick, but we had a bit of trouble gaining internal access to start working back to the seat of the fire,” Inspector Cumner said. “Because of how involved the fire was … at this stage we’ve been unable to ascertain where the fire could have started.” Investigations into the cause of the fire are continuing Senior Sergeant Macgibbon said a crime scene had been declared. He said damage to the structure of the building had made it difficult for the police investigation. “The roof we believe is asbestos as well, which is going to be an ongoing issue … for investigators as we go forward,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Toughest of times': NSW confirms latest virus death | The New Daily","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/11\/national-coronavirus-toll\/","transcript":"A person has died after contracting coronavirus in NSW, health authorities have confirmed, taking the total death toll in the state to 23. The national toll now stands at 56. Health Minister Brad Hazzard expressed his condolences to the family on behalf of the community and the state government. “It doesn’t matter what the time, it is always tough when a family member passes away, and this is the toughest of times,” he said. Mr Hazzard confirmed 44 new cases of coronavirus, taking the total number in NSW to 2,857. A Victorian man in his 80s has died in hospital overnight, taking the state’s death toll from coronavirus to 14. The state’s tally of cases has risen by 24 since yesterday.

Most seem to have heeded the advice and are having a quiet Easter. The state’s chief medical officer has urged people to honour social distancing rules to fend off an expected increase in coronavirus cases. Usually busy long-weekend holiday spots are largely empty in a sign that most people are heeding the message, but Victoria Police have issued 183 fines to those flouting the rules in the 24 hours to 11am on Saturday. Officers have conducted nearly 20,000 spot checks since March 21 at homes, businesses and non-essential services. Among those police fined were four women caught partying at a short-term rental property and seven mates drinking at a school. Multiple people were fined over gatherings at their homes. Australians returning from overseas on Friday evening will be required to quarantine in hotels and other accommodation provided by the Victorian government, Chief Medical Officer Brett Sutton says. People experiencing homelessness can access health care and accommodation at Anglicare Victoria, Brotherhood of St Laurence, Sacred Heart Mission and VincentCare Victoria. Victoria Police are on a five-day operation enforcing safety on the state’s roads over Easter and have the added task of nabbing non-essential travellers. Victorians are only meant to leave their homes for essential travel, including to buy food and to exercise under the stage three rules. Queensland’s coronavirus tally has crept ever so slowly towards 1000 after another nine people were diagnosed with the coronavirus overnight. Health Minister Steven Miles says just 77 people in the past seven days have tested positive to coronavirus in Queensland. The state’s toll sits at 974, with 28 patients in hospital, including 12 in intensive care. “We did 2149 tests overnight, considering that number of positive is just nine, that is a positive testing rate of just 0.42 over the last 24 hours, incredibly low by global standards,” Mr Miles said. “That is because of our social distancing efforts, they are working. We need to keep them up.” Mr Miles said about a third of those who had contracted the virus in Queensland have recovered. He also said restrictions are likely to be reviewed at the end of of the month. Tasmania has recorded 11 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state’s total to 122. With 52 people having recovered, there are 70 positive cases in the state currently. Premier Peter Gutwein said there is an outbreak on Tasmania’s north-west coast. “We have a vulnerable community, an older community, a community that has in certain parts of its population more examples of underlying health challenges and other difficulties that people face,” he said at a press conference today. “That is one of the reasons why we have been so strident in the position that we have taken in terms of ensuring that people follow the rules. “We want to protect the most vulnerable Tasmanians, and it is important that we all play our part to do that.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Look after each other': It's time we followed Fred Hollow's motto","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/11\/coronavirus-fred-hollows\/","transcript":"As the world fights the deadly new coronavirus, we mourn those lost, applaud those fighting on the front line and stay home for those who can’t. Amongst the grief and chaos there have been beautiful bursts of creativity, as plays, music and dance all move online. Across the world coffee catch-ups are shared over Zoom, laughter over Skype and Easter is celebrated through social media. In the early 1990s, one of Australia’s greatest humanitarians Professor Fred Hollows delivered one of his most enduring quotes: “I believe the basic attribute of mankind is to look after each other.” To remind us that although we have never been so distant, we are more connected than ever, the Fred Hollows Foundation’s founding director Gabi Hollows has started a campaign urging all of us to look out for each other. Mrs Hollows told The New Daily that message from 30 years ago, is now more important than ever. “This has been an incredibly tough year and I know that countless people are going through enormous challenges and uncertainties,” Mrs Hollows said, on what would have been Fred’s 91st birthday week. “While many things are out of our control right now, we can still control how we treat each other, especially the most vulnerable among us – locally, and around the world, in big and small ways. “I loved that Fred was forever optimistic about the humanitarian nature of everyday people. You don’t need to be extraordinary to make a difference. “To everyone in Australia and around the world: caring for other people is what being human is all about, so please, be like Fred and look after each other.” Mrs Hollows hailed the many eye surgeons, nurses and community health workers trained by Across the world, staff trained by the foundation have joined efforts to fight COVID-19 – in countries like Kenya, China, Vietnam, Pakistan, Myanmar and the Philippines eye surgeons are are being re-deployed to other areas of hospitals to help. “Our frontline workers are amazingly resilient and brave. I thank them for their contribution in the face of this unprecedented health crisis,” Gabi said. “Fred never did medicine to make money, he did it because it was useful, and I know our wonderful eye health workers are driven by the same humanitarian values. “And for those who aren’t on the front lines, we can all play our part.

The two NASA astronauts say they expect it will be tough returning to such a drastically changed world next week, after more than half a year aboard the International Space Station. Mr Morgan and Ms Meir held a press conference from the space station on Friday (local time), joined by Christopher Cassidy, who just arrived on the space station the previous day. Unsurprisinly, the coronavirus dominated the questions they received. Mr Morgan said the crew has tried to keep atop the pandemic news. But it’s hard to comprehend what’s really going on and what to expect, he noted, when his nine-month mission ends next Friday (local time). “It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,” said Jessica Meir, who took part in the first all-female spacewalk in October. “We can tell you that the Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it’s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place since both of us have been up here.” As an emergency physician in the Army, Mr Morgan said he feels a little guilty coming back midway through the medical crisis. “It’s very hard to fathom,” Mr Morgan told reporters. Ms Meir said it will be difficult not being able to hug family and friends, after seven months off the planet. She anticipates feeling even more isolated on Earth than in space. “We’re so busy with so many other amazing pursuits and we have this incredible vantage point of the Earth below, that we don’t really feel as much of that isolation,” Ms Meir said. “So we’ll see how it goes and how I adjust. “But it will, of course, be wonderful to see some family and friends, at least virtually and from a distance for now.” Mr Morgan flew to the space station last July, and Ms Meir last September. They will return in a Soyuz capsule with Russian Oleg Skripochka, landing in Kazakhstan. Their departure will leave three astronauts, who arrived Thursday, on board. The three will return exactly 50 years after the Apollo 13 astronauts splashed down in the Pacific. An oxygen tank explosion aborted the moon-landing mission. “Once again, now there’s a crisis and the crisis is on Earth,” Mr Morgan said. Mr Cassidy, the space station’s new arrival, experienced how different things were on Earth before arriving on the space station Thursday. It’s Mr Cassidy’s third spaceflight and he said the launch was perfect and that “it never gets old.” But his family, and many others, couldn’t attend the launch. As usual for astronauts before a launch, he spent two weeks in quarantine. “We knew we would be in quarantine, but we didn’t know the rest of the world would join us,” he said. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"AFP considers expelling 14 recruits for flouting social-distancing rules","date":"04-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/11\/afp-college-party\/","transcript":"More than a dozen Australian Federal Police (AFP) recruits could be expelled for breaching social distancing rules at a late-night party held at their residential college in Canberra. Several AFP sources with knowledge of the incident, on Friday night last week, said some members of the cadet group reacted badly when confronted by ACT Police about their actions. “An unknown number of them abused a female staff member and a superintendent when they were told to quiet down,” a college employee said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “[I’d] expect a few of them to get sacked, as the AFP will want to be seen to be tough as they don’t like bad publicity and the rest of them will be given severe warnings.” The trainees who attended last weekend’s noisy gathering in apparent breach of strict coronavirus regulations are enrolled in a course for prospective protective services officers. Another AFP figure, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak publicly, said 14 recruits had been given show cause notices as to why they shouldn’t be kicked out of the college. “The recruits in question were from two courses that had passed their firearms training that day,” the AFP member said. “The investigation is hush-hush at the moment, but they have now made the college alcohol free.” Last week the AFP confirmed it had launched an investigation into the incident, but since then it has declined to answer detailed questions. “We have no further comment to provide to you at this time,” an AFP spokesperson said. ]Trainees who are under investigation claim their AFP superiors had indicated they did not need to isolate from each other, given they live and train together. “The recruits had every right to think they could party together,” a college insider said. “They are being told they are in a training bubble and the social distancing rules don’t apply to them.” Last week Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter said he expected AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw to act swiftly on the matter. “It sounds like that should definitely be a matter of disciplinary proceedings for the Commissioner with his recruits, which I am sure he’ll engage in in a robust fashion,” Mr Porter said on Monday.

The High Court’s decision has prompted calls for court transcripts of Victorian sex offence cases to be made public, in a bid to promote greater transparency. “I have just spent 13 months in jail for a crime I didn’t commit, one disappointment after another,” Cardinal Pell wrote. “From many points of view the crisis is also bad for the Catholic Church, but we have painfully cut out a moral cancer and this is good,” he said.

They will undergo a final health check before they are allowed to leave for their homes around the country. Police are overseeing the departures, assisted by health authorities, the Australian Defence Force and hotel staff. Coaches will run to Sydney’s airport throughout the day, but some won’t be able to return to their home states on Saturday due to flight schedules. “The remaining travellers are being assisted with alternate arrangements, as required,” police said in a statement on Saturday. “The operation will run each day as returned travellers continue to complete their mandatory quarantines and depart hotels across Sydney CBD.” The NSW health minister issued an order directing all overseas arrivals to go directly to a quarantine facility from March 29 to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

Strict social distancing regulations have enabled transmission rates to drop to one person causing one or two infections rather than the scenario of one person leading to 400 cases. However the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned overnight Friday that lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a “deadly resurgence” of COVID-19. Some badly hit countries, like Spain, are considering a gradual resumption of normal life but WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it must be carefully balanced against the risk of a second wave of infections. “The WHO wants to see restrictions lifted as much as anyone,” Dr Tedros said. “At the same time, lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to deadly resurgence. The way down can be as deadly as the way up if not managed properly.” The warning comes as Australians were urged not to relax their social distancing behaviours over the Easter long weekend and to stay at home and adhere to the rules. Under the current regulation regime, deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said Australia could be close to seeing the epidemic die out. “Ideally, where you want to be is below one…person being infected, after a person themselves had the infection,” he said. “Once you get to that point, the virus dies out or the epidemic dies out. At the moment, we’re probably on the cusp of that in Australia. “Whether that’s where we’re going to be in several weeks’ or months’ time remains to be seen. But at the moment, we’re certainly not anywhere near five.” The nation’s daily increase in cases fell below 100 on Thursday for the first time in three weeks. More than 6200 people in Australia have contracted coronavirus with 54 deaths – including the latest deaths in NSW, Victoria and Tasmania. More than 1.6 million people around the globe have been infected, according to the John Hopkins University count. But the true number of lives lost is believed be much higher because of limited testing, cover-ups by some governments and different counting practices. Italy leads the death toll with more than 18,000 while the USA is on track to overtake Italy, followed by Spain. More than 40 per cent of the dead in the US were in New York state. Britain recorded 980 new deaths, its highest daily total, for close to 9000 in all, health secretary Matt Hancock announced on Friday local time. In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a three-week extension of lockdown as helicopters and drones were deployed to make sure residents didn’t slip out of their homes over Easter. But Spain has decided to allow factories and construction sites to resume work on Monday, while schools, most shops and offices will remain closed.

The death toll rose by 980 to 8958, health minister Matt Hancock said, its biggest daily rise to date. The toll exceeded the deadliest day reported by Italy on March 28, the country worst hit by the coronavirus. Mr Hancock urged Britons not to leave their homes over the Easter holidays, during which hot weather is expected. “This Easter will be another test of the nation’s resolve,” he said at a news conference in Downing Street on Friday (local time). Mr Hancock confirmed the prime minister’s health was improving after leaving a three-night spell of intensive care on Thursday. Mr Johnson, who is being treated for COVID-19, is now able to take short walks between periods of rest, as part of the care he was receiving. “He has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care,” a spokesman said. His spokesman said his recovery was only just beginning and he would take advice from his medical team. “I was told he was waving his thanks to all of the nurses and doctors he saw as he was moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward,” the spokesman said. “The hospital said that he was in extremely good spirits last night.” The prime minister’s rapid health decline shook the country earlier this week when he was admitted to the hospital on Sunday after his symptoms persisted. “He must rest up,” his father, Stanley Johnson, told BBC radio. “You cannot walk away from this and go straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.” Mr Johnson’s pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who has also had coronavirus symptoms, tweeted a rainbow picture – in support of healthcare workers – along with hand-clapping emojis."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"The Ferguson Report: Bishop becomes a pawn of the COVidiots | The New Daily Tim Ferguson coronavirus","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/10\/the-ferguson-report-scientific-facts-attracting-a-world-of-debate\/","transcript":"ANTI-FACTS ARE BECOMING INFECTIOUS An anti-vaccination activist has declared the coronavirus is an endangered species that deserves to live.

The Australian’s Newspoll, Guardian Australia’s Essential Poll, and the non-aligned Roy Morgan poll all reported huge turnarounds in voter satisfaction with the performance of the Prime Minister and his government compared with earlier this year. Roy Morgan poll tracked a whopping 22 per cent increase in just one week in the number of Australians who agreed the Australian government was handling the coronavirus pandemic well, reaching a total of 65 per cent. The number who disagreed with this statement decreased by 20 percentage points to 29 per cent. Newspoll asked about the combined effort of the federal and state governments in tackling COVID-19, finding a healthy bump over the past three weeks in voter satisfaction with the governments’ performance in managing the impact on the economy (up 14 points to 47 per cent), preparing the public health system to cope (up 8 points to 59 per cent) and informing Australians about how to protect themselves (up 10 points to 75 per cent).

The Essential Poll found a similar movement in voter satisfaction with the performance of the PM, increasing 18 points over the past month to 59 per cent. These numbers indicate Mr Morrison has indeed learned from his disastrous bushfire experience. In times of national emergency, voters look to their leaders to step up, take responsibility, and lead in the nation’s best interest.

How to keep a cool head in a crisis.#howgoodishawaii pic.twitter.com\/9g8GKlM1eD — Sir Moosie (@Supermoosie) March 9, 2020 By rebadging an existing committee of the nation’s leaders, the Council of Australian Governments (or COAG), as a national cabinet, the PM did what he probably should have done during the fires – showed and shared leadership by creating a way to coordinate effort and short circuit the border and boundary debates. Yes, it would have made a lot of sense to include his opposition counterpart, Labor leader Anthony Albanese, in the tent. But according to a detailed background piece on the national cabinet’s formation by Guardian Australia, it was the state premiers who insisted that opposition leaders be excluded. Mr Morrison can take a little credit and at least some comfort from these glowing opinion poll numbers. The keen student and practitioner of political strategy has, at least on this occasion, shown to be a capable apprentice to his mage, John Howard. But as a long-time political strategist, the PM would also know that his opinion poll boost is at least partly a common knee-jerk reaction by voters during times of national emergency. When the community feels threatened, anxious or stressed about a common enemy, its citizens will tend to think more favourably of its leaders, as long as they prove to be at-least half-competent at protecting the community. I didn’t think in Feb 2009  I’d face a global collapse & nor did I think that the Liberals would put political self interest ahead of the national interest & vote twice against stimulus to stop a recession #auspol https:\/\/t.co\/aVzf6kFEwN — Wayne Swan (@SwannyQLD) April 8, 2020 It should be said that this doesn’t always happen, as we saw with Tony Abbott’s various flag-festooned attempts to create ‘national security emergencies’ during his short tenure as PM, and Mr Morrison’s bungled efforts during the bushfires. Glancing outside Australia’s borders, many of the at-least half-competent national leaders have also benefited from opinion poll boosts in recent times. In some cases, even their opposition counterparts have benefited from such voter goodwill – satisfaction in the performance of Labor’s Mr Albanese increased by a few points in both the latest Newspoll and Essential Poll. So what does this all mean? Will this virus-induced honeymoon last for Mr Morrison right up to the next federal election? It’s impossible to say, but it is clear that Labor has its work cut out. Mr Albanese (or any other opposition leader) is hardly in a position to argue “this reckless spending must stop!” as Kevin Rudd so emphatically claimed last decade. Labor is also unable to leverage its traditional strengths – health and education – while Coalition and Labor governments work together on the twin economic and health challenges created by COVID-19. The Morrison government has even managed to make Labor irrelevant on workers’ issues, by striking deals directly with the union movement and bypassing the opposition altogether. This essentially leaves the federal opposition with little to work with other than the Coalition debacles and disasters that were hot topics before the coronavirus, but which now seem petty and puerile in comparison. While these issues will continue to roil through the increasingly fetid chambers of #auspol on Twitter, they have lost much significance – if they ever had any – with everyday Australians. Mr Morrison’s future is not written in this week’s opinion polls, but in his ability to retain voter support when he finally has to start turning off the cashflow. Labor’s future will be determined by a no-less tricky proposition – getting the balance right between non-partisan cooperation, constructive criticism and political attacks."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"JobKeeper: Who is eligible?

Up to six million workers are expected to access the fortnightly payments – including many who were stood down after the first wave of economic havoc. With the ink still drying on the legislation, The New Daily explains who will benefit and how much they will receive. Workers must have been employed on March 1 to qualify for JobKeeper. Full-time and part-time workers are eligible for the scheme. As are casual workers who have worked for their employer for at least 12 months – and sole traders who have lost, or are likely to lose, 30 per cent of turnover as a result of COVID-19. To be eligible, employees must also be one of the following: Then there’s an additional condition for employers. Businesses – including private-sector companies, partnerships, trusts and not-for profits – must have lost at least 30 per cent of revenue compared to this time last year. For businesses that rake in more than $1 billion in turnover, that benchmark is raised to a 50 per cent reduction in revenue. Registered charities also qualify if their turnover has dropped by 15 per cent. The Morrison government will pay eligible businesses a wage subsidy of $1500 a fortnight for every worker they keep employed during the crisis. Employers will then be legally obliged to pass this on to workers – although it won’t affect everyone’s pay cheques. If you normally earn more than $1500 a fortnight, there will be no difference to your pay if you keep working your regular hours. The money will go to your boss to subsidise your normal salary. But if you normally earn less than that – or are stood down or have your hours cut because of the coronavirus – then you will be paid the full $1500 a fortnight. (The same goes for employees who were let go after March 1 and later re-hired.) This means some workers – especially part-timers – will receive a pay rise under the measure. Either way, it is designed to keep you employed. JobKeeper payments are taxable, as they are paid by employers, rather than the government. But the unemployment benefit JobSeeker is tax-free, with those already on income support now eligible for an additional coronavirus supplement of $550 a fortnight. As for superannuation, employers will only need to pay it on top-up payments above the $1500 threshold. If an employee’s pay falls below the $1500 threshold, the employer is under no obligation to pay superannuation. Under the legislation, employers will start receiving monthly subsidies from the Australian Tax Office from the first week of May. But payments will be backdated to March 30. Scott Morrison has urged the near-750,000 businesses that have applied for the scheme to begin paying their staff under their existing payroll systems and claim that money back from the ATO. However, many businesses forced to shut down following lockdown restrictions – including cinemas, gyms and pubs – may not deliver payments until the start of May given their lack of turnover. Workers do not have to keep working to receive the payment. As discussed earlier, if there’s no work available as a result of the coronavirus, employees will receive the fortnightly payment of $1500 before tax. If they continue working their normal hours, the money will subsidise their normal wage. But if the coronavirus means there is less work than usual, employers are allowed to reduce or modify their workers’ hours to bring their pro-rata pay in line with the subsidy. Eligible employers can direct staff to take annual leave under amendments to the Fair Work Act that were passed at the same time as the JobKeeper legislation. The wage subsidy can be used to subsidise holiday pay. However, arrangements must be agreed by mutual consent between employers and workers, and cannot leave staff with less than two weeks’ leave in their balance."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"ASX200: Coronavirus offers buying opportunity for sharemarket investors","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/markets-and-shares\/2020\/04\/10\/coronavirus-stock-markets\/","transcript":"Ordinary Australians have turned the coronavirus crisis into a savvy investing opportunity, displaying impressive insight by jumping into sharemarkets and snapping up bargains. Retail investors – everyday Australians with some money in the sharemarket – have taken full advantage of the ASX’s recent losses. For many, the allure of the market’s more recent gains are enough to offset the inherent risks attached to sharemarket investing. Gemma Dale, director of SMSFs and investor behaviour at nabtrade (the stockbroking arm of NAB), said existing investor trade volumes have doubled in the past four to eight weeks. And there’s no shortage of new money. Ms Dale told The New Daily applications for trading accounts have increased five times since the virus sent markets into a tailspin. “We’re not seeing the kind of panic selling that people tell you is going to occur – we’ve actually seen the exact opposite,” she said. More promisingly, that sudden influx of money has been very targeted, with retail investors focusing on big-name businesses that normally trade for much higher prices. “There’s been a real swing to quality; we’re not seeing speculative small-cap buying.” Rather than taking a punt on small caps [lesser-known, low-value businesses], retail investors have turned their attention towards well-known businesses that took a hit when markets started selling off earlier in the year. A surprising pick proving that point is Qantas, which Ms Dale said has seen a lot of interest from investors despite suffering big losses due to the government’s travel bans. Investors believe the national carrier is too big and important for the government to let it collapse, Ms Dale said. And with oil prices falling to 18-year lows, airlines are theoretically able to lock in lower fuel costs – their second-largest expense after staffing – to improve profit margins for the next two years. All of that is speculation however, and Qantas investors may yet face further pain. Meanwhile, CMC Markets head of trading sales for Asia-Pacific Ash Glove said Australia’s big four banks have also been major beneficiaries of the swing to quality. A mere ten years on from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), that kind of behaviour makes sense, Mr Glover said. “Investors have seen this before – the GFC is still fresh in everyone’s minds,” he said. “I think they’ve seen that the whole ‘buy-the-dip’ mentality has played out very well for longer-term investors.” ‘Buying the dip’ refers to purchasing shares after their price has fallen, on the assumption their value will recover and increase over time. Big-name ‘blue-chip’ stocks aren’t the only opportunities to capture investors’ imaginations, though. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also enjoying a moment in the sun – with nabtrade’s Ms Dale noting that one Australian ETF had seen sales volumes increase 20 times over in the past month or so. These products work like normal investment funds, but the units held by individual investors can be bought and sold on stock exchanges. Aleks Vynokur, chief executive of ETF manufacturer BetaShares, told The New Daily the sector has seen a sizeable increase in interest from mum and dad investors. Funds focused on big-name companies and financial institutions have naturally been the target of much of that, but Australian technology businesses have also proven popular. “Technology got sold off alongside some of the other industries that got sold off for good reason – for example travel and real estate,” he said. Now, some investors suspect the baby was thrown out with the bathwater and have since jumped at what they see as an opportunity to buy strong stocks at heavily discounted prices. The million-dollar question for other retail investors is whether to join in and snap up bargains. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is complicated and based on personal circumstances. Investing always comes with risk, and not every business that looks like a bargain will turn out that way. Would-be investors need to work out how much money they can afford to lose, understand why they want to invest, and create a plan and a portfolio catered to their own needs. And anyone who chooses to invest now should be prepared for further losses in the months ahead. AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said it’s still too early to know whether or not sharemarkets have hit the bottom of this crisis yet. “There is still a lot of bad news to come,” he warned. “But increasing policy support against the backdrop of increasingly positive signs that suppression is working and it may be possible to relax lockdowns in the next month or so are positive signs that we have seen the low or have come close to the low.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: World Health Organisation's guide to home care","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/04\/10\/coronavirus-home-care-how\/","transcript":"Australia has recorded more than 6000 cases of COVID-19, with most mild and being treated at home. Still, this means that family members and housemates who have taken on a carer role are in the frontline of defence against the spread of the disease. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has published detailed advice on how to care for a patient at home, and how to manage contacts. We advise it is well worth downloading because online advice from state governments tend to cover the basics in a few bullet points that lack practical detail. Firstly though, WHO advises that “if and where feasible, a trained (health care worker) should conduct an assessment to verify whether the residential setting is suitable for providing care”. The health care worker should also “assess whether the patient and the family are capable of adhering to the precautions that will be recommended as part of home care isolation (e.g., hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, environmental cleaning, limitations on movement around or from the house) and can address safety concerns (e.g., accidental ingestion of and fire hazards associated with using alcohol-based hand rubs).” It’s unclear to what extent this monitoring of home-bound patients and the quality of their care is occurring in Australia. Dr Chris Moy is a GP in Adelaide and chair of the AMA ethics and medicolegal committee. He said some states were doing better than others, and that a standard national playbook would have served the community better than what appears to be an ad hoc response from state to state. “The variation across states in how positive COVID patients who require self isolation are assessed and supported is another example of on the ground practical strategies that would have been better addressed on a consistent level nationally by a National Centre for Disease Control,” Dr Moy said. “Although it must be acknowledged that we have done well so far, there has still been a significant degree of inconsistency, confusion and duplication of basic strategies between states which would have been better addressed if everyone had a single playbook to work from instead of having to make it up as we have gone along.” Dr Moy suggested that SA Health appears to adhere closest to the WHO guidelines. The health department has enlisted a group of specialist GPs to assess patients’ circumstances and suitability for home care via telephone consultations. Team leader Dr Jenny Goold told The New Daily: “Initially the assessment is really about are they well enough to be home at that time. Then we do a series of medical checks. What symptoms did they start with? What have they got now? “We also explore their home situation. We have a template that we work off: Where do they live? Are they living in an at-risk place such as a nursing home or boarding house? Who else lives with them? “Are their any particular vulnerable individuals living with them, such as someone undergoing chemotherapy or particularly elderly people. Do they have their own bedroom? A separate bathroom. Sometimes we find it’s not suitable for them to stay at home because of their home environment.” A medical surveillance unit then work to get those patients relocated, sometimes to a hotel or other alternative accommodation. For those remaining at home, Dr Goold’s team then establishes what social and psychological support the patient requires. An email from the Department of Health and Human Services Victoria, responding to questions, said, “GPs and other healthcare workers assess if patients have access to suitable home care if they are diagnosed with coronavirus. “People who test positive for coronavirus and remain at home are contacted daily by DHHS, and are not allowed to end self-isolation before a number of criteria have been met to ensure they are no longer infectious.” According to the WHO document, maintenance of hygiene protocols tends to be the most demanding aspect caring for someone at home.  So if you’re taking on the carer role, and it’s advised that one person in the home take on this role, this is some of what you’re in for:"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Dr John Hewson’s economic vision post-coronavirus","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/10\/coronavirus-john-hewson-morrison\/","transcript":"Former Liberal leader John Hewson says Prime Minister Scott Morrison  has a chance to reset his leadership and establish a post-coronavirus commission to provide a new economic vision for Australia. Dr Hewson believes infrastructure, clean industries and new technology should be a priority, while a revamped tax system should ensure big companies are assessed on revenue not profits – ensuring they pay their fair share. The man who led the Liberals from 1990 to 1994, losing an election while advocating a GST, says Australia has been stunted by ideological battles for “two or three decades” and believes “somebody in the government has got to stand up and lead”. Having urged greater action post-COVID-19 on climate change as part of his role as honorary professor at the ANU’s Crawford School of Public Policy, Dr Hewson says the government had been “caught short” on drought, bushfires – and now the pandemic. He says the PM needs to proactively seek a new way forward that promotes new infrastructure, regional relationships, proper governance and the industries of the future. “Now, Morrison could do this on the basis that, ‘well, look … in terms of the pandemic, we got caught short and I’m not going to get caught short anymore’, and they can try and bury his past on bushfires and droughts and so on,” Dr Hewson said. With the pandemic showing the opportunities for working from home, finishing off the NBN could be a priority, along with investing in roads,  rail, clean energy and major water projects. “It’s probably not too late to say what do we need to do to build it [the NBN] up to what it should be? Many people are going to do so much more on the basis of technology, and you’re going to see that in the business community. “[Ensuring] Internet infrastructure capability is really there and can do what you want it to do … these are obvious things that you can go around and look at a lot of the infrastructure, which is in poor shape. “And you’d have to say some of our aged care and many of our hospitals, a lot of our schools … roads and rail and all those other traditional infrastructure projects. Water is a big one. There are big projects around now to bring water down from the north.” Asked if a post-virus summit with community leaders could help set this agenda, Dr Hewson favoured an independent commission that could be “properly funded and generally independent”. He said such a body would be “able to tap the best opinion around here or overseas to marshal a strategy for this country moving forward over the next several decades”. “With interest rates at near-zero levels and long-term bond rates … we could borrow 30 to 50 years money on a government guarantee, for which we wouldn’t pay more than 2 per cent. “I reckon we’d raise hundreds of billions of dollars.” That money could then be distributed from an independent infrastructure fund and provide cash for public-private consortiums to innovate. But he warned that billionaires and big companies would also have to start paying their way, with inequitable personal tax rates too high at lower levels. “They expect a tradition of paying very low levels of tax, maybe 10 per cent, and they manage to avoid it all. “And we do deals with those who develop the LNG business, for example, who would not have to pay tax or anything for 20 years. “These are major weaknesses in the system, which has to be addressed –  scrap corporate profits as a basis of corporate taxes. Just make it a flat percentage of revenue or something like that. “The cash flow taxes, which is what the Henry [Report] proposed, change the nature. They can’t really fudge that. “Those big players like Apple and Google can come into Australia and make billions of dollars in terms of revenue and pay no tax. That offends everybody beyond belief and the inequity of that is staggering. “I would think in the current climate, [we’ve] just got to say we’re going to go to all the tax concessions and we’re going to take out the ones that are really inequitable [and] cannot be justified. “Our personal tax rates are a lot higher than they need to be and they come in at lower levels of income. So there’s all elements of the tax and transfer system that need to be reviewed. “And you’ve got an opportunity to do it through some independent body or some structure of government … because it gives you the flexibility and the emphasis is resilience. “If you can have the resilience to deal with issues that arise, you can deal with crises as they come. You are better prepared.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin resigns over beach house visit as Easter virus lawbreakers fined | The New Daily NSW Arts Minister quits cabinet over escape to beach retreat","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/10\/nsw-minister-harwin-quits-cabinet\/","transcript":"NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has accepted the resignation of Arts Minister Don Harwin for flouting travel restrictions as hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines were doled out to virus lawbreakers. Mr Harwin was fined $1000 by NSW Police for relocating from Elizabeth Bay to his holiday home at Pearl Beach on the Central Coast “in contravention of a current ministerial direction”. He was ordered by the Premier to return to his primary residence on Thursday and announced his resignation from cabinet on Friday evening. “There is nothing more important than the work of the government in fighting the coronavirus crisis,” Mr Harwin said in a statement on Friday evening. “I will not allow my circumstances to be a distraction from that work and I very much regret that my residential arrangements have become an issue during this time.” Mr Harwin said he’d sought at all times to act in accordance with public health orders and “remains confident” he had done so. But he also acknowledged that “perception is just as important during these times”. Mr Harwin’s social distancing blunder comes amid a coronavirus crackdown over the Easter weekend, with hefty fines issued to people disobeying pleas to stay at home. While authorities praised most Australians for adhering to social distancing measures, disobedient Queenslanders were fined almost $400,000 for breaking coronavirus regulations. As of Friday morning, 289 people in the Sunshine State had been fined a total of $385,526, including 18 hoons at a car gathering in a Loganholme industrial area south of Brisbane. More than 10 vehicles were intercepted and 18 infringement notices of $1334 issued at the gathering for failing to comply with a COVID-19 direction, police said on Friday. Victoria Police have been on a five-day operation enforcing safety on the state’s roads and have the added task of nabbing non-essential travellers. Victorians are only meant to leave their homes for essential travel, including to buy food and to exercise under the stage three rules while many of the beaches along the surf coast are closed. In NSW, residents were praised for not flocking to popular hotspots. “Right around the state, police are reporting there’s a good deal of consideration and compliance with those requests around not travelling and social distancing,” said Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys. “The movement of people with caravans and holidaymakers with surfboards and camping gear – it is almost non-existent.” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said no-one was above the social distancing rules and travel restrictions. “The police, who have been tasked by my government with enforcing these health orders, came to the conclusion that Minister Harwin breached the order,” the Liberal leader said on Friday evening. “While Minister Harwin has served the people of NSW well, and he continues to assure me that he did not break the rules, the orders in place apply equally to everybody.” The minister earlier this week said he’d been mostly living on the Central Coast for four months for health reasons. “I live in a very built-up area in Sydney with high density and here I have windows that can open so I can have the fresh air and I can walk in fresh air and I have more room in my house here than I would have in my small apartment,” he told the Daily Telegraph in Pearl Beach. The NSW Police commissioner has previously said people should be in lockdown at their primary residences to prevent regional hospitals from potentially becoming overwhelmed with sick city-dwellers.

Two words: Movie marathon. Luckily, a lockdown long weekend can be best used catching up on your favourite movie series – before the next instalment is released. If you’ve ever sat down to watch a sequel and realised you have totally forgotten the plot of the first film, this is the list for you. Harrison Ford is back to reprise his role as the dreamy part-time college professor, part-time treasure hunter. The fifth instalment in the mystery-adventure series was announced back in February with Steven Spielberg penned to direct. However, on Saturday it was announced that he was handing over directorial duties to James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari 2019). Some might say the real mystery is how Harrison Ford can still be a total hunk at 77-years-old. The film is expected to be released in 2022, after Ford’s 80th birthday. Where to watch: Netflix, Stan Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)  Your favourite quirky, off-beat detective is back to grace our screens one again. After the success of the first two instalments, it’s no wonder Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law have signed on to do another Sherlock Holmes film. Rachel McAdams is also rumoured to reprise her role as Irene Adler in the series third instalment which is due for release in December 2021. In addition to being fun, witty and fast-paced, this film is also jam-packed with subtle ‘easter eggs’ – see how many you can spot.

The third instalment is expected in November 2021, with much of the original cast returning, including Eddie Redmayne as protagonist Newt Scamander. The series will reportedly continue on for a fourth and fifth instalment but this has yet to be confirmed. If you’re committed to the couch-potato lifestyle this weekend, why not revisit the entire Harry Potter series (which, in total, is over 20 hours long) while you’re at it.

This Easter perhaps it’s worth revisiting some of the musicians who gave so much before the virus took them. Adam Schlesinger (1967- 2020) In 1995, Adam Schlesinger started the alternative rock band Fountains of Wayne. Schlesinger played bass and wrote or co-wrote much of the band’s five albums, which were highly regarded by critics but never reached a wider audience. The band’s sound was based around jangly guitars underneath stories of quirky middle-class life. New Jersey is the locus of these songs, many of them from the perspective of sweet losers; kids in love with their girlfriend’s mother, the superstar singer of a suburban cover band, a hapless salesman. The influence of Ray Davies and the Kinks and cult heroes Big Star is strong with Adam. Schlesinger was more successful in theatre and film, notably the soundtrack for Tom Hanks’ directorial debut, That Thing You Do!. Other projects included the Stephen Colbert’s Christmas and the sitcom My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. For connoisseurs of classic pop, the key Fountains of Wayne albums are the self-titled debut, Utopia Parkway and Welcome Interstate Managers. They’ll brighten your day.  Hal Willner  (1956 – 2020) Willner was much more than just a record producer or the music director for Saturday Night Live. His best works were projects that put unlikely artists together to celebrate something you hadn’t thought of. Those projects ranged from the work of Nino Rota, Walt Disney, Leonard Cohen and Charlie Mingus. And there were some things such as the collection of pirate songs which was disastrously toured to the Sydney Festival. His most successful project was I’m Your Man, his Leonard Cohen tribute. Willner’s Tim Buckley tribute introduced Buckley’s son Jeff to the New York music community. Willner also produced albums for Marianne Faithfull, Bill Frisell,  William S. Burroughs, Gavin Friday, Lucinda Williams, Laurie Anderson and Allen Ginsberg. He also produced a number of albums for the notoriously irascible Lou Reed. They became best friends. To comb through Willner’s body of work is like the perfect anthology of hipsterism. I recommend you check out  John Prine (1946- 2020) Bob Dylan described John Prine’s songs as, “pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree.” He was discovered in 1970 by Kris Kristofferson and by 1971 his self-titled first album. That LP contained Sam Stone, with the line “There’s a hole in Daddy’s arm where all the money goes” and Angel from Montgomery. While critically acclaimed, the debut was not a hit and subsequent records earned great praise from critics and fellow songwriters but not commercial radio. Prine’s songs were full of wry jokes and beautifully rendered characters. Songs like Jesus, the Missing Years, Some Humans Ain’t Human, Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone were sharp satires. His more serious songs cut to the quick in so many emotional circumstances. Speed of the Sound of Loneliness is a devastating relationship song, the story of a depressed housewife in Angel from Montgomery and the tribute to old age in Summer’s End. The latter track is from his 2018 LP, The Tree of Forgiveness, which is, ironically, the highest charting album of his career. Over recent years Prine battled cancer and lost one lung, but was finally felled by coronavirus in his hometown of Nashville. He was a man of enormous grace and humanity which came through all his work.

The enforced lockdown came as Australia’s death toll rose to 54 and medical officials warned the public against believing misinformation about supposed virus cures. In Tasmania, Premier Peter Gutwein called out rescue helicopters to track people’s movements. They were hovering over towns such as Bicheno, Friendly Beaches, Coles Bay, Dunalley and Primrose Sands on Friday. By Friday afternoon, Tasmanian police had told more than 15 people to go home. They had also intercepted more than 35 people in cars – including some towing caravans and boats – and turned them back. The Easter weekend has been described as a critical period in Australia’s fight against the deadly coronavirus. Daily numbers of new cases have been falling for a week as the country appears to be successfully “flattening the curve”. By Friday afternoon, Australia had 54 coronavirus fatalities – the most recent being a 69-year-old man who died in Newcastle, and a Victorian man in his 80s. There were just over 6100 confirmed cases nationwide. The global death toll from coronavirus is almost 96,000 with more than 1.6 million known cases. More than 354,000 people, meanwhile, have recovered, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly on Friday rubbished claims that a cure for coronavirus has been found, saying that spreading such misinformation was illegal. “There has been some media around, some claims of a cure for this virus,” Professor Kelly said. “I just want to reiterate there is no specific treatment yet proven to be able to cure this virus,” he added. Professor Kelly said there were several treatments in development and undergoing clinical trials, and that was “the appropriate place for those things to be used”. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Corboy told Nine’s Today on Friday that police would be “heavily visible” on the roads. “We will be out there from the Queensland border to the Victorian border, looking at people travelling on our highways and on our back roads,” he said. NSW drivers who are pulled over this weekend without a good excuse to be on the road face $1000 fines. “Right around the state, police are reporting there’s a good deal of consideration and compliance with those requests around not travelling and social distancing,” NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said on Friday. “The movement of people with caravans and holidaymakers with surfboards and camping gear – it is almost non-existent.” It was a similar story in Queensland, where anyone returning to the state now must do 14 days quarantine. Health Minister Steven Miles said 897 returned travellers would spend their Easter weekend in enforced quarantine. “This is not the weekend for going away,” he said. “I was heartened that a highway near here on the day before Good Friday … would normally be chockers, normally would be bumper-to-bumper, and there was barely a car on the road. Similarly this morning, the highways are [empty]. That is good news.” However, in South Australia residents of the Fleurieu Peninsula were dismayed at the number of holidaymakers arriving in coastal towns. Goolwa resident Polly Green told ABC News Breakfast locals in popular south coast tourist towns such as Port Elliott and Victor Harbour, and on the other side of the peninsula in Normanville, had noticed a rise in travellers. She said while it was so far less busy than the typical Easter, a stream of tourists had arrived in recent weeks, and the local population was continuing to swell. “We’ve got quite a few hundred here at the moment, which is less than thousands and thousands, but we’re very concerned,” Ms Green said. “Going down the beaches, families, a lot of young kids, surfing – the locals have been talking [about this] on social media.” Ms Green said she saw caravans heading into town on Thursday, despite local accommodation being closed. In Victoria, there have been anecdotal reports of similar numbers descending on holiday towns. Victorians with holiday homes are legally allowed visit them this weekend, although the state government has urged them not to. Many of the beaches along the Surf Coast are closed and only locals or permitted visitors can use them for exercise. Police were also focusing on holiday towns along the Great Ocean Road. Victorian Prevention of Family Violence Minister Gabrielle Williams said staying home was the best way to curb the spread of COVID-19. “If we want to continue to hold back the spread of coronavirus, then we need to stay home and vigilance is key, she said. “There is no need to relax at the moment; it is critical that we don’t.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Charges after nurse spat at while working at Queensland clinic","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/queensland\/2020\/04\/10\/nurse-spat-queensland-clinic\/","transcript":"Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles says he is “disgusted” to hear a nurse had been spat while on duty at a fever clinic set-up for potential coronavirus victims.

The BioCharger NG device is being sold through the My Kitchen Rules judge’s website for $US14,990 ($A23,898) – with a $500 discount for Evans’ followers. Its manufacturer says the machine is a “hybrid subtle energy revitalisation platform” that uses “four transmitted energies” to “stimulate and invigorate the entire body to optimise and improve potential health, wellness, and athletic performance”. In a Facebook video on Thursday night, Evans said the BioCharger “was a pretty amazing tool” that will “take me an hour or two to explain”. He said it offered “a thousand different recipes and a couple on there for Wuhan coronavirus”. Brisbane dietitian Mandy-Lee Noble shared the video on Twitter late on Thursday. “Pete Evans is selling this ridiculous device for US$15K claiming it has some action against ‘Wuhan coronavirus’,” she wrote, before urging the Therapeutic Goods Administration and NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard to investigate and “shut Evans down”. The Australian Medical Association agreed, saying Evans was targeting vulnerable and frightened people amid the coronavirus pandemic. “He is not a doctor. He is not a scientist. He is a chef,” AMA tweeted on Friday. Advanced Biotechnologies, the American company that makes the BioCharger, claims to be “the innovation leader within the emerging field of subtle energy revitalisation platforms”. The company’s website claims the BioCharger NG uses four energy types – “Light, Voltage, Frequencies & Harmonics, and Pulsed Electro-Magnetic Fields”. “Each has its fair share of supported research. However, the BioCharger NG is the first energy platform of its kind to incorporate all four of these beneficial energies into one platform,” the company claims. But Ms Noble, who is a member of Friends in Medicine and Science, said the machine was basically a “glorified plasma lamp”. “It makes your hairs stand on end, and the recipes are different colours – it’s a recipe from the lamp, putting on a different colour show,” she told the Daily Telegraph. “It says on the clip online, ‘just like you charge your phone, this charges you’. “It is probably no threat to people but if people think this in any way will treat or prevent COVID-19 infection, that risks our community response to the pandemic, that is dangerous, it’s an indirect harm,” she said. Evans, who has more than 1.5 million followers on social media, has a history of promoting alternative health treatments. He stirred up controversy in 2015 with a paleo cookbook for babies that included a recipe for a breastmilk replacement made out of chicken liver and bone broth. The Public Health Association of Australia said babies could potentially die from ingesting the mixture. “In my view, there’s a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,” PHAA president Professor Heather Yeatman said. In 2017, Evans claimed eating three meals a day was unhealthy and a “multinational food industry” invention to boost business. In 2019, at the height of the deadly measles epidemic in Samoa, Evans posted a picture of himself to Facebook with anti-vaccine advocate Robert F Kennedy Jr, saying he was doing “important work”. “It just goes to show our Health Care Complaints Commission and Therapeutic Goods Administration and health minister Brad Hazzard how much of a risk Pete Evans is to the community,” Ms Noble said. “They need to take action to shut Evans down and Channel 7 needs to stop giving him a platform.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Police clear AFL star Nat Fyfe over coronavirus travel ban surfing outing in Margaret River | The New Daily","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/wa\/2020\/04\/10\/police-clear-afl-star-nat-fyfe-over-coronavirus-travel-ban-surfing-outing-in-margaret-river\/","transcript":"Police have cleared Brownlow Medallist and Fremantle Dockers captain Nat Fyfe of any wrongdoing after he was spotted surfing near Margaret River in what appeared to be breach of strict coronavirus travel bans. Intrastate border restrictions are in place in WA, separating each of the state’s nine region’s from Perth, and West Australians have repeatedly been told not to travel to holiday homes or away from their primary place of residence. Fyfe drew the attention of Margaret River locals when he pulled into a beach car park at Gas Bay on Friday morning. The ABC approached the 28-year-old for comment as he walked back to a car after his surf but he declined, asking instead that his privacy be respected. Subsequent calls were then placed to Fremantle Dockers management and Fyfe’s personal manager, Jason Dover, but neither was prepared to offer comment other than to say he was driving trucks for his father, picking up a delivery of lime in Margaret River. Dockers Media manager Luke Morfesse said Fyfe was simply taking the opportunity to surf in lieu of exercise. At a media conference on Thursday afternoon, WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson confirmed police were investigating the incident. But after reviewing the matter, police released a statement on Thursday night clearing Fyfe of any wrongdoing. “It has been confirmed that Mr Fyfe entered the region in order to provide transport services and was waiting for a truck to be loaded when he went surfing,” the statement said. “As a result, Mr Fyfe had a valid exemption and was compliant with directions regarding regional travel. “It has further been established that Mr Fyfe did not breach social distancing requirements. “The intent of the directions is to reduce travel in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Western Australia. “Exemptions for regional travel do apply, but exempt travellers must only travel as required and must only stay in the region for as long as it takes to complete the essential service.” Commissioner Chris Dawson said the interpretation of the law had been examined and it had been determined that Fyfe did not commit any breaches. “The spirit of the law is that people apply common sense and only move to another region for the purposes of performing an essential service,” Mr Dawson said. “I will change my directions if I learn of people’s behaviours putting others at risk. Fyfe was photographed with the captain of the Australian hockey team Aran Zalewski. Hockey Australia released a brief statement in response to enquiries from the ABC. “When Aran is not required at Hockey Australia’s High Performance Program as part of the Kookaburras, his primary place of residence is in Margaret River,” the statement said. “There is certainly no intention on his part not to follow the Premier’s directive.” In WA travelling into another region without a valid reason could result in a fine of up to $50,000. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"BBC host slams UK politicians for suggesting 'fighters' can beat COVID-19","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/10\/emily-maitlis-bbc-coronavirus\/","transcript":"BBC current affairs host Emily Maitlis has delivered a stinging broadside to UK government officials for their language surrounding the coronavirus. In a clip that has since been widely shared on social media, Maitlis opened Newsnight on Wednesday (local time) by taking politicians to task for implying that those with a “strength of character” could survive the virus. The language around coronavirus “has sometimes felt trite and misleading” says #Newsnight presenter Emily @Maitlis “You do not survive the illness through fortitude and strength of character, whatever the prime minister’s colleagues will tell us”https:\/\/t.co\/JCoDTwOSp2 pic.twitter.com\/GYinnlwX8p — BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) April 9, 2020  Maitlis said “the language around COVID-19 has sometimes felt trite and misleading. You do not survive the illness through fortitude … whatever the Prime Minister’s colleagues will tell us.” Her words appeared a pointed reference to UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who suggested that Prime Minister Boris Johnson — currently being treated in intensive care for COVID-19 — would beat the virus because he is a “fighter.” Maitlis, who Australians will recall for her probing interview last year with Prince Andrew, went on to say the idea the disease was a “leveler” between rich and poor was a “myth.” “Those serving on the front line right now — bus drivers and shelf stackers, nurses, care home workers, hospital staff and shopkeepers are disproportionately the lower paid members of our workforce,” she said. “They are more likely to catch the disease because they are more exposed.” Maitlis said that inequality meant the lockdown would be experienced very differently by the rich and poor – with those who live in tower blocks finding it tougher. “Those in manual jobs will be unable to work from home. This is a health issue with huge ramifications for social welfare, and it’s a welfare issue with huge ramifications for public health,” Maitlis said. The United Kingdom has been one of the countries worst hit, with 7,097 deaths recorded and 60,733 cases, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The country has been in lockdown since March 24 when Mr Johnson issued a stay-at-home order, directing people to only leave their homes for essential shopping, daily exercise or for work if they cannot do so from home.

The weekend looms as a key test in Australia’s battle against coronavirus, with people told to stay at home during the holiday period.  Health authorities are warning against complacency after encouraging figures showed the infection rate rising just 1.8 per cent over the past three days. Australia’s new daily cases fell below 100 on Thursday, the first time it has slipped under that daily threshold for three weeks. More than 6100 people in Australia have contracted coronavirus, with 52 deaths. The Prime Minister used his Easter message to drive home the importance of social distancing during what is usually a weekend of gatherings. Drawing on his own faith, Mr Morrison acknowledged this holiday would be vastly different, with online church services and no large family events. “For Christians, not being able to gather does not diminish the hope that we have through this important Easter period,” he said in a video message. “This year, we will live out our faith by doing the right thing. “That means staying at home, making sure we’re checking on our neighbours and supporting our communities and families, our friends.” Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the reduced infection rate was an important development but strict social distancing measures must remain in place. “This Easter is the time when any Australian can help save a life with their decisions, or inadvertently risk a life,” Mr Hunt said. “This is the moment to lock in the gains, to stay at home, to protect other people, and if we do that, we give ourselves the best way through this.” Opposition leader Anthony Albanese in a statement issued a similar message, imploring Australians to stay home for the sake of community wellbeing. He also thanked those working over the weekend on the crisis’ frontline. “This age of social distancing and self-isolation means that we are all keeping 1.5 metres apart. But in so many ways, we as Australians have never been as together as we are now,” Mr Albanese said on Friday. The federal government, meanwhile, has reached an agreement with Qantas for three rescue flights from Peru, Argentina and South Africa for Australians stranded through border closures and lockdowns. Those flights are expected next week while a separate government rescue flight returned about 280 Australians from Peru on Thursday. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the government would help arrange flights over the coming weeks but couldn’t make promises over the long term. “But you can get home from places if you can connect into London or Hong Kong or Singapore or San Francisco because we put in place those regular flights,” Mr Birmingham told the Nine Network on Friday. Australian independent schools will also be forced to open in term two after the federal government threatened to cut funding. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus claims another life in Victoria, bringing national toll to 52","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/10\/coronavirus-toll-54\/","transcript":"Three more Australians have died from coronavirus, taking the national toll up to 54. The latest is the fourth coronavirus death in Tasmania, occurring at the North West Regional Hospital. All staff at the hospital working on the medical and surgical wards have been told to quarantine for 14 days. Earlier, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard confirmed a 69-year-old man died from coronavirus complications last night in Newcastle. The latest death brings the total death toll in NSW to 22. There are 49 new cases of coronavirus in NSW, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the state to 2,822. NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys said nearly 50 people had been issued $1,000 infringement notices for disobeying social distancing laws in the past 24 hours. The Victorian government reported the death of a man in his 80s. The overnight death brings Victoria’s death toll from COVID-19 to 13. The number of confirmed cases in Victoria is 1,241 after 13 more cases were confirmed overnight. There are now 158 healthcare workers who have contracted the virus, one more than yesterday. There are 43 people in hospital, seven more than yesterday, and 13 people are in intensive care. Another 120 people have recovered from the disease, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 926.

Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles has confirmed that the number of new cases is continuing to fall. The Minister also said that Queensland police have issued 289 fines for breaches of the public health emergency orders. The fines start at $1,300. Mr Miles said that there were 97 people in enforced quarantine in the state. Mr Miles added that people should not be travelling in the state. “We would encourage people not to be travelling from region to region and we consider Brisbane to the Gold Coast are different regions. “We would encourage people not to travel that far. The two-guest rule was a concession to make it bearable but it is not designed to allow people to travel great distances. That’s what we’re trying to restrict here.” The minister said that if people continue to abuse the two-person rule, then it will be revisited. “We are allowing two guests but if we find people are abusing that, we might have to revisit that.

Some 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. New Delhi resident and Australian expat Simon Quinn created a Facebook support group called Australians Stuck in India, which lobbied the government for emergency flights. “I saw that lots of foreigners here were really struggling after the lockdown started,” Mr Quinn told the ABC. “People were afraid, there were horror stories of people being locked in hotel rooms.” Mr Quinn speaks Hindi, which made the situation easier for him to handle. “But for the average tourist, this was a really scary time,” he said. India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb the rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases. “People assume [Australians] hadn’t heeded the calls from home,” Mr Quinn said. “The lockdown happened really fast. Even if people wanted to get out, they just couldn’t.” As European countries started evacuating their citizens from India, Mr Quinn reached out to aviation experts. He eventually contacted Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, Stratos Group Aviation. Mr Hempel had already leased several Lion Air aircraft, which were transporting medical supplies from China to Australia, when he decided to help the stranded Aussies. Another Australian charter company, Monarc Global, also joined the cause and designed an online ticketing system specifically for the evacuation flights. “People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,” Mr Hempel said. “I know it’s a difficult time for families who are scared of their security and wellbeing. “I did actually see a video from an Australian in Delhi who was trapped essentially in his apartment, awaiting some sort of help from government to get out. That was really the passion in trying to help out.” The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar. Australians Chloe Dimopoulos and her partner Ben Munro, who spent more than 18 days stuck in a hospital in Jaipur, have tickets for the first flight out. “[We’re] elated, absolutely stoked,” Ms Dimopoulos said from her Delhi hotel room. “We were psyching in our heads that we were going to be here for months, the lockdown would be extended, it would be a nightmare.” The couple were put into quarantine in hospital after Ms Dimopoulos came down with a fever, but they were barred from leaving for weeks despite both testing negative twice for COVID-19. “We were nervous that it still wasn’t real until we were literally in the car,” Mr Munro said. “When we were in the hospital we saw … that a lot of other countries were doing evacuation flights. We felt pretty left behind.” Mr Munro said he was grateful the charter flight organisers came through. “I think it should not have been their responsibility,” he added. Organisers expect up to 10 flights can be scheduled from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, but are concerned about how long this may take as authorities have requested each flight is staggered by three days to cope with the influx. Tickets are likely to cost about $2,000, which is more than half what Australians paid for official emergency flights from Peru. The Australian High Commission in India has helped the rescue mission clear bureaucratic hurdles and arranged travel passes for people to travel to the airport during India’s lockdown.

But Mr Hempel said he personally had no safety concerns about the airline. “They’re a large airline,” Mr Hempel said. “In this case, they’ve been extremely helpful and at the end of the day they’re scrutinised by the [International Civil Aviation Organisation] and the same levels of organisation that Australian airliners are.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Queensland state election may see full postal vote, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says | The New Daily","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/queensland\/2020\/04\/10\/queensland-state-election-may-see-full-postal-vote-premier-annastacia-palaszczuk-says\/","transcript":"Queensland’s state election may be held entirely by postal vote amid the coronavirus outbreak, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva painted a far bleaker picture of the social and economic impact of the coronavirus than even a few weeks ago, noting governments had already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $US8 trillion, but more would likely be needed. She said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest of all, which would then need hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid. “Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020,” she said on Thursday in remarks prepared for delivery ahead of next week’s IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings. “Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.” If the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF expected a partial recovery in 2021, Georgieva said, but she warned the situation could also get worse. “I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,” she said. The coronavirus that emerged in China in December has raced around the globe, infecting 1.41 million people and killing 83,400, according to a Reuters tally. Georgieva said the pandemic was hitting both rich and poor countries, but many in Africa, Asia and Latin America were at higher risk because they had weaker health systems. They were also unable to implement social distancing in their densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums. She said investors had already removed some $US100 billion in capital from those economies, more than three times the outflow seen during the same period of the global financial crisis. With commodity prices down sharply, emerging market and developing countries would need trillions of dollars to fight the pandemic and rescue their economies, she said. “They urgently need help,” she said, estimating hundreds of billions of dollars would have to be pumped in from outside sources since those governments could only cover a portion of the costs on their own, and many already had high debts. To ensure a future recovery, Georgieva called for continued efforts to contain the virus and support health systems, while averting export controls that could slow the flow of vital medical equipment and food. “The actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery,” she said. It was critical to provide affected people and companies with “large, timely and targeted” measures such as wage subsidies, extended unemployment benefits and adjusted loan terms, while reducing stress to the financial system. “Those with greater resources and policy space will need to do more; others, with limited resources will need more support,” she said. The IMF was created for times like these, and stood ready to deploy its $US1 trillion in lending capacity, Georgieva said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"New York's infection curve flattens but deaths soar","date":"04-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/10\/coronavirus-new-york-infections-and-deaths\/","transcript":"Coronavirus hospital admissions in New York have dropped off but the state’s death toll has again spiked. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says new cases in hospitals fell to a fresh low of 200 in a sign the disease’s curve was flattening in the state, the epicenter of the US outbreak. But at the same time, the state recorded a record-high 799 deaths on Wednesday, for a total of 7067. “You can’t relax. The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday,” Mr Cuomo said, referring to the shape of graphs tracking new cases. Several officials have hailed the apparent success of mitigation efforts as reflected in death projections that have been scaled down to 60,000 from more than 100,000. Still, Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top US infectious disease expert, said it was important that people continue to stay home. “We’ve got to continue to redouble our efforts at the mitigation of physical separation in order to keep those numbers down and hopefully even get them lower than what you’ve heard recently,” said Mr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A University of Washington model often cited by US and state officials projects that COVID-19, the respiratory ailment caused by coronavirus, will claim 60,415 American lives by August 4. The peak is predicted on Easter Sunday this weekend, when the model projects that 2212 will die. Mr Cuomo likened the crisis to the September 11, 2001, attacks, which killed almost 3000 people, and called it a “silent explosion”. “9\/11 was so devastating, so tragic and then in many ways we lose so many more New Yorkers to this silent killer,” he said. “It was a silent explosion that just ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9\/11.” Stay-at-home orders that have closed non-essential workplaces in 42 states have drastically slowed the once-humming US economy and thrown millions of people out of work. With several state unemployment insurance offices deluged in recent weeks, 6.6 million workers applied for jobless benefits in the week ended April 4, the US Labor Department said on Thursday. That followed 6.9 million jobless applications the week before, the most since the Great Recession of 2008. In all, some 16.8 million American workers have applied for jobless benefits in the past three weeks. US deaths due to coronavirus topped 16,000 on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, a number surpassed only by Italy, with a much smaller population.

Mathematical modelling based on China’s experience has found  “aggressive” interventions such as business shutdowns and travel restrictions successfully abated that country’s first wave of COVID-19. But relaxing such strict measures runs the risk of enabling a sweeping second wave of the virus, with more devastating consequences, the study published in The Lancet states. The warning comes as Australians were warned not to become complacent over the Easter holiday break and to stay at home as the world ticked over 100 days of COVID-19.

IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the global outlook had been “turned on its head”, warning that more rescue packages would be needed on top of the $US8 trillion ($12.6 trillion) already committed globally. “Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020,” Ms Georgieva said. “Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.” News of Mr Johnson’s health improvement prompted a small rise in the value of sterling against the dollar. However, the government statement did not give any details on when Mr Johnson may be able to resume leadership. Mr Johnson was the first world leader to be hospitalised with the coronavirus, forcing him to hand control of the world’s fifth-largest economy to foreign minister Dominic Raab just as Britain’s outbreak approaches its most deadly peak. Mr Raab – speaking before the latest announcement – stressed the importance of allowing the prime minister to focus on recovery. US President Donald Trump tweeted that the improvement in Mr Johnson’s condition was “great news”. Great News: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just been moved out of Intensive Care.

NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin was spotted earlier this week at his million-dollar Pearl Beach house which is more than an hour’s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. In a Cabinet meeting he had argued against the travel restrictions without declaring a conflict of interest, The Daily Telegraph reported. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said police would investigate, noting there was photographic evidence of another person in the holiday home. Officers spoke with the 55-year-old on Thursday and fined him after they were alerted to the fact he had relocated to the Pearl Beach holiday home “in contravention of current Ministerial Direction under the Public Health Act,” NSW Police said in a statement. Mr Fuller said no individual or corporation is above the COVID-19 laws. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian had defied calls to sack the MP and said she would wait for police to first establish the facts. She told Mr Harwin on Thursday to return to his Sydney apartment – acknowledging the “perception is horrible”. Ms Berejiklian is adamant Mr Harwin didn’t break the rules because he relocated on March 13 before state COVID-19 regulations came into effect on March 17. Not wanting to “cause a distraction”, Mr Harwin confirmed he had arrived back in Sydney in a statement on Thursday. He apologised to the premier and the NSW community but insisted he had sought official advice to adhere to the public health order. NSW Labor is calling on Mr Harwin to resign or, failing that, for the premier to step in and relieve him of his ministerial duties.

What were supposed to be some long-awaited comeuppances for the employer and union-run sector not merely failed to work, but backfired on their enemies. A Productivity Commission inquiry commissioned by Scott Morrison intended to replace the default super allocation system that favoured industry funds recommended a new model, but along the way demonstrated that industry super funds were far superior to retail funds controlled by big banks and AMP. Kelly O’Dwyer famously couldn’t bring herself to acknowledge what the PC had found. A campaign to demonise industry funds run out of the Business Council by former Financial Services Council exec and Liberal Party apparatchik Andrew Bragg imploded in humiliation for all concerned. And, most of all, there was the financial services royal commission, in which the Turnbull government included industry superannuation with the hope of, somehow, maybe, exposing some sort of wrongdoing. We all know how that ended: The destruction of the big banks’ super fund model, the smashing of AMP, the confirmation of literally everything that industry super had ever claimed about what a rort retail super was, and tens of billions of dollars being shifted by angry Australians from retail to industry super. It was the biggest own goal in Australian financial history. And ever since, the enemies of industry funds have been itching for revenge. They think the virus crisis has provided the opportunity. For more than a decade, ever since industry super funds outperformed retail funds during the financial crisis, their enemies have been complaining that the willingness of industry funds to invest more in illiquid, and less volatile, asset classes gave them an unfair advantage when stockmarkets tanked – and that their outperformance had nothing to do with better management or the extortionate fees that retail funds paid to the big banks and AMP. In a crisis, while retail funds copped a hiding from their exposure to equities, industry funds would only suffer mild indigestion as assets like infrastructure projects held up. But remember that Scott Morrison actually benefitted from industry funds’ liking for infrastructure assets — they saved his bacon when he nixed the Chinese acquisition of NSW’s Ausgrid. This time around, there are few safe assets in an economy that is being deliberately put in the freezer across the board. Moreover, one of the reasons the government was dead keen to allow people to access their super in the crisis is that it knew that would put pressure on industry funds, with a greater proportion of illiquid assets. That doesn’t mean allowing workers to access some of their super is a bad idea – it affects retail, super and corporate funds alike. But ever since, the enemies have been attacking the industry sector and hinting that it is struggling. Just on Thursday the Australian Financial Review, which has long despised industry super, attacked the “moral hazard weakness” (whatever that is) of the sector and argued it only outperforms the rorted funds of the banks because of the industrial relations system. The AFR also gleefully ran an attack on the sector by AMP – the company that charged dead people premiums and charged fees for no service. Two weeks ago the AFR gave a platform to Bragg – these days a Liberal senator – to renew his attack on industry funds. Since entering parliament, Bragg’s main contribution to public life appears to have been getting infected with coronavirus and potentially exposing other senators. But he told the AFR he was using his time in isolation to develop a “big plan” for super, which has “been totally captured by vested interests”. Bragg, possibly taking the “destroy the village in order to save it” approach, has previously argued super should be made voluntary, so perhaps his plan would be more accurately described as a little one. On Wednesday, The Sydney Morning Herald got Bragg to attack “suggestions” that the Future Fund “props up super funds”. Perhaps the article had been badly subbed, but the “suggestions” appear to have been invented either by the journalist who wrote it or Bragg, rather than come from anywhere in the sector. Then there was Tim Wilson, a veteran foot soldier in the war against industry funds, whose MO is to use his role in the House of Representatives economics committee to demand information from them. That information then mysteriously makes its way to journalists – how, we don’t know, but they all claim that the information has been acquired through legitimate journalism, so who are we to question that? This week Wilson was again using his position to issue “please explains” to industry funds about liquidity issues – via committee correspondence that, coincidentally, made its way the AFR, doubtless due to the great diligence of the journalists involved. It is comforting to know that Liberals aren’t letting a little thing like a global pandemic get in the way of their war on industry super – and that the AFR remains as focused as ever on demonising a sector that, like pretty much the entire economy at the moment, doesn’t fit with its neoliberal obsession with what the world should look like. • This article was first published on the Crikey website.

It is Easter in Australia and it’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before. With constantly changing restrictions it can be hard to keep up – can you see family? Walk the dog? Go to the supermarket? Here is everything you need to know this Easter. If you are wondering this, it is good to imagine every frontline healthcare worker in the country screaming a collective ‘no’. They say no. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says no. Every Premier says no. This Easter, holidaying away from home is cancelled – to be replaced by the under-appreciated staycation. It is not illegal if you own a holiday home you can go there. But it is certainly not advised. On Wednesday, Mr Morrison implored Australians to stay at home this Easter, insisting that doing otherwise could create a catastrophe. “This Easter weekend will be incredibly important,” Mr Morrison said. “Stay at home. Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.” Police roadblocks will placed in some popular holidaying spots, like the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, to deter trigger-happy travellers. Even Airbnb is telling people to stay home. Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb’s country manager for Australia, said: “If you’re thinking of an Easter getaway this long weekend, change your plans immediately and stay home.” Unless you are lucky enough to live near the beach, the answer is no. Don’t worry, it’ll be cold, wet and windy anyway. This one differs from state to state, so it is a little more complex than a simple yes or no. The big family lunch is off. In New South Wales and Victoria, you are only allowed to see one family member – if you are taking them food, providing care or exercising with them.  The federal advice for other states and territories is to keep visits to loved ones to a minimum, with limits on hangouts that include more than two people. Time to fire up the Zoom. No one really. Unless you live in Western Australia, then you can go to a mate’s place if you are the only one invited. But you can go for your daily state-sanctioned exercise together, as long as it doesn’t involve any contact. “This is the strong advice of all states and territories. That unless it’s your household, the family, those that are living at your residence, that being with only one other person as a gathering outside is what is required,” the Prime Minister said in March. Lace up those trainers and get going! Just stick to the rules, no getting close to anyone, and stay local. We get the confusion with this one. For a few small hours it looked like the government had put in place a ‘bonk ban’ as it was called by outraged couples. But states and territories soon rushed to clarify: You can see your partner if you don’t live together. Mazel tov! Yes. Easter isn’t cancelled, it just looks a bit different. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still stuff your face with hot cross buns. But be prepared. Woolworths and Coles have warned customers they will be busy over the long weekend, so you will likely have to stand in cordoned-off queues. “Traditionally, the Thursday lead-up to Easter is one of our busiest times in store,” Woolworths managing director of supermarkets Claire Peters said. “We ask our customers to pre-plan their Easter shopping to avoid the usual Thursday spike in numbers. Customer limits will be specific in each location and based on the size of the store.” Sort of. You may not be able to worship inside your church, but you can via Zoom. For the past two weeks place of worship have been closed across the country. But those that are formally involved in conducting services are allowed to be inside the building. We put all these questions to the health department, which came back with this short, sharp message: “Easter does not change the strict social distancing rules across the country,” a spokesperson said. You must stay at home except for: “People should not travel for holidays and risk infecting tourist towns. Easter lunch should be avoided, and many religious services are being delivered online.” Essentially, stay inside and save some lives."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus hits ‘ambassadorial’ role as Scott Cam parts with Cash","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/09\/coronavirus-ambassadorial-role-scott-cam\/","transcript":"Celebrity builder Scott Cam will give up the remainder of his $347,000 taxpayer-funded salary as national careers ambassador due to the coronavirus pandemic, the federal government says. The television tradie’s 15-month appointment to the role has been the subject of significant criticism after it was revealed he had only attended one public event and appeared in a handful of social media videos in his first few months as ambassador. Cam hit out at questions about whether he was providing taxpayers with value for money, even telling one journalist his salary was “none of your business” in a live television interview. The coronavirus outbreak in Australia, and the associated social restrictions that have shut down workplaces and TAFE colleges, have now hampered his attempts to become more visible. “The nature of the role of national careers ambassador has also changed with face-to-face events being cancelled,” Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said in a statement. “Mr Cam will continue to work with the Australian government and the National Careers Institute to amplify online training opportunities and engage with Australians through digital mediums. Cam was due to earn $262,000 between October 1 and the end of this financial year, with a further $85,000 paid from July 1 and the end of his appointment. He has been paid $175,000 so far, meaning he is giving up the remaining $172,000.

It is understood the suspension will start on Friday. The airline, which is seeking $1.4 billion in government assistance, says demand has dropped due to coronavirus travel restrictions. A spokesperson for Virgin Australia said the airline would continue to monitor passenger numbers and adjust capacity requirements as necessary. “As a result of government restrictions, less people are travelling and we have made changes to our schedules to reflect this,” they said. “We continue to operate a daily service between Melbourne and Sydney, provide cargo transport locally and overseas, and operate charter flights including assisting the government in bringing Australians home.” It’s with a heavy heart that we’re temporarily suspending most of our domestic flights from midnight 27 Mar-14 Jun due to new travel restrictions.

Fare and tax differences may apply. “Guests who have booked flights on a suspended service will be contacted via email, prioritised by departure date, with alternative travel options.” Virgin Australia would not confirm any additional job losses, after announcing 8000 workers would be stood down. Last month, Virgin Australia grounded its entire international fleet in response to COVID-19. The company had also already announced it would temporarily reduce chairman and director fees by 15 per cent, and remove bonuses. Some aviation experts warned the company may fail to survive the crisis despite federal government stimulus measures. “This says to me that the major shareholders, which are foreign companies and own 90 per cent of Virgin, are clearly not prepared to put any more into it,” said airline consultant Neil Hansford from Strategic Aviation Solutions. “This is the only way it’s got of preserving cash.” Singapore Airlines, Etihad, Chinese groups Nanshan and HNA and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group all have stakes in Virgin Australia. “They can’t between them get enough shareholder contributions, which tells me they don’t see a future for Virgin,” Mr Hansford said. Qantas was able to raise $1.05 billion in additional funding by taking out a 10-year loan secured against its aircraft, but Mr Hansford said Virgin did not have that option. He argued the government was unlikely to agree to a $1.4 billion bailout, considering 8000 of Virgin’s 10,000 workers have been stood down, leaving a vastly reduced workforce. In a statement released on Thursday, Transport Minister Michael McCormack said the federal government was taking every possible action to maintain a strong and competitive aviation sector after the coronavirus pandemic. “As Australia’s aviation industry faces an unprecedented and sustained period of falling demand, we continue to work with all stakeholders, including the major airlines, to ensure we meet and beat the current challenges – together,” the statement said. “That’s why we have already invested more than $1 billion to support our Australian aviation industry.” The support includes a $715 million package waiving fuel excise and government charges backdated to February 1. The government also set aside $198 million to ensure the continued operation of essential flights into regional communities and $100 million to provide direct financial support to smaller regional airlines. The fortnightly JobKeeper wage subsidy is also available to a range of eligible businesses across all sectors of the aviation industry. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coroner refers death of Tanya Day in police custody to prosecutors","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/09\/tanya-day-coroner\/","transcript":"A Victorian coroner has referred the 2017 death of Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day in police custody to prosecutors for further investigation. On the “totality” of evidence from the coronial inquiry, Coroner Caitlin English today said there was the possibility an indictable offence had occurred. “Ms Day’s death was clearly preventable had she not been arrested and taken into custody,” Ms English said. Ms Day was in police custody in Castlemaine, after being taken off a Melbourne-bound train in December 2017 to sober up. She fell and hit her head several times while in the police cell, but her injuries were not discovered for several hours. On-duty police did not conduct adequate checks of Ms Day, the coroner found. Ms English questioned the evidence of Leading Senior Constable Danny Wolters, where CCTV footage from the cell contradicted his claims that in his check on her at 5:56pm she was “moving around freely”. She noted there was a 68-minute gap between the second and third checks of Ms Day, and 81 minutes from the last check to when police opened the cell door after 8:00pm. She told the court Senior Constable Wolters was not a “credible witness”. The coroner found Sergeant Edwina Neale and Senior Constable Wolters — who were attending to Ms Day in the cells — showed “cultural complacency” in dealing with people who were intoxicated, using a “minimalised approach to her medical needs”. They did not take proper care of Ms Day, Ms English said in her findings. If “proper physical checks had been done every 30 minutes” she would have been checked 10 minutes after the fatal fall in the cell at 4:51pm, Ms English said. Ms English said “there was an opportunity lost for her survival”. On December 5, 2017, Ms Day had fallen asleep while travelling by train from Bendigo to Melbourne. She was taken off the train by V\/Line officials at Castlemaine and picked up by police and taken to local police cells to sober up. A three-week coronial inquest heard last year that during the four hours she was in the holding cell, police officers did not conduct sufficient physical checks on her — as required under police rules. At the request of Ms Day’s family during the inquest, the coroner released CCTV footage from the cell Ms Day was held in. It showed her hitting her head at least five times inside the holding cell. She was eventually taken to Bendigo Hospital, and later to St Vincent’s hospital in Melbourne, where she died 17 days later. ‘Unconscious bias’ a factor in removal from train, coroner finds Ms Day’s family has pushed for a criminal investigation into the events that day, claiming racism was a factor. At the beginning of the inquest in August, the family’s lawyer argued Ms Day’s catastrophic injuries had been caused by neglect. The inquest is the first time special consideration has been given to whether systematic racism was a factor in the way she was treated by authorities, and ultimately her death. Ms English today said she found evidence from V\/Line conductor Shaun Irvine that he did not notice Ms Day’s Aboriginal heritage “unconvincing”, noting his statement made refence to it and also that Mr Irvine mentioned it to police. She found there was “unconscious bias” by Mr Irvine when he determined Ms Day was unruly and called police. Ms Day’s Aboriginality was a factor in his response, the coroner said. Ms Day’s family did not attend the findings hearing because of restrictions at the Coroners Court of Victoria to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Before the inquest began the Victorian Government said it would drop the state’s public drunkenness laws, but the changes have not yet been made. 3:14pm Tanya Day is removed from a V\/Line train by police at Castlemaine 3:37pm Ms Day arrives at Castlemaine Police Station 3:56pm She is placed in a holding cell to sober up 4:50pm Ms Day suffers a traumatic head injury when she falls forward and hits her forehead on the wall of the cell 8:03pm Police perform their first physical check on Ms Day — she is on the floor with a bruise on her forehead 8:25pm An ambulance is called 8:54pm Ms Day is taken to Bendigo Hospital in an ambulance with lights and sirens 9.48pm Ms Day is unconscious with bleeding on her brain 3:25am She is flown to St Vincent’s Hospital in Melbourne where she remained unconscious until her death"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Lonely Planet, Foxtel workers the latest to suffer coronavirus cutbacks","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/work\/2020\/04\/09\/lonely-planet-coronavirus-jobs\/","transcript":"Travel publisher Lonely Planet will close most of its operations in Melbourne and London as the company deals with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

But it will commission no new “inspirational” titles and will stop publishing its magazine. “Lonely Planet is currently proposing that its operations in London and Melbourne close almost entirely, with impacts in other Lonely Planet locations around the world,” the company’s communications manager Adam Bennett told the ABC. Lonely Planet was founded in 1973 when Australian couple Tony and Maureen Wheeler published their first guidebook, Across Asia on the Cheap. The company became a favourite of many travellers, with its guidebooks pored over in hostels and bars around the world. But Lonely Planet has had its share of challenges in more recent times. Its ownership has changed hands twice, with the BBC’s commercial arm buying a majority stake in 2007. BBC Worldwide later sold the company to NC2 Media – a company based in Nashville, in the US. Elsewhere, 200 Foxtel workers have been laid off and 140 more stood down until the end of June.

The toughest crackdown yet comes as figures show Australians are “flattening the curve” of new infections. Australia has passed 6000 total coronavirus cases, with states and territories recording a combined 105 new cases on Wednesday. For some, the numbers of new infections were the lowest in weeks. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the new figures were “heartening” – but also had a warning. “This, in many ways, is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus,” he said. “This Easter is the time when any Australian can help save a life with their decisions, or inadvertently risk a life. This is the moment to lock in the gains, to stay at home, to protect other people – and if we do that, we give ourselves the best way through this.” In NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian reminded residents they could not attend church or religious services this weekend – and also implored people to stay home. “We cannot lift our foot off the pedal, we have to stay vigilant,” she said. NSW had 39 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, its smallest increase since March 16. There are 31 coronavirus patients in intensive care. In Victoria, police will launch their usual Easter blitz – with a different focus. “We do anticipate fewer cars on our roads and we expect people to abide by the directions that have been put in place by the chief health officer,” Road Policing Command Assistant Commissioner Libby Murphy said. She said police would enforce those directions, including ensuring people had left their homes only for the four approved reasons. Victorian senator Sarah Henderson has urged police to focus on Great Ocean Road, demanding roadblocks to help keep out the crowds. “Two weekends ago we saw a terrible situation where thousands of people headed down the Great Ocean Road – they weren’t following the rules,” she said. Victoria had 16 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday – its lowest in several weeks. It has 12 patients in intensive care. In Tasmania, Premier Peter Gutwein announced a statewide police blitz and an “effective lockdown” in the north-west. “Today the gloves come off. We are going to police this. The period of education is over,” Mr Gutwein said. “If you go to a shack and you don’t have a reasonable excuse to be there, you will be asked to leave. If you don’t, you will be summonsed and charged. “Do not be surprised if you face the full front of the law over this weekend.” Police would also use helicopters to spot people travelling unnecessarily, Mr Gutwein said. Fines of up to $16,800 or six months’ jail apply for those who break the law. Tasmania has 23 virus cases linked to the North West Regional Hospital or North West Private Hospital in Burnie. Nine new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Tasmania on Wednesday night, taking the state’s tally to 107. Queensland will tighten its already tough restrictions, requiring anyone trying to cross into the state to have a border pass from midnight Friday. The state will also require residents returning from coronavirus hotspots, such as greater Sydney, to go into quarantine for 14 days. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk urged Queensland residents to stay at home. “This is no time to be travelling past the border and there is a real risk that you pose, not only to yourself and your family, but to other Queenslanders,” she said. “This is not the time to go into NSW.” In Western Australia, police will clampdown on crowds visiting Perth’s beaches. Deputy Commissioner Gary Dreibergs said too many people were simply lying around socialising on the coast. “If you want to go to the beach, go, have a swim, pack up your towel, go back to your car, head home,” Mr Dreibergs told 6PR radio. He said police would heavily patrol beaches as WA enjoyed warm weather. Temperatures in Perth are forecast to peak about 36 degrees on Good Friday.

The number of new coronavirus cases has declined for the fourth-straight day, giving the best evidence yet that New Zealand has squashed the spread of the deadly infection. A fortnight ago, the Kiwi government implemented a near society-wide lockdown, with particularly strong restrictions on business, to combat the spread of COVID-19. On the evidence of the first half of the lockdown, Ms Ardern believes her country is winning the fight. “At the halfway mark I have no hesitation in saying, that what New Zealanders have done over the last two weeks is huge,” she said. “In the face of the greatest threat to human health we have seen in over a century, Kiwis have quietly and collectively implemented a nationwide wall of defence. “You are breaking the chain of transmission. And you did it for each other.” Ms Ardern has also announced her government will decide whether to extend or relax the lockdown, which is due to expire at midnight on April 22. New Zealand could drop the arrangements on April 20. One Kiwi has died to date, a 75-year-old South Island woman. New Zealand will also implement new controls to keep case numbers down.

There will also be roadblocks across the country to stop Kiwis travelling to beach houses or to visit family over Easter. “As we head in to Easter I say thank you to you and your bubble,” Ms Ardern said, warning against complacency. “We have what we need to win this marathon. “You have stayed calm, you’ve been strong, you’ve saved lives, and now we need to keep going.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'We need to care for them': Fines for coughing, spitting on health workers","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/09\/fine-spitting-health-worker\/","transcript":"Coughing or spitting on healthcare workers in NSW will bring an on-the-spot $5000 fine under measures introduced on Thursday. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said a disturbing trend of abuse and assault towards people in uniform amid the coronavirus pandemic had prompted the move. He said it was disappointing the fines needed to be introduced. “How incredibly ridiculous is it that anybody could think it’s acceptable to spit or caught on front-line health workers, health officials, police or indeed any of our Border Force officials?” he said. “These front-line workers are caring for us and the simple fact is we need to care for them.” The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association has reported healthcare workers in uniform are being assaulted on trains, refused service at grocery stories and spat on. On Wednesday, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt warned that people who deliberately coughed on health workers or abused them faced the possibility of life in jail. “Interestingly, two people have been charged in the ACT for precisely this type of behaviour,” Mr Hunt said. “And the same will occur in other jurisdictions as well.” On a more positive note, Aussies are being urged to show their support for front-line workers in the coronavirus crisis with a mass round of applause on Thursday night. The Cheer4Frontliners campaign urges Australians to “cheer, clap, yelp, bang pots, make noise” from doorsteps, balconies, windows and backyards from 8pm on Thursday. It is inspired by a similar show of clapping in Britain for its National Health Service and has been organised by a social enterprise called Frontliners. Frontliners has contributed $2 million in products, including care packages, to health and emergency workers leading the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. The organisation said the campaign would also make up for some of the “disgusting abuse” some health care workers and police officers have endured during the COVID-19 pandemic. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Tasmanian farmer's rhubarb bubbly idea attracts reprimand from France","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/04\/09\/rhubarb-champagne-farmer\/","transcript":"A Tasmanian farmer has earned a firm ticking-off from France after suggesting people could make their excess rhubarb into champagne. Guy Robertson from Penguin, in the state’s north-west, has turned his business over to deliveries after losing all of almost his usual sales at traditional farmers’ markets and festivals, restaurants and in on-farm experiences overnight because of the COVID-19 outbreak. “The first week was the sleepless week,” Mr Robertson said. “Then we realised we could put everything online.” The Mount Gnomon Farm website was born – and Mr Robertson is now busy selling meat, vegetables, and fruit online, as well as products from other local artisan producers. But it was a post on social media that landed him in hot water with the French. He has been including in-season rhubarb in his produce boxes, and suggested anyone who had too much should treat themselves, as he had, by brewing some homemade rhubarb bubbly, which he termed champagne. A couple of days later, he answered the phone to a French official. “In the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action about the farm’s production of rhubarb champagne,” Mr Robertson wrote in a Facebook post. “I never thought that 10 litres of rhubarb cordial for our own consumption would be on the radar in France.”  Yesterday in the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action… Posted by Mount Gnomon Farm on Monday, April 6, 2020 The French official told Mr Robertson that organisations such as the Comité Champagne protect and promote the Champagne brand. “He was a really nice guy, he said: ‘I know it’s a really bad time around the world at the moment, but our legal team takes it very seriously’,” Mr Robertson told ABC Radio. “He said he has been doing it for three years and it’s his job to make sure everyone complies and nobody markets their bubbles as champagne unless you come from the Champagne region in France. “It was a funny moment for me, I just couldn’t believe I had a call from France in the current climate about 10 litres of home brew that we aren’t even marketing.” Apparently, among Mount Gnomon Farm’s thousands of social media fans is a French person, who was concerned by Mr Robertson’s post. The post was reported – and the man in France then followed it up. “They take their job very seriously,” Mr Robertson said. “It made me laugh and laugh. “If I ever go into the production of rhubarb champagne, I’ll have to call it something different.” In other respects, Mount Gnomon farm is proving resilient. Mr Robertson said he was delivering food boxes throughout Tasmania. “The most encouraging thing is the community support,” he said. “We’re trying to focus on what we can do rather than what we can’t do.” For Easter, he has 70 deliveries around the state’s north-west, 50 to Launceston and 60 to Hobart – all driven by himself. And rhubarb will be in all the produce boxes. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW Police seize Ruby Princess's 'black box' in overnight raid","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/09\/nsw-police-seize-ruby-princesss-black-box-in-overnight-raid-for-coronavirus-investigation\/","transcript":"NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has confirmed there has been a raid on the Ruby Princess under order by the state coroner. He said investigators who boarded the ship on Wednesday evening had spoken to the ship’s captain who was “extremely helpful”. “Ships have a black box very similar to that of international planes and that and other evidence has been seized for further investigation,” he said. Commissioner Fuller said there were still more than 1,000 crew on the ship, three-quarters of whom want to stay on the vessel. “They feel safe on the ship, and I think that’s a good outcome.” The ship is docked at Port Kembla, south of Sydney. The vessel is at the centre of a COVID-19 criminal investigation into whether the ship’s operator downplayed the number of potential coronavirus cases on board, before it was allowed to dock in Sydney on March 19. About 2,700 passengers disembarked the ship and it has since become the largest source of coronavirus infections in Australia. More than 600 cases of COVID-19 and 15 deaths are linked the to the ship. The 1,000 crew remaining on he ship are from 50 different countries. About 200 are displaying flu-like symptoms and 18 have been diagnosed with coronavirus. Commissioner Fuller announced the criminal investigation would probe the communications, actions and other circumstances that led to the docking and disembarking of the ship. A team of 30 investigators have been seconded to Strike Force Bast to conduct the inquiry. The strike force includes intelligence analysts and other specialist officers. The ship moved to the Illawarra region on Monday morning. International Transport Workers Federation national coordinator Dean Summers said he was worried about the treatment of the workers on board. “Get them off the ship and isolate them somewhere else,” Mr Summers said. “They just want to be treated like the passengers, like everybody else, with a bit of dignity.” Mr Summers said the ship should have remained docked in Sydney. “Who would make a decision to send a ship with sick people on it away from three hospitals and towards a regional centre,” he said. “To try and hide it behind a coal stockpile and so the ship is going to be covered in coal dust and out of sight, out of mind, it is an unjustifiable position.” The vessel is due to leave Port Kembla and return to Bermuda in seven days."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus fallout slashes job advertisements by two-thirds","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/work\/2020\/04\/09\/coronavirus-job-ads\/","transcript":"Job advertisements have been slashed by two-thirds as Australian businesses absorb the economic pain of the coronavirus. Victoria and NSW have shown the biggest declines on jobs website Seek as the pandemic drives a wrecking ball through the national labour market. Seek managing director Kendra Banks said the impact of the virus had been swift and extreme, compounding problems already caused by the summer’s bushfire crisis. She said two key trends were emerging during the pandemic: A mass reduction in available jobs at a national level, and an urgent demand for workers in specific industries. Retailers are hunting for shelf stackers, delivery drivers, supply chain managers and warehouse supervisors. Manufacturers need more factory workers to keep up with increased demand for household staples, while large resources companies are looking to fill highly-skilled roles. As more people in employment work from home, software developers and cyber security experts are in high demand, along with nannies and tutors. Healthcare workers and call centre staff are also highly sought after. The Morrison government wants workers displaced by COVID-19 to consider a career in naval shipbuilding. The federally-funded Naval Shipbuilding College is teaming up with the hardest hit industries to launch a recruitment drive. The college has established an online jobs portal and is rolling out a range of training short courses focused on priority roles in the shipbuilding field. New jobs ads posted on Seek in the first week of April were down 65.3 per cent compared to the same time last year. Victorian ads were down 71.6 per cent and there were 67.4 per cent fewer available jobs in NSW. Despite the dramatic declines, people surveyed by Seek were fairly upbeat about their job prospects. Confidence among unemployed people has fallen but more than half still believe they will find work. The feeling of job security has dropped among people in work but more than half still believe they are safe in their current roles. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"At least 50 Qantas workers infected with coronavirus as clusters emerge","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/09\/qantas-workers-coronavirus-cases\/","transcript":"Several more Qantas flights, both international and domestic, have been crewed by staff with COVID-19, as questions surround the exemption from the 14-day self-isolation rule for airline crews. The revelations come as the Transport Workers Union says it lodged notice alleging a breach of workplace safety against the airline on Wednesday. About 50 Qantas workers – including pilots, cabin crew and baggage handlers – have reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus. The airline says it is managing the various clusters, and that most cases are from community transmission – including four cabin crew who Qantas says probably caught the virus while in Santiago on an emergency flight to bring Australians home. On their return to Australia, the cabin crew were exempt from the quarantine imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19. Since their diagnoses, they have been in self-isolation. “There’s been no confirmed cases of transmission of the coronavirus to employees or customers on board our aircraft, or any aircraft globally for that matter,” Qantas said. “That includes instances where someone unwittingly travelled on one of our flights while infected with coronavirus, based on our discussions with health authorities.” The other concerning cluster is among 17 baggage handlers at Adelaide airport. Qantas said that was thought to have originated from a worker who returned from an overseas holiday and went back to work with virus symptoms. Their co-workers were also then infected. The Transport Workers’ Union says a Qantas worker in Sydney is the latest case among the airline’s staff. Other cases include the baggage handlers in Adelaide, 19 cabin crew and eight pilots. The union said on Thursday it had requested documents under lawful entry powers from Qantas over breaches of workplace health and safety laws. “With confirmation of yet another worker infected, people right across the airline will be worried about going home to their families and spreading the infection to them,” TWU NSW Branch Secretary Richard Olsen said. “We believe that Qantas is in breach of workplace health and safety laws and has not been putting in place systems to minimise the risk.” Mr Olsen said workers were too scared to speak up. “At Sydney airport, a worker remains suspended after Qantas took action against him for raising concerns about COVID-19,” he said. “Now Qantas is being investigated by SafeWork NSW but it shows no sign of changing its tune and putting in place protections for workers.” Union national secretary Michael Kaine said Qantas had shown a frightening disregard for worker safety since the outbreak of the coronavirus. “It has operated a business-as-usual response, refusing to hear workers’ concerns about the lack of information, consultation, training and protective gear,” he said. “Now over 50 Qantas workers have been infected and we believe Qantas has serious questions to answer.” In other measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Qantas said it now required crew to stay in their hotel rooms if they were overseas between flights. “We have also advised crew to simply not come to work if they are feeling ill, particularly with early cold or flu-like symptoms,” it said. In addition, all crew are provided with masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Speed of coronavirus deaths shocks New York doctors","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/09\/coronavirus-deaths-new-york\/","transcript":"Diana Torres, a nurse at Mount Sinai in New York City, is in a fearful mood as New York records its highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in a single day. “I’m paranoid, scared to walk out of their room.” Patients “look fine, feel fine, then you turn around and they’re unresponsive,” Ms Torres said. The number of coronavirus cases in New York state alone approached 150,000 on Wednesday (local time), the highest in the US, even as authorities warned the state’s official death tally may understate the true number. Veteran doctors and nurses are expressing shock at the speed with which patients are declining and dying. It isn’t just elderly or patients with underlying health conditions who appear to be fine one minute and at death’s door the next. It can happen for the young and healthy, too. “Every number is a face, ” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ordered flags flown at half-staff across New York in recognition of the toll. “This virus attacked the vulnerable and attacked the weak and it’s our job as a society to protect the vulnerable.” New York has become the epicentre of the pandemic in the United States where the virus has infected more than 415,000 people. Officials said a recent surge in the number of people dying at home suggests the most populous US city may be undercounting how many have died of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the pathogen. “I think that’s a very real possibility,” Mr Cuomo told his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo said 779 people died in the past day in his state. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said 275 had died there. Both totals exceeded one-day records reported just a day earlier. Mr Cuomo said the death count would continue at the current level or increase in the coming days as critically ill patients, who have been hospitalised for more than a week and on ventilator machines to assist in breathing, die. Tragically, New York lost an additional 779 people yesterday to COVID-19. They are more than just a statistic. Every number is a face. Every number is a family. We mourn these New Yorkers deeply. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) April 8, 2020  California, like New York, had one of its highest single-day death tolls with 68 people dying of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, Governor Gavin Newsom said. Louisiana Governor John Edwards said the number of new coronavirus cases reported in the past 24 hours – 746 – was lower than recent days. Louisiana had been one of the nation’s hot spots for the virus. “We do believe we are beginning to see the flattening of the curve,” he said. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he would like to reopen the US economy with a “big bang”, but that the death toll from the coronavirus needs to be on the down slope before that can happen. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"William and Kate wow on virtual visit to British school","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/royal\/2020\/04\/09\/william-kate-virtual-school-visit\/","transcript":"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have praised NHS staff and other key workers for doing an “amazing job” as they met some of their children during a virtual visit to a school in Britain’s north.

With Easter days away, some of the children wore bunny ears for the visit, the duchess was given a virtual posey and William was left stumped by an inquisitive youngster’s question.  Teachers across the UK are dedicating their time to keeping schools open for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.

I think everyone is just pleased to be able to help.” William added: “Good northern volunteering spirit going on up there, very good of you!” There was a lighter moment when one of the children asked the future king: “The first William was William the Conqueror. What do you want to be called?” The duke laughed before bashfully swerving the question, saying: “I don’t think I can answer that.” When the youngsters showed off their self-made bunny ears, William laughed, saying: “I like your bunny ears, they look like the real deal – that’s a strong look!”  The couple spent an hour speaking to children – who held up pictures of their parents – including 10-year-old Harris, whose mother is still working as an NHS administrator for health visitors, and Lloyd, nine, whose mother is employed at a special needs school. “This is a picture of my mum and she works for the NHS as an admin for the health visitors and I’m really proud of her,” Harris said.

On Thursday morning, Ms Berejiklian ordered Mr Harwin to return to Sydney, after he was sprung at his Central Coast holiday house despite bans on non-essential travel. Mr Harwin had reportedly been at his million-dollar holiday home in Pearl Beach for three weeks, despite authorities pleading with Sydneysiders to stay out of regional towns because of the deadly coronavirus pandemic. Mr Harwin’s main residence is an apartment in Sydney’s eastern suburbs – more than an hour from Pearl Beach. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Harwin rejected he was “tourist” and claimed he’d spent most of the past four months at Pearl Beach. The 55-year-old said he’d chosen to move out of Sydney for health reasons as someone with comorbidities and a history of respiratory problems. NSW is the Australian state hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, and authorities – including Ms Berejiklian – have spent days warning people not to go away over the Easter break. On Thursday, Ms Berejiklian conceded “the perception is horrible”. She said she had been made aware of the situation a few days ago. “I regret and apologise to everybody that somebody from my team took this action,” Ms Berejiklian said. “It’s not just about sticking to the rules, it’s about making sure there’s a perception that everybody is sticking to the rules, including members of parliament.” She said Mr Harwin had broken no rules because he went to his holiday house before NSW’s tough social-distancing shutdown was announced in March. “[But] they are very serious circumstances and I don’t want to take away from that,” she said. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he would ask for an explanation from Mr Harwin. “If it doesn’t stack up, I’ll ask for a ticket,” he said. “We have evidence in terms of photographs, and if the explanation doesn’t stack up we will let you know and give him a ticket for $1000.” NSW Labor is calling on Mr Harwin to resign or, failing that, for Ms Berejiklian to step in and relieve him of his ministerial duties. “He’s been selfish and he should be brought to account,” shadow arts minister Walt Secord said. Ms Berejiklian, however, said she wasn’t inclined to sack a minister on the basis of a potential fine but would wait for police to first establish the facts. “If someone is shown to act in a way which is against the ministerial code or against the laws of this state, of course I’ll take action,” she said. Officials across the world have been caught flouting self isolation rule, including Scotland’s chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood who resigned after she was busted going to her beach house. In New Zealand, Health Minister David Clark was caught mountain biking. That’s not banned under NZ’s strict rules, but the fact he drove several kilometres  – in a van emblazoned with an image of his face – to do it is. Mr Clark kept his cabinet job but was demoted by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after admitting a second lockdown breach – driving his family 20 kilometres to visit a beach. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Woman eye gouges supermarket worker","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/04\/09\/eye-gouge-supermarket-worker\/","transcript":"A woman has allegedly spat in a supermarket worker’s face and gouged her eyes after being denied entry to a store on the NSW South Coast.

Police investigating the case found the victims were all from Vietnam and ranged in age from 15 to 44 and are believed to have paid people traffickers to smuggle them into England. Most of the victims were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial reward fuel migration.

The PM’s improving condition is welcome good news in Britain, which is facing a devastating day of mourning amid an unprecedented spike in the number of people dying of COVID-19. After two days in intensive care, Mr Johnson can finally “sit up in bed”, finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Thursday morning (Australian time). Although the hospital indicated he was “improving”, Mr Johnson needed to remain in intensive care, Mr Sunak said. “The prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend, and my thoughts are with him and his family,” he added. Despite his progress, Mr Johnson still requires assistance getting enough oxygen during his treatment for persistent coronavirus symptoms at St Thomas’ Hospital in London. His spokesman, James Slack, earlier said Mr Johnson was continuing to receive “standard oxygen treatment” but remained “clinically stable” and was in “good spirits”. Mr Johnson was admitted to hospital on Monday, 10 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19. He was transferred to intensive care when his condition deteriorated. Mr Slack declined to provide further details of Mr Johnson’s treatment, saying Thursday’s update “contains all of the information which the PM’s medical team considers to be clinically relevant”. As Mr Johnson entered his third day in intensive care, Britain reported a new daily record of 938 hospital deaths linked to coronavirus infections, taking its total to more than 7000. The British health ministry said the total of confirmed infections rose to nearly 61,000 from 282,000 people tested. Government experts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people are infected. Though significantly larger than the previous highest toll of 786, new cases were not “accelerating out of control”, deputy chief scientific adviser Professor Dame Angela McLean said. NHS England’s national medical director, Professor Stephen Powis, warned that “this is not the time to become complacent”, however. “We are beginning to see the benefits, I believe (of following government measures), but the really critical thing, I believe, is that we have to continue following instructions, we have to continue following social distancing, because if we don’t, the virus will start to spread again,” he said. Health experts have criticised the British government’s slow response to the crisis, the low level of testing for the virus and the poor provision of intensive care beds, ventilators and protective equipment. In London, buses began introducing stricter measures to protect drivers and other staff from possible infection, following the death of at least nine infected drivers. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said measures would include protective screens for drivers, enhanced cleaning, restricting passengers to boarding through middle doors and increased social distancing. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus Australia: Ruby Princess cruise ship raided by NSW police","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/09\/coronavirus-ruby-princess-police-raid\/","transcript":"Detectives clad in hazmat suits have raided the Ruby Princess cruise ship and questioned its captain and crew about how hundreds of passengers were allowed to disembark in Sydney last month. The late-night raid came after a 62-year-old South Australian woman who had been on the recent Ruby Princess voyage died from the coronavirus, bringing Australia’s death toll to 50. NSW detectives boarded the vessel at Port Kembla on Wednesday night, in a sign of a rapidly escalating criminal probe into the docking of the US-owned ship. They seized evidence and questioned crew members to try and get to the bottom of how the vessel became linked to hundreds of COVID-19 cases and more than a dozen deaths across Australia. “Strike Force Bast investigators are conducting inquiries on board the Ruby Princess this evening,” NSW Police said. “The operation is being conducted under the strictest health and workplace safety guidelines.” In coming days, police will interview other high-priority witnesses about the scandal. The vessel is expected to remain at Port Kembla for 10 days with 1040 crew members having medical assessments. About 200 crew have shown symptoms of coronavirus, while 18 have so far tested positive. New COVID-19 infections continue to stabilise with NSW recording 48 new cases on Wednesday, taking the state’s total to 2734. There are 36 people in intensive care and the death toll remains at 21. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian welcomed the ongoing stabilisation and decline of new cases but warned community transmission was still increasing. She said that while social distancing would be necessary until a coronavirus vaccine or cure is found, restrictions are being reviewed on a month-by-month basis. She reminded people to adhere to restrictions, which are having a positive effect, as authorities keep a watchful eye on increasing community transmission. The number of new cases has fallen to single digits in several other states and territories. Nine new cases were confirmed across Tasmania on Wednesday night according to the public health department, taking the state’s total number of infections to 107. Three of those are staff at either the North West Regional Hospital in Burnie or the neighbouring North West Private Hospital. Four cases are patients who recently received care at the NWRH or NWPH. Twelve staff at the NWRH have previously tested positive to the virus, as have two inpatients. South Australia reported another five cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, taking the state toll to 420. Sixteen people were being treated in hospital with seven of those in intensive care. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bernie Sanders drops out of 2020 Democratic race","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/09\/bernie-sanders-drops-out-presidential-race\/","transcript":"US Senator Bernie Sanders has cleared the way for former vice president Joe Biden to go head-to-head with Donald Trump in November’s critical general election.

But as Australia’s coronavirus case numbers pass 6000, viral experts warn that ‘immunity passports’ allowing people to return to work would likely be of little use. In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun conducting blood tests to see if people have been exposed to the coronavirus without showing symptoms. The tentative idea is that those who have had the virus will be immune to it, and could go back to their normal lives, attending school and going to work. “We’re just starting to do testing and we’ll report out on these very quickly,” Joe Bresee, deputy incident manager for the CDC said. “We think the serum studies will be very important to understand what the true amount of infection is out in the community.” In Germany, researchers are preparing a study of more than 100,000 volunteers to determine if any are already immune to COVID-19. To track the progress of the virus, the tests will be repeated in larger numbers and, depending on the results, it may mean that certain areas of the country could reopen. Students could go back to school and those with jobs could return to work. Research leader Gerard Krause, head of epidemiology at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig, said those who have recovered could potentially be given an ‘immunity passport’ to travel freely. “Those who are immune could be issued with a kind of vaccination pass that would, for example, allow them to exempted from restrictions on their activity,” Dr Krause said. But University of Melbourne epidemiologist Kathryn Snow said we need to be careful when considering so-called herd immunity. “I guess the first thing to say is it’s really important to be clear about herd immunity as a side effect – a thing that naturally happens – rather than herd immunity as a strategy, which is what the UK was talking about,” she said. For herd immunity to work, lots of us would need to catch the virus, likely flooding our health system, and resulting in more deaths. “What they’re saying is, ‘let everyone catch it and it will be fine’, and that’s absolutely not true,” she said. But we have used immunity to help with outbreaks in the past. During the worst Ebola outbreak, some patients who recovered then volunteered to help in hospitals, she said. “This has been done with Ebola,” Dr Snow said. “In the West African outbreak, some people who recovered actually went and worked in the hospitals. “Because obviously for the average person, you have to be very brave. “But if you have had it and recovered, you’re pretty safe, so some of those people acted as volunteers.” But importantly, there are still a lot of things about COVID-19 we don’t know, like how long immunity will last, and how accurate the tests are, she said. “There are two things that will be important. “First, how reliable the test for immunity is. “Second, how strong is our immunity. If this was a strain of flu, we would know so much more about our immunity. “We don’t know with this virus yet how strong the protection is going to be, how good the test is, and how strong the immunity is.” Australia’s recovered case numbers are currently too small to be much of an impact, said Professor Emeritus Gerry Fitzgerald, a public health expert from the Queensland University of Technology. “When you think about it in Australia, we would be looking at over 2500 people now,” Professor Fitzgerald said. “Which, in a country of 25 million, is not a significant contribution to the workforce. “While the principle is that people who have had the disease will be immune, and we assume they are, we’re not sure it’s a good thing they would be free return to work.” But if we did implement a ‘back to work’ policy for those who had recovered, the easiest way would for them carry a letter around, he said. “It sounds OK in theory and clearly individuals could obtain a letter of clearance to say they have recovered, and that would entitle them to go back to work,” he said. “To set up an administrator would seem cumbersome. It may be well, that if you have recovered you can carry something around, like a letter from the doctor.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus holiday debate: Kangaroo Island travel ‘isn't illegal’, MP says","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/09\/easter-coronavirus-kangaroo-island\/","transcript":"A politician who owns a Kangaroo Island holiday home has slammed the “them and us attitude” of some locals, as pressure mounts on people not to travel amid the coronavirus pandemic. South Australian MP Frank Pangallo said “it isn’t illegal for people to visit their own property”, declaring “regardless I don’t have COVID-19”. In response to concerns from island locals over whether he was planning to head to the island for Easter, Mr Pangallo said he would remain in Adelaide. But he added: “I actually pay my rates and taxes on the island and my business supports the local economy”. “The last time I looked, Kangaroo Island was not a republic.” The island’s mayor Michael Pengilly slammed people planning to leave their primary home as “selfish”. “We haven’t got any (confirmed coronavirus) cases I’m aware of at the moment and we don’t want any,” Cr Pengilly told The New Daily. The respective comments further highlight the debate over whether it is illegal – or just irresponsible – for people to go away for an Easter break. It appears leaders are not immune from the confusion over the various virus shutdown rules around the world. Earlier this week, Scotland’s chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood resigned after she was busted going to her beach house. In New Zealand, Health Minister David Clark was caught mountain biking (which is not banned under NZ’s strict rules, but the fact he drove several kilometres to do it is). On Wednesday night, it emerged that NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin had been staying at a beach house instead of in his Sydney apartment. After being pictured at the holiday home, Mr Harwin told The Daily Telegraph he had been staying on the Central Coast for three weeks. It was more comfortable and he had set up a work from home station, he said. The NSW government has urged residents to cancel all non-essential travel to regional towns and urged Easter holiday-makers to postpone their trips. The state’s Police Commissioner, Mick Fuller, said people should lockdown wherever their “primary home” is to prevent regional hospitals becoming overwhelmed. For weeks, the message has been clear: Australians must stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus through the community. Regional leaders have also made it known they don’t want visitors. They fear it could increase the risk of transmission of the virus and put an unnecessary strain on supermarkets and regional healthcare. In remote Victorian towns such as bushfire-ravaged Mallacoota, where tourists far outnumber locals during Easter, there is only one doctor. The danger of a deadly outbreak is too great to risk. “If somebody brought the virus to Mallacoota and infected the residents, we would not have a system in place that would cope,” East Gippsland Mayor John White told The New Daily. “If people do the right thing and don’t come, then we shouldn’t have any problems.” In Beechworth, a regional town in north-east Victoria known for its gold mining history and Ned Kelly connections, the message is the same. “Please, do not come here,” Indigo Shire Mayor Jenny O’Connor told The New Daily. “This is a vulnerable community – we have a lot of older people and limited health services. “We got whacked by the fire season and now our tourism is shut down, so it’s really hard to say ‘don’t come’, but we can’t afford to risk it.” If you’re thinking of spending Easter with the fairy penguins at Phillip Island, think again. The popular beach destination off Victoria’s southern coast is usually heaving with tourists over the long weekend, but this year every one of the shire’s beaches will be closed. Bass Coast Shire Mayor Brett Tessari told The New Daily the mass shutdown was specifically “to deter visitors”. In Byron Bay, home to celebrities such as actor Chris Hemsworth, prominent locals have urged visitors to stay home. Musician John Butler and TV host Shelley Craft are among a group of celebrities featuring in a video created by Byron Shire Council.  #ByronStayHome It feels strange for us to be saying this, but please #ByronStayHome.We cannot welcome any visitors right now.Residents, please stay in your own homes and villages as much as possible.Be calm, be kind, stay safe and stay home! Posted by Byron Shire Council on Thursday, April 2, 2020 Byron Shire Mayor Simon Richardson told The New Daily the town “loved visitors, but not now”. “It’s a very tough decision because it’s in our DNA to have visitors, but right now we don’t want anyone to come here,” Cr Richardson said. “Right now is the time for our community to look after ourselves and people coming here puts a strain on our ability to do that.” For those still wondering if they should travel over Easter, the message is clear: Stay home. Many tourist hotspots have already been devastated by bushfires. The last thing locals want is a coronavirus outbreak."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Stripped of dignity, yearning curve still needs plenty of work","date":"04-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/2020\/04\/09\/coronavirus-dignity-work-from-home\/","transcript":"Congratulations, Australia. It appears we have flattened the COVID-19 curve … for now, at least. It may be too soon to relax completely, but feel free over this Easter long weekend to take a break from frantically weaving more face masks for the family and distilling alcohol (yes, of course I believe you when you say it’s only so you can brew more hand sanitiser for the needy neighbours). For most of us, this sustained period of physical distancing and isolation has helped ensure we will eventually emerge from the current pandemic with our health intact. But what about our dignity? Perhaps it’s time to stop, draw breath and assess how that is being affected by our new circumstances and routines. For some, of course, dignity went out the window with the first wave of panic-buying and hoarding. Those caught with a couple of container-loads of medical gloves and gowns that they now can’t move or profiteer from, thanks to Gumtree’s sensible decision yesterday to ban the listing of such items – you know who you are. At least you’ll now have your “naughty nurse” outfits sorted for every Halloween from now until the year 2093. Thankfully, at this stage most decent people are still trying to resist the urge to embrace the law of the jungle. A useful gauge to measure how you’re doing on that front is whether you are still wearing pants during Zoom calls. Take it from someone who has worked from home, on and off, for years. Almost everyone begins with the same determination not to lower their standards, even if they are now working on a laptop balanced on the ironing board in the laundry, because it’s the only room in the house where the piercing sounds of Super Smash Bros can’t be heard. They declare they will still get dressed, do their hair and make-up, and turn up to their desk, just as they did when working in an office. But be warned. The road to hell – or at least abject humiliation – is paved with good intentions, including that admirable decision to spend the time you’d normally waste in a morning commute doing an online fitness class streamed by your gym. The next thing you know, you’re on an emergency Skype call, giving strategic advice in an oversized Choose Life T-shirt so threadbare that your boss can see the hot pink animal print sports bra underneath. To be fair, even this experienced work-from-homer has been distracted by the profusion of intriguing exercise options that have popped up online since the government forced the closure of all gyms. Somehow I recently convinced myself that the opportunity to learn to box with four-time boxing world champion Danny Green via a Facebook Live event was too good to miss. Key learning: It turns out you can even injure yourself shadow-boxing. But the pain of the chronic neck injury I exacerbated while imagining myself as Rocky pales in comparison to the hurt inflicted on my ego when my 14-year-old son walked in on the session. He has never heard of Sylvester Stallone. Who knew the words “But Mum, you just can’t” could carry so much power? He’s right, of course. It’s time working from home more closely resembled working from work. Could somebody please launch an app that recreates the slow meander to the vending machine outside the staff canteen, and the indecision over which junk food to buy today? Or perhaps a Facebook Live group that generates a stream of gossip and venting similar to the one you indulge in with the barista, when you duck out for coffee before the weekly staff meeting? At least they’d be safer than working out at home. And who said anything about flattening our own curves anyway?"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Parliament passes $130 billion JobKeeper wage subsidies package","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/08\/parliament-passes-jobkeeper-package\/","transcript":"Eligible workers are set to receive a $1500-a-fortnight wage subsidy for at least six months after Parliament approved the $130 billion JobKeeper legislation on Wednesday night. The Senate gave bills to establish the JobKeeper program, paving the way for up to six million employees to receive the cash in what is the single largest piece of government spending in Australian history. More than 730,000 businesses have registered for the JobKeeper program since it was announced last week. They will be given the money via the Australian Taxation Office to pass on to workers as the government desperately tries to save millions of jobs during the coronavirus pandemic.

Labor and the Greens had argued for changes to the scheme to include more casuals and migrants on temporary work visas, arguing more than one million people in each cohort would be excluded. “Many needy Australians will miss out,” Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese told the lower house. But the government rejected the push, insisting a line had to be drawn somewhere. Many who are not eligible for JobKeeper can potentially access $1100 a fortnight in dole payments, which have been temporarily doubled during the crisis. JobKeeper payments will be made to employers for up to six months, backdated to March 30. The government also rebuffed calls to include council workers in the wage subsidies, arguing they were a state responsibility. Mr Albanese later acknowledged on Twitter that the package “isn’t perfect’’. ‘‘But while it might not be perfect, this package is good. It will make a difference to people’s lives. It will save livelihoods. It’s the direct result of the constructive role that unions, businesses, community leaders and Labor have played – together,” Mr Albanese said. ‘‘As we rebuild, we should be guided by the principle of an economy that works for people, not the other way around. “And we should be reminded of just how much we rely upon each other – and how much stronger we all are when we all work together.

Super Consumers Australia – the retirement savings arm of consumer group Choice – has warned members that the government’s early access to super scheme should only be used as a last resort. Research from the consumer advocacy group found that members who withdraw $20,000 now could lose almost $50,000 by the time they retire. Those losses represent the returns normally generated through compound interest that members will miss out on by taking their savings out before retirement. As a result, younger Australians stand to lose significantly more than their older counterparts if they tap into their super now to cover day-to-day expenses – potentially forcing them to work for longer before retiring.  “Depending on how old you are, withdrawing money now could see you having to work much longer to make up the difference before you retire,” Super Consumers Australia director Xavier O’Halloran said. “There are a number of financial assistance options to help people through these tough times. “Super will be the right option for some, but you should be looking at what else is available and possible cuts to discretionary spending before raiding the cookie jar.” Council on the Ageing chief Ian Yates said super members need only cast their minds back to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) 10 years ago to see the damage that early access to super can cause their retirement. “One of the tragedies of the GFC was that people crystallised their losses by taking their diminished funds out of their super accounts,” he said. “Our message is that, if at all possible, if your savings are in super, keep them in super.” Mr Yates noted that members who move their savings into a more conservative investment portfolio within super have the option to put it back into higher-returning growth options later. But he warned that those who take it out might never be able to put it back in. Although withdrawing money from super before retirement will significantly erode your savings, Choice policy and campaigns adviser Patrick Veyret said it will be necessary for some. Before deciding to take that money out of super, however, Mr Veyret said it’s important to explore every other option available first. And he encouraged anyone considering accessing their super to seek guidance from qualified professionals before doing so. “If people are in financial difficulty, we encourage them to contact financial counsellors, not financial advisers,” he said. “Financial counsellors offer a free and independent service. They can help people navigate through financial hardship, access government payments, and assist with any debt matters.” The comments from Choice and Super Consumers Australia follow similar warnings from the superannuation industry. In March, Industry Super Australia cautioned that 20-year-old members withdrawing the full $20,000 could miss out on more than $100,000 over the course of their working life. “Members need to tread carefully before they think of cracking open their retirement nest egg as it comes at a steep price,” Industry Super Australia chief executive Bernie Dean said at the time. “For millions, the government early release scheme could allow them to wipe out their super balance, meaning they have to start again.” Mr Dean warned it could take decades to recover from withdrawing large sums from super before retirement.

Here’s how to keep kids focused","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/education\/2020\/04\/08\/coronavirus-schools-online-tips\/","transcript":"Victorian students will front up to their first day of term 2 next week in freshly laundered uniforms – but they’ll be in very different classrooms. They’ll be at home. The state, on April 6, officially moved all government and non-government schools to online learning (where possible) and it will vastly change the way students, teachers and households operate. Other states are employing similar tactics, and more announcements could flow as soon as this week, in line with national discussions. It’s just another part of the way society is being forced to adapt to the coronavirus outbreak. The move to online learning has prompted some fears from experts, that it will drive an even bigger wedge between the haves and the have-nots. The Conversation published a story last week that compared the ‘digital divide’ that exists for students within Australia. “About 87 per cent of Australians can access the internet at home. But only 68 per cent of Australian children aged five to 14 living in disadvantaged communities have internet access at home, compared to 91 per cent of students living in advantaged communities,” the piece penned by University of New South Wales’ Amy Graham and Pasi Sahlberg said. Beyond the physical and technical barriers to learning, there’s also the issue of radically overhauling a key component of daily living: Going to school, learning and going home. This is where it’s imperative for parents and children to be on the same page, teacher-turned-author Gabbie Stroud said. “We need to just accept that this is going to be a disruptive and disorganised year for students,” Ms Stroud told The New Daily. She said a key part of that was adjusting expectations for students’ performance, and drawing children closer to parents, as family units moved together in this new world. While it’s an instinct, as a parent, to protect a child, in this situation it’s important to keep children up to date with what’s happening, and to let them know that it’s OK to feel uncertain or even overwhelmed, Ms Stroud said. “Loop the kids in, put them on the same page as you. As the adults, we don’t need to protect them from this, we can draw them in,” she said. “We all just need to take care of one another right now.” It’s going to take a lot of adjustment from all parties involved to get this new-look education working seamlessly. These are Ms Stroud’s top tips for parents transitioning their children to home learning. Find a routine and stick to it “Kids respond very well to boundaries, routine – parents need to put all of that in place,” Ms Stroud advised. “Sit down and have a family meeting, discuss ‘Here’s what our days are going to look like’. “Find your own rhythm and routine, what works for your family. Once you find that, build on it. “In my family, we’ve realised that we can be dressed, breakfasted, bed made and ready by 8.30am – and then we can knock off early. That works for us. “In my experience, if you take that time wisely to set up expectations and routines for kids, it does become like a well-oiled machine. While it feels like a big challenge for parents setting that up … but take a day off your own work and set it up; it will be worth your dividends.” Online learning doesn’t mean constant screen time “Kids need plenty of breaks from screen time throughout the day – we need to look at ways of breaking the days up. “Schools can be a good place to go for that advice. “Plan in an early morning fruit break, a recess break, a lunch break. “The day shouldn’t be entirely for digital tasks, they need practical learning as well.” This is reiterated in The Conversation article we referenced earlier: “Authorities could also relax curriculum requirements and give parents autonomy to spend time with children on alternative educational activities. Music, physical activity and free play outdoors whenever possible can be equally educational for children’s learning and wellbeing as study with a computer indoors.” Those critical years Ms Stroud said the students she feared most for were those in year 12, who are at the culmination of their education, only to have everything they planned for thrown into disarray. Here’s her advice for parents in navigating their year 12 children through to graduation. “Lots of students by this stage have developed very worthwhile learning skills. So many of them know that they’ve got to put hard work into the work. They do struggle with time management and planning and giving tasks time. “It’s worth parents checking in here – ‘send me a draft copy’ or ‘loop me into the email to your teacher’.” She said at this age, under stress, some students could withdraw from family conversations. This is where parents could play a sneaky card in keeping in contact with a child’s close friend or trusted teacher, to make sure everything is on track."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on life insurance","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/08\/coronavirus-life-insurance\/","transcript":"Would-be insurance customers could miss out on pandemic-related coverage as beleaguered providers look to stem their losses, Rice Warner has cautioned, with premium increases “inevitable”. The coronavirus outbreak is placing unprecedented pressure on life insurance companies at a time when profit margins are already suffering, the research house said in a report. In 2019 alone, Australian life insurance companies reported a combined after-tax loss of $1.3 billion on their risk products (including life and income protection insurance). Now, Rice Warner said, the industry fears coronavirus “will deliver a further hard blow” – and customers could be forced to pay more as a result. “There will be some death and disability claims directly from the virus, but the impact of a sudden spike in unemployment and a general economic downturn will swamp that,” the report said. “We know that disability claim rates are directly correlated to unemployment. Studies from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK have all shown that unemployment rates and disability claim rates follow very similar patterns.” Worker compensation claims in Australia are also closely linked to unemployment data, as the additional stress results in more claims for mental health problems. The financial fallout caused by these complications are significant. Rice Warner cautioned the outbreak could be “the final catalyst” that causes insurers to scrap long-term income protection products. Weaker profits aren’t just a problem for insurers, though. They’re also bad news for consumers. Rice Warner said insurers are seeing a lift in the number of applications as coronavirus fears encourage workers to consider their options – a trend the research house said could continue for up to two years. That helps to fix the pervasive ‘under-insurance’ problem which has left many Australians without appropriate levels of cover. But it also means insurance companies face greater financial risk, which suggests premium increases are almost “inevitable”, Rice Warner said. What’s more, although most policies do not include exclusions for the coronavirus pandemic, the research house said it would become increasingly difficult for insurers to avoid adding exclusions to future policies. Ultimately, this means customers could be forced to pay more for their insurance and lose pandemic-related benefits. The Rice Warner report comes after TAL, one of the largest insurers in the country, came under fire for reportedly planning to add clauses to new policies so the company would not have to pay out any claims directly or indirectly related to the coronavirus. The planned exclusions would have meant those who have recently travelled, are showing symptoms of the coronavirus, or are part of a “high-risk group” (including frontline medical staff) would not be paid any benefits for illness caused by the disease. TAL denied the reports but said new customers who fell into those categories were assessed individually (and could be offered modified terms) under a policy change the company implemented on March 18. “All customers of TAL who had cover in place prior to 18 March, 2020 can be assured that they are fully covered in line with their policy terms and conditions for any impacts arising from COVID-19 [coronavirus],” TAL said. “For customers who took out cover on or after 18 March, any modified terms applied to their policy would have been communicated to them at the time of taking out the policy.” Financial Services Council (FSC) – the industry body that represents TAL and other large insurers – made a positive move on Monday, though. It announced a number of measures to protect healthcare workers. Those measures include: “This means not only doctors, nurses and hospital staff but also those who may potentially be exposed to COVID-19 such as police, pharmacists, paramedics and aged-care workers,” FSC chief executive Sally Loane said. “While not everyone will be able to get new cover for other unrelated reasons, this commitment means potential exposure to COVID-19 alone won’t affect the cover these workers can get with participating life insurers.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW Police strike force to examine Ruby Princess debacle","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/strike-force-ruby-princess\/","transcript":"NSW Police have formed a strike force to look into how the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship was allowed to dock and disembark thousands of passengers in Sydney in mid-March. A team of 30 detectives from across a host of NSW Police departments, including counter-terrorism, special tactics and marine area commands, has been seconded to Strike Force Bast. They began their investigation on Wednesday morning. The ship, which was carrying more than 100 sick passengers, has since become the source of 15 COVID-19 deaths and nearly 370 cases in Australia and overseas. On Wednesday, South Australian Premier Steven Marshall described it as a “shocking situation” that had “caused havoc right across our nation”. Earlier this week, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller announced a criminal investigation would examine the communications, actions, and other circumstances that led to the Ruby Princess docking at Circular Quay on March 19. It comes as the Nine newspapers report an Australian Border Force officer instructed a Sydney harbour master to allow the troubled cruise ship to dock, despite it having up to 140 passengers in isolation on board. Sources have told the papers there was a conversation between a Port Authority of NSW employee and a female Border Force officer in the hours before the ship was due to dock.  The paper said there were serious concerns about the sick passengers on board. The Border Force officer told the harbour master she needed to check with a supervisor – 15 minutes later, she called back and said the ship could dock. Passengers from the ship were dispatched into central Sydney to make their way home – and reports of cases have grown ever since. The Ruby Princess then spent a fortnight in NSW waters, off the central coast, before being permitted to dock at Port Kembla on Monday. By then, more than 200 of the 1000 crew on board had reported coronavirus symptoms. NSW Police said Strike Force Blast would interview high-priority witnesses in coming days.

NSW Health said on Wednesday it had tested 121 symptomatic travellers from 15 hotels – 36 (or 30 per cent) had COVID-19. Among them are an adult and child from a family of seven who were staying at the Hilton Hotel. Three children from the family were taken to Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital late on Tuesday, with the positive tests confirmed on Wednesday. NSW Health said they had mild symptoms. Video shot outside the hotel showed the children on stretchers wearing protective face masks and being wheeled out of the hotel by paramedics. The hotel is one of those being used to quarantine thousands of travellers who have returned to Australia from overseas. NSW Health said passengers who sat near the family on their flight back to Australia should be aware of coronavirus symptoms and call their GP if they developed any. NSW had 227 people being treated for COVID-19 on Wednesday. That included 36 people in intensive care, 22 of them on ventilators. Cruise ship voyages into Sydney linked to confirmed cases include: the Ovation of the Seas (docked March 18, 96 cases), Voyager of the Seas (docked March 18, 47 cases), Celebrity Solstice (docked March 19, 14 cases), the Ruby Princess (docked 19 March, 379 cases among passengers and crew). There have been six deaths in NSW associated with the Ruby Princess, and nine more in other states. Among them is a 62-year-old South Australian woman who became the country’s 50th coronavirus fatality on Wednesday. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said the Ruby Princess was a “shocking situation”. “It has caused havoc right across our nation,” Mr Marshall said. NSW Police has started a homicide investigation into how the Ruby Princess was allowed to dock in Sydney. It eventually docked again at Port Kembla this week, with nearly 200 sick crew members on board. Also on Wednesday, the first group of 288 Australians quarantined under strict coronavirus measures were released from the nearby Swissotel. This group arrived in Australia from Hawaii on March 26. They had been passengers on the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship. The group have now completed their mandatory 14-day self-isolation, to protect the community from the coronavirus. Gold Coast woman Christine Cooper said she and her husband Graham had been well looked-after during the “long two weeks”. “It’s weirder getting out,” Ms Cooper said on Wednesday. “You feel like an inmate that’s been in jail and now you’ve been released.” Mr Cooper said they had been well fed at the Swissotel. “The food was as good as you could get under the circumstances, and plentiful,” he said. Another traveller, Rachel Deering, said hotel staff had been accommodating. However, she said parts of the quarantine process were “inhumane”. “There’s a lot that needs to be changed,” she told the ABC. “We fully support the concept of quarantine but this is a very ill-conceived plan – very poorly executed.” All in the group were to get letters confirming their isolation periods and have final health checks before leaving, under police supervision. Police are also expected to supervise further hotel departures at the weekend, with 3000 Australian residents expected to come out of hotel isolation across the country in the next week. “[On] Sunday, we start to see thousands of people come out of the Sydney hotels and head home. And I think that’s a wonderful thing for all of those Australians,” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said on Wednesday. “We thank them for their patience, and really protecting the safety of the people of NSW.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Ex-police officer Gary Jubelin fined for illegal recording","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/crime-news\/2020\/04\/08\/tyrrell-family-gary-jubelin\/","transcript":"Former lead detective Gary Jubelin has been convicted and fined for making illegal recordings during the investigation into missing toddler William Tyrrell. Magistrate Ross Hudson on Wednesday ordered Jubelin to pay $10,000 in Sydney’s District Court. Jubelin was on Monday found guilty of four breaches of the Surveillance Devices Act while heading up the task force into William’s disappearance. The 57-year-old defended his decision to make four recordings on his mobile phone with the Tyrrell family’s elderly neighbour, Paul Savage, in 2017 and 2018, claiming he was protecting his lawful interests. Jubelin’s barrister, Margaret Cunneen SC, asked that he not be convicted, describing her client as an “exceptional man” who had served the state for 34 years. “He’s not disgraced, he’s not corrupt and is a former police officer who should remain respected in the community,” Ms Cunneen said. Jubelin was facing a maximum penalty of five years in jail, but prosecutor Phil Hogan did not push for a term of imprisonment – instead insisting on a monetary penalty. But he said Jubelin should be convicted, given he was dishonest in his testimony and lacked remorse. “These offences are just too serious,” Mr Hogan said. “They have to include some punishment and denunciation, not of the offender, the person, but of the offending. It’s offending that infringed on fundamental civil rights.” Earlier, Tyrrell’s foster mother has told a NSW court she is worried about the police investigation into the toddler’s disappearance following Gary Jubelin’s exit. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at Jubelin’s sentencing after the former police officer was earlier in the week found guilty of illegally recording conversations with a person of interest. She – along with a string of high-profile witnesses including former NSW Police deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas, ex-senior crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi and Greens MP David Shoebridge – spoke of Jubelin in glowing terms and described him as a man of integrity. William disappeared from the front of his foster grandmother’s home at Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast, in September 2014. Jubelin led the Tyrrell investigation before quitting the force last year. Asked by Ms Cunneen whether she was worried about the future of the investigation following Jubelin’s departure, William’s foster mother said: “Yes.” She became tearful when describing her family’s bond with the former detective chief inspector, saying he took the time to form a connection with them. “He knew William,” the woman told the court. “He never met him, but he knows him. Through us, through his sister. When you’re a victim of a crime like this, you need people to know you.” After testifying and during a breaking in proceedings, she approached Jubelin and said “I don’t care about coronavirus” before embracing him. Earlier she described him as one of NSW Police’s biggest assets and his departure from the force as a huge loss “He’s a man of integrity and honest and I trust him implicitly,” she said. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Jail threat for anyone who deliberately coughs on health workers","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/jail-threat-coronavirus\/","transcript":"People who deliberately cough on health workers or abuse them amid the coronavirus threat face the risk of life in jail, Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned. Mr Hunt said he had learned of “troubling” incidents in recent days where health workers had been abused or threatened with the deliberate transmission of the deadly virus. He said the federal government’s legal advice was that deliberately transmitting COVID-19 was an offence anywhere in Australia. “The most serious of these offences may carry maximum penalties up to imprisonment for life if somebody was to take a step that led to the death of a healthcare worker,” he said on Wednesday. It was also an offence to make someone fear raid they would catch the virus – such as by coughing on them. “Interestingly, two people have been charged in the ACT for precisely this type of behaviour,” Mr Hunt said. “And the same will occur in other jurisdictions as well.” He refused to say how many reports there had been of health workers being threatened. Mr Hunt’s comments came at a media briefing with deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd and Australian Medical Association chief Tony Bartone. All three urged Australians to keep seeing doctors for regular health checks during the coronavirus crisis. The update came as the national coronavirus toll rose to 50 on Wednesday, with the death in Adelaide of a 62-year-old woman who had been a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Dr Bartone said one pathology provider had told him business fell 40 per cent during March. “That is very worrying when you consider, especially, the diagnosis of internal cancers or skin cancers or other important conditions that need to be managed,” he said. “We are putting all of that at risk because the community is fearful … about whether they should be accessing care at a time when they think that their doctor, their health provider, is overrun with the needs of providing for COVID-19. “Healthcare doesn’t take a holiday. Cancer doesn’t take a holiday. Neither does heart disease, neither does stroke.” Elsewhere, Mr Hunt said the federal government had flatly rejected the idea of trying to use herd immunity beat the coronavirus pandemic. “Herd immunity is 60 per cent of the population, on the best advice that we have,” he said. “[That’s] 15 million people. If there is a 1 per cent loss of life, that would be a catastrophic loss of human life.” Under such figures, that would mean 150,000 Australians dead from COVID-19. Instead, on Wednesday afternoon, Australia had fewer than 6000 cases of coronavirus and a falling number of new infections. Mr Hunt said Australia’s stringent measures to restrict the spread of the virus – including shutting national and state borders and quarantining arrivals in hotels – were starting to have an effect. “Now we’re in the suppression phase where we are doing everything we can to track down and to wipe out community-to-community transmission,” he said. Mr Hunt described it as a “happy challenge” that people were beginning to look to when coronavirus restrictions might end. Earlier on Wednesday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it was possible some bans in that state might be eased as soon as May 1 – although all would be reviewed on a monthly basis. Mr Hunt said restrictions would be examined regularly. “But for the time being, we need to consolidate, to suppress the virus, and to win that battle and the more successful we are, the faster we will then be able to take measures,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cathedral vandalised as George Pell flees Victoria","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/george-pell\/2020\/04\/08\/vandalism-george-pell-high-court\/","transcript":"Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral has been vandalised, with the words “rapist” and “no justice” graffitied across its doors a day after Cardinal George Pell was acquitted on child sex abuse charges. “Rot in hell, Pell” was also scrawled across the doors of the cathedral at the centre of allegations the cardinal abused two choirboys in the 1990s. The words “the law protects the powerful” were also spray-painted on the cathedral forecourt. Meanwhile, a tricycle, ribbons and a paper bag emblazoned with a biblical quote were left at the gates of the monastery in Melbourne’s east where Cardinal Pell spent his first night of freedom on Tuesday. Cardinal Pell left the monastery on Wednesday morning, headed for Sydney. Nine Network journalists filmed him at a service station near Wangaratta, less than 100 kilometres from the NSW border, on Wednesday afternoon. The cardinal was put up by the Sydney archdiocese after he returned from Rome to fight the abuse charges, having most recently served as Archbishop of Sydney. He also has family in NSW. His swift departure from Melbourne came as police investigate the vandalism at St Patrick’s Cathedral. The High Court ruled on Tuesday there was insufficient evidence to convict Cardinal Pell, quashing five convictions. He was freed from Barwon Prison, south-west of Melbourne, within hours. Archbishop of Melbourne Peter Comensoli said he wasn’t surprised by the vandalism. “There’s such strong emotions around all of these matters,” he told Melbourne’s 3AW radio on Wednesday He said he hoped people would consider the High Court judgment and see the decision in its legal context, but expects people will keep their original positions about the cardinal. The release of Cardinal Pell, 78, comes in a significant week in the Christian calendar – Holy Week, which marks the end of Lent and the celebration of Christ’s resurrection on Easter Sunday. The coronavirus outbreak means the cardinal must go into self-isolation and cannot celebrate Easter with any congregation. Any thoughts of a quick return to Rome have also been scuppered by international travel bans. The cardinal’s previous position as Vatican Treasurer was filled in his absence, putting him effectively in retirement. Cardinal Pell’s former private secretary Father Mark Withoos told Sydney’s 2GB radio that if it weren’t for the coronavirus crisis “perhaps those involved in this terrible miscarriage of justice would be forced to resign”. Premier Daniel Andrews has refused to comment on the High Court’s decision. But, on Wednesday, he said people, particularly Catholics, had to face the fact there were people who had moved predators across parishes. “Others who knew that it was going on facilitated it and whether they’re in jail or not, they’ll have to go to their maker knowing they did those sorts of things,” he told radio station Triple M. Cardinal Pell is yet to speak publicly but released a statement saying a serious injustice had been remedied and he bore no ill will toward his accuser. The accuser, now a man in his 30s, came forward after the death of the second choirboy in 2014. “I respect the decision of the High Court. I accept the outcome,” he has said. He also hopes the outcome won’t discourage child sexual abuse survivors from coming forward, reassuring them “most people recognise the truth when they hear it”. The Vatican welcomed Cardinal Pell’s acquittal, praising him for waiting “for the truth to be ascertained”. Pope Francis offered his Tuesday morning mass for those who suffer from unjust sentences, though he did not mention Cardinal Pell by name. “I would like to pray today for all those people who suffer unjust sentences resulting from intransigence (against them),” the Pope said, speaking before the start of the mass. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Judicial Commission rules on ‘buyer’s remorse’ Magistrate Pithouse","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/08\/buyers-remorse-magistrate-richard-pithouse-investigation-conclusion\/","transcript":"A magistrate who suggested a rape victim had “buyer’s remorse” acted with bias and reinforced outdated stereotypes about sex crimes, a major investigation has concluded. The Judicial Commission of Victoria found Richard Pithouse used language of “significant concern” in his dealings with Penny when she appeared before him in a victims of crime hearing. In a separate incident, Mr Pithouse was found to make victim-blaming comments to another woman who was at the centre of a domestic violence matter. He had said about that woman:  It also concluded that when he failed to stop at the scene of a car crash in 2017, Mr Pithouse displayed an “element of moral turpitude” and “brought the office of Magistrate into disrepute”. He has now been referred to Chief Magistrate Lisa Hannan, who has the power to decide on how he should be disciplined (but not whether he is dismissed – to sack a magistrate requires a majority vote in both Houses of Parliament). The investigation into a list of complaints, including one referral from Attorney-General Jill Hennessy, found that Mr Pithouse’s comments about Penny “reinforce[d] outdated misconceptions associated with sexual offending, including that victims of sexual offences ‘ask for it’ by consuming too much alcohol.” The investigators have also recommended to Chief Magistrate Hannan: In a formal notification of the investigation to Penny, seen by The New Daily, the commission noted Mr Pithouse infringed standards expected of a court officer. The commission found the judicial officer used unacceptable language about Penny including suggesting she “put herself in that position” and saying “you can’t profit from your own malfeasance”. “The use of the word “malfeasance” implies the complainant committed a wrongdoing or illegal act,” the panel found. “While this proceeding was a directions hearing and it was appropriate for the officer to draw to the attention of counsel and articulate the difficulties in the case, the language the officer used to address the difficulties causes significant concern.” In response to an allegation Mr Pithouse had made up his mind that Penny was not raped, the commission found that “based on the comments made by the officer … and the associated findings, that the officer had done so”. The findings state: “To an objective observer, the “buyer’s remorse” comment could reasonably be construed as the officer speculating that the complainant had not been raped, but rather had consented to sexual intercourse and then regretted it the next day, by then alleging she had been raped.” The panel also noted: The New Daily has previously revealed the same magistrate was the subject of another complaint after a social media page under his name appeared to criticise the barrister in Penny’s case. That matter was also investigated – and on Wednesday it was confirmed that complaint was also upheld. “The commission found it was highly inappropriate for the Officer to publicly criticise someone who had appeared before him in a proceeding he had presided over,” the panel noted. The outcome of the investigation is the strongest response yet to a list of complaints sent to the watchdog about Mr Pithouse. It’s also a major victory for the complainants including Penny, who has said she wanted her story told in order to demonstrate the barriers sexual assault victims face in the judicial system. Penny, who is legally blind, had initially complained to police after she woke in the bed of a man she had met briefly while intoxicated at Crown Casino. As is common, there was not enough evidence for police to pursue a criminal case. But Penny had the option to go to the Victims of Crime Tribunal to have her experience legally recognised. It was in the initial stages of that process that Mr Pithouse made the comments. In December, Penny returned to the Victims of Crime tribunal (VOCAT) which found she was indeed the victim of a sex crime. Ending a more than two-year fight for official legal recognition of the sex assault, Magistrate Fiona Hayes awarded Penny $10,000 – the maximum amount available in the Victorian victims’ tribunal. The state is also covering costs for Penny’s recovery, including past and future psychological help for symptoms of post-traumatic disorder."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Twitter chief Jack Dorsey pledges quarter of his fortune to coronavirus fight","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/twitter-chief-jack-dorsey-coronavirus-pledge\/","transcript":"Jack Dorsey plans to donate US$1 billion ($1.63 billion) to fight the coronavirus outbreak, funds that will drive research to help “disarm this pandemic”. The Twitter CEO’s pledge is by far the largest gift by a private individual yet during the pandemic. Mr Dorsey, 43, who co-founded Twitter in 2006 and went on to found payments company Square, tweeted on Tuesday that he was donating $1bn of Square shares to a charitable fund called Start Small, to “fund global COVID-19 relief”. I’m moving $1B of my Square equity (~28% of my wealth) to #startsmall LLC to fund global COVID-19 relief. After we disarm this pandemic, the focus will shift to girl’s health and education, and UBI. It will operate transparently, all flows tracked here: https:\/\/t.co\/hVkUczDQmz — jack (@jack) April 7, 2020  The sum not only dwarfs contributions by other philanthropists; it represents a significant proportion of Mr Dorsey’s fortune. He said the donation was equivalent to about “28% of my wealth”. Mr Dorsey has amassed riches of about US$3.9 billion ($6.35 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world’s richest person, has said he will donate US$100 million ($163 million) to food bank charity Feeding America to help relief efforts during the pandemic. “Even in ordinary times, food insecurity in American households is an important problem, and unfortunately COVID-19 is amplifying that stress significantly,” Mr Bezos, 56, said in an Instagram post last week. Mr Bezos’ donation represents less than 0.1% of his estimated US$123 billion ($200 billion) fortune. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given US$100 million ($163 million) to efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and to fund testing and treatments. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has offered more than US$25 million ($40.7 million) to help research through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Michael Dell, the founder of Dell computers, has committed $100 million ($163 million). Mr Dorsey says all of the gift’s donations will be tracked through a public Google Sheet. That document shows $100,000 has been given so far to America’s Food Fund, an organisation co-founded by Laurene Powell Jobs and Leonardo DiCaprio. After the coronavirus outbreak has been contained, Start Small will shift its focus to funding girls’ health and education, as well as universal basic income, a regular cash payment made to citizens by the government, Mr Dorsey said. “Why UBI and girl’s health and education? I believe they represent the best long-term solutions to the existential problems facing the world,” Mr Dorsey wrote in a follow-up tweet. “UBI is a great idea needing experimentation. Girl’s health and education is critical to balance.” “I hope this inspires others to do something similar,” Mr Dorsey said of his contribution. “Life is too short, so let’s do everything we can today to help people now.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"UFC president Dana White plans to host bouts on island during lockdown","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/sport\/mma\/2020\/04\/08\/ufc-island-bout\/","transcript":"Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White says he plans to host fights on a private island. As world sports search for ways to get around the coronavirus pandemic, the UFC is talking up the possibility of forging ahead with UFC 249. In a move with echoes from Bruce Lee’s 1973 martial arts classic Enter the Dragon, White insists the show must go on. The UFC boss revealed a fight between lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson had been scrapped, with Nurmagomedov apparently unable to leave Russia amid the pandemic. American Justin Gaethje is the new man to replace Nurmagomedov at a yet-to-be-determined location. White is evidently confident of getting the fight up, having already updated his Twitter bio to include details of the bout. “I’m this close to getting a deal done so this place where this fight is going to be on April 18th, I have locked up for two months. So I’m going to continue to pump fights out,” White told ESPN. “I’ve also secured an island. I’ve got an island. The infrastructure is being built right now. “We’re going to do all of our international fights on this island.” White gave no indication where the island was located. The fight is signed and is 100% ON LIVE on ESPN somewhere on EARTH!!!! 😃@TonyFergusonXT vs @Justin_Gaethje is LIVE on @espn+ PPV April 18th for the interim lightweight belt! pic.twitter.com\/aH44zg5K30 — danawhite (@danawhite) April 6, 2020  The last UFC event was on March 15 in the Brazilian capital Brasilia. It became the first event in UFC’s history held behind closed doors after the local governor declared a ban on all large gatherings in response to coronavirus. Since then, a UFC fight night in London was also cancelled, as were two other cards due to be held at UFC’s headquarters in Las Vegas. Most US states have restrictions in place that would make it impossible to stage a show, even without an audience. UFC 249 initially was slated for Brooklyn, but a venue change became necessary several weeks ago. ESPN, the UFC’s broadcast partner, has said White was attempting to secure an unnamed venue on the west coast for the show. “I’m terrified and I … love it,” Gaethje tweeted after the announcement of his fight. Nurmagomedov announced last week that he wasn’t planning to leave his native Dagestan, suggesting Russia’s travel restrictions in response to coronavirus made it impossible. He later said he would be willing to leave for the fight but couldn’t plan because he didn’t know where or when it would occur. The island idea is not new, with the NRL admitting it is considering a range of options including moving its entire competition to Tangalooma — on Moreton Island off the Queensland coast — which would allow it to keep the players quarantined. English football is also looking at proposals to get the EPL season over the line. Suggestions include squads living together in hotels for the rest of the season, with daily games potentially played at neutral venues across the country. The AFL has looked at the possibility that teams could be sent to a number of “hubs” in different states in a bid to get the season off the ground. The idea would involve some teams based in Tasmania and Western Australia, where there are lower COVID-19 infection rates and a possible earlier end to self-isolation and restrictions than elsewhere in Australia. However AFL Players Association president Patrick Dangerfield has described the idea as “speculative” and said he wasn’t sure how comfortable he was with it. –with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Sovereignty, not ideology, Scott Morrison tells returned Parliament","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/scott-morrison-jobkeeper\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison has declared Australia will “never surrender” to the coronavirus as he warned the nation there was a long road ahead and restrictions are not likely to be lifted anytime soon. Pledging to “check at the door” ideologies, the Prime Minister acknowledged the $130 billion cost of the JobKeeper plan to be debated by Parliament on Wednesday was unprecedented. But despite the restrictions and shutdowns, he said Australia would not surrender its values or way of life, even if the nation “looked different” on the other side. “Defending our sovereignty has always come at a great cost, regardless of what form that threat takes, and today will be no different,” he said. “Above all, our sovereignty is sustained by what we believe as Australians, what we value and hold most dear, our principles, our way of life, a way of doing things. “We will never surrender this. So make no mistake, today is not about ideologies. We check those at the door. Today is about defending and protecting Australia’s national sovereignty. “It will be a fight. It will be a fight we will win. But it won’t be a fight without cost, or without loss.” The Prime Minister said he wanted to thank every Australian enlisted in the fight against COVID-19: “Nurses, teachers, drivers, cleaners, doctors, police and paramedics, factory workers, engineers and bankers, grocers, miners, farmers, pastors, priests and imams. Politicians, union officials, even lawyers. Mums, dads, grandparents, kids, families. All of us,” he said. “You are saving lives, you are saving livelihoods. But we have to keep up our efforts. Progress can be easily undone, as we have seen in other places around the world.” But he stressed that Australia needed to tackle twin crises: the health impact of COVID-19 and the economic impact. “Our sovereignty is enabled by having a vibrant market economy that underpins our standard of living, that gives all Australians the opportunity to fulfil their potential,” he said. “We have a long way to go. Through the actions we have taken to date, we have bought Australia valuable time to chart a way out over the next six months. But there are no guarantees, and it could well take far longer. “Our country will look different on the other side but Australians will always be Australians. We have navigated the road in, and we can now see some encouraging signs.” Mr Morrison said preparing Australia’s health system for the challenge to come – increasing intensive care unit capacity and ensuring supplies of masks and personal protection gear for nurses and doctors – remained one of the biggest priorities. In the 16 days since Parliament last met, Australia’s coronavirus tally has risen to 5956 and 2547 patients have recovered. Of those, 294 remain hospitalised, with 92 in intensive care and 32 on respirators. The death toll has risen to 50. But Mr Morrison said there are promising signs Australia is “flattening the curve” of new cases. “When the house last met, new cases were growing at more than 20 per cent a day. In recent days, it has averaged 2 per cent a day. This is very encouraging,” he said. “We are flattening the curve. We are buying ourselves precious time in this fight. And I want to thank the overwhelming majority of Australians for doing the right thing. You are saving lives, you are saving livelihoods. But we have to keep our — keep up our efforts.” Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the ALP would seek to amend the JobKeeper legislation to extend eligibility to casuals with less than12 months’ service with a single employer. However, if – as expected – these amendments fail, Mr Albanese said he would not block the $1500 a fortnight wage subsidy that Labor had urged the Morrison government to consider for weeks. Mr Albanese urged Australians to reflect on the essential workers keeping the nation safe “We should reflect on the fact that so many of those front-line workers – and think about it – cleaners, childcare workers, teachers, healthcare workers, nurses are, in so many cases, defined not just by being primarily female occupations but they are our poorest paid,” he said. “They are the people we are relying upon.” As NSW flagged a discussion on re-opening parts of the economy, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews cautioned those calling for immediate relaxation of social distancing laws and bans on cafes and restaurants opening. “We have to be prepared for the long haul,” he said. “A vaccine for this sort of virus is not something that has been done before.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW woman found guilty of South Australian partner's murder","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/04\/08\/nsw-woman-guilty-murder\/","transcript":"A NSW woman has been found guilty of murder after poisoning her partner in Adelaide with a toxic cocktail of drugs including morphine, valium and tramadol. A South Australian Supreme Court jury returned the guilty verdict late on Tuesday after deliberating for about six hours in the case against Wendie-Sue Dent. The 61-year-old, who lived in Dapto before her arrest, had been accused of murdering her de facto husband David Lawrence in December 2015 to claim his $300,000 estate. She also denied falsifying paperwork, including a will. At the opening of the seven-week trial, prosecutor Emily Telfer SC told the jury Dent administered a cocktail of dangerous medication, which included valium, tramadol, and morphine that had been prescribed to her. The court heard a post-mortem examination revealed the toxic levels of morphine alone were enough to kill Mr Lawrence. “Next to the bed where David Lawrence’s body was, was a glass of orange liquid that contained dissolved traces of the same drugs that were found within David Lawrence,” Ms Telfer said. “This was no accidental overdose of medication, this was no suicide but was a deliberate killing.” The prosecutor said Mr Lawrence, 62, who was in good health, was found dead in his bed. He had been dead for some time. She told the jury Dent quickly moved into Mr Lawrence’s home after meeting him and he had his will changed about nine weeks prior to his death. “David Lawrence signed a document which provided for the entirety of his estate to be paid to Ms Dent in the event that he’d pass away,” she said. But in his opening remarks, defence counsel had Martin Anders had urged the jury to keep an open mind until all the evidence was heard. “You’ll hear of the suddenness of Mr Lawrence’s passing, her sadness and confusion and obvious grief, the vitriol that quickly came her way from Mr Lawrence’s siblings, and the scrambling of his brothers and sisters to secure his assets and exclude her,” he said. He said Dent suffered from an addiction to prescription medication and had future plans with Mr Lawrence, including marriage. Dent has been remanded in custody for sentencing submissions later this month. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Trump threatens to halt funding for 'China-centric' WHO","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/donald-trump-who-funding\/","transcript":"President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw US funding to the World Health Organisation, saying it “missed the call” on the devastating coronavirus pandemic. Mr Trump made the announcement at a White House press briefing on Tuesday (Washington time) as deaths and infections across the United States continued to rise. Mr Trump criticised the organisation, saying it “called it wrong” on the coronavirus outbreak and saying it seemed to be “very China-centric”. “They should have known and they probably did know,” he said. “We‘re going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it and we‘re going to see.” Minutes later, however, the President changed his language, conceding that the midst of a global pandemic was “maybe not” the best time to freeze funding for the international health organisation. “I‘m not saying I‘m going to do it, but we are going to look at it,” he said – denying his earlier comments when pressed by reporters. “I said we’re going to look at it. We’re going to investigate it, we’re going to look at it.

His statement came as the US was partway through what is likely to be its deadliest week of the coronavirus pandemic. The total number of coronavirus deaths in the US topped 12,000 on Tuesday, according to a tally by NBC News. New York City – one of the country’s worst-hit areas with more than 4000 deaths – had its single deadliest day, with more than 800 dying in the 24 hours from Monday. The WHO has praised China for its transparency on the virus, even though there is reason to believe more people died of COVID-19 in China than its official tally. The organisation has been warning about the coronavirus since early January. In late February, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to prepare, while the organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11. Throughout his presidency, Mr Trump has voiced scepticism of many international organisations. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Some coronavirus restrictions could be eased as soon as May: Premier","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/coronavirus-restrictions-ease-nsw\/","transcript":"NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state’s tough coronavirus social-distancing rules could be relaxed as early as May. On Tuesday, she described social distancing as “a way of life” that would remain until a COVID-19 vaccine was found. When asked on Wednesday about the chances of the restrictions being eased on May 1, she said that was possible, and that the laws would be assessed on a month-by-month basis, based on health advice. “If the advice in a couple of weeks is that there might be a couple of aspects that we can tweak to provide relief to our citizens, well then, we’ll take that advice,” she said. However, she said despite the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in NSW stabilising, lifting restrictions “comes with a risk”. “When you do lift any of the restrictions, it does mean that more people will be admitted to our hospitals and more people who will succumb to the virus,” she said. “Every time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick. More people will die.” Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said the state’s tough social-distancing laws would be in place until the end of June, and that he would not seek to extend them. “People will have gotten the message by then, hopefully,” he said. NSW Health confirmed 48 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday morning, taking the state’s total to 2734. It is the lowest number of new cases recorded since March 19 – the day the Ruby Princess cruise ship docked in Sydney. NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant said 2900 people were tested for COVID-19 on Tuesday, up from 2100 the day before. The Premier said she wanted to quadruple NSW’s ICU capacity and that there were 1000 beds with ventilators available already. “That is something that we’re working hard on behind the scenes and it’s positive news,” she said. “We’ve been able to double our capacity already.” Commissioner Fuller said officers would be out in force at the Easter weekend to enforce social-distancing bans. “We will be going through caravan parks early, issuing warnings to people who may think that they can get around these laws,” he said. “It’s important over this weekend that we continue the good work and we continue to isolate, as frustrating as that may be.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Overnight deaths take national coronavirus toll to 50","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/national-coronavirus-toll-50\/","transcript":"A 62-year-old woman from Adelaide who contracted coronavirus from the Ruby Princess cruise ship has died.

The man, known as Witness J, was one of two choirboys Cardinal Pell was convicted of sexually abusing. The second choirboy died of a drug overdose in 2014. “I respect the decision of the High Court. I respect the outcome,” Witness J said in a statement from his lawyer, Vivian Waller on Wednesday. “I understand their view that there was not enough evidence to satisfy the court beyond all reasonable doubt that the offending occurred,” he said, adding that he understood why there was a heavy burden of proof in child sexual abuse matters. “But the price we pay for weighting the system in favour of the accused is that many sexual offences against children go unpunished. “I would hate to think that one outcome of this case is that people are discouraged from reporting to the police.” Witness J, who is now in his 30s, reassured child sexual abuse survivors “most people recognise the truth when they hear it”, adding “I am content with that”. “My journey has been long and I am relieved that it is over … this case does not define me. I am not the abuse I suffered as a child,” he said. “I am a man who came forward for my friend who, sadly, is no longer with us.” Cardinal Pell was unanimously convicted by a jury in 2018 over the accusations involving two 13-year-old choirboys at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996. It was his second trial on the charges after an earlier jury was unable to reach a verdict. The second jury’s decision was upheld by Victoria’s Court of Appeal in 2019. But on Tuesday, the High Court acquitted the cardinal, ruling there wasn’t enough evidence for the jury to convict him beyond reasonable doubt. The ruling meant Cardinal Pell was a free man. He was released from Victoria’s Barwon Prison within hours of the decision being announced. Witness J also thanked police and Victoria’s office of public prosecutions, saying he had felt well-supported throughout the lengthy legal process. The father of the deceased choirboy said through his lawyer, Lisa Flynn, he was disgusted that Cardinal Pell’s convictions had been overturned. “He is furious. The man he believes is responsible for sexually abusing his son was convicted by a unanimous jury, only to have that decision overturned today, allowing George Pell to walk free from jail,” Ms Flynn said on Tuesday. She said her client had lost faith in the justice system and was shocked at the decision. “He is heartbroken for the surviving victim, who stuck his neck out by coming forward to tell his story but was ultimately let down by a legal process that forced him to relive his pain and trauma for no benefit.” Family members of another accuser who claimed he was sexually assaulted at a Victorian pool have also thrown their support behind Witness J. Those allegations never went to trial because of insufficient evidence. “It is more important than ever that they continue to speak their truth and hold to account both perpetrators and institutions. Our thoughts are with J, his family and friends. You are not alone, you were believed,” the family said. Ms Flynn said the deceased choirboy’s father continues to believe his son was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of the cardinal. “We will continue to pursue a civil claim on behalf of our client despite the High Court’s ruling today,” she said.

With millions of people all over the world in voluntary or compulsory home isolation because of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, a host of athletes have posted workouts and drills to social media with suggestions for staying in shape. In Federer’s version – which he called “a helpful solo drill” – he encouraged fans to tweet to him videos of them mimicking his volleying exercise. And then he replied to some, even dispensing a little advice. Not a bad instructor, eh? Federer, who has a men’s-record 20 grand slam singles titles, previously posted clips of himself hitting against a wall in the snow, including around-the-back or through-the-leg-‘tweener trick shots. But on Tuesday, the 38-year-old star donned an all-white outfit (perhaps a nod for Wimbledon, which he has won eight times and has been cancelled for 2020). He added a white panama hat with black band, stood near the green wall and volleyed against it. Federer tapped the ball more than 200 times during the test of reflex and form in the 59-second video. Within six hours, his clip had garnered more than one million views, and his post drew more than 1300 replies. True to his word, he answered some. “Don’t lean back, strong in the wrist,” Federer wrote to one person. “Keep up the great work.” To another, in which a man hit a tennis ball against an indoor wall while a dog appeared to nap underneath, Federer answered: “Love the confidence not to drop the (tennis ball emoji) on the (dog emoji).” To others, he sent verbal pats on the back, such as, “Good job” or “Nice work” or “Love the effort”. Federer, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in February, is waiting along with everyone else for competitive tennis to return. The men’s and women’s professional tours are suspended until at least mid-July because of the COVID-19 pandemic. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Two members of hotel quarantine family have coronavirus","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/hotel-coronavirus-quarantine-family\/","transcript":"A child and an adult from a family group of seven quarantined in a Sydney hotel have been confirmed to have the coronavirus. Three children from the family were taken from the Hilton hotel to Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital late on Tuesday. Video shot outside the hotel showed the children on stretchers wearing protective face masks and being wheeled out of the hotel by paramedics. On Wednesday, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said an adult and one of the children had tested positive for COVID-19. The hotel is one of those being used to quarantine travellers who have returned to Australia from overseas. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said on Wednesday he was aware of the cases but wouldn’t comment further. Professor Kelly told Nine’s Today show that children could get catch the virus – and that was one of the reasons social distancing rules needed to be taken so seriously. Also on Wednesday, the first group of 288 Australians quarantined under strict coronavirus measures were released from the nearby Swissotel. This group arrived in Australia from Hawaii on March 26. They had been passengers on the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship. The group have now completed their mandatory 14-day self-isolation, to protect the community from the coronavirus. Gold Coast woman Christine Cooper said she and her husband Graham had been well looked-after during the “long two weeks”. “It’s weirder getting out,” Ms Cooper said on Wednesday. “You feel like an inmate that’s been in jail and now you’ve been released.” Mr Cooper said they had been well fed at the Swissotel. “The food was as good as you could get under the circumstances, and plentiful,” he said. Another traveller, Rachel Deering, said hotel staff had been accommodating. However, she said parts of the quarantine process were “inhumane”. “There’s a lot that needs to be changed,” she told the ABC. “We fully support the concept of quarantine but this is a very ill-conceived plan – very poorly executed.” All in the group were to get letters confirming their isolation periods and have final health checks before leaving, under police supervision. Police are also expected to supervise further hotel departures at the weekend, with 3000 Australian residents expected to come out of hotel isolation across the country in the next week. “[On] Sunday, we start to see thousands of people come out of the Sydney hotels and head home. And I think that’s a wonderful thing for all of those Australians,” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said on Wednesday. “We thank them for their patience, and really protecting the safety of the people of NSW.” NSW recorded another 49 coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing its total to 2686. While the number of new cases in NSW continues to stabilise, authorities remain concerned about 406 locally-acquired cases with an unknown source. The latest deaths include a 90-year-old male resident of the Opal Care Bankstown aged care facility and an 87-year-old woman who was a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Of the 21 NSW deaths so far, five are linked to the Ruby Princess, six were residents at Dorothy Henderson Lodge and two were residents at Opal Care Bankstown."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus exercise quiz: Can I go hiking or travel to the beach to surf?","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/08\/exercise-coronavirus-rules\/","transcript":"As social distancing rules become increasingly restrictive around Australia, questions have been raised over what type of exercise is permitted in each state and territory. We all need to do our bit to limit the spread of the coronavirus by staying at home as much as possible. But it’s also important to look after our health – both physical and mental – which is why the government has allowed us to keep exercising. However, that doesn’t mean it’s open slather to do whatever activity we want outside in the name of keeping fit. It’s not just the risk of passing on the virus that has driven authorities to make tough laws. Consider this: If you travel out of your area to hike, it means you’d potentially stop at a petrol station or shop to fuel up – potentially passing on germs to other areas. There’s also more risk you could break down, get in a car crash or even have a fall. That could put more strain on police and emergency crews who are already stretched because of the pandemic.

He went on to campaign against Boris Johnson for the Conservative Party leadership but after failing to receive enough Tory support he backed Mr Johnson for the top job. Now, Mr Raab is at Mr Johnson’s side again as the PM is treated for worsening coronavirus symptoms in an intensive care unit at St Thomas’ Hospital in London. Not since World War II have Britons so desperately needed strong leadership. The virus situation in the country is dire; latest data shows that Tuesday was Britain’s most deadly day for COVID-19, with 798 people dying. More than 6000 people have been killed by the virus in Britain already, while another 55,000 have caught it – including two of the country’s most high-profile residents, Prince Charles and Mr Johnson. On Wednesday morning (Australian time), Downing Street confirmed Mr Johnson was stable, while Mr Raab maintained the leader was in “good spirits”. The PM is under “close monitoring” and has had oxygen treatment. But Mr Raab said he was breathing without the help of a ventilator. Although Mr Johnson technically remains in charge of the nation, the spotlight has turned on Mr Raab, who will deputise “where necessary”. Unlike in other countries, Britain’s leader does not have a deputy so there is no clear line of succession. But late in March, when Mr Johnson tested positive for COVID-19, Downing Street designated Mr Raab as the leader’s right-hand-man should the PM’s health reach grave levels. “It comes as a shock to all of … he’s not just a prime minister…he’s a friend,” Mr Raab said on Wednesday."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Company scrambles to get Australians off virus-infected Greg Mortimer","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/08\/greg-mortimer-cruise-ship-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Australians stuck on a coronavirus-infected cruise ship near Uruguay face a $15,000 fee – each – to get home, as the travel company works on a plan to have them quarantined in Melbourne. It comes as more details have emerged about the state of passengers and crew on board the ship, which is owned by Australia’s Aurora Expeditions. The company said early on Wednesday that more than half of the 217 passengers on the Greg Mortimer had the virus – although they were showing no symptoms. “There are currently no fevers onboard and all are asymptomatic,” the cruise ship operator said. Six infected people were removed taken from the ship in Montevideo. They remain in hospital in the Uruguayan capital, in stable conditions. Plans are underway to get other passengers home. “We have also asked DFAT to accept the NZ passengers into Australia and allow the NZ passengers to complete their quarantine in Australia before returning home,” the company said. Australian Border Force had asked for an Airbus A340, refitted to act as a medical plane, to land in Melbourne, the statement said. It has also requested that passengers spend two weeks in quarantine at a single Melbourne facility. “While our preferred plan had been to disembark all passengers simultaneously, the nature of the situation and the difficulty in securing flights has meant it is likely that the Australian and New Zealand passengers will leave the vessel before our European (UK included) and North American passengers,” Aurora Expeditions said. Aurora Expeditions is still trying to work out how the Australians will be able to afford the $15,000 flight fee, which it said was a “hard cost” and “underdetermined at this stage”. The company said it was doing “everything possible to expedite disembarkation” and hoped to have the passengers fly out later this week. The company has called on the federal government to help fund the mercy flight. The Airbus is expected to have to seat the coronavirus-infected people away from everyone else. Last month, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a 30-day ban on cruise ship arrivals in Australia. Yet four vessels have been allowed to dock since, including ill-fated Ruby Princess, which is at Port Kembla, near Wollongong. At least 200 of the Ruby Princess’s 1040 crew members have coronavirus symptoms, but no one has been allowed to disembark the ship. Rather, all are being medically assessed while remaining on board."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Wuhan lockdown lifted as China reports falling coronavirus cases","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/08\/wuhan-lockdown-coronavirus-end\/","transcript":"After enduring two months under the world’s largest lockdown, millions of people in the Chinese city of Wuhan will finally be able to leave from midnight on Wednesday (AEST). The move comes as the Chinese government claims there have been no new deaths in Wuhan in a 24-hour period – for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started. There has also been a decline in imported virus cases. In Wuhan, which was where the COVID-19 outbreak began, trains will run again and deserted roads will soon be packed with cars as travel restrictions are partially lifted for the first time since January 23. Residents who pass a health test will receive a green ‘health code’ that enables them to travel freely beyond Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province. The national health code service gives citizens colour-coded passes to be scanned by authorities. A yellow code indicates the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code shows the user is a confirmed COVID-19 patient and must be in quarantine. Although it is unlikely the true number of cases or death toll will ever be known because of media restrictions, the Chinese government claims to have brought the coronavirus outbreak largely under control. And though it is too early to celebrate success, the end of the lockdown at the epicentre of the killer pandemic is a milestone in the fight against the virus. After weeks of trying to bury news of the Wuhan outbreak, China brought in the world’s toughest lockdown laws. More than 11 million people were banned from leaving their homes, and transport in and out of the city was shutdown – with no exceptions for personal or medical emergencies. All shops were shut, except those selling food or medicine. In some areas, outings were limited to one family member every two days to buy essentials. In other areas, residents were barred from leaving altogether and restricted to home deliveries. Officials went door to door checking people’s health for signs of the virus and forced anyone ill into isolation or quarantine. On March 18, China reported a huge milestone of no new community transmissions of COVID-19: All newly identified cases had come from overseas. Imported cases became one of China’s key concerns. The government closed its borders to foreigners and expelled foreign journalists as the virus spread globally and became a pandemic. However, it turned out most imported cases were not being brought by foreigners – they were often coming from Chinese nationals returning home from overseas. In April, authorities started testing international arrivals for the virus. China began detecting and monitoring people who were unwittingly spreading the virus while showing no symptoms. Some people were passing on the coronavirus with barely any symptoms, not even a runny nose. As of Monday, China claimed 1033 asymptomatic patients were being kept away from the community and held under medical observation to limit the virus’s spread."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"George Pell: Red hat intact, the Cardinal returns to isolation","date":"04-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/george-pell\/2020\/04\/08\/george-pell-home\/","transcript":"Within hours of the High Court quashing his sexual abuse conviction on Tuesday, Cardinal George Pell was greeted by a nun in East Melbourne, where he was filmed by a media helicopter limping back into the welcome arms of the church – and, most likely – a life out of the spotlight. From an isolation prison cell he returned into a community that is self-isolating and also set to keep him at a distance – the days of Cardinal Pell being the Catholic Church’s singular and authoritative moral voice in Australia appear over. For while the High Court’s unanimous decision on five convictions prompted cheers from his supporters and outrage from anti-abuse advocates, the Cardinal’s leading role in the wider church is in doubt. Cardinal Pell retains loyalty and influence among an inner circle of senior clergy, many of whom he appointed, but the ground has shifted in the past four years as he battled his way through the courts. Pope Francis may have given the Australian a nod when dedicating his Tuesday mass “to persons who suffer an unjust sentence through persecution”, but there are still civil cases pending that will concern the Vatican. On the convictions, related to events in 1996, the High Court found “the evidence did not establish guilt to the requisite standard of proof”, however the court cases and the debate around the Cardinal’s conduct has clearly left him a diminished public figure. A Vatican inquiry shrouded in secrecy under canon law also remains ongoing and, although it will take into consideration the High Court decision, it will likely consider other issues and, possibly, even other allegations. In a statement, the Vatican welcomed the High Court verdict. It did not reference the status of the church’s internal investigations but said “the Holy See reaffirms its commitment to preventing and pursuing all cases of abuse against minors”. “Cardinal Pell has always maintained his innocence, and has waited for the truth to be ascertained,” the statement read. Cardinal Pell’s 400-day prison term may have ended, but the former Richmond Football Club reserves player has ongoing heart-health issues and limited mobility with a ruckman’s dodgy knee. He will also get no respite from court proceedings, with several civil cases pending and the release of redacted details of the Royal Commission into Child Abuse set to shine a further light on his role in responding to abuse allegations against other clergy. And, while retaining his cardinal’s red hat for life, on June 8 next year the Victorian turns 80, meaning the veteran churchman will no longer be eligible to join the College of Cardinals to elect a Pope. His influence as ‘the Pope’s banker’ and financial-corruption fighter with the exalted title Secretariat for the Economy expired in February last year, having already finished a five-year term as one of the Pope’s Cardinal Advisers at the end of 2018. Author and journalist Lucie Morris-Marr, who covered the Pell trials for The New Daily, and subsequently wrote the book Fallen, charting the case, believes the Cardinal’s long-term future is “bleak”. “There are civil cases brewing against Pell, let alone the redacted sections of the Royal Commission regarding what the Cardinal may have seen, heard or ignored as a young priest and during his career,” Morris-Marr said. “They are effectively the smoking guns which remove any chance of him regaining his reputation. Morris-Marr said the public outrage would also be too great for Cardinal Pell to have a formal role in the Australian Catholic Church. “I expect his only option will be to quietly live out his days securely with close family or friends, or in a seminary such as the one in Sydney where he spent many months during his case,” she said. In a statement, Cardinal Pell appeared to maintain that his now-overturned convictions had been the result of his leading role in the church’s response to sexual abuse allegations. “My trial was not a referendum on the Catholic Church; nor a referendum on how church authorities in Australia dealt with the crime of pedophilia in the church,” the statement read. “The point was whether I had committed these awful crimes, and I did not.” With the convictions quashed and other allegations about Pell failing to meet the standard required to proceed to criminal court, the issue now becomes how the church can move on from the scandal. Australia’s Catholic bishops acknowledged Cardinal Pell’s acquittal will be devastating for many people, but welcomed by those who believe in his innocence. Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher was among those welcoming Cardinal Pell’s release, but others among the faithful were not so fulsome. Victorian parish priest Andrew Hayes said he did not share the relief felt by some. “My concern is less about what happens to Catholic clergy in the courts and more with what happens for the thousands of people we broke,” the Ararat and Stawell priest said in a Facebook post. “We broke them because we thought that illegal rape was only immoral. “We broke them because we were immature in so many ways, and then were vested with a dysfunctionally isolated authority.” The church’s response has long been criticised for being more concerned with legal intricacies than compassion. The father of the choirboy who died in 2014 – one of the boys the Cardinal had been accused of molesting – said through his lawyer Lisa Flynn that he was heartbroken for the surviving boy who came forward. “My fear is this will stop those with allegations of child abuse, [they] will not come forward to face years of being in a challenging legal quagmire, only to be accused of being a liar,” the father said. And while the Cardinal is free, author Morris-Marr believes he will remain a reduced figure. “This has been a protracted, fiercely fought battle lasting from 2017 when he was first charged.

The good and the bad pic.twitter.com\/UiOUzxeHzp — Sally McManus (@sallymcmanus) April 7, 2020 Crucially, the award rate will not be altered, but employers will be granted the flexibility to change agreed hours. “That will not change the hourly rate that would be worked by – that would be owed to a worker – under all the relevant EAs and awards, but it could alter someone’s hours down,” Mr Porter said. “You can only make that alteration if the pandemic has meant that there is no work for that person to do, compared to what they would usually do, or a limitation in the work that they would do compared to what they would usually do. “That alteration of hours cannot be unreasonable.” Workers who are stood down and receiving the $1500-a-fortnight subsidy for six months will also be allowed to seek secondary employment to supplement their income. There are concerns that workers will be forced to run down annual leave during the crisis, while taxpayers are subsidising the wages of up to six million Australians. Mr Porter confirmed greater flexibility will be legislated surrounding bosses asking workers to run down leave entitlements. “So if someone had four weeks annual leave, for instance, they could reach an agreement with their employer to use two of them,” Mr Porter said. “So the employer might ask, [but] they would have to agree. “They could not unreasonably withhold the agreement. But if that became a matter of dispute that would be adjudicated on by the Fair Work Commission before the agreement became effective.” Labor and unions will support the package after securing extra protections, including a provision that employees be left with at least a fortnight’s leave.

Australia’s largest employers urgently need the ability to temporarily alter working hours and leave arrangements in consultation with unions so they can avoid falling into serious distress.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus breathing technique used by Harry Potter author","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/04\/07\/coronavirus-breathing-jk-rowling\/","transcript":"JK Rowling claims she’s recovered from a COVID-19-like illness with the help of a breathing technique. The Harry Potter author said she’s been experiencing all the symptoms of the coronavirus – but didn’t get officially tested – for the past two weeks. Rowling said she was following a breathing technique shared by a doctor at the Queen’s Hospital in London, on the advice from her husband, who is also a doctor. Rowling tweeted she’s now fully recovered from her illness, and that the technique “helped a lot”. Since Rowling shared her experience, medical experts have urged caution about the general public adopting the measure, saying patients could actually spread the coronavirus if they do have it. “While special breathing techniques have their place in hospital, under the supervision of a respiratory physiotherapist or respiratory doctor, and for certain medical conditions, using them at home to manage coronavirus symptoms could be dangerous,” Brian Oliver wrote in The Conversation, who is a research leader in respiratory cellular and molecular biology at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research. “The technique in the video could help spread the coronavirus to people close by.”  Dr Sarfaraz Munshi says the technique has been implemented in the hospital’s intensive care unit patients, but can be used by anyone the moment they’re diagnosed, or feel symptoms. Dr Munshi says it’s important to get oxygen deep into the lungs, where the virus is at its most potent, to aid the lungs’ function. It’s pretty simple: Take five deep breaths, holding each one in for five seconds, and on the sixth, hold it and then do a deep cough (while covering your mouth). Repeat this twice, then lie on your bed on your stomach for five to 10 minutes, and continue to breathe deeply.  Dr Munshi stressed lying on one’s stomach – because the majority of the lungs are at the back, lying on your back if you have a respiratory infection, does not help at all. “The most important thing is laying in bed for prolonged periods, on your back, is going to close off the small airways,” he says in the video. “[It will] increase your risk of secondary pneumonia, that can make your condition deteriorate much further – bearing in mind the patients that are deteriorating are deteriorating because of respiratory problems.” Please watch this doc from Queens Hospital explain how to relieve respiratory symptoms.

For a Republican, they’re at best irrelevant and, at worst, tedious reminders of how irrelevant the Royal Family has become. So why would I care that Her Majesty had addressed the British nation and, by extension, the Commonwealth, on the challenges presented by COVID-19? Seated beside a writing desk, her hands clasped on her lap, Queen Elizabeth II spoke from a sitting room at Windsor Castle on Sunday afternoon. This, I thought, would be five or so minutes of empty rhetoric and bland platitudes. But I was wrong. Her address was life-affirming and in a quiet, subdued way, inspirational. It was the sort of address every politician should aspire to deliver and about as far removed from a Donald Trump word-stew as one could imagine. Scott Morrison should watch and learn too. Perhaps it was her own proximity to the illness that inspired the Queen or her speechwriters. As she spoke, her Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in hospital fighting the disease and her oldest son, Charles, was recovering from it. She began with a nod to workers on the National Health Service frontline: “Every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times.” But then, in a clever segue, she thanked those who are, in effect, doing nothing. And constantly carping about it. “I also want to thank those of you who are staying at home, thereby helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones. “Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.” Her Majesty The Queen addresses the UK and the Commonwealth in a special broadcast recorded at Windsor Castle. pic.twitter.com\/HjO1uiV1Tm — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) April 5, 2020 But then came the master stroke, as she evoked the never-say-die spirit of Britons – and Australians – during the great wars. “I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. “And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.” It shouldn’t surprise us that the Queen and her communications team are capable of such oratory. After all, she’s been at it for 80 of her 93 years, a point she made along the way, again evoking World War II. “It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister. “We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety. “Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.” It dawned on me at this point that the speech, just 525 words, was as powerful for what it didn’t say as for what it did: It could be worse, you could be sheltering at home because people are trying to shoot or bomb you. So ‘Stop Whingeing And Get On With It’. (Last century, pre-Twitter, it was the more elegant, ‘Keep Calm And Carry On’.) It set up one last, telling point: Unlike the two world wars that defined the 20th century and divided people into enemies and allies, this 21st century pandemic unites us all. “This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. “We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us.” It took less than five minutes for Her Majesty to say what the supposed leader of the Free World, Donald Trump, has failed to do in hours and hours of televised bile, ineptitude and stupidity. Was it the Queen’s finest hour? It was certainly her best four-and-a-half minutes. Now, stop whingeing, watch the address and then get on with it."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus court: Think tank makes case for suing China","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/2020\/04\/07\/coronavirus-sue-china\/","transcript":"China should pay more than $6 trillion in compensation to countries affected by coronavirus, according to a conservative British think tank. Research from the Henry Jackson Society found China breached several of its obligations under the World Health Organisation’s international health regulations. The report claimed the Chinese government failed to share evidence of human-to-human transmission weeks after becoming aware of it, gave the UN “erroneous” infections data, and allowed five million people to leave Wuhan before locking the city down. The think tank consequently claims the communist superpower could be liable for the damage caused by the coronavirus, which amounts to roughly £3.2 trillion ($6.42 trillion) for the G7 nations alone. That figure could “be eclipsed several times over” once other nations are factored in, the report added. Australia alone could seek damages of up to £29.9 billion ($37 billion), the report said. “The Chinese Communist Party has learnt no lessons from its failure in the SARS epidemic of 2002-3,” one of the report’s co-authors, Matthew Henderson, said. “Their repeated blunders, lies and disinformation, from the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, have already had far more deadly consequences. “How this will translate into practice, time will tell.” The Society proposed 10 different avenues through which affected countries could theoretically pursue China, including the International Health Regulations. If Australia receiving a near-$30 billion cash injection from its largest trading partner sounds too good to be true, that’s probably because it is. UNSW law professor Natalie Klein told The New Daily there are several reasons why a payout of that magnitude is unlikely. Chief among these is that under most international legal systems, China would need to consent to having litigation filed against it before it could be sued. If China chooses not to consent, which Professor Klein said is the most likely option, there would be no case against it. “We don’t have an international court system where a state is compelled to appear before the court unless they’ve consented,” she said. But some treaties include clauses compelling signatory nations to consent to legal action. The Henry Jackson Society noted in its report that China has signed two of these treaties – the World Trade Organisation dispute settlement understanding and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Signatories of both treaties must consent to the exercise of jurisdiction before an international court or tribunal. But Professor Klein said it was doubtful these treaties would be enough to force China’s hand. “The report does identify those issues, but downplays how big those hurdles are,” she said. “Because it’s not just about getting consent – you also have to have a case which falls under the ‘subject matter jurisdiction’, which means it has to be about a particular topic.” Essentially, to make a legal challenge against another country under the two treaties identified in the report, the plaintiff state would have to challenge them over the interpretation or application of that specific treaty. “The main claim the report is making is about international health regulations, but that’s not a dispute about the interpretation or application of the law of the sea treaty, for example,” Professor Klein said. “What you would have to do to get before a court or tribunal under the law of the sea convention is to take some provision in that treaty and use it as a way to say something China did in its handling of this related to a clause in the convention – and there’s nothing that leaps out there.” Such a move would also bring political risks. For Australia, choosing to sue our largest trading partner would likely have long-term consequences."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Pope prays for those ‘suffering from unjust sentences’","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/george-pell\/2020\/04\/07\/pope-prays-unjust-sentences\/","transcript":"With news of Cardinal George Pell’s release from prison after the High Court quashed his child sex convictions, Pope Francis has offered his daily mass “for people who suffer unjust sentences because of persecution”. Vatican News reported on Tuesday evening (AEST) that the Pope introduced his mass saying that Jesus was hounded by the doctors of the law even though He was innocent. “I would like to pray today for all those persons who suffer an unjust sentence because of persecution,” Pope Francis said. The Vatican Press Office has yet to make a statement on Cardinal Pell’s release from prison after serving 400 days on charges of assaulting two choirboys in the 1990s. AAP reports that in recent weeks, the Pope’s intentions for nearly all of his daily masses have been related to the coronavirus pandemic. In these days of #Lent, we've been witnessing the persecution that Jesus underwent and how He was judged ferociously, even though He was innocent. Let us #PrayTogether today for all those persons who suffer due to an unjust sentence because of someone had it in for them. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) April 7, 2020 The Pope, who appointed Cardinal Pell to overhaul the Vatican’s vast finances in 2014, had said he would comment only after all avenues of appeal had been exhausted. Leading mass in his residence Casa Santa Marta, the Pope reminded the faithful that serving God was a vocation. “Each one of us has a destiny, a free destiny. The destiny is the election of God. I am born chosen to be a servant of God with the task of serving.” “To serve is not pretending that we have any other benefit to give than serving.” Vatican News said Pope Francis explained the important thing is our attitude before God and that except for Our Lady and Jesus, we have all fallen. “The example of Peter is a source of inspiration. When Peter denied Jesus and the cock crowed, he cried and repented. This is the path of a servant who asks for forgiveness when he or she slips and falls. “The other path is that of the servant who is incapable of understanding that he or she has fallen. This path leaves the heart open to the passions that lead to idolatry.” Concluding his homily, the Pope invited the assembled to think of Jesus who was faithful in service. “We are by vocation meant to serve and not to make a profit from our position in the church,” Vatican News said. Cardinal Pell is not expected to return to a Holy See job. The cardinal had been on a leave of absence from the post, whose formal title is Prefect for the Secretariat of the Economy, since 2017. Last year, the Pope named a successor, Spanish Jesuit priest Juan Antonio Guerrero Alves.

Releasing the official modelling that has governed the national cabinet’s response but had remained secret until now, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday it clearly showed the government’s strategy of border closures and social distancing was working and saving lives. It was buying hospitals, doctors and nurses vital time by slowing the number of cases and allowing hospitals to prepare for patients, especially those who require intensive care. But it is not yet extinguishing the virus in Australia. “There is no map for this. We are in uncharted territory,” the Prime Minister said. “We have bought valuable time, but we cannot be complacent. We must keep tension in the cord. “This Easter weekend will be incredibly important. Stay at home.” The long-awaited modelling tells the nation little about the impact of the virus in Australia or projected deaths because it is not based on local data. Mr Morrison stressed the modelling released on Tuesday was “theoretical” and based on international data. Further work will be needed on the 6000 Australian coronavirus cases to consider the next steps. The greatest concern remains the rate of community transmission in Sydney, where those afflicted have had no known close contact with an infected person or a returning traveller from overseas. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said social distancing measures would remain a fact of life until a vaccine is found. “That is the new normal,” Ms Berejiklian said. “Not having physical contact, socially distancing is, at the very minimum, a way of life for us. Because we have to be honest with ourselves – until a vaccine is found, there is no simple way to deal with this issue.” However, chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy did not rule out a strategy of trying to “eliminate” the virus in Australia – an approach pursued in parts of China. “That’s a good question. That was a strategy that was undertaken in Wuhan to completely stop transmission. And that is one of the options available,” he said. “The issue then, though, is you don’t have any immunity in the population and you really do need to control your borders in a very aggressive way for a long time. There is no clear answer there are lots of potential paths. “We are not pursuing a path of herd immunity.” Professor Murphy conceded that a vaccine was not a foregone conclusion. “We don’t know if and when a vaccine will come. If it does, that’s a beautiful way out,” he said. Mr Morrison said in terms of the eventual lifting of restrictions, the national cabinet would look at all the information. Some states and territories might ease their restrictions before others."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Rent relief for virus-affected businesses | The New Daily","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/07\/rent-relief-virus-affected-businesses\/","transcript":"Small businesses shut down because of coronavirus will soon have their rent reduced in line with their revenue falls. The prime minister and premiers have agreed to a mandatory code of conduct for commercial tenancies to be legislated across all states and territories. It does not apply to residential tenants. The rules will apply to commercial tenancies where the tenant or landlord is eligible for the JobKeeper payment and has a turnover of $50 million or less. Landlords must not evict tenants and will have to lower commercial rents in line with the company’s falling revenue. Tenants must not break the lease under the new rules. Residential rental agreements will be dealt with separately by individual jurisdictions. Asked about the option of mediation, which is available for commercial tenancies, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was a matter for the states and territories. Political leaders largely agreed with the strategy, but industry figures proved much harder to convince. Senator Cormann said there were a range of competing interests at play. “Depending on whether you are the landlord or the tenant, your interests are obviously not necessarily aligned,” he told Sky News. “We would say they should be in this context, and there should be scope for landlords and tenants to work through these issues with each other constructively, given the circumstances. “That’s sometimes easier said than done.” Senator Cormann said the code of conduct would include scope for landlords who “do the right thing” during the COVID-19 crisis to receive land tax relief or deferral. “We are trying to do our bit, providing the right incentives along the way,” the minister said. “But we do also expect that landlords will do the right thing in relation to those tenants who are in financial distress.” The prime minister has already announced a six-month moratorium on evictions for people in financial distress and hardship.

Mr Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London – just a mile from his home and office at 10 Downing Street – late on Sunday. He had suffered persistent coronavirus symptoms, including a high temperature, for more than 10 days. His condition rapidly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was moved to intensive care, where the most serious cases are treated. Although he has received oxygen, his office said Mr Johnson remains conscious. Late on Tuesday afternoon (Australian time), two sources close to the British PM said there had been no change in his condition. Mr Johnson is a controversial figure and his initial positive diagnosis attracted a level of schadenfreude from political opponents and those who questioned his initial slow response to the threat of pandemic. Britain’s first coronavirus death came on March 5, just two days after Mr Johnson said he had visited a hospital and “shook hands with everybody”. Indeed, the PM’s initial response to the escalating virus threat seemed to veer dangerously close to the now discredited notion of “herd immunity”. He warned the British public that “many families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time”. It took another two weeks that the government implemented social distancing and lockdown measures. Britain has already recorded 52,279 cases of the coronavirus, 5385 people have died and 287 patients have recovered. Now Mr Johnson is among them, in his own fight for life. His foreign minister, Dominic Raab, is deputising for him as Britain tackles the COVID-19 crisis and world leaders rally to offer support. Usual opponents of Mr Johnson have also taken to social media to wish him the best, with many rejecting any suggestion that he should not be supported during his illness. “The PM has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State, to deputise for him where necessary,” Downing Street said. Just hours earlier, Mr Johnson’s office had said he was in good spirits and Mr Raab had told a news conference that the Prime Minister was still running the country. Mr Johnson, who is expecting a child with partner Carrie Symonds, has had persistent coronavirus symptoms since testing positive for the infection on March 26. Ms Symonds is unable to visit him because she is in isolation after also being confirmed to have the virus. Mr Johnson had been in isolation in an apartment at Downing Street, and until Tuesday morning (Australian time) his office had insisted he was continuing work as usual. Just hours later, the government released a less optimistic statement and confirmed that Mr Raab had been deputised to stand in for the PM. Buckingham Palace said the Queen was being kept informed by Downing Street and US President Donald Trump said all Americans were praying for Mr Johnson’s recovery. “He’s been really something very special – strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up,” Mr Trump said. He said he had asked two pharmaceutical firms developing potential COVID-19 therapies to get in touch with the British government to offer their services. “We’ve contacted all of Boris’ doctors and we’ll see what is going to take place,” he said. “But they are ready to go.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote alongside a love heart and prayer emoji: “Get well soon Boris … I wish you a speedy recovery.” “Thoughts and prayers with Boris, @carriesymonds and all their family. This is such a terrible virus that we all must take seriously,” wrote MP Ian Blackford. “This must be so scary. I hope the government can now stop this pretence that all is fine and concentrate on getting him well and reassure the country,” MP Layla Moran wrote. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also wished Mr Johnson a speedy recovery. “Thinking of you, your family and all our UK friends at this tough time,” Mr Morrison said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Victoria Police waive $1600 fine for learner driver","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/07\/coronavirus-learner-driver-fine\/","transcript":"The mother of an L-Plater who was fined $1600 by Victoria Police for having a driving lesson says she is “relieved” the fine has now been waived and the rules made clear for learner drivers. Hunter Reynolds, 17, and her mother Sheree were issued the $1652 on-the-spot infringement as they drove from their home in the bayside Melbourne suburb of Hampton to Frankston on Sunday. Sheree told 3AW on Monday that the police officer who fined them said they were driving “too far from home”. The drive from Hampton to Frankston takes about 36 minutes. In response to public outrage, Victoria Police withdrew the fine on Tuesday, conceding the law “wasn’t widely understood by the public”. But, driving lessons will remain banned in the state under tough COVID-19 social distancing laws – meaning other learners could be fined. Ms Reynolds told The New Daily she was pleased the rule had been clarified for other Victorian parents. “I think the majority of people were thinking it was still OK to do some educational learning with their children,” Ms Reynolds said. “We weren’t getting out of the car, nor visiting anybody – we were purely just going for a drive because it was great learning in the wet conditions and I wouldn’t have thought that would’ve been problematic. “If anything, now Victorians know where they can stand as to whether they can or can’t drive with an L-plater.” For those asking – yes – we’ve seen a copy of the actual infringement notice handed yesterday to a 17yo L Plater having a training drive with mum in the rain yesterday. pic.twitter.com\/VjZTkNJVni — Heidi Murphy (@heidimur) April 6, 2020  Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton told 3AW on Tuesday that the officer should have shown discretion and issued a warning to the pair instead. “We will withdraw it because clearly that [law] wasn’t widely understood by the public,” Deputy Commissioner Patton said. “But it has, to a degree, highlighted a significant issue in terms of something that needed clarity. “Undertaking a driving lesson by itself, to go out and simply drive off somewhere to undertake a driving lesson with your parent – you are not able to do it.” During the past 24 hours, Victoria Police has issued 77 fines to people breaching lockdown laws, bringing the total number of infringements to 377 since the new restrictions were introduced on March 30. Since March 21, officers have conducted 15,232 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services operating across the state. Meanwhile in New South Wales, two off-duty police offers have been fined for breaching public health orders over the weekend. About 8.30pm on Saturday, officers spotted a 27-year-old woman who appeared drunk being helped by a man on King Street after attending a social gathering. It was later discovered the woman was a senior constable, as well as a 27-year-old man who attended the same social event. Both were fined $1000. In Queensland, where the state’s borders have been sealed completely, police have issued 174 fines and turned around 852 vehicles."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus books: Five potential winners from the Stella Price shortlist","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/books\/2020\/04\/07\/coronavirus-books-stella-prize\/","transcript":"On April 14 the winner of the 2020 Stella Prize will be announced.

You may not have time before next week’s announcement to read all this year’s shortlisted books. Then again, in these isolating times, anything is possible. See What You Made Me Do (non-fiction) Jess Hill Investigative journalist Jess Hill tackles with courage and tenacity the difficult topic of domestic violence. She deftly balances superb and often gut-wrenching storytelling with compelling facts and research. Writer Helen Garner  describes it as  “a shattering book: clear-headed, meticulous, driving always at the truth”. A must-read. Diving Into Glass (non-fiction) Caro Llewellyn Former literary festival director and writer Caro Llewellyn’s story of the life-changer moment when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis is captured beautifully in this fine memoir.

Also a classic Nina Simone is rescued and re released and the next Lucinda Williams puts her game face on. Fodder on my wings Nina Simone  Largely unavailable since its 1982 release, Fodder was recorded when Nina was on the positive side of the curve. That means that the burning anger that seethed through her soulful, jazz tunes was kept in check. Her cover of the pop hit Alone Again (Naturally) is transformed from a sappy ballad into a merciless indictment of her father whom she is happy to see dying in the other room. It’s not all doom and gloom though: I Sing Just to Know I’m Alive is a joyous and defiant Simone tune. Nina never respected segregation and here she veers from Africa to all the Americas. She recounts the night she danced nude in the Liberian nightclub and that’s what this album sounds just like.  St Cloud Waxahatchie Katie Crutchfield is another one of those fiery women songwriters in the tradition of Lucinda Williams – she has issues, she has a dark past and she wants to tell us about it. This second Waxahatchie LP is rooted in solid acoustic-guitarish songwriting, but then flavoured with spooky ‘90s ambience in places. Tunes such as Fire are quite seductive. Recently sober Crutchfield takes her vocal to interesting places.  Summertime Orville Peck Country music just keeps getting further and further out there. Leading the posse is Orville Peck whose 19 inch LP Pony was one of the highlights of last year. His growling baritone is a bit menacing and a bit romantic like a Morrissey imitating Johnny Cash. Peck, not his real name, apparently has a background in punk and alternative rock which accounts for the hard edges to his songs. Orville is never seen without his mask which is part Lone Ranger and part harem girl. But the songs actually transcend the fancy dress. Could well be a next big thing.  Walkabout Nick Lowe & Los Straightjackets  What is it about men in stupid masks? Los Straightjackets are an instrumental surf band that dress like Mexican wrestlers. But boy, can they rock as the lucky few who caught Nick’s recent tour will attest. Nick was one of the architects of punk rock, producing Elvis Costello and the Damned and his own work during the 1970s and ‘80s. He exchanged the leather jacket for a cardigan and has quietly turned out a solid body of work – songs in the traditional style performed with grace and a sense of humour. This album was assembled from earlier Eps plus six instrumental Nick Lowe hits including (What’s So Funny About) Peace, Love and Understanding. An album for when the relos come over for a spot of tea.

The latest Essential Research poll finds more people have limited their outings to social spaces, shops, restaurants and group events and stopped shaking hands or hugging people than a week ago. About four-in-five of those surveyed are following health advice to stay home unless strictly necessary and to keep 1.5 metres from others. Half have also cut down on their use of cash amid concerns money changing hands could be spreading the virus. At the same time, the number of people who had bought extra groceries to stock their pantries dropped in the past week to less than two-in-five. Those in regional areas were less likely to be stocking up on food. The poll was released as the country’s major supermarket chains introduced further restrictions on shoppers ahead of the long Easter weekend. Woolworths, Coles and Aldi all said they would limit the number of customers allowed in their stores and manage queues outside to ensure shoppers remained at least 1.5 metres apart from each other. In a statement, Woolworths said it would use signs and traffic cones to tell customers where to line up, and the number of customers allowed in-store would be managed on a one in, one out policy. The changes are being introduced this week. “Depending on how busy the store is, we may limit the number of people entering the store from time to time. Customer limits will be specific to each location and based on the size of the store,” supermarkets managing director Claire Peters said. “We know it may take some getting used to but we ask our customers to be patient with us during this time. Supermarkets overseas have successfully adopted similar measures.”  ❗UPDATES TO COLES TRADING❗As of Monday April 6th, restrictions will be placed on the number of customers within Coles… Posted by Hawaiian's Park Centre on Saturday, April 4, 2020 Coles will role out similar measures this week. Chief operating officer Matt Swindells told Melbourne’s Triple M radio on Monday that customers would be asked to queue outside. “We have people counting customers in and have people counting customers out,” he said. The number of people allowed into each supermarket will depend on the size of the store. Aldi said it would allow 70-100 shoppers in each of its supermarkets, depending on size. There will be similar queuing measures, monitored by security guards. Aldi is also installing plastic screens at its checkouts and hygiene stations with hand sanitiser and trolley wipes at store entries. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cardinal George Pell leaves prison after High Court quashes abuse convictions | The New Daily","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/07\/george-pell-released-jail\/","transcript":"Cardinal George Pell has been released from a maximum security prison south-west of Melbourne after the High Court quashed his five convictions for child sexual abuse. In a unanimous decision handed down at 10am on Tuesday, all seven High Court justices said Cardinal Pell should be acquitted. “There is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted because the evidence did not establish guilt to the requisite standard of proof,” the full bench of seven judges said in their judgment, handed down in Brisbane. At 12.30pm, as two helicopters and a pack of journalists gathered outside Barwon maximum security prison at Lara, Cardinal Pell emerged, alone in the back seat of a small black SUV, and was driven away. The ABC reported he was then taken to a church property in Melbourne’s inner east, where a nun greeted him at the door and helped him inside. He had served 400 days behind bars. Even before he had been driven from the jail, Cardinal Pell had released a statement saying a “serious injustice” had been remedied. “I hold no ill will to my accuser. I do not want my acquittal to add to the hurt and bitterness so many feel; there is certainly hurt and bitterness enough,” he said. “However, my trial was not a referendum on the Catholic Church; nor a referendum on how Church authorities in Australia dealt with the crime of paedophilia in the Church. “The point was whether I had committed these awful crimes, and I did not.” Shortly after the cardinal’s release, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews posted a short statement to social media: “I make no comment about today’s High Court decision”. “But I have a message for every single victim and survivor of child sex abuse: I see you. I hear you. I believe you,” he wrote. There was widespread reaction after the High Court’s ruling: From the key witness in the Cardinal’s trials, from his friends and supporters and from Australia’s Catholic bishops. The father of the choirboy who died in 2014, one of two boys Cardinal Pell was charged with abusing, said he was shocked at the High Court’s decision. His lawyer Lisa Flynn said in a statement the father was also heartbroken for the surviving boy. “Our client says this man, who the jury believed, is an upstanding citizen who had nothing to gain from speaking out other than to protect other children from the pain and suffering he has to live with on a daily basis,” Ms Flynn said. The father will continue to pursue a civil case against Cardinal Pell. Cardinal Pell was charged by Victoria Police officers after a man came forward in 2014 alleging he and another choirboy had been sexually abused at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996. That former choirboy, now in his 30s, gave evidence in court, revealing he felt compelled to come forward after the death of the other boy. A jury convicted Cardinal Pell of five charges in December 2018. An earlier trial had been abandoned after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Lawyers for the surviving complainant aren’t expected to make any statement on Tuesday. In a statement, Victoria Police acknowledged the work of its investigators and said support was being provided to the complainant in the case. “Victoria Police remains committed to investigating sexual assault offences and providing justice for victims no matter how many years have passed,” the statement said. Victoria’s Office of Public Prosecutions would not comment on its decision to prosecute Cardinal Pell, or on the High Court’s ruling. Meanwhile, former prime minister and Pell supporter Tony Abbott told reporters in Sydney he didn’t want to comment other than saying “let the judgment speak for itself”. “That’s as it’s been and as it will be but, as I said, today is just a day to let the High Court judgement speak for itself,” he said. Cardinal Pell’s release from jail has also been welcomed by those who believe in his innocence. Australian Catholic Bishops Conference president and Brisbane Archbishop Mark Coleridge said the result did not change the church’s commitment to child safety. “Today’s outcome will be welcomed by many, including those who have believed in the cardinal’s innocence throughout this lengthy process,” Archbishop Coleridge said. “We also recognise that the High Court’s decision will be devastating for others. “Many have suffered greatly through the process, which has now reached its conclusion.” Archbishop Coleridge said anyone with allegations of sexual abuse by church personnel should go to the police. “The result today does not change the church’s unwavering commitment to child safety and to a just and compassionate response to survivors and victims of child sexual abuse,” he said. Ballarat Bishop Paul Bird said the case had divided opinions in legal circles and the general community, and particularly in his diocese because of Cardinal Pell’s early connections there. “Now that the highest court in the land has given a judgment, I hope this will bring some sense of resolution to all those affected by the proceedings,” Bishop Bird said. Bishop Bird said the High Court decision ended months of uncertainty. “The whole process of trials and appeals has been distressing, most immediately for those directly involved in the court proceedings but also for others in the community, including victims and survivors of abuse and their families.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Four cruise ships ordered to leave Queensland waters","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/qld\/2020\/04\/07\/cruise-ships-queensland-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Four cruise ships off the coast of Queensland have been ordered to leave by Wednesday to limit the spread of the lethal coronavirus across the state. There had been nine cruise liners of the state’s coast, but five have already left. The remaining four, which are being refuelled, have been told to leave by one minute before midnight on Wednesday. “If you do see a cruise ship at a port today or tomorrow, they are just refuelling and then they will be on their way,” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. Queensland Ports Minister Mark Bailey said none of the five foreign-flagged ships was carrying any passengers. The total number of coronavirus diagnoses in Queensland has reached 934 with an additional 13 cases overnight. Of the current cases, 42 people had been hospitalised and 11 are in intensive care on ventilation. Health Minister Steven Miles said four of Queensland’s five fatalities from the coronavirus were people who had been on cruise ships. Among them were passengers of the ill-fated Ruby Princess, from which 12 people have since died. The NSW Police homicide squad is investigating the cruise ship, which has become the largest single source of Australian Covid-19 infections, accounting for about 10 per cent of the total. The Ruby Princess eventually docked in Wollongong on Monday, with no passengers but more than 200 sick crew members on board. Queensland’s order follows similar instructions to cruise ships off NSW and Western Australia. On March 27, Australian Border Force ordered all cruise ships to leave Australian territory without docking, unless they had permission, their safety was at risk or their voyage had started in Australia. Former cruise ship passengers account for 119 cases of the virus in Queensland. A further six people have caught the coronavirus from the passengers. “We need to stop these cruise ships coming into Queensland and bringing the virus with them,” Mr Miles said. He urged people in the state to think about how they would spend the Easter Holiday at home amid travel and social distancing restrictions. It was announced on Monday that more people will be tested for coronavirus in Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast after a handful of people mysteriously contracted the disease. Police also are continuing to crack down on those breaching public health directions, issuing 174 fines for the offence. Thousands more who have been stopped by police while trying to cross the state’s border have been ordered into quarantine. Authorities have directed 2460 people intercepted at state road borders to go into quarantine, along with another 2386 people who arrived on domestic flights. A further 34 domestic flight passengers have been refused entry to Queensland under its strict coronavirus border legislation. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Read full statement from Cardinal George Pell | The New Daily","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/george-pell\/2020\/04\/07\/george-pell-statement\/","transcript":"Read the full statement by Cardinal George Pell: I have consistently maintained my innocence while suffering from a serious injustice.

As the High Court decision was handed down, Pell was with a small number of his legal team inside the maximum security Barwon prison at Lara on the south western outskirts of Melbourne. He released a statement at 11am saying he had “maintained his innocence while suffering from a serious injustice”. “I hold no ill will toward my accuser. I do not want my acquittal to add to the hurt and bitterness so many feel; there is certainly hurt and bitterness enough.” The ABC’s Kate McKenna reported that due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, the High Court registry room in Brisbane, which usually sits about 16 people in the public gallery, only allowed three journalists inside for the decision on Tuesday morning. “So they kept the door open and at 10am, the Chief Justice [Susan Kiefel] entered the room and swiftly delivered the verdict, essentially allowing Cardinal Pell special leave to appeal and allowing the appeal itself and quashing his convictions,” she explained. Chief Justice Kiefel handed down the ruling on behalf of the full bench  to the near-empty High Court, and unanimously found Pell’s conviction for child sex abuse should be overturned and he should immediately be released from prison. At 10.30am, Victoria Police released a statement regarding the High Court decision: “We respect the decision of the High Court in this matter and continue to provide support to those complainants involved. Victoria Police remains committed to investigating sexual assault offences and providing justice for victims no matter how many years have passed. “We would also like to acknowledge the thorough work on this case by Taskforce Sano investigators over many years,” it read. Pell, 78, Australia’s most senior Catholic, was convicted in December 2018 of raping a 13-year-old choirboy and molesting his friend after a Sunday Mass at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996. He has maintained his innocence since being confronted with the allegations by Victoria Police in Rome four years ago, but a jury of 12 and Victoria’s Court of Appeal ruled otherwise. Pell’s lawyers have argued the jury was wrong and the appeal court majority made a mistake. The High Court handed down its decision in Brisbane on Tuesday morning. The appeal bid was based on two grounds – firstly that Chief Justice Ann Ferguson and President Chris Maxwell made an error in requiring Pell to prove the offending was “impossible” in order to raise reasonable doubt. Secondly, his lawyers have argued the judges erred in concluding the guilty verdicts were not unreasonable, because of findings there was reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The full bench of seven judges must first determine whether they will granted Pell special leave to appeal the decision, before the appeal itself can be determined. Pell has spent more than 400 days behind bars since being taken into custody last February. His lawyers have urged the High Court to quash his convictions and release him immediately. Prosecutors, led by Victoria’s Director of Public Prosecutions Kerri Judd QC, want his conviction to stand. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australian virus toll rises as another Ruby Princess passenger dies","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/07\/coronavirus-fatalities-australia\/","transcript":"Five more elderly Australians have died of the coronavirus, including another passenger from the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship. NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said on Tuesday morning a woman, 87, had died and a man, 90, who had been living at the Opal aged-care facility in Bankstown in western Sydney, had also died. On Tuesday afternoon, an elderly Tasmanian man in his 80s died in the state’s North West Regional Hospital. His death brought to 13 the number of passengers from the Ruby Princess who have lost their lives to COVID-19. The ship is also linked to at least 622 COVID-19 cases. In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews announced another person had died overnight. South Australia also recorded its first death, of a man aged 75. SA’s chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said it was believed he also had some underlying health issues. She said the death emphasised just how serious the virus could be. “This is not just a statistic, it’s a person who has been a real integral part of a family,” she said. “A very much beloved, father, husband and possibly grandfather as well.” It brings the total number of COVID-19 deaths in Australia to 46. NSW has 2686 cases and 21 deaths, while Victoria has 1191 cases and 11 dead – they are the two states with the highest number of confirmed cases. The Ruby Princess cruise ship is still docked in Port Kembla, near Wollongong. It is expected to stay there for 10 days while its 1040 crew members have medical assessments, treatment or emergency extractions. About 200 have symptoms of coronavirus. The NSW Police homicide squad is investigating why passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship in Sydney on March 19 despite concerns some might have contracted the illness. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller on Tuesday told ABC Radio the investigation wouldn’t be rushed, saying “I just need to make sure I get the right outcome”. “There is global attention. Do we rush it for some political win or do we do the proper job that we should do, which is a criminal investigation into what will be a complex matter with lots of witnesses?” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the number of new cases in the state continued to “stabilise and even decline” but said social distancing was the “new way of life” until a vaccine was developed. “For the first time in a long time, every scientist on the planet is working towards a vaccine, working towards a cure, and, of course, we want NSW to be part of that story,” Ms Berejiklian said. “We want our best and brightest in NSW and across Australia working their guts out to make sure that we find a vaccine as soon as possible. “Because the reality is that until we find a vaccine, we all have to live with this virus. “And no matter what restrictions there are in the future, no matter what restrictions are potentially eased in the future, until a vaccine is found, social distancing is a way of life now.” Mr Andrews said that by staying at home, it was “delivering results that are so much better than so many other parts of the world that are gripped by unbearable tragedy” “As they see so many cases, their hospital system is then overwhelmed, and we see some of those shocking scenes, those wicked scenes in places like New York,” he said on Tuesday."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Finally some good news: Easter Bunny declared an 'essential service'","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/07\/easter-bunny-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Easter long weekend is looming – and while it’s hardly a typical holiday break, there will still be plenty wanting to spend their days at home indulging in good food and chocolate. It might be comforting to know, then, that at least one constant has widespread approval to get on with his “essential” job – the Easter Bunny. “I’m told because he’s a solo operator and an essential service, he or she, will be allowed to continue to operate,” Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has said. It’s a view endorsed in at least two Australian states. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said the Easter Bunny fitted into the same category as health care workers, military personnel, transport and freight specialists, and MPs, and would be allowed to get on with his job despite the island state’s strict coronavirus travel bans. “I’ve actually had a number of emails … one from a delightful young fellow whose brother was taken out of school [and had to] self-isolate because he had an underlying health condition,” he told the Nine Network. “He wrote to me, an eight-year-old … wanting to know whether or not the Easter Bunny would come. “It’s my personal view, based on a discussion with Public Health [Services] … that the Easter Bunny can be classed as an essential traveller and therefore will be in the state over Easter and able to deliver Easter eggs.” It’s a similar situation in Western Australia – which has closed its borders to try to halt the spread of the virus. Premier Mark McGowan said he’d also been hit up by concerned kids – and had decided to allow the Easter Bunny free travel throughout the state. Over the ditch in New Zealand, where the nation will head into its third week in a strict lockdown at the Easter weekend, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also given the all-clear for the busy bunny – and another essential co-worker. “We do consider both the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to be essential workers,” she said on Monday. Ms Ardern said 2020 had already been particularly tough for the Easter Bunny. “They’re going to be potentially quite busy at home with their family as well and their own bunnies,” she said. “So I say to the children of New Zealand if the Easter Bunny doesn’t make it to your household, then we have to understand that it’s a bit difficult at the moment.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Boris Johnson in intensive care as coronavirus symptoms worsen","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/07\/boris-johnson-intensive-care-coronavirus\/","transcript":"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being treated for worsening coronavirus symptoms in an intensive care unit, with his foreign minister deputising for him as the nation tackles the COVID-19 crisis. The UK has so far recorded 52,279 positive cases of the coronavirus, 5385 people have lost their lives and 287 patients have recovered. Mr Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London late on Sunday after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms, including a high temperature, for more than 10 days. His condition rapidly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was moved to an intensive care unit, where the most serious cases are treated. Although he had received oxygen, his office said he was still conscious. Downing Street said the move to intensive care was “a precaution should he require ventilation to aid his recovery”. Britain has no formal succession plan should a prime minister become incapacitated. “The PM has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State, to deputise for him where necessary,” Downing Street said. Just hours earlier, Johnson’s office said he was in good spirits and Mr Raab had told a news conference that the prime minister was still running the government. “The government’s business will continue,” a sombre Mr Raab, 46, told reporters, saying Johnson was in the safe hands of a brilliant medical team. “The focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the prime minister’s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward.” Mr Johnson, who is expecting a child with partner Carrie Symonds, has had persistent coronavirus symptoms since testing positive for the infection on March 26. He was working from an apartment at Downing Street, and until Tuesday morning (Australian time) his office had insisted he was continuing work as usual. Just hours later, the government released a less optimistic statement and confirmed that Mr Raab had been deputised to stand in for the PM.

Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth had been kept informed by Downing Street and US President Donald Trump said all Americans were praying for his recovery. “He’s been really something very special – strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up,” Mr Trump told a news briefing, adding he had asked two pharmaceutical firms developing potential COVID-19 therapies to get in touch with the British government to offer their services. “We’ve contacted all of Boris’ doctors and we’ll see what is going to take place,” he said. “But they are ready to go.” Mr Johnson and his health minister tested positive last month and chief medical adviser Chris Whitty self-isolated. Mr Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote alongside a love heart and prayer emoji: “Get well soon Boris..

With a total of 21 residents and staff testing positive to coronavirus, Mr Low maintained that all employees were “doing their very best caring for our residents as they would their own family”. While aged care homes are hotbeds for the flu-like illness, putting already vulnerable elderly at further risk, Australian authorities are also grappling with the emergence of another virus risk site: cruise ships. So far at least 622 cases of COVID-19 in Australia have been linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Speaking on ABC’s Q&A on Monday night, Labor’s health spokesman Chris Bowen said the approval granted for the Ruby Princess to dock in Sydney in March was a form of “criminal negligence”. “…The blame game that’s being played between the Commonwealth, the state and the cruise company is just unbelievable,” Mr Bowen said. The NSW Police homicide squad is investigating why passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship in Sydney on March 19 despite concerns some might have contracted the coronavirus during the voyage. “To just ask the cruise company ‘do you have anybody with COVID-19?’ ‘No, we don’t.’ ‘Right you are, off you come.’ [Allowing] 2,000 people into Sydney is just gobsmacking negligence,” Mr Bowen said. “There has to be a full explanation to the Australian people about how Border Force let that happen. It is just unacceptable.” On Monday, the Ruby Princess docked in Port Kembla, near Wollongong, where it is expected to remain for 10 days while its 1040 crew members undergo medical assessments, treatment or emergency extractions. About 200 of them have symptoms of the coronavirus. Former vice-president of the Australian Medical Association Dr Stephen Parnis revealed that heads of medical departments across the nation were flocking to Bunnings stores in desperate search of face masks and other protective medical supplies that are rapidly dwindling. Speaking on ABC’s Q&A program, Dr Parnis said he has seen first-hand the extent to which medical professionals are running out of personal protective equipment. It was not enough that healthcare workers relied on overseas supplies because they were at jeopardy. The general public, therefore, has an important role to play in ensuring personal protective equipment get to frontline staff, he said. “I spoke to a number of colleagues around the country before coming onto the program and I have to say we’re all very worried about the provision of personal protective equipment,” Dr Parnis said. “I’ve seen department directors going to Bunnings, I’ve seen people look and hope they might have contacts overseas [for PPE] and it’s probably the number one concern for health workers around the country at the moment.” His concerns were echoed by GP Vyom Sharma, who repeated what authorities have said in the past about the need to not hoard face masks. “What people need to understand is that the most important mask is the one that’s going to end up on the faces of healthcare workers and patients,” Dr Sharma said. “That’s what’s at greatest benefit for society. And what we don’t want is a run on surgical masks occurring, so our frontline workers are left empty.” -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Popular UK video games to show coronavirus safety advice","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/07\/video-game-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Top video games in the United Kingdom are being updated to display coronavirus safety advice in an effort to help young people get the message to stay home.

Health Minister Greg Hunt said the figures will underline the life-saving effect of the shutdowns that have forced thousands of Australians into unemployment. “Were there to have been no actions by the government, we could have had a catastrophic death rate and death toll,” Mr Hunt said. “Early on, we were worried because we could see predictions of a globally catastrophic virus. Sadly, we are seeing that play out in some countries. “That scenario was before us.” Just a fortnight ago, Australia’s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly urged Australians to “do the maths” on how many people would die from COVID-19. The numbers were terrifying. It suggested up to 150,000 Australians could die from the killer virus, which still has no known vaccine. No amount of reassurance that the majority of COVID cases are “mild” could sugar-coat that number. Professor Kelly came close to nominating the potential death toll on March 16, when he conceded anywhere between 20 and 60 per cent of the nation’s citizens could contract the disease. “It’s something in the range. I’m not going to speculate on the actual numbers,” Professor Kelly said. “The death rate is around one per cent. You can do the maths.” Based on the more conservative prediction of one in five Australians contracting the virus, that would result in five million people being infected and about 50,000 deaths based on a 1 per cent death rate. But if 60 per cent of the population was infected, the death toll could rise to 150,000 people and 15 million patients, overwhelming GPs and hospitals. Just a few weeks on from that grim prediction, the Morrison government is more confident the tough measures to shut down the nation’s borders, pubs, cafes and restaurants are working. On Tuesday, after national cabinet meets to discuss the COVID-19 modelling, it will be released in some form designed to reassure families that the lockdown tactics are working. What we do know is at 3pm on April 6, a total of 5795 cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Australia, including 39 deaths. The majority of cases are from New South Wales, followed by Victoria and Queensland. The median age of all cases is 47 years and the median age of deaths is 80 years. There are clues in those numbers about at-risk groups: The higher proportion of females in the 20 to 29 age group is under investigation. In men, there’s a higher proportion of cases in an older 40 to 49 age group. The good news is that “the curve” of new cases appears to be flattening for now. Over the past 24 hours was 2 per cent, compared to 12 per cent reported a week ago. The vast majority – 66 per cent – have recent international travel history. A stunning 1000 COVID cases in Australia are associated with cruise ship travel or contact with people returning from cruise ship travel. Australia has conducted 300,000 tests and about 2 per cent have been positive. It’s important to do things that help us build and maintain good mental health.

Social media erupted on Monday after a Victorian learner driver who was trying to get her logbook hours up was slapped with a $1652 fine. Police found the 17-year-old’s journey was not ‘essential travel’, raising questions about whether the laws have been explained well enough to the general public. Still, there have also been many instances of people ignoring lockdown instructions from state governments. Officers aren’t just roaming the streets or knocking on doors to catch people who are flouting the rules. In Western Australia, authorities have taken the unprecedented step of deploying drones to help enforce public gathering restrictions. The New Daily has taken a look at each state and territory and how police are enforcing lockdowns. The number of fines issued by Victoria Police in the 24 hours leading up until 8am on Monday was 108. That number reached 307 by the afternoon. Since March 21, officers have conducted a total of 14,275 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services. There were 983 checks performed on Sunday alone. A police spokesperson said they were unable to provide any background or breakdowns of data due to the high number of fines and spot checks. As for the L-plater who copped a hefty fine for being on the road in Melbourne’s south-east with her mother, Victoria Police confirmed with The New Daily that Assistant Commissioner Bob Hill will review the matter to find out “whether discretion could have been used in this instance”. For those asking – yes – we’ve seen a copy of the actual infringement notice handed yesterday to a 17yo L Plater having a training drive with mum in the rain yesterday. pic.twitter.com\/VjZTkNJVni — Heidi Murphy (@heidimur) April 6, 2020 From Thursday, 200 public service officers will be spread across Melbourne CBD, as well as commercial hubs and suburban areas across greater Melbourne and the regions, including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. They will also continue to patrol the 83 train stations across Victoria, despite lower passenger numbers. A further 18 coronavirus-related fines were issued at the weekend. Police confirmed several people had been attending barbecues. A 21-year-old ignored a swimming ban and then coughed at officers on Bondi Beach. He later tested negative for the coronavirus. Police are issuing more severe penalties than any other state or territory. Individuals could face up to six months in jail and\/or fined $11,000, plus a $5500-per-day fine if they keep breaking the rules. For corporations, those fines are $55,000 and $27,500 respectively. Across the state, police, defence and emergency service personnel have performed more than 5000 checks on people who are in quarantine. Police have charged at least five people, including three drivers who had their vehicles intercepted due to failure to comply with a direction from the Director of Public Health. Another 50-year-old man who recently returned to Tasmania from Victoria was charged after refusing to self-isolate. A further 10 people will be prosecuted for entering a restricted area at an east coast campground. An ACT Policing spokesperson said its response to the coronavirus has not moved past stage one. That means unlike other parts of Australia before police move to warnings and fines, their focus remains on educating people about the new rules. They’re also only carrying out spot checks when requested by ACT Health. The Territory Targeting Team is also assisting agencies, including Access Canberra, to conduct business compliance checks. On April 1, police arrested a 48-year-old man who attempted to cough and spit on officers, claiming he had SARS\/COVID-19. Those completing their 14-day quarantine are being checked regularly by NT Police. More than 1800 compliance checks have been completed as of Sunday, with help from Public and Environmental Health officers and Australian Defence Force personnel. So far, just four fines have been issued. The most recent one was on Saturday. When police knocked on the door of a 45-year-old woman at Alawa, she was found to be hosting a social gathering at her premises involving 14 people, 10 of whom did not reside there. One of the residents was in self-quarantine inside the property after returning from interstate. A 35-year-old man who was meant to self-isolate at a Perth hotel tried to escape his room and even got on public transport to travel within the metropolitan area. Authorities are using drones fitted with flashing lights and sirens, similar to that of a police vehicle, and capable of broadcasting a message to a range of up to one kilometre. People breaking social distancing guidelines can be receive an on-the-spot fine of $1000 for individuals and $5000 for businesses. People arriving in WA who are caught breaching a directive to self-isolate for two weeks face a fine of up to $50,000. On Saturday night police swarmed a large car rally south of Brisbane, where about 150 vehicles were pulled up in a warehouse car park. Police issued 58 coronavirus infringements, each worth $1334, totalling $77,372. Police are also going door to door to check on “random residences for compliance unless an issue has been identified or complaints need follow up action”, Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said at a press conference. Officers can also issue on-the-spot fines of $1334.50 for individuals and $6672.50 for corporations that fail to abide by the health directions. Police are currently not authorised to enforce lockdown rules, but they are strongly advising that everyone adheres to the two-person rule. “When the Prime Minister makes recommendations to the states about restriction guidelines relating to COVID-19, each state must then consider how those recommendations will be applied,” the SA government website says. “They are not enforceable in South Australia until the state co-ordinator, Commissioner Grant Stevens, enacts a direction.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus shutdown talk is puzzling for Australians who live alone","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/07\/coronavirus-scott-morrison-puzzle-single-life\/","transcript":"I don’t consider myself a lonely person. I enjoy my own company, embrace the perks of living alone and rarely feel deprived by being single. But in the age of coronavirus, I’m struggling. There was a moment last week where it hit me: I might not touch another human for six months. Maybe even longer. The realisation gave way to a profound sadness – a yearning that I felt deep into my bones. The psychologists call this skin hunger. Emotionally, we don’t do well with prolonged periods of physical isolation. We have a primal need for connection. Touch reduces stress and releases oxytocin, the feel-good ‘cuddle chemical’. At this time of social distancing, everyone is feeling the loss of closeness to people they care about. But for many who live alone, that loss is being felt more acutely. Friends for Good, a Melbourne service tackling loneliness, has had a 200 per cent jump in calls to its helpline in recent weeks. The rules in Victoria, where I live, state that for those living alone, we can only spend time with one friend if outdoors exercising and staying 1.5 metres apart. I fully accept the need for these measures, but it’s a tough situation. And it’s made tougher by the public messaging on how we should weather this storm. At a recent press conference, the Prime Minister urged us to “keep your family close and together”.  Catching up with friends on a Friday night. Life is changing, but we can still stay connected. Thanks Australia, for everything you’re doing. Posted by Scott Morrison (ScoMo) on Friday, March 27, 2020 Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy told Australians not to travel this Easter but “stay home with your family”. These messages are well-meaning but completely erase the 2.3 million Australians who are living alone. We’re not all hunkering down at home with family, doing jigsaw puzzles around the fireplace like a scene from a Hallmark Christmas card. The assumption that we are only heightens the sense of isolation. \"Our kids are at home now, as are most kids, and Jenny went out yesterday and bought them a whole bunch of jigsaw puzzles.\" Scott Morrison gives jigsaw puzzles as an example of essential items to get households through the next six months. #auspol #covid19aus #qldpol pic.twitter.com\/ZKU1oEfQb8 — David Marler (@Qldaah) March 29, 2020 I know that in these unsettling times, nobody has it easy. Constantly being around other people in close confinement – even if you love them – brings its own challenges. I also know how lucky I am to have a job, my health, a safe place to call home, and a network of friends and family who I connect with daily. Still, even as someone comfortable with time alone, I’ve been knocked by how hard this physical separation has been after just a few weeks. On Zoom calls and FaceTime catch-ups I’ve winced watching workmates hug their kids, friends sharing space with housemates, or couples snuggling up together on the couch. At a time of high anxiety all I want is the reassurance of a hug. Or just the simple comfort of spending time in the same room as another human. I’ll be OK. I’m adapting to this new normal, learning new ways to self-soothe, and reminding myself that this isolation is temporary. But I worry about those who are crippled by loneliness and don’t know how to reach out for support. So please check in with the people in your social circles or in your neighbourhood who live alone. Particularly the elderly, but also younger people – even those who ordinarily seem pretty self-reliant. Make that call. Send that text. Drop off some food or flowers or a handwritten note to say you care. At a time when so much is outside of our control, looking after each other is the one thing we can do. It sends a powerful message to anyone doing it tough that while you may be living on your own, you are not alone.

Whichever way the High Court falls on George Pell’s criminal conviction for sexual abuse, the debate that rolls around the disgraced Catholic cardinal will continue. The 78-year-old has steadfastly maintained his innocence since being convicted in 2018 and subsequently jailed for six years for raping a 13-year-old choirboy and sexually molesting another at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral in 1996. But throughout that trial and the appeal process, crowds of sexual abuse victims and supporters of Pell have turned up outside the hearings to make their feelings known. It’s unlikely to be different outside the High Court on Tuesday, with the judgment sure to ignite further discussion around the Catholic Church’s response to child abuse within its ranks, and Pell’s role in the Australian church. Just last week the ABC detailed further allegations in its Revelation program, prompting more anger and concern about how child abuse survivors have been treated by the church. Pell is the most senior Catholic in the world to be convicted of child sex abuse, but until his appeals are exhausted he still remains a member of the College of Cardinals. Last August Victoria’s Court of Appeal – in a 2-1 majority decision – found there was enough evidence for the jury to find Pell guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Now it’s the High Court turn to deliver its verdict, with numerous possibilities open to the seven justices, with a 4-3 majority needed. The justices last month spent two days grilling Pell’s specialist appeals barrister Bret Walker SC and Victoria’s Director of Public Prosecutions Kerri Judd QC. The appeal bid is based on two grounds – firstly that Chief Justice Anne Ferguson and President Chris Maxwell made an error in requiring Pell to prove the offending was “impossible” in order to raise reasonable doubt. Secondly, his lawyers have argued the judges erred in concluding the guilty verdicts were not unreasonable, because of findings there was reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The possible results include the following: The High Court has to grant Pell special leave to appeal before they can formally consider the appeal. Usually this happens before the appeal hearing, but in Pell’s case it was decided it would hear the appeal arguments before making a decision on granting special leave. If special leave is refused, Pell’s conviction will stand and he will remain behind bars. If the High Court determines there is a legal question for it to consider, then it will grant special leave. After that, there’s a few paths it can follow. After considering the two days of arguments and written submissions, the High Court justices could determine there was no error in the Court of Appeal’s majority decision to uphold Pell’s conviction. Alternatively, they might find there was an error but not one that affected the ultimate decision. If either are the case, the appeal will be refused and Pell’s convictions will be upheld. He will remain in prison. Because Pell was convicted of charges relating to two separate incidents, it’s possible the High Court could grant the appeal in relation to one incident but refuse it in relation to the other. For example, the justices might find there wasn’t sufficient evidence for a jury to reach a guilty verdict in relation to the second incident, but there was in relation to the first. That could see Pell’s conviction quashed on some charges but not others, meaning he would have to be re-sentenced. Another potential outcome is that the High Court determines there was an error in the Court of Appeal’s decision, but it was not one that immediately requires Pell’s conviction to be overturned. It could be ordered that the original appeal be reconsidered, either by the High Court or the Court of Appeal. If the High Court determines there was an error in the Court of Appeal’s majority decision, it might find that the error was so significant that Pell’s convictions should be quashed and he be acquitted. This would result in his immediate release from prison. This is what his defence wants, with Pell’s barrister arguing for this last option. “We’re not here to prove anything … except to show, to demonstrate, that there was unexplored possibilities that meant it was not open to the jury to convict,” Mr Walker told the High Court last month. The trial focused on five or six minutes after Sunday Mass in December 1996, when Pell caught the boys sneaking wine from the priest’s sacristy. The jury found he molested the two boys then and, some time later, pushed the first boy against a corridor and molested him again. Mr Walker said the complainant’s evidence couldn’t stand if that of sacristan Max Potter and Monsignor Charles Portelli – which included that Pell was never alone after Mass – was accepted. Ms Judd said the appeal should not be granted, or, if there was a mistake made by the Court of Appeal, that appeal should be heard again. She urged the judges to consider the evidence as a whole, pointing to evidence that practices weren’t always followed. “Quite a number of choirboys and others do say there were occasions when … he did not stand on the steps but he actually (joined the procession). The choirboys recall having to wait for him to go through,” Ms Judd said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Great Barrier Reef shark attack victim dies in hospital","date":"04-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/07\/great-barrier-reef-shark-attack-death\/","transcript":"A man has died after being bitten by a shark in waters off the Great Barrier Reef.

There is no will in the Parliament to stand in the way of the government’s unprecedented JobKeeper program. On the weekend Mr Porter waxed lyrical when he said “we are pushing a $130 billion lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever seen”. Despite real concerns from the unions and the Opposition that the package leaves one million casuals either neglected or shortchanged, Labor’s Tony Burke says there is nothing he can imagine that would see the party voting against the wage subsidy. The perfect will not be allowed to be the enemy of the good, despite the good potentially laying the foundations for a WorkChoices-style erosion of workers rights once Scott Morrison’s foreshadowed “snap back” occurs after the crisis. Fuelling these fears is the belief that hostility to the unions and organised labour is in the Coalition’s DNA. This is the real reason for the hesitation about using the “sledgehammer” of blanket legislation varying all awards, enterprise agreements and work contracts, rather than the Fair Work Commission doing it on a case-by-case basis. Mr Porter thinks this is time-wasting madness, which would see many of the six million workers losing the promised income support for weeks or months. Besides, he says the legislation will have a six-month sunset clause. Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus is urging Labor, the Greens and the crossbench to oppose changes to the Fair Work Act because she says they are not necessary. Ms McManus, who has been in line-by-line discussions with Mr Porter, is also not buying into the Prime Minister’s characterisation of Team Australia; she certainly doesn’t agree with “no unions and no bosses”. She told David Speers on Insiders “I wouldn’t say that there are no unions and I can assure the working people in Australia that the trade union movement is here and working in their corner”. The latest Newspoll found overwhelming public support for the JobKeeper package with its $1500-a-fortnight payment for workers who otherwise would have received nothing because their businesses were unviable. Mr Morrison has an approval rating not seen for a prime minister since Kevin Rudd at the height of the Global Financial Crisis. For a leader who just three months ago during the bushfires saw his support collapse to near record lows, this is very heartening news. Although it could be tempered by the fact that within two years Mr Rudd’s party dumped him. The durability of Mr Morrison’s new-found approval will be just how long Australians are prepared to co-operate with the draconian social distancing and isolation measures that have shut down the way in which a healthy society  and economy operate. For now the consensus is the deadly COVID-19 virus leaves no choice for anybody. Some of the government’s media cheer squad see Mr Morrison’s stunning pivot to the left, plunging the budget into multibillion-dollar deficit, as evidence of a superior political mind stranding Labor. This is too glib and underestimates the real gravity of the situation. It also ignores the fact that by coming on to Labor’s traditional turf, the Liberal Prime Minister has given credibility to “big government” and “big spending”. By the same token Ms McManus has the not-too-distant past to prompt her wariness of a Coalition government stripping wages and conditions in the name of saving jobs.

Jubelin, 57, was one of the state’s most experienced investigators until he was charged last June, resigning after a career spanning over three decades. He was accused of breaching the Surveillance Devices Act by illegally recording four conversations with Paul Savage during the Tyrrell investigation, between November 2017 and December 2018. Police said the recordings were unlawful because they were made on Jubelin’s mobile phone and a colleague’s, outside the scope of warrants for Mr Savage’s home, car and phone to be bugged. Magistrate Ross Hudson today found the former detective guilty of all four counts and slammed Jubelin for pursuing Mr Savage “at all costs”. “This was above and beyond legality,” he said. Magistrate Hudson said Jubelin belittled and humiliated Mr Savage in lengthy interviews, with a repetition that “may be seen as offensive”, despite there being no evidence to confirm his involvement. “There’s no DNA, there’s no fingerprints, there’s nobody who says ‘I saw him go into the backyard’, there’s no leads, there’s nothing,” the magistrate said. “He’s picked Mr Savage. He’s pursuing him at this stage … at all costs.” Jubelin always denied wrongdoing, insisting he had “a lawful right and an operational need” to record the material. But Magistrate Hudson said Jubelin came across in court as “a person playing a role, telling a story”, his evidence “self-evidently partisan” and his answers at times “lengthy and self-serving”. Jubelin made no reaction when he learned of the decision in the Downing Centre Local Court. The case provided an extraordinary insight into the investigative techniques used to gather information about William’s September 2014 disappearance. The three-year-old was last seen playing in his grandmother’s backyard at Kendall, on the Mid North Coast, wearing a Spider-man costume. Mr Savage, a neighbour, came into the crosshairs of detectives in 2017 because he did not have a solid alibi. Authorities said his behaviour was “irrational” and he’d previously stalked a post office employee. In July 2017, police planted a Spider-man suit on a bush track where Mr Savage was known to walk and an undercover officer hid in the bushes to film his reaction. At another point in the investigation, an undercover officer unsuccessfully attempted to pose as a clairvoyant to exploit the sensitive topic of Mr Savage’s late wife. The case also exposed disharmony within the strike force and Magistrate Hudson concluded there were tensions over who should and shouldn’t have been a target. During his evidence, Jubelin claimed his senior colleague, Detective Superintendence Scott Cook, once said “no-one cares about that little kid” and told him to “get him off the books”. Scott Cook, who was promoted to the rank of Assistant Commissioner in December, denied making the comments. Mr Savage has denied any involvement in William’s disappearance and has never been charged."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Authorities single out coronavirus hotspots for increased testing","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/06\/coronavirus-worst-areas-australia\/","transcript":"NSW Health will step up coronavirus testing in some of Sydney’s wealthiest suburbs and other areas across the state after evidence of local transmission of the deadly virus. NSW’s coronavirus hotspots include the local government zones of Waverley, which takes in Bondi in the city’s east, and neighbouring Woollahra, which is home to some of Sydney’s ritziest suburbs. Other areas of concern include Manly in the city’s north, Dee Why and Ryde. Outside of Sydney, they include Lake Macquarie and Port Macquarie, Nowra and South Nowra and Broken Hill. NSW Health executive director Dr Jeremy McAnulty said coronavirus testing had dropped off at the weekend, but it would be increased again in communities with evidence of local transmission. “We want to encourage increased testing in those communities where we have seen even a few local cases of transmission,” he said. “We are extending testing and encouraging patients who have got symptoms…of acute respiratory infection, a cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or fever,” he said. NSW had 2637 confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday, and the state’s death toll rose to 18 after men aged 85 and 86 died in Liverpool Hospital on Sunday. The latest figures include 595 infections locally acquired from known cases, while 397 were locally acquired from unknown contacts. NSW Health said on Monday the state had recorded 57 new cases. That was a drop on Sunday’s growth – partly due to fewer tests at the weekend. There are 40 people in intensive care units, 22 of them on ventilators. Dr McAnulty said case numbers in recent days had been “really hopeful” and it seemed contract tracing and social distancing measures were working. “But it’s too early to make too many assumptions; we need to keep a very close eye on these figures,” he said. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian welcomed the fall in new cases but said those acquired through community transmission remained a concern. Elsewhere, Western Australia’s toll rose by one, with the death of a man in his 80s at Royal Perth Hospital. Victoria’s coronavirus fatalities rose by two on Monday – a man in his 50s died at home and a woman in her 80s died in hospital. The state had 1158 confirmed cases on Monday, up 23 from Sunday. Victoria has 88 confirmed cases of COVID-19 acquired through community transmission and the state has carried out more than 57,000 tests. There are 45 coronavirus patients in hospital in Victoria, including 11 in intensive care. The state has expanded its criteria for virus testing as the number of community-transmitted case has risen. “The number of community acquired cases contracted from an unknown source are continuing to rise – the expansion of the testing criteria will allow us to get a clearer picture of how much the virus is circulating,’ chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); Victoria’s coronavirus cases are also concentrated in wealthier areas. Stonnington, which covers Toorak and South Yarra, has the most. Banyule, in Melbourne’s north-east, is next, and then Boroondara, in the city’s inner-east. Queensland’s cases are concentrated in Brisbane, on the Gold and Sunshine coasts and in Cairns. Another 14 cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the state on Monday, taking its total tally to 921. Queensland has also broadened testing criteria after 32 cases where authorities could not determine where the virus was acquired. “I think this is pre-emptive, ahead of local transmission, so I don’t see there’ll be a big increase in numbers,” Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said said. “Once we do see increased community transmission outside those areas – Gold Coast, Brisbane and Cairns – we’ll increase the testing there as well.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Famous beaches close as hundreds of rule-breakers hit with hefty fines","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/06\/beaches-fines-coronavirus-gold-coast\/","transcript":"Three of Australia’s most famous beaches will close after crowds flocked to popular surf breaks over the weekend, breaching social distancing laws and risking the spread of COVID-19. Hundreds of people across the country continue to breach new laws and border control measures announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison ordering them to stay home unless it’s essential, and to gather in groups of no greater than two. Among those, Victorian learner driver, Hunter Reynolds, 17, was fined $1652 by police while learning to drive “too far from home” and 58 people at a Queensland car rally were fined $1334 each for also failing to comply with COVID-19 directions. Hunter’s mother Sharee told Melbourne radio station 3AW they were travelling about 30 kilometres from their Hampton home to Frankston. “We didn’t think for one minute that we would be doing anything wrong,” she said. “We weren’t in contact with any person, we weren’t stopping anywhere, we weren’t planning on visiting any destinations, we were just learning to drive in those conditions. “She (the officer) said we were too far from home and we would cop a fine, and that Hunter would be the person to receive that fine.” The officer told them they’d been “smashing it on the roads today”. A Victoria Police spokesperson told The New Daily on Monday a total of 307 people had so far been fined since the new restrictions were introduced on March 30. A NSW police spokesperson said that since March 17, police have issued 98 PINs (Penalty Infringement Notices) and 8 Court Attendance Notices (CANs) for breaches of the Public Health Act NSW (2010). In one of the many incidents documented, officers from South Coast Police District were conducting patrols of the North Nowra area on Sunday morning about 2am when they found a car parked in bushland. “As police approached, four women were sighted in the vehicle, including three who were lying down in the backseat. The women told police they had been at a party but had been asked to leave. They were each issued with a $1000 PIN,” a NSW police statement read. In Queensland, police confirmed 139 infringement notices had been issued to people breaking the new laws. Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate said on Monday that “unfortunately out-of-towners” had travelled down from Brisbane and Logan to the Gold Coast’s iconic beaches at Surfers Paradise, The Spit and Coolangatta at the weekend. He said the beaches would close from midnight on Tuesday – ahead of an expected influx for the long Easter weekend. More would follow if people continued to ignore advice from health authorities. “The curve is flattening. This is not the time to relax, it’s time to kill it off,” Councillor Tate said. The mayor said closing the beaches was a reluctant decision, designed to protect the community. While “Gold Coast beaches are quintessential Gold Coast”, authorities had to consider the overall situation. “For us to win this fight against COVID-19, we are in it together. And if the minority of people are absolutely congregating and spreading it, I know, governing for the majority but in this case, the health issue is a No.1 priority,” he said. Car parks will be barricaded off to stop beach access, and council officers will monitor illegal parking. The closed beaches will also be patrolled by authorities. “We love you but we don’t want you visiting now. The beaches are open for our locals so they can walk and continue to exercise. We will be working through the finer details to have parking officers redeployed to monitor illegal parking,” Cr Tate said. “I didn’t want to do this but over the weekend, shows me, especially people visiting from Brisbane are not listening to us.” He said anecdotal information was that when drivers were pulled over by police, many said they were going to the beach. “It’s not essential travel,” Counciller Tate said. “Out-of-towners are congregating and not respecting what we Gold Coasters are doing … really sending the message out to Brisbane and Logan that the Premier says stay in your suburb. And Brisbane is not part of your suburb.” Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll told reporters on Monday afternoon 139 infringement notices have been issued in less than a week to people breaking the law. She said people had been pinged for non-essential travel, breaking quarantine, and a lack of social distancing in parks. “Disappointingly, even though we’ve given a lot of messaging around this, people are still blatantly disregarding the rules,” she said. Queensland Police have intercepted 23,000 vehicles since last Friday, and turned away 532 vehicles. Councillor Tate said if the barricades and council restrictions didn’t deter beachgoers, he said, they risked parking fines and “the laws will keep escalating”. Meanwhile, Victoria police have fined another 108 people in the past 24 hours for breaching the state’s COVID-19 self-isolation rules. Officers have done 983 spot checks in the past two days and more than 14,000 since March 21. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Porter dashes hopes of extending JobKeeper subsidy to more casuals","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/work\/2020\/04\/06\/jobkeeper-payment-12-months\/","transcript":"Hopes more casuals could secure the $1500 JobKeeper allowance have been dashed just 24 hours after Attorney-General Christian Porter pledged he was “listening” to unions. On Sunday, Mr Porter said he was considering ACTU secretary Sally McManus’ calls for more workers who do not meet the 12 months continuous service rule to secure the payment. But on Monday morning, Mr Porter said that hard limit – that workers must have worked for an employer for a year to qualify – will remain. “There has to be a line drawn,” he said. “You have to have some kind of guiding limits on the outer edges, even of a scheme that represents expenditure of this extraordinary amount. “We will require regular and systemic attachment to an employer for 12 months.” Winners and losers are set to emerge from the JobKeeper wage subsidy that will pay all eligible employees a flat rate of $1500 a fortnight, regardless of whether they are casual, part-time or full-time. It is designed  to help companies “hibernate” during the COVID-19 crisis. The winners include casuals and part-timers who have worked for companies for 12 months or longer who are currently paid less than the JobKeeper payment. The design of the subsidy means that some casuals who previously earned just a couple of hundred dollars a week working in a supermarket will get a huge pay boost to $750 a week. But casuals with less than 12 months in continuous service will miss out. On Sunday, Mr Porter had said he was open to changes. “We’re working on that and listening and so, when you see the final draft, you will see we are trying to be as inclusive and reasonable as possible,” he said. But he urged Labor and the unions not to delay the JobKeeper wage subsidy. “This change will be happening next Wednesday. No matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday,” Mr Porter said. “Six million Australian jobs depend on it. “Next Wednesday we are pushing a $130 billion lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever seen. “People will need to decide whether or not they’re going to help us push that boat out, but it is going out on Wednesday.” Mr Porter has rejected calls to suspend award rates during the coronavirus crisis. He has flagged that flexibility will be required around agreed hours under industrial relations laws, for example in circumstances where workers have been stood down and are not working. Workers who earn more than $1500 a fortnight and are stood down because of mandated COVID-19 closures, could have their salary slashed – legally – while the business goes into “hibernation”. Employers will also have the option to “top up” the subsidy for workers who earn more than $1500 a fortnight. This will apply to companies that qualify for the wage subsidy but continue to trade as normal. “I think there’s agreement among all people who have knowledge and experience in industrial relations and employment relations in Australia that for the system to work you have to make changes to the way in which the employment relations and industrial relations system in Australia presently operates,” Mr Porter said “Those changes would be time-bound. They would only last for as long as the payment system lasted.” Labor accused Mr Porter of falsely claiming it did not support the JobKeeper allowance as a distraction for the backflip on casuals. “Porter’s claims that Labor is opposed to the JobKeeper package is unhinged. We called for it for weeks while government ruled it out,” Labor’s industrial relations spokesman Tony Burke said. “He’s now claiming we will vote against amendments that haven’t even been drafted yet. It’s hysterical, stupid, nonsense.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Rural Fire Service boss to head new NSW crisis agency","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/04\/06\/shane-fitzsimmons-resilience-nsw\/","transcript":"Celebrated NSW Rural Fire Services boss Shane Fitzsimmons is taking on a new role, heading up an agency aimed at ensuring the state’s resilience amid major challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Fitzsimmons said he would take up the job after making the “absolutely difficult and deeply personal” decision to quit the RFS. Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the establishment of Resilience NSW on Monday, saying it would ensure the state was prepared and able to respond to crises – “be it COVID, be it cyber security, be it a whole range of things we may not foreshadow”. She said Mr Fitzsimmons – “one of the true heroes of NSW” – had decided to retire from his RFS position and would become the agency’s commissioner in about a month. “Who would have thought that in 2020, NSW would be facing a pandemic?” Ms Berejiklian said. “We don’t know the challenges of the future but what I do know is that NSW, through Resilience NSW, will be able to focus on preparing and recovering from anything that comes our way.” Mr Fitzsimmons, 51, has been widely praised for his leadership during the horror bushfire season that has just ended. He said the decision to step down as commissioner and move on to a new role was “absolutely difficult and deeply personal, but it’s the right one”. “It’s been a privilege and an absolute honour to have served in this organisation alongside so many tens of thousands of wonderful individuals, and in particular a privilege to lead the organisation as commissioner for over a decade,” Mr Fitzsimmons said on Monday. “I’ve seen very much this past season – the worst that mother nature can deliver, but I also saw the very best in our people.” Mr Fitzsimmons said drought-stricken communities had been “belted by bushfires” only for the extraordinary COVID-19 impact to compound the situation further. “I very much care about and am concerned for the people of NSW … and there is no doubt in my mind that I take on this new role with a deal of trepidation of course,” he said. “But I’m very open to the idea of continuing to make a meaningful difference in the lives and livelihoods of people, of communities, to help with business, to help with industry, and to help rebuild our economy.” He added that Resilience NSW would lead a whole-of-government prevention, preparedness and recovery effort, and oversee emergency management policy, service delivery and all aspects of disaster recovery. Mr Fitzsimmons joined the RFS in 1985 and was appointed commissioner in 2008. Emergency Services Minister David Elliott thanked him on Monday for his service. “I don’t think there’s a single person who would disagree that Commissioner Fitzsimmons’ leadership was a beacon of hope during our State’s darkest hour,” Mr Elliott said. He said Rob Rogers would take over the role of NSW RFS commissioner, after 40 years as a member and nine years as deputy commissioner. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Experts develop immunity test for COVID-19 | The New Daily","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/06\/experts-develop-immunity-test-covid-19\/","transcript":"Australian scientists have made a test to check who is likely to develop coronavirus. Researchers at Monash University and Alfred Health have developed a rapid test to determine a person’s immunity to COVID-19. The test will indicate who remains infectious and the severity of COVID-19 if a person was to get it. Cell samples will begin arriving from the three coronavirus hotspots – Italy, China and New York – as well as sufferers from Melbourne, from next week. The test will also look for differences in the blood of patients with a mild disease compared to those with a severe infection to find biomarkers to predict who needs early medical treatment. Experts repurposed influenza and allergy testing technology to create the rapid test, which will involve a blood test. “This and other tests like it will provide us with a more nuanced approach to managing the disease,” lead researcher Associate Professor Menno van Zelm, from Monash University’s Central Clinical School, said on Monday. The test, similar to that for influenza, looks at memory B lymphocytes which are immune system cells that make antibodies to fight pathogens such as viruses. The cells remember the same pathogens for a faster fight in the future, and are formed after vaccination. If there is evidence of a large population of the cells specific to a pathogen, it is likely a person has been infected in the past. The test is expected to be ready in the coming months. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Israel Folau's payout at risk as Rugby Australia buckles under virus fallout","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/06\/israel-folau-rugby-payout\/","transcript":"Axed Wallaby Israel Folau’s multimillion-dollar payout from Rugby Australia could reportedly take a major hit if the sport’s governing body is forced into insolvency. The former fullback ace was sacked by RA last year after a string of homophobic social media posts, including one stating hell awaits homosexuals. The two parties agreed to an out-of-court settlement in December after the Folau sued RA for religious discrimination. While the terms weren’t made public, it’s understood to be about $3 million, which is the value of the remainder of his four-year contract. Rugby Australia has taken a massive financial hit with all play stopped during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, it stood down 75 per cent of its non-player workforce and announced a $9.4 million loss. The organisation spent much of the weekend in talks with the players’ association, seeking cuts to player remuneration. No deal has yet been reached. Elsewhere, some of the game’s high-profile figures have called for chief executive Raelene Castle to be sacked. At the weekend, World Cup-winning captain Nick Farr-Jones declared Rugby Australia “unbankable” and said it was probably time the entire board stepped down. Farr-Jones believes the coronavirus pandemic has merely brought RA’s dire financial woes to a head and said the governing body only had itself to blame. “I think the rugby community has lost confidence in the senior executives and the board of Rugby Australia. There’s no doubt about that,” he said. According to The Australian, Folau’s settlement is being paid off in instalments – which are at risk should RA go under. Should RA be forced to declare itself insolvent, the former Wallaby would become an unsecured creditor. Depending on the organisation’s assets, he’d likely be paid out only a few cents in the dollar. Folau has been playing rugby league with French club Catalans Dragons in the Super League, although competition is suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. He is reportedly expecting his first child later this year with former netball star wife, Maria. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Our Pearl Harbour moment': Americans told to brace for 'hardest week'","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/06\/us-hardest-week-coronavirus\/","transcript":"US Surgeon-General Jerome Adams has told Americans to brace themselves for “the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives” because of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as the US begins one of its most critical weeks yet in the escalating coronavirus crisis with the death toll exploding in New York, Michigan and Louisiana. New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that it had nearly 600 new deaths, for a total of 4159 deaths and 122,000 total cases. Bodies of victims of COVID-19, the flu-like respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, were stacked in bright orange bags inside a makeshift morgue outside the Wyckoff Heights Medical Centre in Brooklyn, according to photos provided to Reuters. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said new hospitalisations had fallen by 50 per cent and, for the first time in at least a week, deaths had fallen slightly from the prior day, when they rose by 630. But he cautioned that it was not yet clear whether the crisis in the state was reaching a plateau. “The coronavirus is truly vicious and effective at what the virus does,” Mr Cuomo said. “It’s an effective killer.” US Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned on Fox News on Sunday that hard times were ahead but “there is a light at the end of the tunnel if everyone does their part for the next 30 days”. “This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly. This is going to be our Pearl Harbour moment, our 9\/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localised,” he said. “It’s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.” Elsewhere in the US, places such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Washington, DC, are starting to record rising deaths. The White House coronavirus task force has told Americans it is not the time to go to supermarkets or other public places. Some governors have called for a national order to stay at home, while most states have imposed their own orders on residents to try to slow the spread of the virus in the United States. Dr Adams called on state governors who had not yet imposed such orders to do so, even if they were comparatively shorter. “If you can’t give us a month, give us what you can. Give us a week. Give us whatever you can to stay at home during this particularly tough time when we’re going to be hitting our peak over the next seven to 10 days,” he said. “There is a light at the end of the tunnel if everyone does their part for the next 30 days.” More than 321,000 people in the US had tested positive for the coronavirus and more than 9100 had died by early Monday (Australian time), according to a Reuters tally. However, a few churches held large gatherings on Palm Sunday, the beginning of Holy Week in Christian churches. “We’re defying the rules because the commandment of God is to spread the gospel,” said Tony Spell, pastor at the Life Tabernacle megachurch in a suburb of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He has defied state orders against assembling in large groups and has already been hit with six misdemeanours. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Ill-fated cruise ship controversially docks in Wollongong as national death toll rises to 40 | The New Daily","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/06\/coronavirus-deaths-ruby-princess\/","transcript":"The ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship, now the focus of a NSW homicide investigation, has docked in Wollongong after sailing off Sydney for more than two weeks. The ship, with 1040 crew from 50 countries on board, docked at Port Kembla, south of Sydney on Monday morning, raising concerns the Illawarra region would not be able to cope with a medical emergency if crew members needed hospitalisation. More than 200 of those on board have reported coronavirus symptoms. NSW shadow health minister, Ryan Park, told the ABC the health infrastructure in the Illawarra region didn’t have the resources or staff to cope. “We simply don’t have the capacity in terms of ICU beds or resources at our local hospitals. Why would anyone think it’s smart to move a cruise ship with hundreds of people sick, away from where the major hospitals are in Sydney? It’s appalling and it’s all about out of sight, out of mind for this government,” he said after the ship docked. And a member of the South Coast Labour Council told the ABC on Monday afternoon the crew were told not to speak to the media: “It seems to be a feature of this operation, it is covert and secretive and no-one is talking to anyone else”. He said the pilots on the tug boats were given eight hours’ notice the ship was to dock at Port Kembla: “There are people working closely together, why on this occasion who made the decision to send the ship from Sydney did not speak to to front line workers and their representatives is a mystery”. Also on Monday, it was revealed that five more people have died from the coronavirus in NSW, Victoria and Western Australia, taking the national death toll to 40. The toll in NSW rose to 18 after the deaths of two men aged 85 and 86 on Sunday. In Victoria, a man in his 50s died in hospital and a woman in her 80s died at home from COVID-19 on Sunday. The state has 1158 confirmed cases, an increase of 23 from Sunday. It is not yet known whether the latest casualties were passengers from the ship. And in WA, a man in his 80s who was a passenger on board the Ruby Princess, died at Royal Perth Hospital. There were seven new cases of COVID-19 confirmed in WA on Monday, taking the state’s total to 460. ABC reporter Jesse Dorsett was at Port Kembla on Monday and was able to speak to a few of the Ruby Princess crew from their balconies. “A few of the crew came out onto their balconies and were giving us a wave. I shouted out ‘are you guys all OK?’. They gave us a thumbs-up but said some people are still sick,” he said. “We haven’t been able to speak to them until now and they passed about 50 metres and all the crew came out. “I shouted out, ‘How are you all?’, and a few replied ‘we’re good’. “And I said: ‘Are many sick?’. And they said: ‘Yes there is’. “That was what we said in the short time. There was a tug boat and police boat following the cruise ship. That is still following, a police helicopter is above.” Attorney-General Christian Porter has backed the NSW Police investigation announced by Police Commissioner Mick Fuller on Sunday. It will examine the circumstances surrounding the docking and disembarkation of passengers from the ship in Sydney on March 18. “There’s a whole range of offences, including civil fraud, that may have been possibly committed and that’s what the investigation is about,” he told ABC Radio. “If those offences can be substantiated by evidence then they would be very, very serious indeed.” The NSW Police homicide squad investigation aims to identify how passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship in Sydney when there were suspected COVID-19 patients on board. “The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation,” Mr Fuller said. The investigation will examine the actions of the port authority, ambulance, police, the NSW Health department and Carnival Australia. So far 11 passengers on board Ruby Princess have died while another 622 tested positive to COVID-19. The stricken ship will spend up to 10 days in port to allow medical teams safer access to sick crew members. NSW has confirmed 2637 cases of the deadly coronavirus. NSW Health said on Monday the state had 57 new cases, a drop on rise from Sunday. According to the latest federal health department figures, last updated at 3pm on Sunday (AST), there have been 5687 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia, including 139 new cases overnight. Aspen Medical executive chairman Glenn Keys said the Ruby Princess crew did not need to leave the ship for treatment. “In our view, they can be treated on board,” he told ABC Radio. “The ship’s been good in spreading the crew out to make sure there is enough room. They’ve got fresh air and the treatment they need.” Ruby Princess owner Carnival Australia said the company was assisting the police investigation. “In addition to willingly participating in the investigation, Carnival Australia will vigorously respond to any allegations of which there must now be full disclosure and the basis for them,” a spokesman said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Tiger at New York zoo confirmed to have coronavirus","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/06\/tiger-new-york-zoo-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus, in what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the US or a tiger anywhere. The four-year-old female Malayan tiger, and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill, are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee, the US Department of Agriculture said. The first animal started showing symptoms March 27. All are expected to recover, said the zoo, which has been closed to the public since March 16. “We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution” and aim to “contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,” zoo chief veterinarian Dr Paul Calle said. Officials said no other animals in the zoo had coronavirus symptoms. The finding raises new questions about transmission of the deadly coronavirus in animals. The USDA said there were no known cases of the virus in US pets or livestock. “It’s important to assure pet owners and animal owners that at this time there isn’t any evidence that they can spread the virus,” said Dr Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and a USDA official. The coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say. In a statement, the USDA said “there is no evidence that animals play a role in the transmission of COVID-19 to people”, except for the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. There have been reports of a handful of pets outside the US becoming infected after close contact with contagious people. Among them is a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. In March, Adjunct Professor Graham Burgess from the College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences at JCU told the ABC any mammal was a potential carrier of the coronavirus. Professor Burgess said all common domesticated animals, including bovines and dogs, had adapted coronaviruses in the past 2000 years. Coronaviruses in dogs and cats were found to be made up of combined genetic material from other coronaviruses, he said. Some researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to COVID-19, and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus holiday home rules: Health leader breaks own rule","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/06\/coronavirus-holiday-home-scotland\/","transcript":"Scotland’s chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood has quit after it was revealed she broke her own advice on coronavirus social distancing, spending two weekends at her holiday home. In a statement on Sunday night (local time), more than seven hours after insisting she would carry on despite being warned by police over the travel to her second home, Dr Calderwood said she had again discussed the controversy with Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and concluded her position was untenable. Photographs of Dr Calderwood visiting her holiday home in Earlsferry, on the east coast of Scotland – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Edinburgh – last Friday night were published in the Scottish Sun. Her husband and three children were with her. On Sunday, Dr Calderwood also revealed that – despite being the voice of the Scottish government’s public information campaign urging people to avoid all non-essential travel – she and her husband had also visited Earlsferry the previous weekend. The United Kingdom is in a police-enforced lockdown to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Under the rules, Britons must stay at home unless for one of a few “very limited purposes” such as getting food or medical attention or going to work. Public gatherings of more than two people are also banned and non-essential shops have been closed. “I did not follow the advice I’m giving to others, I’m truly sorry for that,” Dr Calderwood said in Edinburgh on Sunday. “People across Scotland know what they need to do to reduce the spread of this virus and that means they must have complete trust in those who give them advice. It is with a heavy heart that I resign as chief medical officer.” Earlier, Dr Calderwood said she had seen comments calling her a hypocrite and saying she was irresponsible. “What I did was wrong. I’m very sorry,” she said. “I know how important the advice is I have issued. I do not want my mistake to distract for that.” She also apologised to police and National Health Service colleagues. Police Scotland said officers had spoken to Dr Calderwood about her actions and had warned her about her future conduct. “The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone,” Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said. “Individuals must not make personal exemptions bespoke to their own circumstances. It is vital everyone adheres to these requirements.” Ms Sturgeon had initially asked Dr Calderwood only to step back as a public face of the coronavirus battle. Later, she said she agreed the controversy was damaging the government’s message. “It is clear that the mistake she made – even though she has apologised sincerely and honourably for it – risks distracting from and undermining confidence in the government’s public health message at this crucial time,” Ms Sturgeon said. “That is not a risk either of us is willing to take.” Scotland has had 3345 coronavirus cases and the death toll stands at 218. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"UK PM Boris Johnson admitted to hospital for tests","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/06\/boris-johnson-hospital-coronavirus\/","transcript":"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been taken to hospital as he continues to show symptoms of the coronavirus, 10 days after testing positive. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had shown persistent symptoms of the coronavirus since self-isolating at No.11 Downing Street on March 27 after testing positive to COVID-19. However, his hospital admission is said to be “not an emergency”. British health officials said on Sunday the death toll from the coronavirus had risen by 621 to 4934 with 48,440 people testing positive. “On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,” Downing Street said on Monday morning (Australian time). “This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.” A source told Reuters that British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would chair the government’s emergency COVID-19 meeting on Tuesday (AEST). Mr Johnson’s pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, 32, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better. Since his self-isolation, Mr Johnson has had his meals brought to him and has conducted the business of government in a suit and tie via videolink and social media. However, on Friday, looking slightly dishevelled with his tie undone and short of breath, the PM said he still had one of the symptoms with a high temperature. Reuters reported Downing Street refused to say what tests Mr Johnson was to have in hospital. But experts said a person of the prime minister’s age with COVID-19 symptoms after 10 days would be likely be assessed for their oxygen levels, lung, liver and heart functions, and undergo an electrocardiogram heart check. Doctors managing COVID-19 patients have reported that more men than women have serious problems. Patients who are overweight or with previous health issues are at a higher risk. Earlier this year, Mr Johnson said he needed to lose weight. “The prime minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,” Downing Street said. Meanwhile, Prince Charles, 71, is back at work after recovering from the coronavirus, which he tested positive for at the end of last month.

Britons gathered at television and phone screens on Monday morning (Australian time) to watch the Queen’s address, in which she urged the community to pull together to fight COVID-19. Less than an hour later, the British government confirmed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been taken to hospital as he continues to show symptoms 10 days after being confirmed to have the virus. Release of information on the PM’s hospitalisation, along with the Queen’s message, are undoubtedly part of a strategy to make it hit home to Britons how serious a threat the coronavirus poses. Downing Street invited the Queen to record her message as the government grapples with how to convince Britons to stop going outside to sun-bake and picnic in the spring sun. “While we have faced challenges before, this one is different,” she said. “This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us.” The Queen has only delivered such a speech only five times in her 68-year reign – the first as a child during wartime. The broadcast came hours after officials said Britain’s virus death toll had risen by 621 in the past 24 hours to 4934. Healthcare workers are preparing for more surges, and authorities believe more people will die this week. Among those to have contracted the coronavirus is the Queen’s own son, Prince Charles. He has since recovered. The Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, travelled to Windsor Castle in March, earlier than their usual Easter getaway, as part of protection measures. For the filming of her historic message, the Queen used one of the castle’s biggest rooms to ensure there was a safe distance between her and the cameraman, who wore gloves and a mask. She thanked the British public staying at home, adding that in future people would be able to take pride in how they dealt with such a disruption to their lives. She said the situation reminded her of her first broadcast in 1940, when she and her sister Margaret spoke from Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes under sustained German bombing raids.

The pride in who we are is not a part of our past – it defines our present and our future.” Maintaining an upbeat tone, the Queen invoked the words of a World War II song – We’ll Meet Again by Vera Lynn, which became a symbol of hope for Britons during the conflict. “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return,” she said. Britain’s health minister has warned that outdoor exercise could be banned if people continue to flout lockdown rules designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Daily exercise, such as walking, running or cycling, is allowed as long as people maintain social distancing. But that could be about to change. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was reacting to reports some Britons have been in parks sun-baking in the warm spring weather. Most people were complying, he said, but if a minority continued to break the rules “we then might have to take further action”. “What we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed,” he said. London’s Lambeth Council closed one park on Sunday after it said many people had sunbathed or gathered in large groups there on Saturday. Mr Hancock said it was “unbelievable” that a small minority would flout government advice on social-distancing."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus cruise saga: Ruby Princess to dock amid murder probe","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/06\/ruby-princess-criminal-investigation-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A criminal investigation into the disastrous handling of the Ruby Princess is set to begin on Monday as the vessel is moved to Wollongong. The cruise ship will likely spend up to 10 days docked at Port Kembla as the crew on board are monitored for the virus and taken to land for healthcare, if needed. The announcement that NSW was launching a homicide investigation came as the Ruby Princess was on Sunday linked to a total of 11 deaths from the coronavirus. Families have been revealing conditions on board the ship, including how people were coughing and visibly unwell – leading to further questions over why passengers were allowed to disembark. One of the victims was identified as Leonard Fisher, an 81-year-old from Tasmania.  His son Greg told 60 Minutes Mr Fisher contracted the virus on the ill-fated cruise. He recalled his dad said “at my age, I’ll probably never get a chance to do another trip like this again”, before growing concerned about the escalating virus outbreak on the ship, Greg told 60 Minutes. Greg noted that his dad had been sitting beside a man who was “coughing and coughing, and coughing”, but the pair ultimately trusted Carnival Cruises, the company which owned Ruby Princess. “At no stage were the passengers told that there was a possibility of coronavirus on that boat. They were unaware of any sickness that was on that boat, it was just so wrong,” Greg said. The NSW police homicide squad will be leading the investigation into how passengers were allowed to leave the Ruby Princess in Sydney. The ship has emerged as a main source of COVID-19, with a total of 622 people who had been onboard so far testing positive for the coronavirus including 342 NSW residents. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said that while they had “many unanswered questions”, there was clear evidence COVID-19 had come off the Ruby Princess and at least 11 passengers had died in Australia because of it. “There seems to be absolute discrepancies between the information provided by Carnival and what I would see is the benchmark for the laws of the federal and state government,” Mr Fuller told reporters on Sunday. On March 18, the day before the ship disembarked in Sydney, a worker on board the Ruby Princess was on the phone to Triple 0 for 17 minutes, relaying information about two passengers who needed medical attention, Mr Fuller revealed. He said an ambulance supervisor went a step further and notified the NSW Police Marine Area Command about the potential for infection to spread to other passengers. Leaked emails further revealed results of onboard swab tests from the cruise ship’s passengers who were showing signs of influenza would have been available the same day passengers disembarked. However, Carnival Cruises later informed police that “COVID-19 wasn’t an issue on the ship”, Mr Fuller added. NSW police confirmed the Ruby Princess will arrive at Port Kembla on Monday “to allow for safer access for medical assessments, treatment, or emergency extractions of her crew.” The vessel is likely to remain docked for up to 10 days for medical assessments, treatment or emergency extractions of the crew, but they won’t be disembarked unless in an emergency and approved by Mr Fuller. Health Minister Brad Hazzard stood behind his staff who had allowed the Ruby Princess to disembark on March 19, despite knowing the results would be available within hours. But NSW Labor called for Mr Hazzard to resign over the scandal, with the opposition labelling it “one of the greatest health disasters” in NSW history. The NSW death toll reached 16 on Sunday after it was revealed four more people had died from the coronavirus in NSW, including passengers of the Ruby Princess. The deaths were all men, aged 61, 76, 80, and 91, NSW Health protection confirmed on Sunday. The good news is that Australian infection rates have eased by 25 to 30 per cent a couple of weeks ago to single figures in recent days. It was as if the country was at the end of the first quarter in the grand final and a goal ahead, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth said. “We know that if we work as a team and play as we are now, we can get the premiership, but we are a long way away from that being the case,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “It is far too early to drop the ball and …. if we do stop these measures too early, then we have seen graphs in the media showing there could be a resurgence in cases so we have to be careful on those grounds.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Unions push for ‘reasonable test’ in JobKeeper deal for casuals","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/06\/unions-push-jobkeeper-compromise-casuals\/","transcript":"Thousands of casual workers who do not currently qualify for the $1500-a-fortnight JobKeeper allowance based on length of service could secure access to the scheme in a compromise deal after Attorney-General Christian Porter confirmed he was “listening” to union concerns. But Labor and unions are also set to compromise over changes to allow bosses to slash some workers’ wages and hours to fit the base rate of the $1500 payment for six months if they are stood down – to help companies “hibernate” during the COVID-19 crisis. Winners and losers are set to emerge from the JobKeeper wage subsidy that will pay all eligible employees a flat rate of $1500 a fortnight regardless of whether they are casual, part-time or full-time. The winners include casuals and part-timers who have worked for companies for 12 months or longer who are currently paid less than the JobKeeper payment. The design of the wage subsidy means that some casuals who previously earned just a couple of hundred dollars a week working in a supermarket will get a huge pay boost to $750 a week. But casuals who have worked for less than 12 months in continuous service will miss out under the draft rules announced by the Morrison government. \"If you could have reasonably expected to be working if it were not for the #coronavirus, then you should get the JobKeeper allowance,\"@sallymcmanus.#Auspol #Insiders pic.twitter.com\/A9DhL5qPAc — Insiders ABC (@InsidersABC) April 4, 2020 ACTU secretary Sally McManus is proposing a “reasonable test” to extend the payment to casuals who had expected work over the next year, before COVID-19, regardless of whether they have served 12 months of continuous service. The workers would otherwise be left on the $550-a-week JobSeeker allowance, the ‘dole’ that has been recently doubled to help workers laid off during the coronavirus crisis. Currently, casuals who have worked for a company for less than a year are excluded from the $1500-a-fortnight scheme. “Unfortunately in our country, we’ve become so dependent on casual work. Think about all of the universities – more than 50 per cent of the workers there are casual workers and they won’t get that allowance unless it changes,” she said. “There’s a reasonableness test to it. And I think that that would mean that you’d pick up on all of the people who had already banked on the fact that they already have a job this year.” .@sallymcmanus says the ACTU doesn't believe changing the Fair Work Act is necessary. \"We're worried that if you change the rights of workers unfortunately, some employers might abuse that.\"#Auspol #Insiders pic.twitter.com\/LMObjJ4YGf — Insiders ABC (@InsidersABC) April 4, 2020 Mr Porter said he was carefully considering calls from Ms McManus and Labor to extend the eligibility to more workers. “We are listening,” Mr Porter said. “We’re doing it in a short time. We’re trying to make the definition reasonable and inclusive and there will be, as Sally McManus said in this today, in her language ‘swings and roundabouts’. “Some people will find themselves being paid significantly more than their usual wage because they’re part time or casual.” But he urged Labor and the unions not to delay the JobKeeper wage subsidy. “This change will be happening next Wednesday. No matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday,” Mr Porter said. “Six million Australian jobs depend on it. “Next Wednesday we are pushing a $130 billion lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever seen. “And people will need to decide whether or not they’re going to help us push that boat out, but it is going out on Wednesday.” Mr Porter has rejected calls to suspend award rates during the crisis, but flagged that some flexibility around agreed hours will be required to industrial relations laws, for example in circumstances where workers have been stood down and are not working. Workers who earn more than $1500 a fortnight and are stood down because of mandated COVID-19 closures, could have their salary slashed – legally – while the business goes into “hibernation”. Employers will also have the option to ‘top up’ the salary to the normal amount if workers earn more than $1500 a fortnight. This will apply to companies that qualify for the wage subsidy but continue to trade as normal. “I think there’s agreement amongst all people who have knowledge and experience in industrial relations and employment relations in Australia that for the system to work you have to make changes to the way in which the employment relations and industrial relations system in Australia presently operates,” Mr Porter said “Now those changes would be time-bound. They would only last for as long as the payment system lasted. “But without those changes, even if it were the case that a business would face a situation where it would otherwise have to let an employee go. “So we must change the system. “Now I’ve been working very, very co-operatively with Sally McManus and the ACTU and with the assistance of Greg Combet on the Prime Minister’s Commission.” Labor’s industrial relations spokesman Tony Burke said it would be reasonable to reduce hours in some circumstances, but his main concern was ensuring casuals who do not qualify on the basis of length of service are considered. “You can’t reduce someone’s hourly rate but there may be circumstances where the employer can’t afford … to pay the full rate but there’s a chance of a job because of the job subsidy, and in those circumstances, you’d want to find a way that you could negotiate to reduce hours so that the person was still on the correct hourly rate,” Mr Burke said. But he said there would be other circumstances that are not acceptable. “For example, is having an employer who ran a restaurant shut down the restaurant and then be able to say, well having shut down the restaurant, I’m going to use the wage subsidy so that the people who used to work in my restaurant can now do the cooking and cleaning for me and my family at home. You wouldn’t want to allow that.” Mr Burke said Labor’s preference however was to allow the Fair Work Commission to manage these issues. Parliament will sit on Wednesday, with far fewer MPs flying to Canberra in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 and non-essential travel."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Take it seriously’: Quarter of NSW coronavirus cases are young people","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/06\/young-people-coronavirus-cases\/","transcript":"The misconception that young people can easily survive the coronavirus has been debunked again, following the death of a five-year-old in the United Kingdom. The child was among 708 people whose deaths caused by COVID-19 were announced on Saturday in the UK, propelling Britain’s death toll beyond 4300. But authorities fear messages about the very real threat to young people are falling on deaf ears. And it’s not just foreign countries that are reporting a growing number of life-threatening cases among children and people under the age of 30. It’s happening in Australia, too. On Sunday, New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard announced about a quarter of all cases in NSW were people under 29 years old. “I keep hearing messages that young people think this isn’t going to affect them … it can affect young people and it is currently affecting young people,” Mr Hazzard told reporters. “‘Take it seriously’ is my message to young people.” Of the state’s 2580 cases, 565 are in people aged under 29, while 105 are in people aged under 19. Three people in their 30s are so ill they have been put on ventilators in intensive care. So far, the youngest recorded death during the pandemic is a six-week-old baby in the US state of Connecticut. The baby died last week after testing positive for the coronavirus. Governor Ned Lamont confirmed the death on Wednesday, adding it was likely one of the youngest deaths from the disease “anywhere.” Those who still think young people aren’t seriously affected by the coronavirus need to confront the reality that people of all ages are dying or being treated in hospital after contracting the disease. In Australia, people aged between 20 and 29 account for the highest number of confirmed cases of all age groups. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Staying at home during coronavirus: Show us the mischief makers","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/06\/coronavirus-stay-home-children-photos\/","transcript":"We’ve all got a lot of more time on our hands now we’re staying at home.

The band’s victory launched it on a path to worldwide fame, with the single becoming a No.1 hit in several countries, reaching the US top 10 and selling nearly six million copies. Waterloo was so popular it was chosen as the best song in the competition’s history at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005. Contrary to popular belief, the title Waterloo does not refer to Waterloo in London, nor the landmark train station in central London. The song is about a woman who ‘surrenders’ to a man and promises to love him, referencing the defeat of French emperor and military leader Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The story is introduced in the first verse: My my At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender Oh yeah And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way The history book on the shelf Is always repeating itself ABBA first performed the song at Melodifestivalen 1974 in February, singing it in Swedish. The song won, advancing the band to Eurovision. The catchy, up-tempo tune of Waterloo made it stand out from the dramatic ballads that were stereotypical of Eurovision, and the band members’ bright costumes – including platform boots – were something the audience had never seen before. The group was also the first winning entry in a language other than that of their home country. Before 1973, all Eurovision singers had to sing in their country’s native language, but that restriction was lifted briefly between 1973 and 1976, allowing Waterloo to be sung in English. The group was made up of two married couples who later split, and the band name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names: Anni-Frid Lyngstad (Frida), Benny Andersson, Bjorn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: What will the economy look like once the virus is contained?","date":"04-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/2020\/04\/06\/post-coronavirus-economy\/","transcript":"The novel coronavirus has caused more economic upheaval than any event since the Second World War. Offices have been closed and supermarket shelves stripped bare. Airlines have ground to a halt and hundreds of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. And that’s just the beginning. Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week said the short-term goal is to protect as many jobs as possible during the “hibernation” so the economy can bounce back once the virus is contained. But what happens beyond that? Is it reasonable to expect economic ‘normality’ to resume after such a catastrophic event? The late neoliberal economist Milton Friedman once said: “Only a crisis – actual or perceived – produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.” And so, amid all the anxiety and uncertainty about our future, The New Daily asked several economists to dust off their best ideas and paint a picture of what the post-coronavirus economy might look like. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the inadequacy of crucial aspects of our social and economic system, particularly relating to employment and unemployment. Before the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1970s, Australian governments accepted responsibility for maintaining full employment, and provided support for all those unable to engage in paid work, whether through age, disability or unemployment on an equal basis. The full employment goal was not always achieved, but it remained central to public policy. Over the period since the 1970s, government has passed the responsibility for economic management to the Reserve Bank and required a primary focus on low inflation. The treatment of benefit recipients, except the old, has been steadily less generous and more punitive. Meanwhile, governments have focused obsessively on largely meaningless measures of budget balance. The failures of this approach have been evident for years, but it has taken the COVID-19 crisis to lead to any change. Within a matter of weeks, dogmas that have been in place for decades have been abandoned. The most important requirement for the post-coronavirus economy is that we should not attempt to return to a pre-crisis ’normality’ that was unsustainable in almost every respect: Social, economic and environmental. Rather, the income support measures adopted in response to the crisis should be maintained, and the government should accept the maintenance of full employment as its core economic responsibility. John Quiggin is an economics professor at the University of Queensland. He is the author of several books including Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us. The coronavirus will fundamentally transform our economy. It is up to policymakers whether those transformations lead to a more prosperous and sustainable economy. Although the crisis has exposed the risk of interconnected global supply chains, we should not turn our back on globalisation. Its benefits far outweigh the risks. The government’s moves to strengthen the social safety show how woefully inadequate it had become, and how this undermines macro-economic activity. The extent to which this stays in place will help drive more equitable and sustainable economic growth into the future. There are signs of great innovation stemming from the crisis that have the potential to lead to step improvements in productivity and changes in how we work. Businesses will be able to reduce office footprints, for example, as more workers work from home. The use of tele-medicine will save doctors and patients time in accessing healthcare. There are many more examples emerging. Government will need to do a lot of the heavy lifting once the pandemic is over to get the economy back to full production. As long as it is able and willing to do this, the future does not look as bleak as it may appear. Angela Jackson is an economist at Equity Economics. She previously worked as a senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to the Australian minister for finance and deregulation from November 2007 to September 2010. As production output slows and factories close overseas, policies designed to dismantle domestic manufacturing over recent years reveal our vulnerability in dependence on imports. Reconstruction will necessitate its reboot to produce emergency healthcare goods and plug intermediate input holes that emerge under more strained international supply chains. Disease containment forecasting will demand proactive, hands-on economic planning, likely for several years. Business investment will play a marginal role in reconstruction. Huge public investments in higher-value, high-wage production (through state-owned enterprises and joint ventures) and expansion in public services will be central. Rebooting and reorganising production will likely take years while fighting the pandemic. Universal income guarantees could provide much-needed security and support civic engagement in community-led efforts, including mutual aid groups. Highly restrictive industrial relations laws will be a continued barrier to the co-ordination needed to fight the disease and plan our future reconstruction. Previous crises in history show without adequate democratic infrastructure, state-led economic recoveries can send freedoms backward. Industry and unions can work together to expand capacity and scope of existing industries to replace imports, increase exports, and create new industries – including renewable power infrastructure and social housing. Alison Pennington is a senior economist at the Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work. (This response has been edited for brevity.) We are seeing just how important the role of government is in the economy. With strong economic leadership from the government, as we are seeing especially in the likes of the UK, Canada, Germany, Sweden and New Zealand, the personal pain of the recession will be minimised so that when the recovery finally comes, the pick up will start on a stronger footing. For Australia, the unemployment rate will be materially higher, even a year after the virus has passed. We are likely to see persistent easy economic policy – not just in interest rates, which will remain low for many years, but also the government’s budget settings will likely be slow to withdraw stimulus in an effort to eventually reduce the budget deficit. The key role of the government post-crisis will be job creation. People will need to be retrained and re-skilled. The government will need to create jobs either through a revamping of the currently depleted public service but also indirectly through infrastructure spending. Get set for big government.

For weeks the Geelong man had been trying to think of meaningful ways to be of help to the community during the coronavirus pandemic. Now, an idea had struck at an unexpected moment – and soon, he was on a roll. “When I ran out of toilet paper I rang my sister, who lives around three blocks away, and she helped me,” Mr Qutub told The New Daily. “That gave me the idea: I know my neighbours, but there would be a lot of people out there who don’t have that level of connection with their neighbours.” Eager to connect his community during the crisis, Mr Qutub used his skills as a web developer to create Angel Next Door, a website that links people who need help with their neighbours. Users who register themselves as an ‘angel’ receive an email notification whenever someone posts a help request in their area. One of the first users was Armstrong Health Centre’s Dr Faisal Murad, who wanted to find a webcam so he could conduct health consultations with patients over video calls. “We can’t find it in any shops. If you have a spare webcam that you can sell or rent, please let us know ASAP,” Dr Murad posted. Not long after, some ‘angels’ answered the call: One offered her webcam, and another organised a special urgent delivery. #AngelNextDoor New help request from #Lara – Help for a family member. | Hey there!

All conversations happen one on one as private messages. Mr Qutub said he didn’t want people to shy away from helping others over fear of sharing personal information in a public forum, such as Facebook groups. And his sensitive approach to information sharing is paying off. “The response time is pretty quick – generally within 30 minutes of someone posting a request they will get a response,” he said. A family of five in the nearby town of Lara recently posted on the website explaining they urgently needed groceries and “a lot of lovely angels jumped on to help”, Mr Qutub said. “One of the ladies organised a delivery from a local grocery shop. “It’s all about encouraging people to help each other, and celebrate people helping each other.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Michael Pascoe: Big business bastardry continues with payment squeeze","date":"04-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/2020\/04\/05\/coronavirus-big-business-exploitation\/","transcript":"The small wholesaler was giving the large customer the standard 30 days to pay with a 3 per cent discount. On the 30th day came the extra squeeze, an arm twist for more, an act of business bastardry. With payment about to fall due, the message was that the supplier was invited to tender with a further discount to ensure prompt payment. The supplier was told, as an indication, that other suppliers were offering discounts of 15 to 20 per cent. Take the hint, Sunshine. Although the wholesaler’s instinct was to tell the customer where to shove the invitation, he spoke to his accountant first. Except at the luxury goods top end, a discount of 15 to 20 per cent doesn’t just wipe out a small wholesaler’s profit margin, it bites into their capital. But cash flow is always king. Right now it’s also Emperor and God and the thin red line before calling the bank. The wholesaler offered a smaller discount. Payment came through. Maybe it was all a bluff, maybe full payment would have occurred promptly anyway. In any event, there was nothing illegal about the customer trying it on – and nothing unusual about a bigger business trying to squeeze the last drops out of a smaller business. I’m tempted to not name the particular company that tried it on, to let any number of bigger players wonder if I’m writing about them, to let them worry that word of their behaviour is getting out. I’ll decide whether to name or not at the end of this column, but in the meantime, bigger businesses should remember the public shaming  fabulously wealthy Rio Tinto copped earlier this year over its “reverse factoring” scheme – small suppliers were invited to discount their invoices by 2 per cent if they wanted payment quicker than 30 days. Rio has form when it comes to squeezing suppliers. In 2016, it proposed a unilateral doubling of payment terms to 90 days for contracts worth more than $3 million – a proposal public opinion caused it to abandon. The Australian Financial Review’s Chanticleer columnist observed that Rio’s “reverse factoring” scheme wasn’t particularly bad, but it still didn’t pass the pub test. “Rio’s decision is the right one because these reverse factoring schemes rely on big companies being able to take advantage of the inherent power imbalance between buyer and supplier, and all for a gain that must be somewhere between tiny and minuscule,” wrote Chanticleer. “Worse than that, Rio’s decision shows there is a clear risk of reputational damage attached to these schemes. “We all understand that there will be vigorous negotiation at the start of a supply contract, as both parties try to get the best deal. “But for big companies to then go to their suppliers and attempt to chip them for a couple of percentage points after the goods or services have been delivered is not a good look. “The message it sends is so arrogant. Yes, we know we could help your cash flow if we paid your invoice in a week, but we’re not going to because that would hurt our cash flow. “So if you want your cash early, take 97¢ in the dollar. Or wait.” That was in January – so long ago now that it could be dated as BC – Before Coronavirus. And Rio continues to watch the billions pour in as iron ore prices remain extremely profitable for it. Now there’s extra pressure across industry as big companies feel the crisis too – or use it as an excuse to apply extra pressure. Minister for Small and Family Business Michaelia Cash has warned big businesses the global pandemic is no excuse for delaying payments and using it as such is “unacceptable”. “The government has made their expectations clear – big businesses must step up and do what they can to support small and family businesses in the face of the COVID-19 [coronavirus] outbreak,” she said. Colleague Killian Plastow reports Senator Cash’s comments come after the AFR reported auto parts retailers Supercheap Auto and Repco were pressuring suppliers into extending payment terms, in some cases by as much as 90 days. In March, government unveiled a stimulus package to support small business owners facing drastically reduced income as customers self-isolate. Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO) Kate Carnell told Killian delayed payments are a death sentence for many of those businesses. “Small businesses are already in a world of pain with regards to cash flow because a very large percentage of them have had significant reductions in business,” Ms Carnell said. “It isn’t acceptable under any circumstances, especially not in this situation. Smaller businesses are hanging on by their fingernails already. To end up with 60- or 90-day payments from some of their major customers is beyond belief.” Although the coronavirus pandemic makes the need for timely payments more pressing, the problem has long plagued Australia’s small businesses. Accounting software firm Xero claims 53 per cent of all payments made by large firms to their smaller counterparts are paid late. That amounts to $115 billion every year, or the equivalent of $52,000 for each small business. On average, that money ends up in the hands of small business owners more than three weeks (23 days) after it should. Xero estimates paying invoices to small businesses on time would result in a $7 billion stimulus for this segment of industry. But the power imbalance between large and small businesses means many bigger outfits can negotiate unreasonably long payment times as a form of “free credit”. “Most small businesses really don’t have a choice whether they deal with a major supplier or not,” Ms Carnell said. “Big businesses have the power, smaller ones don’t have any choice. That’s why it’s really important big businesses don’t use their power to pay small businesses slowly – and in some cases becoming slower.” Big multinational corporations are among the “worst offenders”, Ms Carnell added. For example, CIMIC-owned engineering firm UGL last year told suppliers and subcontractors their payment times would be extended to 65 days, up from the recommended 20. Small businesses who aren’t paid on time only have one form of recourse: Taking late-paying businesses to court. That is both time-consuming and expensive. Many big businesses simply turn to other small suppliers. Ms Carnell said more protections are needed so that small businesses don’t have to fight for their cash flow. The current crisis only strengthens the case for stricter legislation, she said. “And if they don’t step up to the mark and show they can be good corporate citizens and do the right thing, then as soon as government gets through this traumatic time they will need to look at legislation for payment times. “Unfortunately some businesses – enough businesses – have shown they can’t be trusted to do the right thing.” So what was the company at the start of this story making the “invitation”? Brand Collective, a spinoff from the old Pacific Brands. It’s owned by the private equity outfit, Anchorage Capital Partners. Private equiteers are famous, or infamous, for their financial engineering, stripping businesses down and squeezing for any possible advantage – sometimes quite short-term advantages."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: How Australia is supporting its frontline health workers","date":"04-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/05\/coronavirus-frontline-health-workers\/","transcript":"Australians have never relied on frontline health workers more than today, yet medical staff are most at risk of contracting the coronavirus. As the number of confirmed cases in Australia soared above 5500, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday addressed this paradox when he said the state government would spend $20 million on hotel rooms for healthcare workers who need to self-isolate. Mr Andrews told reporters that up to 8000 hospital workers and paramedics will get access to free accommodation if they contract the virus or have unprotected contact with a person suspected of having it. “This is exactly the right thing to do,” Mr Andrews said. The announcement mirrored similar measures introduced by the South Australian and Tasmanian state governments – and came after a series of broader health measures listed below. In addition to the program announced on Sunday, the Victorian government has bolstered its health system by: As part of its $2.3 billion coronavirus stimulus package, the NSW government will spend $700 million on strengthening its health system. It said this would: Aside from the above package, NSW Health has partnered with the Australian Physiotherapy Association in training physiotherapists with previous intensive care experience to provide specialised care to patients with COVID-19. Pharmacists also have extra powers to dispense medicines without a prescription and can now stay open 24 hours a day.  As for frontline workers in the state, they have called on their leaders to follow in Victoria’s footsteps and provide free accommodation to those who need to self-isolate away from their families. The government has also urged retired nurses and doctors to rejoin the workforce if they are able to do so. The Queensland government has said it will invest $1.2 billion in increasing the capacity of its healthcare system to fight COVID-19. It said the money would go towards the expansion of: Asked what the Queensland government was doing to protect its frontline healthcare workers, a spokesperson said it was making sure “our staff have the protective equipment and support they need each day so they can return safely back to their homes and families after each shift”. They added: “Queensland Health meets regularly with staff and stakeholder representatives so that we can adapt and meet any emerging needs that arise.” Steven Marshall’s administration was the second state government to announce free accommodation for frontline health workers. Announcing the measure on March 25, the state premier said the first rooms would be available within weeks. SA Health has also opened dedicated COVID-19 clinics; established a mental health support line for those feeling overwhelmed by the crisis (1800 632 753); and reached an agreement with packaging company Detmold Group to produce surgical masks and respirators. The South Australian company will provide an “uninterrupted supply” of respirators and 20 million masks a month from June. The government is also trialling the use of vending machines to deliver PPE to frontline workers. Similar to many other state and territory governments, Mark McGowan’s administration has set up dedicated fever clinics, initiated various recruitment drives, and scaled back elective surgery. It has also made it easier for pharmacists to dispense prescription medicines (until May 31), and established a $3 million funding program to support COVID-related research. “This new funding scheme will give WA researchers an opportunity to be part of global efforts to minimise the impacts of COVID-19,” WA health minister Roger Cook said of the scheme. “At a time when there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19, WA patients and healthcare consumers will potentially have access to clinical trials.” Among other things, the government has also expanded its testing criteria to include anyone who is showing signs of a fever and acute respiratory infection, and relaxed rules pertaining to the use of new and emerging treatments.  The Apple Isle was the first jurisdiction to ban interstate travel in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus. It was also the first to offer emergency hotel accommodation to frontline workers who need to self-isolate away from vulnerable family members. In addition to this, it has: As part of its second economic rescue package, the ACT government announced it would spend roughly $23 million building a temporary hospital to deal with COVID-19.

There has been wide support for the Morrison government’s third and massive stimulus package, but there has been some criticism of parts of the plan. “We are pushing the $130 billion lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever had to see and people need to decide whether or not they want to help us push the boat out, but it is going out on Wednesday,” Mr Porter told reporters in Canberra on Sunday. “We’re not going to be arguing about timing and process and speculative possibilities in the weeks to come. This, and the changes necessary to make JobKeeper happen, are happening next Wednesday.” Labor’s industrial relations spokesman Tony Burke said he wanted the legislation to be passed so the money gets to business and then into the pockets of workers. “This system as announced by the government will be improved and can be approved,” Mr Burke told reporters in Sydney. Mr Porter, who is also leader of the house and industrial relations minister, says the legislation is still being nutted out in his department and Treasury.

But she was concerned about 1.1 million casual workers were missing out on the payment because they haven’t had 12 months continuous service, particularly in the arts and entertainment and construction industries. She is also concerned by the government’s push to make changes to awards covering millions of workers made in the last couple of weeks through Fair Work Act legislation rather than through collaboration. “We don’t want unintended consequences. We don’t want a situation where we change workers’ rights and leave it open for some employers to be opportunistic … some employers might abuse that,” Ms McManus told ABC television’s Insider program. Mr Porter said he was listening to the ACTU on the matter of casual workers and was trying to come up with a definition for these cases. “When you see the final draft you will see we are trying to be as inclusive and reasonable as possible.” Mr Porter said. He also said the legislation had a six-month cut off and would have to be re-submitted through another sitting of Parliament if the pandemic drags on beyond that period. Mr Burke said he hoped Mr Porter was listening to those concerns because there was a risk of “perverse outcomes” the way the scheme had been presented.

The simple answer is yes, but you’re more likely to have some symptoms, even if they’re mild. The World Health Organisation says asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 are “rare”, but emerging research is challenging that statement. Of course, having no symptoms is a better experience of COVID-19. But asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus in the community without realising they’re infected. And while they may not show symptoms, the people they transmit it to could have a response anywhere from mild to fatal. It’s for this reason that the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised all Americans to wear masks in public. But first, just how common is symptom-free COVID-19? When a passenger who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship was found to have COVID-19, the majority of the remaining passengers were tested for the new coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). From the results of those tests, researchers concluded that 17.9 per cent of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. The real figure could be closer to 30 per cent, one of the researchers, Dr Gerardo Chowell, told the New York Times. “The substantial asymptomatic proportion for COVID-19 is quite alarming,” said Dr Chowell, an epidemiologist at Georgia State University. Health authorities in several countries are casting doubt on the WHO’s early estimation that just 1-3 per cent of cases are asymptomatic. That estimation was based on February’s figures from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which claimed 1.2 per cent of its then 72,000 cases were asymptomatic. But more recently, the Chinese Government revealed to the South China Morning Post that a further 43,000 people tested positive but were not included as confirmed cases because they showed no symptoms. That puts the asymptomatic rate in China around 30 per cent, although there is likely a lot more asymptomatic cases who were not tested. Iceland has been testing anyone in the population who volunteers, along with people who are showing symptoms. Early results suggest roughly half of the cases in the general population are asymptomatic, but the sample size was still small when Iceland’s chief epidemiologist reported these findings. South Korea’s CDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters in mid-March that “Korea currently has a significantly higher rate of asymptomatic cases than other countries, perhaps due to our extensive testing”. In the US, the director of the CDC told NPR the proportion of silent carriers “could be as high as 25 per cent”. The answer is “probably”, in the same way people with COVID-19 can be contagious a couple of days before developing symptoms. On the one hand, asymptomatic people are less likely to be spreading droplets through coughing. On the other, they’re more likely to be mixing with others as they don’t realise they’re sick, let alone infectious. Researchers are still working to understand exactly how contagious asymptomatic cases may be. In one study, a 26-year-old Chinese man dubbed “Patient Z” felt nothing despite being a close contact of a confirmed case. But by day seven, the virus had bloomed in his nose and throat in exactly the same way as those who showed symptoms. “The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients,” the authors wrote. There’s also debate among researchers as to whether asymptomatic people truly have no symptoms or just fail to notice them as they are so mild. There are a few key takeaways here. Firstly, the outbreak is probably significantly larger than the cases we know about. Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the global tally was likely “five to 10 times higher” than the one million cases currently confirmed. In Australia, we’ve prioritised testing people with symptoms to conserve tests. While this approach returns a higher proportion of positive tests, we may be missing silent carriers and the opportunity to quarantine those people. For most of March, Australians were told to stay home or keep their kids home “if they had symptoms”, but this advice likely overlooked some asymptomatic carriers. With this in mind, the New Zealand government told all its citizens in a text message to: “Act as if you have COVID-19. Doing so will save lives.” Asymptomatic cases also throw into question WHO advice that healthy people don’t need to wear masks in public. As the US overrides this advice, will Australia follow suit?"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cyclone Harold bears down on Vanuatu with winds of up to 250kmh","date":"04-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/05\/cyclone-harold-vanuatu\/","transcript":"Disaster officials in Vanuatu are urging communities, many of them in remote locations, to shelter as a tropical cyclone is forecast to intensify to a category five in the coming hours.

She will personally thank front-line NHS staff, care workers and others carrying out essential roles for their efforts, in what is expected to be a deeply personal message reflecting her experience in other difficult times.

Although the 67-year-old President may indeed be fit and well, a positive test result would not have been in keeping with his strongman image. For 20 years, he has cultivated a hero-like persona, competing in judo, scuba-diving, driving tanks, firing weapons, fishing and horse riding.

While residents of major cities have been told to stay at home, Australian expat Jason Fenton, who lives in St Petersburg, said some people weren’t taking the threat seriously. “Not everyone is adhering to the self-isolation,” he said. “If I go to a supermarket, I need to go late at night to avoid the crowds.” Mr Fenton, who runs a web development business, said he’d seen some examples of panic buying. “Initially, when they announced that the borders to Europe were going to be locked down, things like buckwheat, pasta and rice sold out very quickly,” he said. “But toilet paper [shortages]? We’re not having that problem.” He said in recent weeks, he’d even heard some people joking about the virus by saying: “It’s OK, we drink vodka. We already have the medication.” It’s easy to see where that complacency comes from. As of April 3, Russia had 3548 officially confirmed cases of the coronavirus with a total of 30 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While that number increased significantly in recent days, it’s still relatively low, considering Russia has a population of 146 million people and shares a vast border with China and Europe. Russia’s efforts to control the virus may have indeed given it a head start. It shut its border with China in January and progressively closed other crossings throughout March. However, serious cracks in Russia’s defences emerged last week when Moscow’s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said infections were likely to be much higher than official figures suggested. Russia’s Doctor’s Alliance, a union group with links to opposition figure Alexei Navalny, also accused the government of deliberately hiding the number of infections — accusations the Kremlin denied. “They have a habit of fiddling with figures,” Mr Boulegue said. The Russia expert doubted the Kremlin would pursue a large-scale cover-up of cases, but would instead try to shield the President from the situation if it goes badly. On April 2, the President addressed the nation, telling Russians that a paid non-working week would now last a month in order to “win time”. “The peak of the epidemic in the world has not yet been reached, and in our country as well,” Mr Putin said. While Mr Putin has made national addresses and posed for photos, he has left many of the tough announcements about lockdowns and other restrictions to others. This is a deliberate strategy to “shift responsibility”, according to Mathieu Boulegue. “[Putin can say] that if your region gets a massive outbreak, it’s not the fault of my government, it’s the fault of your region. So blame your [regional] government,” he said.

The crisis is already creating major political headaches for Mr Putin, who has been forced to delay a constitutional vote that would allow him to remain in power until 2036. If the virus takes hold in poorly resourced regions with struggling health systems, it risks breeding “wider discontent”, Mr Boulegue said. “This is something the Kremlin needs to avoid at all costs. “They can’t face a social crisis that comes in the middle of power transition discussions.” Despite creating enormous challenges for Russia, the pandemic has created opportunities for Vladimir Putin. Following discussions with US President Donald Trump, Mr Putin arranged for a planeload of medical supplies to be flown to New York. It was a “very nice” gesture, Mr Trump said. It was also a chance for Russia to portray itself as a generous and capable world player, coming to the aid of the United States. “This is nuts,” tweeted Andrew Weiss, vice-president of studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Hopefully someone will tell Trump that he’s playing right into a propaganda ploy.” The Russian military has released several videos of its forces disinfecting aged-care homes in northern Italy. It has also sent planeloads of equipment to Italy, which some diplomats believe is another attempt to exert influence in Europe, where newly enforced border restrictions have created divisions. “Russia’s trying to probe European solidarity. It’s very self-serving,” Mr Boulegue said. Mr Putin has also suggested sanctions against his country should be relaxed, in light of the pandemic. “Ideally, we should introduce a moratorium, a solid moratorium on restrictions on essential goods as well as financial transactions for buying them,” he said. The Russian President seems determined to make the best of a bad situation. As he said in a televised address earlier this week: “God helps those who help themselves.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Jacinda Ardern tells Kiwis: No sex, please, we’re skittish | The New Daily","date":"04-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/05\/jacinda-ardern-tells-kiwis-no-sex-please-were-skittish\/","transcript":"Jacinda Ardern’s government has quietly codified a “bonk ban” more than a week into New Zealand’s clampdown designed to stamp out COVID-19. New Zealand authorities have issued new lockdown guidance that separates families and lovers who don’t live together. In Victoria and NSW, the chief health officer intervened to prevent a similar situation, with Victoria’s top medico last week saying the state had “no desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners.” With Kiwis not even half-way through an initial four-week lockdown that may even be extended, it remains to be seen how long they’ll spend apart. Before the lockdown, Ms Ardern asked Kiwis to “apply common sense” and shrink down their social group to “a small group of individuals who are part of your bubble … the bubble you must maintain” for the month. That was understood largely to mean households, but the non-specific language allowed families and partners who didn’t live to see each other. However, the issuing of a Health Act Order, replaced the unspecific order with explicit language, leaves no room for misinterpretation. It allows for no fraternising across households with very limited exemptions; for shared custody of children, and when at least one of the partners lives alone. The end result is the criminalisation of most relationships between Kiwis who don’t live together. Ms Ardern has justified the decision as necessary to fight COVID-19, on the same day that New Zealand cases reached an unfortunate milestone. The announcement of 89 fresh cases on Sunday means more than a thousand Kiwis have caught the virus during the pandemic. New Zealand’s tough lockdown goes further than stopping partners from seeing each other, it has closed all non-essential businesses – including all restaurants and educational facilities – and provided Kiwis with very few reasons to leave their own homes.

Late on Friday, the White House told Atkinson, the Intelligence Community’s inspector general, that he would be terminated from his position in 30 days. He was a key figure in the run-up to impeachment, having found credible a complaint from a still-unnamed whistleblower within the administration that Trump abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine’s interference in the 2020 US election for his political benefit. The president complained that after receiving the complaint, Atkinson did not come and speak to him about it at the White House. “He’s a total disgrace,” Trump said, also lambasting the whistleblower as “fake” and politically biased. “Frankly, somebody ought to sue his ass off,” he said. Atkinson’s firing prompted concerns among some Congressional Republicans and criticism from Democrats. US Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised Atkinson, while noting Trump has the authority to fire him. “Like any political appointee, the inspector general serves at the behest of the Executive,” Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, said in a statement on Saturday.

Trump informed the Senate intelligence committee late Friday of his decision to fire Michael Atkinson, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. Atkinson handled the whistleblower complaint that triggered Trump’s impeachment last year. Atkinson’s firing, which is part of a shake-up of the intelligence community under Trump, thrusts the president’s impeachment back into the spotlight as his administration deals with the deadly spread of coronavirus. As Trump was removing Atkinson, the number of US deaths due to the virus topped 7000. Trump said in the letter that it is “vital” that he has confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general, and “that is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general”. He did not elaborate, except to say that “it is extremely important that we promote the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of federal programs and activities,” and that inspectors general are critical to those goals. Atkinson was the first to inform Congress about an anonymous whistleblower complaint last year that described Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son. That complaint prompted a House investigation that ultimately resulted in Trump’s impeachment. In letters to lawmakers in August and September, Atkinson said he believed the complaint was “urgent” and “credible”. But the acting Director of National Intelligence at the time, Joseph Maguire, said he did not believe it met the definition of “urgent”, and tried to withhold the complaint from Congress. .@realDonaldTrump fires  Michael Atkinson the watchdog Inspector General who forwarded the Ukraine whistleblower complaint to Congress as was required under the law.

In secret Facebook group seen by The New Daily, real estate agents have been sharing tips on how to turn down tenants asking for a rent decrease after suffering financial hardship because of the coronavirus. Many voiced frustration tenants were asking for a decrease. “Seriously over getting these text messages,” wrote one agent from Melbourne, who posted a screenshot of the text. “Hi, I just letting you know that I lost my job and can’t pay the rent anymore. How do I go about this situation,” it read. “Following up the government regulations at the moment this makes me eligible to not be evicted and rent to be waived.” In response, one agent from New South Wales wrote: “Could they at least word it better.”  “This makes them sound like a spoilt brat kid and says to me ‘I’m an entitled twit, and I deserve to not pay rent and there’s nothing you can do about it because the government said so’.” Another wrote: “Am I the only one who hasn’t had any sh***y tenants expecting to live rent free for 6 months. How lucky am I’.” The discussions indicated agents were reluctant to enter into rent negotiation as dropping the rent is covered by some landlords insurance. “I understand having compassion and all, but ensure you protect your rights as a landlord too, especially if you yourself are experiencing financial hardship,” wrote one agent. Another expressed concern that if the landlord was covered, the money would not be paid until the tenant moved out. “In the current circumstances that could take some time, also dependent on government announcements that may see evictions placed on hold,” he wrote.  Some members of the 11,000-strong group shared different templates for financial hardship forms that requested the tenant take out their superannuation to pay rent. On Saturday, most of those posts had been deleted, or admin had made it clear no one was allowed to offer financial advice, after ASIC said they would crack down on the practice. Some agents were upset with the announcement, with one arguing: “Saying you can access your super is hardly financial advice. That’s like saying to someone you should buy that house\/car.” “The old saying you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink,” wrote another. “Don’t be silly, tenants are a protected group, can do no wrong, are entitled … they deserve free everything even if its not for COVID-19,” wrote another.  “Easier to just say, shove it up you’re a$$ and issue the 1B termination,” wrote another.  Members of the group also shared tips on dealing with tenants who were seeking a rent decrease, sharing email templates with what to say. Many of the posts expressed frustration that the government’s decision to ban evictions for six months had not been properly planned. Leaving it to tenants and landlords to sort things out, had put the agents in a tough spot. Leo Patterson Ross, from the Tenants Union, said the government needed to offer a framework of how this might work. “I think agents are struggling to know how to deal with the crisis, which is another good reason for government to step in with direction,” Mr Ross said. “For so long there have been no prospects of negotiated rent, so people don’t know how to do it. “This is a whole new world, I think expecting the agents to do without clear direction is a hard ask.”  That thousands of agents around the country had been swapping tips on how to deal with tenants asking for a rental decrease showed the power imbalance of the industry, Mr Ross said. “The agents are hired by the landlord, specifically to act in their interest. They’re not there to be nice to tenants,” he said. “There is often a disconnect between the way government and industry leaders talk about how it operates, and the real experience on the ground, and how the tenant feels. “This highlights that.” On Friday, REIA President Adrian Kelly released a statement condemning agents asking tenants to take out their super.  “I too have seen some less than acceptable behaviour from some agents in their communications with tenants. This heavy handedness is irresponsible,” Mr Kelly said. “Over the past three weeks I and many others in our industry have been very public about looking after the needs of both our tenants and property owners in particular those who are experiencing financial hardship. “We have always maintained that a moratorium on evictions during these challenging times is the correct thing to be doing because now more than ever everyone needs a roof over their heads. “Our members are receiving telephone calls every five minutes from our tenants and property owners who have lost employment and we have been waiting nearly two weeks now for the state and federal governments to agree on a framework so that we can get on with our job.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"What’s a verb?

Last week searches on Google for basic numeracy and literacy spiked. “With an increasing number of Australians working and learning from home, there has been a noticeable surge in search interest for basic literacy and numeracy questions,” Google said in a breakdown of most searches in the past week. The most searched “What is a…?” questions, past seven days in Australia was: Interestingly, the top trending related topics for childcare are ‘key worker’ and ‘working parent’, spiking +2,700 per cent and +2,550 per cent respectively. Perhaps a lot of us are taking this time to work on our sourdough starter, and write ‘Love in the time of coronavirus’ – a debut novel. Perhaps a lot of us are so bored we are entering spelling bees. Or maybe, just maybe, some parents are turning to Google, because it’s been 40 years since they studied what a noun was. Whatever the reason behind the spike in searches, it seems lots of us could use a refresher on the basics. Gabbie Stroud, former teacher and author of the books, Teacher and Dear Parents, said the trick to homeschooling is simplifying it. “Often the things for teaching kids that are the most powerful are the most simple,” she told The New Daily. “Studies after studies, from across the world show that reading with your child is the best thing to boost their literacy. “That is incredibly powerful, but I think parents think it’s not enough. “If parents took 45 minutes everyday to just do some reading and writing, the kids would be fine.” The curriculum for mathematics changes so quickly that most parents would be unfamiliar with a lot being taught, she said. “In terms of numeracy, mathematics has changed so much since even the youngest parents went to school. Even if the fundamentals are the same, parents should look for really natural, teachable moments. “For primary school kids, just get kids to learn their timetables.” Mostly though parents should be making sure their kids feel safe, and have time to process the rapidly changing world, she said. “We all need to accept as parents, policy makers, politicians, that this is going to be a disjointed year. “There’s still so much we don’t know. We just need to accept that and just try our best. We cant turn ourselves inside our by puttying up all the gaps.” But for those looking to brush up on their technical knowledge, The New Daily has put together a quick list below. Nouns The Merriam-Webster defines nouns as: “any member of a class of words that typically can be combined with determiners to serve as the subject of a verb.” Now we have cleared that up, let’s look at it in layman’s terms. A noun refers to a person, animal or thing. There are seven categories of nouns and they can overlap, but if you want to keep it simple, just think of them as the building blocks of sentences. They represent almost anything you can think of. ‘Nurse,’ ‘coal’, and ‘beauty are all nouns. ‘Memes,’ ‘masks,’ and ‘manners’ also nous. You get the drift. Verbs We won’t bother with the dictionary this time. They’re the ‘doing’ words. She sells toilet paper, he went to swim (but couldn’t) and you bought a ticket to a concert you can no longer go to. Adjectives Adjectives gather information. Without them, we wouldn’t know if the takeaway was bland, the online dating world disastrous or if working away from your boss is actually divine. They help us answer questions and be more specific. It was a brown dog, she was a hot nurse, I found four fresh rolls of toilet paper. Capisce? Let’s move on. Prime Numbers These bad boys are just numbers we already know and love that have a cool little trick to them. They cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller numbers. The world runs on the opposite, composite numbers. We break our day into 24 hours, which can be divided again into two lots of 12, or three lots of eight – in which the modern work day is based on. Our circles are 360 degrees. But prime numbers flip the switch on this: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,  are all prime. 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, also all prime. Their mathematical oddness creates the building blocks for all numbers. For instance, they help us encrypt things. When you’re putting your credit card information into ASOS, logging into your baking app or sending an encrypted message – prime numbers have your back. Metaphors Metaphors are actually quite fun. They are a figure of speech containing a comparison. They state one thing is actually another. Metaphors help us illustrate the world around us, explain how we feel, or symbolise something’s importance. Good ones help us understand something we might not have otherwise. Love, really isn’t a battlefield, the world is not actually a stage, and your husband hasn’t actually turned into a couch potato. But you might use these metaphors to explain what is happening. Synonyms Synonyms are our friends. They stop us repeating the same word over, and over, and over, and over, and over, again. They are words that are similar, or really closely related to another word. We could be baffled by the new social distancing restriction or we could be confused. Not hugging your friends could make you sad or miserable, but you could be lucky and fortunate to still have your job. And you might be passing the time by texting a beautiful woman, who is also stunning, during this difficult and arduous time. You get it."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus new treatments: The evolving battle against COVID-19","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/04\/04\/coronavirus-treatments-problems-latest\/","transcript":"It seems that every day scientists are discovering something new about our nasty jailer, COVID-19. But for each new challenge thrown up by the virus, researchers are ready to try out a new fix. Here is some of what’s been happening in the past week. A stopgap measure for ventilators: One of the most horrifying realities in emergency departments overseas (and thankfully one we haven’t we haven’t yet faced in Australia) is a shortage of ventilators. This means doctors are forced to decide who gets to keep breathing and who does not. US hospitals are about to trial a stopgap measure for people in respiratory distress, in cases where a ventilator is not helping, or where a ventilator is not available. The plan, prompted by a new study, is to give these patients a drug that is otherwise used to treat blood clots. According to a statement from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the drug is a protein called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). It’s commonly given to heart attack and stroke victims. How can this help people struggling for breath? There is emerging data from China and Italy that Covid-19 patients have a profound disorder of blood clotting that is contributing to their respiratory failure. “If this were to work, which I hope it will, it could potentially be scaled up very quickly, because every hospital already has it in their pharmacy,” said Michael Yaffe, a David H. Koch Professor of Science at MIT, in a prepared statement. “We don’t have to make a new drug, and we don’t have to do the same kind of testing that you would have to do with a new agent. This is a drug that we already use. We’re just trying to repurpose it.” The researchers will test tPA in patients under the Federal Drug Administration’s “compassionate use” program. That’s not a heart attack, it’s COVID-19: According to a report in The New York Times, some patients are presenting at emergency departments with symptoms of a heart attack, but when the doctors search for blocked arteries, there aren’t any, because the cardiac distress is being caused by COVID-19. This is a desperate scenario. As the Times writes: “What should doctors do these days when they see patients with apparent heart attacks? Should they first rule out coronavirus infection — or is that a waste of valuable time for the majority of patients who are actually having heart attacks?” And what do the doctors say about it? “I don’t know what the right answer is,” Dr Nir Uriel, a cardiologist at Columbia University and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, told the paper of record.  Meanwhile, a University of Texas study found that inflammation brought on by COVID-19 “can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias”. In other words, it can damage healthy hearts. Further, a report on heart problems among coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, found that 20 per cent of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had some evidence of heart damage. Many of these patients had no previously recorded heart disease. These patients were four times more likely to die compared with patients free of heart complications. Grim news, but new insights lead to new, more effective treatments. Experimental stem cell therapy given go-ahead: The US Federal Drug Administration has approved the clinical testing of an experimental stem cell therapy in patients with COVID-19. The therapy, to be initially trialled in 86 patients, uses Natural Killer (NK) cells from human placentas. NK cells are a type of white blood cell that work to support the immune system by identifying and destroying cells in the body that appear to be stressed, either from an infection or a mutation. The therapy has reportedly had some success in treating tumours. There is a difficulty with this form of therapy, however: it can thrust the immune system into overdrive, causing what’s known as a “cytokine storm”. This is where the body attacks healthy cells in the lungs, leading to organ failure and death. This occurs in up to 15 per cent of people battling any serious infection. The Phase I and II trials will be conducted by a New Jersey company called Celularity. Hundred-year-old vaccine trialled on Australian healthcare workers: 4000 healthcare workers are being recruited for a randomised controlled clinical trial of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, which was widely used to bring tuberculosis under control in the early 20th Century. BCG is still given to more than 130 million babies annually. It’s been found “to boost humans’ frontline’ immunity, training it to respond to germs with greater intensity,” according to a statement from the  Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI), which is conducting the trial. BCG has also been found to significantly reduce sharply reduces the incidence of respiratory infections. While the researchers “hope this improved ‘innate’ immunity will provide crucial time to develop and importantly, validate, a specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine”, the initial plan to is to see if it can provide some protection for doctors and nurses treating COVID-19 patients. The trial will take place at multiple sites across Australia, the first being the Royal Children’s Hospital and Monash Medical Centre. The trial has been endorsed by the World Health Organization. The MCRI announcement can be found here."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Staying sane in the COVID-19 pandemic: Help isn't far away | The New Daily","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/04\/04\/mental-health-pandemic-telehealth\/","transcript":"My name is Cathy, and I see a psychologist. I’m a pretty regular person – I run my own business, I have an amazing long-term partner, a mortgage and great relationships with friends and family. From the outside, it might seem as though I have my life together, and most of the time I am really happy. But sometimes I am not, and I need help to sort my stuff out. Once upon a time seeing a psychologist meant you were emotionally unstable (or borderline psychotic). The stigma still exists, but attitudes around mental health are changing, even more swiftly in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to an outsider is a great way to work through your everyday dramas, as well as the big things that can cause upheaval in your life – spoiler, we all have these. In my case, there’s been quite a few over the past 18 months. My beloved grandfather, Pa, passed away; there was some unusual family conflict that was intensely draining; my partner’s dad experienced a major health scare; my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer; we were renovating our house; and on top of all that we are trying to run a small freelance business. It was a lot. Opening up to a stranger about your most personal thoughts, the feelings you think aren’t justified, or the stuff you are embarrassed about can be tough. You’re probably used to mulling over your work worries, friendship dramas or relationship niggles with those closest to you over buckets of shiraz. But a stranger is often your best bet. They don’t carry historical baggage about you — they consider everything objectively and, in my experience, very helpfully. They also relieve the burden from others who can’t always be on call. My partner is an amazing listener and problem-solver but, with family health concerns of her own, she sometimes has limited bandwidth to troubleshoot my stuff too. I have had two psychologists over the past 10 years. I sought out the first – let’s call him Jordan – when I was trying to work through issues around my sexuality. He specialised in queer relationships and it felt comforting to me to speak with someone who understood my community and empathised with my experience. My current dude, let’s call him Brad, is more of a generalist. We talk about the relationships I have with people in my life, my core values and beliefs which shape my opinions (and judgements) and he’s given me techniques to deal with it all. Importantly, he’s also offered a place for me to simply vent. A psychologist doesn’t tell you what to do. You don’t go to them with a problem and say ‘fix it’. I like to call what they do ‘unpacking’. It’s as though I have a suitcase bursting at the seams with emotional energy and I feel as though I can’t touch the buckle without its contents spewing out. It feels messy. They help you to open it all up, sort through the stuff that can go straight back in the wardrobe and offer strategies to help you clean up the rest and to feel less stressed about the whole process. As the world becomes an increasingly unpredictable and terrifying place, our place within it is constantly shifting. It’s normal to feel unsettled at the best of times, and right now taking care of our mental health has never been more important. Brad and I chatted this week via video conferencing. We have a great rapport so it wasn’t weird not being in the same room. We had a great discussion and I feel a lot more equipped to be dealing with the horror show happening outside my door, but also confident about managing my general life stuff which hasn’t been switched off by COVID-19. The introduction of Telehealth services by the Morrison government means that you can access bulk-billed sessions with your GP and a psychologist via phone or video link. The first step is to speak with your GP and get a Mental Health Care Plan. This is a conversation with your doctor about your stress levels, any anxiety you may have and why a psychologist may help. The Plan allows you 10 discounted sessions per year which, under new bulk-billing offerings, means it will be free. If you don’t have a plan, there is a small Medicare gap fee of between $30 and $60. We all need to look after each other right now, but we also need to look after ourselves. And there is zero shame in asking for help."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus mask-making factory prompts experts' warning","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/coronavirus-homemade-face-masks\/","transcript":"Children in lockdown are making hundreds of reusable face masks from second-hand cotton sheets. They hand them out for free to elderly Australians queuing outside supermarkets. While they mean well, experts warn that homemade masks have the potential to cause harm. Dave McKay has turned his home garage into a mask-making factory. His three grandchildren, all aged 12, help six adults, cut and stitch the op-shop material with elastic strips, to replicate surgical face masks that cover the mouth and the nose. “Elderly people standing in a queue outside the supermarkets would put the masks on straight away and wear them while shopping inside,” Mr McKay said. Supermarkets aren’t always welcoming. On Friday, one of Mr McKay’s young distributing teams was kicked out of a Woolworths store in Melbourne. The store manager apparently complained that homemade masks were dangerous and that the container used to store them was not sterile. Mr McKay conceded “it was obviously very clean, but certainly not sterile” and “the moment anyone touched a mask it would not be sterile anyway”. The masking team of volunteers is pressing on regardless. They have already made 750 reusable masks and have enough material for 1250 more. “While medical staff are the ones at most risk, it makes no sense to say that masks do not help members of the general public,” Mr McKay said. “Hand-washing is the best means of defence, but it does not mean that hand-washing plus masks is not better.” He referred to an article by The Atlantic which reported that studies have suggested homemade cloth masks, while less effective than medical ones, were still better than nothing. The article referenced a 2013 experiment, that found surgical masks filtered 89 percent of viral particles from the air. “That is where we are coming from,” Ms McKay said. According to the report, the aim of the experiment by Cambridge University was “to determine the effect of homemade and surgical masks in preventing the dispersal of droplets and aerosol particles produced by the wearer”. Associate Professor Ben Mullins, from the School of Public Health at Curtin University, told The New Daily that the researchers didn’t investigate what was inhaled by participants, and thus failed to demonstrate that surgical masks will protect people from contracting the coronavirus. Associate Professor Mullins said that surgical masks are not designed to protect the wearer but to prevent them from contaminating others: they catch droplets emitted while exhaling. This is important in hospital settings – but a person donning a surgical mask is still inhaling air through its unenclosed sides, meaning infected droplets may still enter their system. Associate Professor Mullins questioned the idea they were still “better than nothing” by raising concern for people wearing homemade masks who are infected, coughing persistently and exhaling lots of droplets. “If it’s not maintained very well, if they’re wearing the same homemade mask for days and days, you can get such a buildup of moisture on there that it can be a vector for disease,” he said. Associate Professor Brian Oliver, a respiratory specialist at the University of Technology Sydney, worries that the masks, depending on the thickness of the cotton, could be hazardous to elderly people with breathing problems. He is also concerned that homemade masks can give a false sense of security and cause people to take more risks because they mistakingly believe the face-covering will protect them."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Kennedy family members missing on US east coast","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/04\/kennedy-family-members-missing\/","transcript":"The curse of the Kennedys has struck again, with two members of the tragedy-plagued clan feared dead after their canoe foundered in high winds on Chesapeake Bay. Friday night’s (US time) hunt for Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, 40, and her 8-year-old son, Gideon, turned up no trace of the duo. Their fragile craft was found empty, overturned and adrift, prompting searchers to give up all hope and reclassify the hunt from “rescue” to “recovery”. The missing mother and son are the daughter and grandson of former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who is the daughter of slain US Attorney general Bobby Kennedy and niece of assassinated president John F. Kennedy. “With profound sadness, I share the news that the search for my beloved daughter Maeve and grandson Gideon has turned from rescue to recovery,” Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement.  Kathleen Kennedy Townsend issues a statement on her daughter and grandson lost in boating accident: My heart is crushed, yet we shall try to summon the grace of God and what strength we have to honor the hope, energy and passion that Maeve and Gideon set forth into the world — Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) April 4, 2020  A Maryland Natural Resources Police spokeswoman said authorities suspended the search Friday night, with efforts to recover the bodies set to resume Saturday morning (local time). The search started Thursday afternoon after the state Natural Resources Police responded to a report of two people in a canoe who appeared to be in distress due to strong winds. Initial reports from the search hub say the tragedy began to unfold when a ball landed in Chesapeake Bay near Shady Side, Maryland, where there is a Kennedy-owned waterside property. The mother and son reportedly climbed into the canoe to fetch the ball but were driven away from the shore by winds so strong they were unable to make their way back. The latest deaths seemingly confirm a wisecrack by Bobby Kennedy after learning that little brother Ted Kennedy had been pulled barely alive from a light plane crash that claimed the life of a senior aide. “Someone up there doesn’t like us,” he said. Three years later, Bobby Kennedy would himself be gone, gunned down by a lone assassination in a Los Angeles hotel while campaigning for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.

As the state’s coronavirus count grew by 104 on Saturday, Mr Hazzard staunchly backed his staff who had allowed the cruise ship to disembark in Sydney on March 19. A heated press conference saw Mr Hazzard and NSW Chief Medical Officer Kerry Chant face tough questions after leaked emails revealed that results of on-board swab tests of passengers who were showing signs of influenza would have been available later that day. “The NSW Health expert panel has assessed the Ruby Princess as NOT requiring on board health assessment in Sydney,” NSW Health said in the email. A total of 622 passengers on board have tested positive for COVID-19 including 342 residing in NSW, with the handling of the saga to be investigated by NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller. Test results which were revealed by the government on March 20 showed that four passengers had contracted the virus while on board but by that time 2647 people had left the ship. Labor ramped up their attack on the government, calling on the health minister to resign. But a defiant Mr Hazzard said that NSW Health had worked “their hearts out” to keep the state safe and told critics to “take a step back”. “Can I just say that the experts who made the decision were the best in the world,” Mr Hazzard said. “And the appropriate thing at this point is for the investigation to continue. “Each of the staff of the Chief Health Officer who made the decision made it to the best of their ability. And those people are experts in their field.” Dr Chant also defended the actions of NSW Health based on the information given to them at the time, which was deemed low risk. “Hindsight is a great thing and all I can say is, as the minister indicated, a team of professionals considered the information,” she said. “I think it is clear that the influenza outbreak on the ship or the influenza activity on the ship … did leave them to conclude that the respiratory illness [cases on board] was due to influenza activity. “Cases that we could have averted by decanting people in a more ordered way with face masks and taking them directly to their homes, would have been in the order of 11,” Dr Chant said. “The people that have acquired their infection on the cruise ship could not have been avoided and every period of time that people were on that cruise ship, there were actually at risk of more transmission on the cruise ship in a very, vulnerable age group. ” She said it was now clear patients who left the ship had COVID-19. “In retrospect … we could all we wiser,” Dr Chant said. Labor opposition leader Jodi McKay said the government’s actions amounted to a “cover-up” and slammed them for allowing the ship to disembark without testing or quarantine. “This is one of the greatest health disasters in this state’s history,” she said. “The buck stops with the health minister and we are today calling for the health minister to stand aside.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Victoria and ACT record coronavirus deaths as national toll hits 30","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/victoria-and-act-record-coronavirus-deaths-as-national-toll-hits-30\/","transcript":"Two more deaths from COVID-19 have raised the national coronavirus toll to 34 in the space of a few hours. The tragic tally grew when four more people were categorised as coronavirus casualties in NSW, bringing the state’s death toll to 16. Meanwhile, the ACT recorded its second coronavirus-related death, a man in his 80s who had pre-existing health problems. The NSW deaths were all men, aged 61, 76, 80, and 91, NSW Health protection executive director Dr Jeremy McAnulty confirmed on Sunday. “Our condolences go to the family,” Mr McAnulty told reporters in Sydney. “That brings a total of 16 deaths in NSW.” In the 24 hours to 8pm, NSW recorded 87 new cases, bringing the state’s total to 2580, Health Minister Brad Hazzard told reporters on Sunday. Announcing two new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canberra, ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said the man’s death was proof of the danger posed to vulnerable and elderly people. “It is especially to protect these vulnerable groups that we all need to take the physical distancing measures we are implementing seriously,” she said. Dr Coleman said another two people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 since yesterday, bringing the total number of people in Canberra to have contracted the disease to 93. Of those cases, 18 people have recovered and 13 are in hospital. Earlier, it was announced a woman in her 70s has died in hospital from coronavirus in Victoria, bringing the state’s death toll from the illness to eight. State Health Minister Jenny Mikakos confirmed the death on Saturday. “Currently there are 42 people in hospital, this is up from 37 yesterday and ten patients in intensive care which is up from 7 yesterday,” Ms Mikakos said. There were an additional 30 cases of the virus since yesterday, bringing the total number of cases up to 1115. Of those 209 cases were recorded in regional Victoria, she said. It comes as some Victorians continue to flout coronavirus restrictions with police slapping 25 more people with fines across the state. In the past 24 hours police carried out more than 700 spot checks at homes, business and non-essential services. More than 390 of those checked were returned travellers and 99 of those recent arrivals were not at home when police turned up. “That’s incredibly disappointing, those individuals are putting their fellow Victorians at risk,” Ms Mikakos said on Saturday. She said people who had arrived from overseas last week were being quarantined at hotels. “For those people that returned prior to the start those changes they are still required to self-quarantine at home. No exceptions,” Officers have conducted more than 12,500 spot checks across the state since March 21. People have also been urged not to hoard masks if they are fit and healthy. “For well people leaving the house, masks are not necessary. If you are unwell, you should not be leaving the house, except to get medical assistance,” Deputy Chief Health Officer Annaliese Van Diemen said. That comes amid confirmation community transmission cases hit 73, up from 11 on Friday. The state’s team of “contract tracers” has grown to 1000 people which includes epidemiologists, nurses, administrative staff and public health professionals. Each time a new case of coronavirus is diagnosed, the team tries to determine if there is a link to other cases and notifies potential contacts. A community transmission happens when someone tests positive to the illness if they haven’t been overseas or have a connection to another positive case. Ms Mikakos urged people not to get complacent and follow the restrictions because a vaccine is not available. She noted a lot of young people returning from overseas had been diagnosed with coronavirus. Premier Daniel Andrews is expected to ramp up stage-three lockdown restrictions, which include no recreational fishing or golfing. Meanwhile, the state’s opposition called for protective services officers to be temporarily redeployed to help with the virus response. “PSOs shouldn’t be left babysitting empty train stations while police resources continue to be stretched across the state,” Opposition police spokesman David Southwick said. Three of the eight COVID-19 deaths in Victoria were patients at The Alfred Hospital, with about 100 staff sent home for isolation since last week. People can be fined $1652 if they leave home for non-essential reasons and businesses face a $9913 fine if caught doing the wrong thing. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Pink recovers from coronavirus, blasts government","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/pink-recovers-from-covid-19-blasts-government\/","transcript":"Superstar singer Pink has revealed she has tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the latest celebrity to face a battle with coronavirus amid the global pandemic.

Plant a vegie patch, learn a skill or musical instrument through online classes and courses, take an online Pilates or dance class. You can learn to do a lot of things by watching YouTube. But you can also go upmarket: learn guitar from Carlos Santana, film making from Ron Howard, interior design from Kelly Wearstler, tennis from Serena Williams, cooking from Thomas Keller, scientific thinking from Neil deGrasse Tyson, using Masterclass, an unlimited pass to its 80-plus classes is $280 a year.  Watch movies that transport you somewhere beautiful and exciting. The Trip, with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon eating their way around England, will make you hungry and make you laugh (follow-ups set in Italy and Spain are gorgeous to look at but lack the same zing). Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris is a love letter to the city. There are uplifting options like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and thought-provoking ones like Wild, and Into the Wild. Some make you laugh, like Sideways, set in California wine country. Revisit classics like Roman Holiday, with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, To Catch a Thief with Cary Grant (French Riviera). Other favourites: Out of Africa (Kenya), Amelie (Paris), comedy\/drama In Bruges, or any of Woody Allen’s adoring windows into New York life. And there are viscerally distracting thrillers like the James Bond movies (try Spectre’s Mexico City opening) or any of the Jason Bourne movies. There are plenty, too, free on the small screen, like the ABC’s long-running Doc Martin series, set in postcard-pretty Port Isaac, Cornwall. Now’s the time to invest in future trips by plotting your route, researching your destination and planning the perfect holiday. Most libraries are closed but have e-book lending to members. Lonely Planet’s excellent guides are available as e-books and e-chapters through its online shop. Several local bookstores are also home-delivering phone orders. Fact or fiction, reading about travel can be transporting, too. I’m going to catch up on some I’ve missed, perhaps Alex Garland’s The Beach, about a backpacker’s search for seaside perfection, and The Salt Path, about walking in Cornwall. Anything by Jan Morris, Bill Bryson or Eric Newby is worth reading. For romance, try Under the Tuscan Sun; for intrigue in North Africa, The Sheltering Sky; for friendship and fascinating history, The Island of Sea Women; for daydreaming, Peter Mayle’s books about Provence; for a compelling story and a visceral sense of nature, Where the Crawdads Sing.  @mrniland has just released The Whole Fish cookbook today. Josh and his amazing team at @saintpeterpaddo are reinventing what can be done with fish and making sure that we all realise that none of the fish should go to waste. The front of his book is covered in quotes like “Josh Niland is a genius” from @nigellalawson , “a mind-blowing masterpiece” from @jamieoliver and “Josh is pretty good and stuff” from @photopalmer .

The news comes as amid confirmation that four more people have contracted the virus in the NT and are now in the care of Royal Darwin Hospital, bringing the total to 26 confirmed cases as of Saturday. Like the ACT, Northern Territory remains community transmission free as all of its confirmed cases remain linked to interstate or overseas travel. A man in his 40s, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 50s became unwell while in self-quarantine after coming home from Africa, the UK and South America. The fourth case was a woman in her 20s who was in self quarantine and in close family contact with a person diagnosed with the virus after returning home from overseas. On Friday, Chief Minister Michael Gunner declared the Northern Territory the “safest place in Australia” as it had no deaths or reports of community transmission unlike the rest of the country. “The rest of the country is full of coronavirus hot spots, we are a safe haven and we are trying to stay that way,” he said. “I’ve made it as hard as possible for people to come here, we have said to the rest of the country: ‘We want you back one day, but for now you need to stay away, you are too dangerous’.” 04\/04\/2020 11:30am 🇦🇺 Total 5,523🔺165 🦠Active 4,875* Deaths 29🔺1 (VIC)* 🏥ICU-84 💚Recovered 648 🔹Tested-277,278 NSW-2,493🔺104 VIC-1,115🔺30* QLD-900🔺27 SA-396 WA-422 ACT-91 TAS-80 NT-26🔺4 — COVID19 Australia (@COVID_Australia) April 4, 2020  At that time, there were 2629 people legally required to be in 14 days of quarantine. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Supermarkets boost social distancing measures for Easter rush","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/supermarkets-social-distancing-easter\/","transcript":"Coles and Woolworths will reduce the number of customers permitted in their stores from Monday, in an effort to enforce social distancing. Shoppers will notice the new measures in the lead-up to the Easter weekend. “Traditionally, the Thursday in the lead up to Easter is one of our busiest times in-store. We ask our customers to pre-plan their Easter shopping to avoid the usual Thursday spike in numbers,” Woolworths managing director Claire Peters said on Saturday. How many customers are permitted inside Woolworths at any given time will be determined by the floor space of each individual store. Customers may be tallied at the entrance and asked to queue in the street, being allowed in as other shoppers finish buying and leave the store. The Woolworths store at Richmond in NSW has reportedly already limited access to just eight people at one time. Coles will implement its restricted access of customers with security guards and trained staff. Coles CEO Steven Cain says “team members will be at store entrances to provide assistance and let you know when it is OK to come in”. Customers are requested to “follow the directional signs around the store, pack your own bags at the checkout, scan your own flybuys card and use tap & go payment.” Trading hours will be extended to help with the implementation of the new measures. “Late evenings are typically less busy, so please consider visiting at this time if you prefer a quieter shopping period,” Mr Cain said.

The company’s medical officer Russell Brown yesterday told staff that, in addition to previously announced cases of baggage handlers, the airlines’ numbers included eight pilots and 19 cabin crew. “Most of those were from overseas, but they were taking the precautions,” Dr Brown said via a webinar. “They are wearing masks when flying and being careful, and we’re still seeing these cases. “When you’re dealing with a community that has more spread, the risk goes up, and we have to start thinking about what’s going on here.” It is understood the cases have been distributed throughout the entire Qantas Group — which also includes Jetstar. In a statement, Qantas medical director Ian Hosegood said there was no evidence passengers had caught the virus from infected staff — but could not rule that out. “In most of these cases, the employees have contracted the coronavirus while overseas including staff who were on holidays,” Dr Hosegood said. “There’s been no confirmed cases of transmission of the coronavirus to employees or customers on board our aircraft, or any aircraft globally for that matter. Whilst this transmission is possible, current evidence suggests it’s unlikely. “We have put in place increased measures to protect our people while they are at work and our customers including enhanced cleaning at airports and on aircraft and providing necessary safety equipment.” All of the infected staff members are undertaking 14 days’ quarantine. It comes as the cluster of coronavirus cases at Adelaide Airport continues to grow, with management confirming a security worker who carries out public duties has COVID-19. Adelaide Airport management said it was now working with SNP Security and SA Health. The latest positive case comes after 12 Qantas baggage handlers also tested positive, while seven family members have been infected through close contact. SA Health has advised anyone with COVID-19 symptoms who has been to the airport including the car park in the past fortnight to self-isolate and get tested. On Tuesday, Qantas cancelled seven Adelaide flights, including one that was turned back to Sydney mid-air. South Australia’s chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said SA Health had also made recommendations about the baggage handling area. “Our department’s worked with Qantas overnight to give advice about having a really deep clean of that area,” she said on Wednesday. Dr Spurrier said the risk of contracting the virus from luggage was “extremely low” but advised passengers to wipe down their baggage as a precaution. “There’s absolutely no harm in giving your suitcase a wipe particularly around the handle,” she said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus pandemic is 'humanity's darkest hour': IMF","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/coronavirus-pandemic-is-humanitys-darkest-hour-imf\/","transcript":"The coronavirus pandemic has ground the global economy to a standstill and plunged the world into a recession that will be “way worse” than the global financial crisis a decade ago, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. The IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, speaking at a rare joint news conference with the leader of the World Health Organisation, called the pandemic “humanity’s darkest hour” while lobbying advanced economies to step up their efforts to help emerging markets and developing countries survive the economic and health impact of the pandemic. “This is a crisis like no other,” she told some 400 reporters on a video conference call. “We have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis” of 2008-2009. World Bank President David Malpass echoed her outlook in a post on LinkedIn, writing, “Beyond the health impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are expecting a major global recession.” More than one million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and more than 53,000 have died, a Reuters tally showed on Friday. Ms Georgieva said the IMF was working with the World Bank and WHO to advance their call for China and other official bilateral creditors to suspend debt collections from the poorest countries for at least a year until the pandemic subsides. She said China had engaged “constructively” on the issue, and the IMF would work on a specific proposal in coming weeks with the Paris Club of creditor nations, the Group of 20 major economies and the World Bank for review at the annual Spring Meetings, which will be held online in about two weeks. In his posting, Mr Malpass said a debt standstill could begin on May 1, providing added liquidity for the poorest countries as they battle the disease. During the suspension period, he said, the World Bank and the IMF could evaluate the sustainability of those countries’ debt and the possible need for a debt reduction by official creditors and commercial creditors. Emerging markets and developing economies have been hard hit by the crisis, Ms Georgieva said, noting that nearly $US90 billion ($A150 billion) in investments had already flowed out of emerging markets, far more than during the financial crisis. Some countries are also suffering from sharp drops in commodity prices. More than 90 countries – nearly half the IMF’s 189 members – have asked for emergency funding from the IMF to respond to the pandemic, she said. The IMF and WHO have called for emergency aid to be used mainly to strengthen health systems, pay doctors and nurses, and buy protective gear. Ms Georgieva said the IMF stood ready to use as much of its “war chest” of $US1 trillion ($A1.66 trillion) in financing capability as needed. .@KGeorgieva to policymakers: Prioritize health expenditures. Use money to pay doctors and nurses, make sure there are makeshift clinics where necessary.

She said central banks and finance ministers had already taken unprecedented steps to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and stabilise markets, but more work was needed to keep liquidity flowing, especially to emerging markets. To that end, the IMF’s board in coming days would review a proposal to create a new short-term liquidity line to help provide funds to countries facing problems. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Sailors cheer sacked US navy captain who sounded alarm on coronavirus | The New Daily","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/sailors-cheer-sacked-us-navy-captain-who-sounded-alarm-on-coronavirus\/","transcript":"US defence leaders are standing firm on the Navy’s decision to fire a ship captain who sought help for his cornonavirus-stricken aircraft carrier, even as videos showed sailors cheering him as he walked off the vessel. Videos went viral on social media Friday (local time), showing hundreds of sailors gathered on the ship chanting and applauding Navy Captain Brett Crozier as he walked down the ramp, turned, saluted, waved and got into a waiting car. Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors. pic.twitter.com\/AkGFdlYjwt — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 3, 2020  Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly abruptly fired Mr Crozier on Thursday, saying the commander created a panic by widely distributing a memo detailing the escalating virus outbreak on his ship and pleading his leadership for help. Mr Modly said Mr Crozier “demonstrated extremely poor judgment” in the middle of a crisis. The ship is docked in Guam, and so far 137 of the nearly 5,000 sailors on board have tested positive for the virus. The Navy has said as many as 3,000 will be taken off the ship and quarantined by Friday evening (local time) to stem the spread of the virus. Crew members are needed to remain on the shop to maintain critical systems and protecting the carrier. On Friday (local time), Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said Defense Secretary Mark Esper supported Mr Modly’s decision to fire Mr Crozier from his command job. He said Mr Modly told Mr Esper he had lost confidence in the captain. And Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told FoxNews that he trusted Mr Modly’s judgement. He said it was a difficult decision, and that Mr Modly is accountable to the American people for it. Mr Crozier, in his memo, warned of a growing outbreak of the coronavirus on the ship and asked for permission to isolate the bulk of his crew members on shore, an extraordinary move to take a carrier out of duty in an effort to save lives. And he said that if commanders didn’t act quickly, they would be “failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset, our sailors.” Videos posted online showed sailors chanting Mr Crozier’s name and applauding him as he left the ship. A number of lawmakers have questioned the firing as too hasty a decision. Mr Hoffman said that 41 per cent of the sailors on the ship have been tested, and results are still coming in. He said no sailors are hospitalised. –with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Donald Trump says he won't wear face mask despite administration advice","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/donald-trump-says-he-wont-wear-a-face-mask-despite-his-administrations-advice\/","transcript":"President Donald Trump says his administration is encouraging many Americans to wear face masks in public, but he does not plan to do so himself. Speaking at a White House news conference on Friday (local time), Mr Trump stressed that the recommendations were not mandatory. “I don’t think I’m going to be doing it” he said as he announced the new guidance. Though some people already have begun sourcing or creating face masks on their own, the administration’s new guidance could test the market’s ability to accommodate a surge in demand. It was expected to be limited to people in areas of the country hit hard by the coronavirus, not nationwide, as some health experts had urged. The new guidelines, to be announced Friday (local time), will encourage people to use more rudimentary covering like T-shirts, bandannas and non-medical masks. And President Donald Trump himself suggested scarves could be an good alternative to masks. The new recommendations are set to be announced at a time when states are bracing for critical shortfalls like those that other parts of the world have experienced. They’re scrambling to stockpile all manners of equipment. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said he would use his authority to seize ventilators and protective gear from private hospitals and companies that aren’t using them. Mr Trump, who foreshadowed the coming guidance at a White House briefing on Thursday (local time), sought to minimise any burden by stressing the recommendations would not amount to requirements. Medical masks, particularly N95 respirators, are in short supply and are to be left for those on the front lines of fighting the spread of the infection. “If people wanted to use scarves – which they have, many people have them – they can. In many cases, the scarf is better, it’s thicker,” Mr Trump said. “Depending on the material, it’s thicker.” He said the recommendations would not be mandatory “because some people don’t want to do that” and that “people can pretty much decide for themselves right now.” The administration has said states should have done more to stockpile medical supplies, but it’s not clear if anyone is prepared for the rush that could ensue if everyone follows the White House guidance. In rural Florida, Okeechobee Discount Drugs has been sold out of face masks for almost two weeks, and “we don’t know where you can find any masks at this point,” said Stacey Nelson, one of the pharmacy’s owners. “It’s very hard to get these products, but people want them,” Ms Nelson said. “They’ve been getting mixed messages and people aren’t sure if they should be wearing masks in our daily lives. It’s very confusing. Wear them, or don’t wear them?” Even the less protective “earloop” masks are out of stock. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. In fashioning the recommendations, the administration appears to be striving to balance political concerns about states that have not been as affected by the coronavirus and wanting to preserve as much normalcy as possible with public health concerns that some infections are being spread by people who seem to be healthy and this could infect areas that so far have been mostly spared. Draft guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially envisioned the new recommendations would apply to all Americans, not just those in hot-spot areas. But federal officials limited the recommendations to places with high rates of community spread. The CDC is recommending that Americans consider wearing face masks in public settings, President Trump said Friday, though he added he is choosing not to do it.

For the hardest-hit areas, where social distancing has already been in place for some time, the White House coronavirus task force thought there would be less risk of people ignoring the other guidance if they covered their faces. Dr. Deborah Birx, the task force coordinator, said Thursday (local time) she was concerned that people would be lulled into a false sense of security by covering their face, and wouldn’t abide by the more critical and effective measures to slow the spread of the virus: staying six feet apart, frequently washing their hands and refraining from touching their faces. As with other public health guidance, the recommendation on face covering has been a moving target for the administration. Under the previous guidance, only the sick or those at high risk of complications from the respiratory illness were advised to wear masks. Surgeon General Jerome Adams wrote on Twitter at the end of February that people should “STOP BUYING MASKS” and said they were not effective in protecting the general public.

Here's why the city may never be the same again | The New Daily","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/coronavirus-has-seized-control-of-new-york-heres-why-the-city-may-never-be-the-same-again\/","transcript":"New York, of all places, should have seen it coming. The melting pot. The city that never sleeps. The concrete jungle where dreams are made manifest in structures of shiny metal. Say ‘New York’ and the mind conjures up crammed subway cars and swarming sidewalks, shared taxi rides and shoebox cafes. Eight million movers and shakers live in an area totalling 480 square kilometres. And 55 million more visit annually from faraway places, carrying faraway contagions. You don’t need a medical degree to see why the crown jewel of American cities is an infectious disease’s idea of Disneyland. At the time of writing, more than 51,810 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in New York City. More than 1,375 had died, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the 6,055 total deaths in the United States. Experts say it could be another three weeks until we see the peak toll. Journalists who committed to calling it the “coronavirus epicentre of the US” are now testing out “epicentre of the world”. A month after its first coronavirus casualty, New York is seeing clearly what it missed before — and watching the virus seize control over a place once defined by freedom. New York’s army of medical professionals knew right away they weren’t ready for the inevitable attack. More than 11,000 of the most critical patients crammed into hospitals that collectively, only contain 3,000 intensive care beds. Supplies dwindled so rapidly that doctors have had to ration treatment and make calls as to who should receive it. Three nurses themselves have died from a lack of protective equipment and nearly 200 are sick. Aline Reich is one of them. The paramedic from the Bronx tested positive for COVID-19 after weeks of seeing an uptick in cardiac arrest calls and now is quarantined at home with two young children, struggling to breathe. “We just have to be very close to patients to assess,” she said. “But we’re literally out of everything we should have to protect ourselves. We’re dropping our standards just to do what we need to do.” “Every day, our lives and our families’ lives are at risk. I hear a lot of people saying, ‘You signed up for this,’ but I don’t think we signed up for deciding who should live and who should die.” Ms Reich said she planned to resume working after two weeks without symptoms. In her 12 years as a medical professional, she has never seen a situation with so many unknowns. “We live in a place where we feel we can pass anything, but this is coming to get everyone,” she said. “This is not going to stop. Honestly, I’m scared.” Mayor Bill DeBlasio declared this Sunday (local time) to be “D-Day” because the city expected to run out of key supplies, including live-saving ventilators. Yet New York is only just now discovering the full extent of who needs saving. It was four weeks ago that Governor Andrew Cuomo first publicly called on the federal government to provide functioning test kits after the first ones came back inconclusive. With New York being the kind of place that takes matters into its own hands, the state swiftly authorised private labs to do testing and asked private companies to design and distribute 500,000 kits. The first batch only arrived this week. As of Wednesday (local time), New York state had tested 220,880 individuals, far more than any other place in the US. Some say that the relatively high testing rates inflate the sense that New York is far worse off than other US locations. Local authorities say they’re not trying to hide the reality, and in a city where space is a premium, they couldn’t even if they tried. Federal emergency teams began assembling tents for field hospitals in Central Park and converting old warehouses and conference centres into makeshift infirmaries. A 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship also arrived in the city this week, floating down the Hudson River like a beacon of hope as hundreds of onlookers broke social distancing guidelines to watch. Bob Cooley, a 21-year-old New York-based photographer, was one of those compelled to capture the boat’s arrival. He’d been tracking the ship online for the three weeks it took to gather a crew and sail over. When it finally swept into the bay, he stood on a pier near the Statue of Liberty and tried to keep his distance from 30 strangers. But even standing three metres away from the crowd, it was impossible not to feel a sense of solidarity that has been absent since the pandemic’s onset. “Initially it was just a boat that was coming in,” Mr Cooley said. “But then you saw the medical professionals actually on the boat, standing in a row across the top. That’s when everyone started cheering and waving and applauding. “It was the first time I’d seen people breaking the silence of social distancing … there was this sense of human connection that we needed.” But two days after the USNS Comfort docked, reports emerged that it wouldn’t be accepting coronavirus patients. In fact, only 20 non-COVID patients have been admitted for care thanks to the same bureaucratic measures that led to New York’s shortage of supplies and space in the first place. The US Navy says the 49 rules around patient admittance are unlikely to change. For now, the mighty ship still sways in the harbour, cavernously empty, a spectre of the hope it used to be. Elsewhere in the city, the prevailing symbols of the crisis were grim from the start. A new fixture throughout the city is the presence of “mobile morgues” — refrigerator trucks stationed outside hospitals to store corpses. Alix Monteleone can see one below her third-floor apartment in Brooklyn. She and her fiance first noticed it a week ago, and realised its purpose when they overheard a nurse say, ‘Yo, there’s mad bodies in there’. At first, the truck was totally exposed, and her view was crystal clear. The hospital has since constructed fences and awnings to give the dead a bit more privacy, but Ms Monteleone can still hear the electric hum of refrigeration and the clatter of construction crews building shelves. “If we’re seeing this chaos outside the hospital, my heart breaks for what must be happening inside,” she said. Those 45 morgues can hold 3,600 bodies collectively. Eighty-five additional trucks are being sent to the city this week because the death toll is expected to exceed 16,000. Ms Monteleone has already noticed another truck added to the liminal space below her window. The shock of it all is starting to fade. “My fiance has lived in this apartment for seven years. For New York standards, it’s very large. The rent is right. We have so many windows, which was a blessing up until now,” she said. “The prospect of moving is just not on the horizon … This is just a reality we’re having to adjust to.” Ms Monteleone is just one of many who are surprised by the speed at which the city has been turned upside down It wasn’t even three weeks ago that New Yorkers were ignoring early guidance and kept doing what they do best — getting from point A to point C. On the weekend of March 14, hordes of New Yorkers were still bar-hopping, brunching and buzzing through their daily routines with such dedication that one writer chose the blunt phrase, “gathering in groups right now is selfish,” as a headline. Early data comparing New York to San Francisco suggests that the five-day lag in declaring shelter-in-place orders led to 15 times the number of infections. Many of the same New Yorkers who defied those early warnings may now lose the income to support the social lifestyle they had before. The city is yet to release its latest unemployment numbers, but a website used to file claims across the state saw a 900 per cent increase in traffic over a five-day period at the end of March. It caused the site to crash and lead to a subsequent 16,000 per cent rise in phone calls to the department’s hotline. The governor ordered a 90-day moratorium on evictions because an estimated 40 per cent of city residents won’t be able to pay rent this month. Andrea Brown, who moved to Williamsburg from Sydney about 10 months ago, is one of those residents who’s negotiating with her landlord this week after seeing a pay cut. “We don’t want to leave, but we don’t want to be paying this rate for the next six months with my new salary,” she said. “We pay $US4,100 ($6,841) per month [for a one-bedroom] … it’s a big financial burden in terms of being able to save for, say, a flight back to Australia if need be.” Others assessed the situation and decided it was indeed time to leave the city, taking the threat of the virus to other parts of the country or the world, without promising to return. As the most densely populated city in America, New York may have been uniquely vulnerable to coronavirus, but there was nothing unique about the way it met the threat. It’s merely a microcosm of America’s overall response to the virus. “Other states should be looking to us because we’re the canary in the coal mine,” Mr Cuomo said solemnly this week. “This is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. “This spreads like fire through dry grass with a wind behind it … You will see this move across the country. New York is just first.” We are all vulnerable to this virus. I couldn’t protect my little brother. He couldn’t protect himself. And it’s scary. I’m worried about him just as we are all worried about the people we love. I love you, little brother. Stay strong. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) April 1, 2020  This week, the US shifted its attention away from the navy ship and the mobile morgues to watch New Orleans surface as a rising hotspot. Then it was Chicago. The rise of cases in Detroit, Michigan has authorities particularly worried because they’re paired with economic stagnation. But the same could be said for the numbers in Florida, with nearly a quarter of the population over 60 years of age. Texas is looking shaky. New Jersey is getting bad. And Wyoming is the only state not to have a fatality. New York may have been caught off guard as the first, but it knows now it won’t be the last, and that knowledge weighs heavy on its mind. The city that thinks it’s the greatest in the world wants you to know there’s no guarantee it’ll be exceptional on this one. As one resident put it, “Right now, we’re all neighbours.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Researchers find common head lice drug kills coronavirus","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/coronavirus-head-lice-drug-ivermectin\/","transcript":"An common drug used to treat parasites like headlice has been found to kill COVID-19 in the lab within 48 hours. A Monash University-led study has shown a single dose of the drug Ivermectin could stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus growing in cell culture. “We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA (effectively removed all genetic material of the virus) by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,” Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute’s Dr Kylie Wagstaff said . While it’s not known how Ivermectin works on the virus the drug, which is already safely used in humans to treat parasites like head lice, River Blindness, and scabies, likely stops the virus dampening the host cells’ ability to clear it. The next step is for scientists to determine the correct human dosage, to make sure the level used in vitro is safe for humans. “In times when we’re having a global pandemic and there isn’t an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner,” Dr Wagstaff said. “Realistically it’s going to be a while before a vaccine is broadly available.” Before Ivermectin can be used to combat coronavirus, funding is needed to get it to pre-clinical testing and clinical trials. Ivermectin is an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug also shown to be effective in vitro against viruses including HIV, dengue and influenza. The study is the joint work of Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and the Peter Doherty Institute of Infection and Immunity.

New York City has mere days to prepare for the worst of the novel coronavirus onslaught, the city’s mayor Bill de Blasio says. De Blasio pleaded for federal government help to end a shortage of medical staff and ventilators. The city has suffered more than a quarter of US deaths in the outbreak. “I think somehow in Washington, there’s an assumption (that) there’s weeks to prepare,” de Blasio said on MSNBC on Friday. “There’s not weeks anymore. It is days now.” New York state recorded 2935 fatalities over 24 hours, up from 2373 a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday. It was the highest single increase in the number of deaths since counting began. The September 11 attacks killed nearly 3000 people, the majority of them at New York City’s World Trade Centre. De Blasio is asking for 1000 nurses, 150 doctors and 300 respiratory therapists as the number of COVID-19 cases in the city is expected to rise sharply next week. New York City has yet to receive a resupply for the up to 3000 ventilators needed by next week, de Blasio said, urging US President Donald Trump to mobilise medical personnel from the US military. “They are not mobilised for action,” de Blasio, a Democrat, told WNYC radio. “The president has to give that order right now.” Trump is a Republican. More than 25 per cent of the 6058 US coronavirus deaths tallied by Johns Hopkins University as of Friday morning were in New York City. Infections in the US totalling 240,000 account for about 24 per cent of the more than one million cases worldwide. “We all know New York is bad but we know the worst is yet to come,” said Naila Shereen, an internal medicine specialist who rotates through various hospitals in New York. New statistics on Friday confirmed that hundreds of thousands of Americans had lost their jobs because of the pandemic. However economists say the real figure is far more than that because huge swathes of the US economy began shutting down last month to avoid spreading the virus. US employers cut 701,000 jobs last month, ending a record 113 straight months of employment growth, the Labor Department said. In the last two weeks, nearly 10 million workers have filed for jobless benefits. “What we are watching in real time is the greatest bloodletting in the American labour market since the Great Depression,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in Austin, Texas. Anthony Fauci, a doctor and leading member of Trump’s coronavirus task force, said social distancing is beginning to work even though the US is still far from over the worst."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW Health knew about sick Ruby Princess passengers","date":"04-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/04\/coronavirus-ruby-princess-emails\/","transcript":"Authorities knew about sick patients on board the Ruby Princess but declared the ship “low risk” before letting passengers disperse across the country, it has been revealed. While defending its decision to approve disembarkation, NSW Health  has admitted it knew of 104 cases of acute respiratory infections on the cruise but determined this “fell short of the definition of an ‘outbreak’.” Despite the number of sick on board, NSW Health approved the release of some 2700 passengers from Australia and overseas without undertaking coronavirus testing or enforcing quarantine. The Ruby Princess has since became the nation’s biggest source of COVID-19, leading to seven deaths across the country, with 342 infections in NSW alone linked to the cruise. NSW Health’s admission follows media reports exposing emails from the ship’s physician who warned the department about two unwell passengers in isolation who had been swabbed and tested negative for the flu. Nine News reported on Friday that the ship’s doctor was told by NSW Health that the Ruby Princess did not require on board medical assistance but asked for the swabs to be tested for COVID-19. The Australian also reports on Saturday that the ship sought the department’s advice on how to proceed with guests and whether the swabs would be processed for coronavirus. The government responded that an on-board assessment was not needed and the passengers were “free to disembark tomorrow”. Responding to the media reports, NSW Health released a statement defending its assessment of the ship as “low risk”, citing the fact that many of the passengers had been confirmed to have the common flu. Testing for COVID-19 had also been undertaken when the ship was in New Zealand before it arrived in Sydney, the department said. NSW Health also confirmed that the ship’s doctor had been treating two sick passengers for influenza, despite both of them testing negative for flu. “The risk assessment process…balanced the level of risk against the benefit of removing passengers from a cruise ship on which the virus could be circulating,” NSW Health said a statement. “The Ruby Princess was assessed as low risk, based on the level of illness on board, the negative COVID-19 tests done on passengers while in New Zealand, and the positive influenza tests done on a large proportion of the passengers with influenza-like illness. “The ship reported to NSW Health there were 104 acute respiratory infections of which 36 people had presented to the ship’s clinic with influenza like illness during the cruise and its numbers fell short of the definition of an ‘outbreak’.” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller will lead an investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship fiasco. Cruise ships have become a major source of infection in NSW with more than 470 cases linked to several vessels, including 351 cases from the Ruby Princess and 84 from the Ovation of the Seas. Australia’s coronavirus infections rose to more than 5330 on Saturday, with 28 deaths as the global tally exceeded one million cases of COVID-19. Overseas Australians will be able to access regular flights home from London, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Auckland for the next four weeks, Foreign Minister Marise Payne says. Qantas and Virgin Australia will operate the services, which have been organised after talks with the federal government. “Many Australians will be able to get to one of these four destinations. They can do so knowing there will be an Australian airline to get them home,” Senator Payne said in a statement on Friday night. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said the month-long window would allow Australians to get home as soon as possible, while also providing freight capacity to exporters and importers. He indicated the government had helped fund the services on top of the $1 billion support package already announced for the industry. But it’s unclear whether the increase in flights will make it any cheaper for stranded travellers and expatriates to get home amid skyrocketing long haul flight prices in recent weeks. The cheapest one-way flight from London to Sydney in the next month is $1000 and involves stopovers in Poland, India and Singapore, according to Google Flights. The cheapest direct one-way flight from LA to Sydney in the next month is $1479 on May 3. The British government announced a STG75 million ($A153 million) package to help its own nationals return to the UK earlier this week. Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said airlines should offer alternative flights “at little or no cost where routes have been cancelled” and allow passengers to change tickets between carriers at no additional cost, the BBC reported. Senator Payne indicated the federal government could potentially fund charter flights to pick up Australians who are unable to access the four airports, particularly those stranded in South America and the Pacific Islands. “We recognise that, in some cases, this will not be possible. We will continue to work closely with airlines and our overseas consular assistance network in these situations,” she said. “Where there are no commercial options available, the Government will consider supporting, on a case-by-case basis, non-scheduled services to other overseas destinations. “We are continuing our constructive discussions with Qantas and Virgin on flights to less accessible destinations, including South America and the Pacific.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Why developing a COVID-19 vaccine takes so long","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/04\/03\/vaccine-developnent-why-so-long\/","transcript":"You’ve probably heard that some COVID-19 patients are being treated with experimental drugs, with researchers reporting qualified success. Most of these treatments are being given to people who are critically ill or healthcare workers on the frontline. As these antiviral compounds prove their efficacy, they’ll be used more widely, and the severity of symptoms in many cases will be reduced. The hope also is that the death rate will drop. This is good news, but it’s not the pathway to liberation from life under siege. For that we need a vaccine. There are already reportedly 41 early-stage candidates being investigated across the globe. The CSIRO made world news this week by fast-tracking pre-clinical testing of two potential vaccines. This means they are testing the drugs on animals, in this case ferrets, because ferrets seem to acquire the coronavirus in much the same way that humans do. As reported in The New Daily, it would have ordinarily taken the CSIRO one to two years to get their research this far. They did it in eight weeks. Results of those pre-clinical tests might be available as early as June. The next step would be Phase One clinical tests, which means trialling the drugs on a small group of courageous volunteers. To learn what Phase One subjects go through see here. Last month, US researchers skipped the pre-clinical stage and went straight to Phase One testing on humans, reflecting the urgency of bringing an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company behind this speedy trial, Moderna Therapeutics, hopes to have an early version of their vaccine ready by the northern autumn, which is September. The plan is to make an early version of the vaccine  available to healthcare workers. No, we’re not. For a new vaccine to be made available to the general population (that is, to land on your pharmacy shelf) can take up to 20 years. The world obviously can’t stay in lockdown for that long, and scientists are already breaking speed records to set us free. But even if they have the magic elixir already in hand, it will take at least a year to 18 months before we can all start getting jabbed. Because that’s how long it will take to conduct sufficient testing. But why? The drug thalidomide was developed in the 1950s by a West German pharmaceutical company. It was an anticonvulsive drug, but was marketed to pregnant women as a safe sedative and as a treatment for morning sickness. Indeed, it was deemed so safe that it was sold over the counter, no prescription required in many countries. However, the drug caused about 10,000 babies worldwide to be born with severely malformed limbs. The linked wasn’t revealed until 1962. How could it ever have been determined safe in the first place? Testing was limited, and confidence in the drug as a safe compound leaned heavily on the fact that it was nearly impossible to suffer a lethal overdose. However, the preclinical tests of the drug failed to investigate what would happen to an animal during pregnancy. The catastrophe led to a change in how drugs were tested. In 1955, a batch of polio vaccine had not been fully inactivated and still contained live virus. More than 250 fatal cases of polio were attributed to this mistake, along with several deaths, with the faulty batch traced back to a company called Clutter Laboratories. Thus it became known as the Clutter Incident. The vaccine was recalled as soon as cases of polio was detected. Vaccinations were suspended, but resumed later that same year and polio was eventually all but eradicated. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes , “The Cutter Incident as a defining moment in the history of vaccine development and manufacturing, and of government oversight, leading to the creation of a better system of regulating vaccines.” While the Australian Academy of Science says the incident illustrates “the importance of strict routine testing,” it also notes that “No such events have been reported since.” As with any clinical drug testing, vaccine development usually begins with pre-clinical tests in the laboratory on animal models. If a vaccine candidate is found to be unsafe in animals, the work is abandoned and the researchers go back to the drawing board. If it passes the pre-clinical trial, three phases of human testing begins. Phase III usually takes a number of years, and seeks to demonstrate that the vaccine works and its safety is rock solid. It’s during this phase that unusual side effects show up. The rate that those side effects occur will determine whether or not the vaccine goes to market. In the case of COVID-19, Phase II trials will probably involve healthcare workers on the front line. And because there are many thousands of them around the world, and we are relying on them to stay healthy for the sake of our own survival, Phase III will presumably happen a lot quicker than it normally does. Still, it will take some months of waiting to see if potentially trial-wrecking side effects show up. Only then will a vaccine be approved for widespread community use. Even then, safety surveillance will continue. As the Australian Academy of Science explains on its website: “The value of ongoing safety testing of licensed vaccines is demonstrated by the successful identification of potential clinical problems. “The most recent example is the detection of an increased risk of febrile seizures that unexpectedly occurred in young children given a particular influenza vaccine in Australia in 2010. “When the problem first became apparent, the use of all influenza vaccines in young children was suspended to allow time for authorities to identify the one type of vaccine preparation causing the problem. “Meanwhile, influenza vaccines shown not to be associated with unacceptable rates of febrile seizures were reintroduced to ensure that protection against influenza remained available for children at high risk of complications from the disease.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"How to shop safely during the time of coronavirus","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/03\/shopping-safely-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Shopping for essentials is one of the few reasons deemed acceptable for leaving our homes under coronavirus social-distancing rules. But with tens of thousands of people visiting supermarkets and shopping centres every day, these locations could potentially become virus hotspots. It’s important we shop safely to reduce our chances of getting sick. The coronavirus’s secret weapon is that it can survive for several days outside the human body. That can of beans you just picked up? If an infected shopper sneezed into their hand before picking up that same can and putting it back a day earlier, there is a chance you could contract the virus – especially if you touched your face straight after. Going to the supermarket requires you to touch surfaces shared by other people, whether it be shopping trolleys, baskets or the touch screen at self-serve checkouts. Although supermarket staff members are endeavouring to clean and sanitise everything, it is wise to take extra precautions. If you’re feeling unwell, do not go shopping. Ask someone else to do it for you. Whatever you do, do not touch your face while shopping. That is how the virus spreads. Don’t hang around at the supermarket, Bunnings or K-mart – wherever you are shopping. Before you go, write a shopping list, do a quick blitz then head home. Practise social distancing by keeping the length of a shopping trolley between you and the person ahead of you. If you usually drive to the shops, it’s a good idea to rub your hands with sanitiser before touching the steering wheel. Once you arrive home, wash your hands straight away. Masks and gloves are not being recommended for shopping, in line with health department advice. The coronavirus is a respiratory virus, not food borne, so you don’t need to worry too much about eating fresh fruit and vegetables but it is wise to wash them with water first anyway. Supermarkets are encouraging shoppers to pack their own groceries and to pay via tap-and-go instead of cash to help limit transmission."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus lockdown: When can we go back to our normal lives?","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-lockdown-how-long\/","transcript":"For the past three weeks, Australia has been slowly closing down. Our sporting fields are empty, pubs are shut and cafes relegated to takeaways. Almost every day there are massive new restrictions on our lives, on how much we can move around, and who we can see. The restrictions are necessary to stop the spread of the deadly new coronavirus. On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians should get ready for six months of lockdown. “We are now in a place where we are seeking to put the pressure down on [infections] but that does not exclude us from considering additional measures,” Mr Morrison said.  “It could be longer. We pray it’s shorter. But a six-month period should give people a good indication of what Australians have to prepare for.” Some modelling shows we will reach a peak in June and others indicate we will need to stay socially distant for 18 months until a vaccine is developed. Essentially, there is no answer, said Bill Bowtell, a strategic health policy adviser and Adjunct Professor at the University of New South Wales. “This virus only obeys the laws of physics, chemistry and biology. It does not obey the Prime Minister or the Police Commissioner, or me, or you, or anyone else,” Professor Bowtell, who helped lead Australia’s response to the AIDS crisis, told The New Daily. “It is absurd to say that any arbitrary deadline created by any officials has any basis in the facts of the problem. “We ought to have shut down two weeks ago when New Zealand did. The consequence of not doing that is that we are going to drag and drag this thing out.” He said the pandemic would not be a “three-act play with a happy ending” and that the government’s response means we will be in the throes of the virus for quite some time. “It was perfectly obvious from January what needed to be done. The governments failed completely to prepare themselves for what was coming,” he said. “Their failure to stockpile test kits and medical gear, and communicate what was needed to the public. They didn’t shut down travel until February. “In our failure to act, we let this thing run. That was the policy, that was the approach. The virus isn’t an act of God, it isn’t unprecedented. “It was precedented. It was really predictable.” Australians need to understand the only thing they can do now is to try and slow the spread – and brace for change, he said. “A pompous declaration of a deadline only confuses matters for the public. The only thing we can do is make the job of the virus as hard as possible for as long as possible,” he said. “This is a new reality. That world two weeks ago is gone. “How we work, how we travel, how we have sex, how we eat, how we entertain ourselves, how kids are educated, everything. It’s all going to change.” Professor Emeritus Gerry Fitzgerald, a public health expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said we have three options. “Option A, is we squash domestic transmission,” said Professor Fitzgerald, who was previously Chief Health Officer for Queensland. “We get it down to a position where cases are just those coming back from overseas, who we have rigid control over and are monitoring closely. “If we can get to that stage, where for the past five days, all new cases have only been among people coming in from overseas, we might have the confidence to open up domestic things.’’ “Option B is that it keeps puttering around. We get a new cluster breaking here and there. “You get a cluster breaking and someone from that cluster goes somewhere else and starts a new one. That’s the flatten-the-curve option, where we’re going to have to manage it by keeping the numbers under control so our health system can cope.” We already know what option C looks like, and we don’t want to go there, he said. “Option C is that it gets out of control. We’re Italy or America, or Spain or France, where there is sustained and widespread community transmission,” he said. “In which case, we probably experience several months until we get it back under control. More people will die under this option.” University of Melbourne epidemiologist Kathryn Snow said pinpointing when we will be able to hug a friend again or host a dinner party is impossible. And we likely won’t have a one-size-fits-all approach for every state and territory. “It does seem like the federal government is encouraging people to be consistent across the nation, but there’s also a recognition that each state and territory has different needs,” Dr Snow said. “It will probably be quite different in different places. In Sydney they’re seeing more cases in community transition. “So the peak in Sydney will probably happen at a different time, and it might be higher. It depends on a lot of different factors.” The aim of the current game is to try and stop it overloading our health system before a vaccine is developed. A process that could take 18 months. One thing we can be certain of is that it will not end with a bang, but most likely a whimper, she said. “It won’t be like throwing a switch and everything is OK all at once,” she said. “I think they’re worried every measure will be in place for 18 months until we have a vaccine. “If we aren’t seeing any of those frightening scenarios, and the numbers are looking OK, we will probably see some restrictions start to relax. “For a while we’ll probably have some measures in place, like travel restrictions, and bans on really large events, but some of the smaller things could be relaxed. “It’s about monitoring the situation.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Real estate industry under fire for ‘outrageous’ super advice","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/property\/2020\/04\/03\/rent-coronavirus-superannuation\/","transcript":"Labor leader Anthony Albanese has taken aim at unscrupulous real estate agents for telling struggling households to use their super to pay rent. The comments come after emails were sent by several high-profile real estate institutions, including Buxton Real Estate, to tenants around the country. The emails encouraged those struggling to make their regular rent payments to consider taking money out of their superannuation through government’s controversial early access scheme. But in a strong rebuke to the real estate industry, Mr Albanese said workers who have lost income because of the pandemic “shouldn’t be told to dip into their super just to pay the rent”. Mr Albanese called on government to strengthen its recently announced ban on evictions to better protect families affected by the coronavirus’ fallout. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has vowed to introduce a mandatory code of conduct for commercial landlords but there is no indication that a residential code will follow. On Friday morning, corporate regulator ASIC warned the real estate industry, advising the emails in question may constitute a breach of law. In a letter sent to a number of real estate institutions, ASIC executive director of financial service enforcement Tim Mullaly said telling renters to access their super is akin to unlicensed financial advice. “Financial advice must only be provided by qualified and licensed financial advisers, or financial counsellors,” he said. “Not by real estate agents who neither hold the requisite licence, nor are an authorised representative of an Australian Financial Services Licensee.” Businesses caught giving unlicensed financial advice could potentially be fined $1260 million, while individuals face five years’ imprisonment and fines up to $126,000. Real Estate Institute of Australia president Adrian Kelly said Labor’s remarks were “cheap political point scoring” but acknowledged some real estate agencies “need to try harder”. ” I agree that estate agents providing financial advice to tenants is clearly illegal and the REIA doesn’t condone it,” Mr Kelly said. “For the Labor Party to come out today slinging mud at our industry when they know full well that the vast majority of us are doing the best we can under very trying circumstances is irresponsible.” A spokesperson for the REIA confirmed to The New Daily the email sent by its members did not originate from the association. Chris Martin, senior research fellow at University of NSW’s City Future’s told The New Daily renters were rightfully angry with the real estate industry’s response. “This group, that is rental property owners, as a group are high income,” Dr Martin said. According to Dr Martin, the average annual income for landlord households is $130,000, a full two-thirds more than non-landlord households’ average of $80,000. Retired landlords are often even more well off, Dr Martin added, noting the one in six landlords who are over 65 have an average wealth of $3 million each. “To say that while the rest of the community suffers a massive hit to income, that their incomes have to be maintained, including by running down the superannuation wealth of lower households, is outrageous,” he said. “The idea that they have any special claim or priority on getting their income ahead of other people that have had their income smashed is appalling greed.” Anglicare Australia chief executive Kasy Chambers however told The New Daily some smaller landlords do rely on this money, and a compromise will need to be made. “You probably wouldn’t want people dipping into their super for this, but nor would you want some of those private landlords to take a hit either,” Ms Chambers said. “We’ve developed this situation by structuring ourselves around private investment for the housing sector and walked away from public and social housing to a certain degree, and now it’s coming home to roost.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus politics: Parliament is in hibernation. But should it be?","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-politics-parliament-hibernation\/","transcript":"One of the hot topics being debated by many politically engaged Australians right now is whether the national parliament should be sitting during the COVID-19 restrictions. Parliament is not ‘in session’ at the moment because it was temporarily closed down last month, or as PM Scott Morrison likes to say ‘put into hibernation’, and will not resume for normal business operations until August. It will however meet briefly next week to pass the laws needed to deliver the latest commitments made by the government to help individuals and businesses with cash payments and other financial support until the worst of the pandemic has passed. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Labor opposition is among the dissident voices, which also include academics and former judges, calling for Parliament to resume its originally planned sittings in May and June. These voices argue the Parliament must continue to operate so that it can ensure the government is held to account for its unprecedented spending, and also undergo scrutiny for other matters, such as its involvement in the Ruby Princess debacle. At face value, this seems an eminently sensible suggestion, as long as MPs could abide by social distancing rules by participating online. According to one of Australia’s most respected constitutional lawyers, Professor Anne Twomey, there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent a virtual session of Parliament being conducted online. There was a Royal Commission into pink bats when 4 people died because of shonky operators. Will there be a Royal Commission into #RubyPrincess Death toll so far 4 and counting. — Donna..an unquiet Australian. (@simpsubhswf) March 31, 2020 But the question has to be asked – is this the best use of our elected representatives’ time over the next few months? Do we want ministers (and the public servants who work for them) spending hours preparing for Question Time each day? Or do we want them devoting that time to best supporting the Australian community through the pandemic? Similarly, do we want opposition MPs spending hours each day strategising on the best way to get a nightly news grab with a Question Time zinger, or should they be spending that time working with their constituents to identify what could be improved in the government’s new COVID-19 support systems? If your answer to these questions is, “They should do both”, that might be a fair response when it comes to the Opposition’s shadow ministers, who don’t have a ‘day’ job like ministers. But for the actual government, every hour spent dealing with the theatrics of parliament is an hour that could have been spent on identifying, developing or implementing life-saving measures. For let’s face it, question time these days is big on theatrics and little on scrutiny. Between the Opposition’s search for the perfect gotcha and the government’s determination not to answer the question, Australian democracy is not losing anything by the lack of question time until August. What’s more, there are other, more effective ways of getting the Parliament to scrutinise the government without extra sitting days in May and June. According to Professor Twomey, the committees established by the Parliament for exactly this purpose, such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which examines government expenditure, can and should continue to perform their important scrutiny functions while parliament is not sitting. These committees are permitted to operate by phone or online. Does this mean Labor’s calls for Parliament to resume are not really about scrutiny, but about providing a larger platform from which the government’s critics can deliver their counter messages? The Morrison government is not the only Australian government to have closed  its parliament to concentrate on the combined health and economic challenges created by the virus. The NSW Parliament will not sit again until September. However the state’s Upper House (the equivalent of the Senate in the Australian Parliament) has established a special committee of oversight to scrutinise the NSW government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, which will sit regularly during the parliamentary break until September. As we observed during the Global Financial Crisis, and have seen several times since, even governments with the best of intentions can get it wrong when making and implementing decisions during times of serious emergency. Right now, we’ve entrusted our health, wellbeing, economic viability and civil liberties to a government that hasn’t always proven to have the best of intentions. In this sense, advocates are right to call for greater government scrutiny and accountability. However, if scrutiny of the Morrison government is really what Labor and other advocates calling for the return of Parliament are after, they should redirect their efforts to using the existing parliamentary committees to do so. Otherwise the complaints look like calls for just another opportunity to grandstand, which is also something that Australian democracy doesn’t need right now."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Garry Linnell sets out to calm our coronavirus fears ... sort of","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-garry-linnell-questions\/","transcript":"Time to get positive, the editor of The New Daily said. There’s a lot of scared and confused people out there. Why not answer their questions and give them the facts – and some hope? Sure thing, boss, I said. Always happy to help out. So here goes. The ultimate advice column to help you get through the coronavirus pandemic. I miss working in the office. I miss the camaraderie, the gossip and the interaction. I’m finding it hard at home to concentrate on the work in front of me. It’s even harder to find inspiration. Any suggestions? – Mike, Brisbane. Not really, Mike. You’re clearly one of those office workers the rest of us detest. Workplaces are filled with annoying “team members” like yourself who constantly require validation and attention. Your daily routine of interrupting others, sending grandstanding group emails and brown-nosing the boss are simply time-wasting techniques to disguise your lack of creativity. When the world returns to some sort of normality I doubt your company will be able to afford to carry passengers like yourself. But let’s be positive. Why not consider a new career? If sitting around an office stating the obvious and riding on the back of other people’s ideas are your chief qualities, become a consultant. This lack of sport is driving me crazy. I’m tired of watching replays when I already know the result. I’m desperate to see some live action. Any recommendations? – George, Sydney. A little imagination, George. Please. If you want fearless tackling, brilliant interceptions and bruising collisions – all in high definition – wander down the toilet paper aisle of your local supermarket. When your usual grocery shopping @woolworths turns into a toilet paper fight in the supermarket aisle. Yikes. #toiletpaperpanic for the #coronavirus has taken a whole new level. pic.twitter.com\/aKJ283I20C — Adella Beaini (@adellabeaini) March 7, 2020 My children are at home and spending more time than ever online. How can I keep them safe without restricting their screen time? –Madeleine, Wollongong. Great question. I’ve installed blocking software in our place that seems to be doing the trick. In the past three days we haven’t receive a single notification from anyone saying “We’re All In This Together” or “We Will Emerge Stronger, Kinder and Better.” The software has also blocked those awful videos of celebrities humming Imagine and spouting world peace from the balcony of their Beverly Hills mansions. Never forget how important it is to keep kids away from predatory types spreading cliched slogans and  insincere messages of hope. The world is a very sick place at the moment and your children need to deal with it. I’m worried about my ageing parents. I’m not allowed to visit them and I’m concerned they are going to struggle without any help. – Georgia, Maroubra. Is this a joke question, Georgia? Are these the same parents who have banged on throughout your life about how they had it much tougher back in their day? Are these the very same parents who sneered about the younger generation and how soft it has become? These self-righteous elderly snobs should be setting an example for the rest of us, not cowering in their little retirement villages pleading for grocery deliveries and crying because they can’t see their little grandkids. Pathetic. Don’t worry about your parents, Georgia. If they could walk barefoot to school every morning for ten miles and eat mouldy bread for lunch then surely they can boil a packet of instant noodles. It has been inspiring watching people on their balconies in Italy and Spain singing to one another and lifting each other’s spirits. Can we start something similar here? Perhaps we could all go into our backyards at a certain time and sing I Still Call Australia Home. – Isabella, Brisbane. Certainly not. You sound feverish, Isabella. Please get tested immediately. The only song Australians ever manage to sing in unison is Cold Chisel’s Khe Sanh – and only at midnight when they are drunk at a barbecue. I’m a very tactile person. I need the warmth of human touch. Not only are these self-distancing rules confusing, they are making my life miserable. How much longer will they be in place? – Kirk, Fremantle. Hopefully for a very long time in your case, Kirk. The majority of us have always regarded “touchy” people like yourself as a little on the creepy side. Ever seen those idiots in shopping malls carrying “Free Hugs” signs? Ever noticed how they all have bad haircuts and pull their pants up all the way to their armpits? As I said. Creepy. Self-distancing rules should remain long after the pandemic is over to keep people like you away. Toilet paper is obviously hard to get. Any thoughts on how to make it last longer? – Carlos, Mildura. Call me a tightwad. Call me budget-conscious. My family certainly does. But here’s what I do. Take a roll of 3-ply toilet paper and very methodically separate the sheets to create three rolls of 1-ply paper. Of course, you need to be careful when using it. But as I’ve told my wife, the experience allows you to stay in touch with your inner self. More of your questions next week. And remember. Look after one other by remaining completely out of touch.

The first thing to remember is not to panic. As difficult as it may be, keeping a clear head will allow you to sensibly review the options at your disposal and find the best path to a solution. “Do a crash budget,” said Murray Wilkinson, a financial planner with Future Gen Solutions. “Say ‘this is the minimum I need to spend, here’s what the outgoings are, here is the income and this is the shortfall’.” The government has put in place the following measures to help Australians who have already fallen on tough times. If you are on income support or lose your job in the coming months, you will be eligible for this supplement. This measure will kick in on April 27 and effectively doubles the nation’s unemployment benefit by delivering eligible beneficiaries an extra $550 a fortnight. That would bring the total benefit payment to $2230 a month for a single person currently on the JobSeeker payment.  The government will also make a one-off $750 payment to all pensioners and beneficiaries as well as concession card holders sometime between the end of March and April 17. That will be matched by a further $750 payment to the same group of people from July 13. Neither the stimulus cash or the supplement will be taxable or taken into account in benefit income tests. However, the second payment will not be paid to individuals who receive the coronavirus supplement. If you are a sole trader or work for a company that is hit hard by the crisis – or get stood down or your hours reduced – you could be entitled to $1500 a fortnight from the government. The measure covers full and part-time workers, and casuals who have worked for their employer for at least the previous 12 months. However, workers are only eligible if they were on their employer’s books on March 1. The JobKeeper payment works like this. If your employer has revenues of under $1 billion and loses 30 per cent of its business as a result of the crisis in a single month after March 1, then it can apply for a fortnightly wage subsidy of $1500 for every eligible employee. If it has more than $1 billion in revenue, then it has to lose at least 50 per cent of its business to be eligible for the scheme. If you earn more than $1500 a fortnight then there is no difference to your pay if you keep working during the crisis. The money will go to your boss to subsidise your salary. But if you earn less than that – or are stood down or have your hours cut because of the coronavirus – then you will get paid the full $1500 a fortnight. This means some workers – especially part-timers – will receive a pay rise under the measure. Either way, it is designed to help your boss keep you employed. Workers cannot, however, claim both JobSeeker and JobKeeper. The former is for people who lose their jobs and are not re-hired, the latter is for stood-down workers who hold onto their jobs. Self-employed people will have to apply themselves to get the JobKeeper payment. Employers will receive this payment from the first week of May, but your boss can take a temporary hit and start paying you immediately. Superannuation is put away for your retirement but during the crisis the government will allow people who have struck hard times to access up to $20,000 from their fund in two instalments by September 24, 2020. To be eligible you must be unemployed, made redundant or had your working hours cut by 20 per cent or more. Application is made through the MyGov website and sole traders can also apply if they lost at least 20 per cent of their income because of the virus. The first $10,000 can be accessed before July 1; the second, between July 1 and September 24. David Simon, principal with Integral Private Wealth, cautioned people to think twice about dipping into their super, though. “You are taking out money after values have fallen so you are eroding your balance more than you would have three months ago,” he said.  If you have your super in different allocations including growth, fixed-interest and cash, “you should make the withdrawal from the cash allocation,” Mr Simon said. If your fund allows it, you could also move the whole $20,000 from a balanced option and put it into cash, so you don’t damage your fund if there are further sharemarket falls between now and September 24, before the second $10,000 withdrawal must be made. “Many mortgages today have an offset facility where you can draw down on the capital,” Mr Wilkinson said. “Check with the bank on what you can draw down, because this is extra capital you have. “Also check your insurance. If you have income protection insurance, either inside or outside your super, ask for a waiver on the premium which you can often get for six months. That keeps the insurance in place without you paying premiums.” Most banks have also offered six-month mortgage holidays for home owners suffering financial hardship. So, if you are under financial pressure, call your bank or head to their website to find out what assistance they can offer. It’s worth noting here, too, that many energy providers are also providing payment relief."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus disruption unleashes left-field rivals on supermarkets | The New Daily Coronacirus unleashes left-field rivals on supermarkets","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-mcdonalds-coles-woolworths\/","transcript":"Businesses are scrambling to adapt to a swiftly changing retail market – and it’s one where only the strong will survive, experts say. The usually resilient supermarkets are facing attacks on many fronts: staff are being diagnosed with the coronavirus, supply chain disruptions are showing in empty shelves, and now they’ve got more competition than ever. McDonalds this week announced it would be swinging its global power into the grocery department, selling essentials – dairy and bakery products – through its drive-through services, alongside its takeaway food menu. It’s a powerful weapon to bring into the arena, Deakin University marketing lecturer Michael Callaghan told The New Daily this week. Dr Callaghan said he wouldn’t be surprised if Macca’s started making use of its delivery service to get these essentials out to customers, too. The company’s brand is firmly embedded in Australia’s consumer habits – and with dining-in now closed, it now has plenty of unused space inside its restaurants to capitalise on these essentials deliveries. It’s got unique relationships with suppliers that could enable it to source milk at a wholesale price and established deals with large-scale bakeries, creating a formidable foe for Coles and Woolworths, not to mention smaller players like IGA and Aldi, Dr Callaghan said. “People may just change their shopping habits,” he said. I'm skeptical.  \"I don’t think many people will be asking for milk and English muffins with their Happy Meals at the Drive Thru…\" However,  there are many other businesses truly adapting and innovating.@QUT @QUT_AMPR @TheTodayShow @9NewsAUS#coronavirus https:\/\/t.co\/qXoBbwfU8B — Professor Gary Mortimer 🛒🛒🛒 (@ProfRetail) April 2, 2020 Australia’s retail landscape wasn’t sitting pretty before the coronavirus pandemic hit our shores, but its arrival has forced the hand of businesses that were teetering between success and failure. Many have chosen to use the outbreak as a sign to pack it in, opting to close doors definitely or indefinitely, Queensland University of Technology associate professor Gary Mortimer said. Then there are others who are choosing to harness innovation as a way of keeping their (virtual) doors open. “It’s very much like human behaviour, in a period of uncertainty or risk, it’s fight or flight,” Professor Mortimer told The New Daily. “Some have closed doors and said, ‘It’s too hard’. “Others are choosing to innovate and asking, ‘How can I collaborate?’.” Today I bought a gift for a family member and within 2 hours of ordering it online from a favourite local small retail shop, they personally delivered it, gift wrapped, for free to my doorstep, with a bonus discount code too. This is why we must keep supporting small businesses. — Eloise Keating (@ellykeating) April 3, 2020 It’s going to be about making their business model outlast consumer innovation, too. Professor Mortimer used gyms as an example of an industry that could struggle to get back on its feet even after the coronavirus passes. If people have worked out how they can stay healthy for four to five months at home without going to the gym, they might not renew that $40-a-month membership, he said. Both Professor Mortimer and Dr Callaghan agreed a post-coronavirus world could look very different to what we’re used to. Big companies that usually hold dominance over consumers are struggling to be able to flex quickly enough to adapt to changing regulations and requests, while independence is freedom. Whereas the traditional corner stores were trampled when big-name supermarkets moved in, Dr Callaghan said, sole traders are now enjoying the freedom to establish their own partnerships with neighbouring small businesses, the goal being to innovate and meet customer demands. “It’s getting to the point where the sole trader can service the community better than a supermarket,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus provides even more cause to quit smoking","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-is-more-cause-to-quit-smoking\/","transcript":"If ever there was a time to butt out, it’s now.

That means people who smoke need to extra cautious right now, Quit Victoria director Dr Sarah White says. “Please don’t share cigarettes, water pipes or e-cigarettes and be very aware that the hand-to-mouth action of smoking and vaping means you are frequently bringing your hands into close contact with your face,” she said on Friday. “Practising good hand hygiene is a must.” She said now was a “good time to make a quit attempt”. “You can make self-isolation and your friends and family around you – physically or online – work for you,” Dr White said, adding people can call the Quitline on 13 7848 for help. Quitline has experienced a slight increase in callers wanting to quit, with almost 100 per cent of them telling counsellors they were worried about COVID-19.

He hailed the country’s “promising” trajectory of confirmed cases – which hit 5274 on Friday afternoon. “Had the virus kept growing at the same rate it was 12 days ago, we would now have more than 10,500 cases in this country,” Mr Morrison said after a national cabinet meeting in Canberra on Friday. “There would be difference of 5000 more cases, over 5000 more cases.” He said the lower-than-forecast numbers were a tribute to Australians’ support of social distancing and other strict regulations imposed by state and territory governments. Also on Friday, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the formation of a state “crisis council” to fight the pandemic. “These are not ordinary times and business as usual will not get the job done,” he said. “This is an unprecedented crisis, something none of us have experienced in our lifetime, so today we have established, and the governor has sworn in, a crisis council of cabinet.” The council is made up of Mr Andrews and seven Victorian cabinet ministers. They will coordinated the government response to the virus “to make sure we are nimble, agile”. “Business as usual will not get this done. Government has to change, public service has to change and that is exactly what we are seeing from this swearing-in today,” Mr Andrews said. Also on Friday, Australia’s toll from COVID-19 rose to 28 with four deaths: A man and woman in NSW, another man in Victoria, and a foreign tourist from the Artania cruise ship who died in Perth. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world topped 1 million on Friday. But chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the real total could be up to 10 million – with the difference reflecting the gaps some countries’ ability to test for the virus. “The only numbers I have total faith in are the Australian numbers, frankly, because we have the highest testing rate in the world,” he said. Professor Murphy said positive tests were still being recorded in travellers returning to Australia. “But those numbers are reducing. We still have cruise ship people to come home. We still have a lot of issues with people who have contracted the virus from overseas. But we are in control of those issues,” he said. Of greatest concern were clusters of community transmission of the virus – more than 300 in Sydney, about 60 cases in Melbourne and 30 in Brisbane.  Mr Morrison also warned there was no guarantee the trend towards a slower increase in infections would continue. “Patience must become the virtue of Australians over the next six months, at the very least,” he said. “It could be longer. We pray it’s shorter. “But there are no guarantees, I want to express. This virus writes its own rules.” It came as Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the state was months away from a peak in COVID-19 infections. “We haven’t even started to climb the curve. We are about two or three weeks behind NSW and the peak could be in July, August, September,” she told ABC radio on Friday. “We will continue to see increases of cases.” Ms Palaszczuk said the timing of Queensland’s peak would depend largely on infection suppression efforts, including social isolation and the border shutdown. Elsewhere, Victorians were urged to aim for a quiet time at home during the state’s first weekend in full stage-three lockdowns. Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton said fishing, hunting, boating, camping, and golf were all banned under the stringent regulations. “Hang up your rods, leave the tinnie in the driveway, and clean your clubs at home,” Professor Sutton said on Thursday . “No round of golf or gym session with your mate is worth that cost.” Urging Victorians to stop looking for loopholes in the coronavirus restrictions, Professor Sutton advised people to stay home and save lives. “These restrictions are tough, but they are there for a reason. If we don’t do this, Victorians will die,” he said. Exercise is still considered one of the four reasons why leaving home is allowed, along with buying food and supplies, medical care or working and studying. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Former Sydney teacher Chris Dawson pleads not guilty to murdering wife","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/crime-news\/2020\/04\/03\/chris-dawson-pleads-not-guilty\/","transcript":"Former Sydney teacher Chris Dawson has pleaded not guilty to his wife Lynette’s murder in the Supreme Court.

The case was extensively examined in the popular Teacher’s Pet podcast produced by The Australian, which was taken offline to prevent prejudicing legal proceedings. In February, the former Newtown Jets rugby league player faced a four-day committal hearing where four witnesses gave evidence in court that they saw Ms Dawson after she vanished. One of the witnesses was Mr Dawson’s brother-in-law, Ross Hutcheon, who said he saw Ms Dawson at a bus stop near a hospital in Gladesville about three-to-six months after she went missing. Mr Hutcheon said he reported the sighting to a pair of police officers who visited him in 1999. The other witnesses included neighbours Jill Breese and her husband Peter, who claimed they saw her working as a nurse in a private hospital and contacted police after seeing a missing person article in 1988 or 1988.

Captain Brett Crozier, the commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, wrote to his superiors saying that sailors’ lives were at risk. “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” he wrote in a letter published by American media. News of Captain Crozier’s removal came after a US defence official told CNN that 114 sailors on the carrier had been confirmed to have the coronavirus. That represents more than 10 per cent of all cases across the US military. But the outbreak on the ship is escalating rapidly. Last week the Pentagon confirmed three sailors on board had tested positive. Two days later that number had risen to 25, while it rose to 70 on Tuesday and had topped 100 by Thursday. The military did not accuse Captain Crozier of leaking the letter but Michael Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said it was distributed “broadly”. Pentagon officials confirmed Captain Crozier was being relieved of his duty. They said he had gone outside the chain of command and speculated he might have been overwhelmed by the situation. “I just know that he exercised extremely poor judgment,” acting US Navy secretary Thomas Modly said. Mr Modly called Captain Crozier’s note, which reportedly went to up to 30 people and was published in the San Francisco Chronicle, “a blast-out email to everyone he knows”. “Decisive action is required,” Captain Crozier wrote. “Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure. This is a necessary risk.” The USS Theodore Roosevelt is now in port at Guam. About 1000 sailors have been evacuated from the aircraft carrier and are in quarantine in hotels on the Pacific Island. However, officials have continued to downplay the severity of the situation, saying the coronavirus cases on board were mild. Admiral Gilday said the ship could not be entirely evacuated because some crew was needed to perform essential tasks such as operating its nuclear reactor. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus music: From dustbowl songs to alien anthems","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/music\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-music-rob-hirst\/","transcript":"Rob Hirst is a man of many faces while Grimes is out of this world like a Musk rocket, and Ry Cooder’s 1972 classic is a record for these times.

The one constant in his work is a ‘Beatlesesque’ touch on the melodies and a willingness to try new sounds and unexpected arrangements. Best known as Midnight Oil’s drummer, who have two recording projects coming up, Hirst has an insatiable need to make music from blues to German electronic psychedelic rock. His singing has improved through all this road work; he has a warmth and suppleness to the vocals that’s hard to get past. In fact, the Jimmy Webb-ish Pearl Shell Buttons is among the very best work he has ever done. The track is featured on this album, recorded and written with long-lost daughter Jay O’Shea. A standout gem amongst 11 mature, captivating modern pop songs.  Driver Reviver Sean Sennett & Rob Hirst Maturity isn’t a KPI for Sennett and Hirst who have been banging away with versions of garage rock for a few years now.

And although we might be tempted to take the easy option and put a bestseller in their hands, it is important booksellers give this request the thoughtfulness it deserves. A “really good read” does not maketh the ideal book club book. But a novel that has layered characters, clear themes, provokes debate, takes readers out of their comfort zone, and displays terrific writing certainly will create vigorous discussion. One day soon we will write a list of some of the proven book club hits of the past five  years. For now, here are three new ones we think might soon become word-of-mouth favourites: American Dirt Jeanine Cummins Sections of America’s literati flew into a collective rage when Oprah Winfrey declared a few weeks ago that  “everything about this book was so extraordinary. It’s suspenseful, the language is beautiful, and the story really opened my heart”. The anguish was led by Latino writers who felt Cummins’ American background did not qualify her to write a novel about a Mexican mother and son’s flight to the US border in search of a new life. Claims of cultural appropriation grew louder, and have continued even after Oprah hosted a TV discussion between the author and a handful of her critics. We urge your book club to read it and then you be the judges. Hamnet Maggie O’Farrell This much-awaited work by Irish-born writer Maggie O’Farrell arrived in our shop on Thursday, and although our doors are temporarily closed, we feel certain our internet and phone orders will run hot when the word gets around that Maggie’s back. O’Farrell has a big following in Australia; The Hand That First Held Mine (2010) and Instructions For A Heatwave (2013) remain popular among local book clubs. In this new novel, she presents a fictional account of how William Shakespeare’s play Hamlet came into being. Fans of historic fiction will especially enjoy this one. Sheerwater Leah Swann Just as Lionel Shriver’s 2003 bestseller We Need To Talk About Kevin made for uncomfortable reading and provocative book club chat, Sheerwater will take readers to some dark and murky places. Betterreading.com.au describes this book as “an extraordinary literary debut; the writing is beautifully evocative and the intertwining narratives of the main characters seamless’’. Ava’s plan to start a new life in seaside Victoria after escaping an abusive marriage is crushed when the children disappear. This is a devastating story, and an important mirror on the contemporary world in which we live. Book clubs particularly enjoy those kinds of challenges.

The impact of COVID-19’s spread has come into stark relief in the past fortnight, as economies across the globe sink toward severe recessions and businesses shut down. In the US, which now has a nearly a quarter of the world’s coronavirus cases, last week’s figure is much higher than the previous record of 3.3 million – which was reported in the previous week. And the jobless claims are expected to keep rising as most Americans are under some form of lockdown so cannot get to work even if there place of employment is still operating. As a result, economists say more stimulus is needed. The mounting lay-offs have led economists to contemplate the possibility of as many as 20 million lost jobs by the end of April. The ongoing turmoil provided the backdrop to another volatile trading session on Wall Street. Stocks surged despite the huge rise in jobless claims because oil prices jumped by one third on hopes of a deal to end a damaging price war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2 per cent or 470 points to 21,413. The S&P 500 put on 2.3 per cent or 56 points to 2,527 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq increased 1.7 per cent to 7,487. The rises come after US President Donald Trump said he had brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia to reduce oil production by 10 to 15 million barrels of oil a day. …..Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2020  Saudi Arabia had called for an emergency meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, state news agency SPA said on Thursday (local time). The unemployment rate in the US could spike to as high as 15 per cent in April, topping the previous record of 10.8 per cent set during a deep recession in 1982.

Around 9000 ventilators are on hold by FEMA, the agency tasked with coordinating the federal response to the outbreak, with states having to effectively make a case for allocation. The combination of scarce supply and high need has sent many states onto the open market, where they are bidding for ventilators from private manufacturers, competing against both the federal government and other states. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the pandemic in the United States, warned Thursday that New York would run out of ventilators in six days at the current rate. FEMA has sent 4,400 ventilators to New York, where officials have said they are likely to need 20,000 to 40,000 during the crisis. In Louisiana, where coronavirus cases are skyrocketing, Governor John Bel Edwards has requested 14,000 ventilators from the federal government and private companies. To date, the state has received just 442, including 150 that arrived Wednesday from the national stockpile. 4 million N95 respirators, 1.8 million surgical masks, 460,000 face shields, 1.4 million gloves, and 4,400 ventilators have been sent to New York. pic.twitter.com\/LdNcIJytOJ — The White House (@WhiteHouse) April 2, 2020  FEMA spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow said states should not expect any shipments until they are within 72 hours of a crisis situation. Several states have hit that point. FEMA said Wednesday that it was sending machines from the national stockpile to Michigan, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut and Louisiana. Lawmakers have called repeatedly on the federal government to publicly account for how it is distributing ventilators and personal protective equipment but say they haven’t received answers. The Pentagon’s announcement two weeks ago that it had 2,000 ventilators available appeared good news. But much of that stockpile is earmarked for a pair of hospital ships and military field hospitals being deployed to take some of the patient load off other facilities. President Donald Trump has defended his administration’s deployment of ventilators and said the federal government is doing all it can. He has taken steps to compel General Motors to make more of the machines, though the company was already moving in that direction before the president’s order. He issued an order Thursday under the Defence Production Act aimed at ensuring manufacturers have the supplies to make the machines. GM said in a statement with Ventec on Friday that they expect to deliver the first ventilators next month and will initially produce more than 10,000 per month. Ford, in collaboration with GE Healthcare, said Tuesday that it expects to produce 50,000 of the ventilators within the next 100 days."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Passenger train was doing 100km\/h before fatal derailment: Report","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/04\/03\/train-derail-wallan-report\/","transcript":"A report into a fatal train derailment north of Melbourne in February has revealed the train was travelling at more than 100km\/h in a 15km\/h zone when it came off the tracks. But the preliminary report by the Australian Safety Transport Bureau said the direction of the rail tracks had been changed from their “normal position” earlier that day, which caused the train to leave the main track and enter a passing loop. The Sydney-to-Melbourne XPT service, which was carrying 153 passengers, derailed at Wallan shortly before 8pm on February 20. The report stated when the train reached Albury, it was about 85 minutes behind schedule. The train’s driver, 54-year-old John Kennedy of Canberra, and train pilot, Sam Meintanis, 49, of Castlemaine, were killed, and 39 passengers were injured. Mr Meintanis boarded the train a few stops from the crash site to help the driver navigate through a 24-kilometre section of track because signalling equipment was damaged. The report stated the tracks on both ends of the Wallan loop had been changed from their “normal position” to their “reverse position” earlier that day. “This change meant that rail traffic, in both directions, would be diverted from the Main Line [straight] into the loop track,” the report said. Information issued by the rail manager to the driver “reflected the change” and specified a 15km\/h speed limit to enter the loop and a limit of 35km\/h to exit. According to the report, the train was approaching the Wallan loop at 7.43pm at about the speed limit of the main track, which was 130km\/h. Recordings from the train revealed the driver applied an emergency brake shortly before the point where the track had been switched. “This slowed the train a small amount before it entered the turnout travelling at a speed in excess of 100km\/h,” the report said. “The train was not able to negotiate the turnout to the loop track at this speed and derailed.” The report revealed the front train car rolled onto its left side and the XPT driver and pilot sustained fatal injuries. Three passengers were seriously injured and 36 received minor injuries. Five members of the train crew, who were in the passenger cars, were also injured. The ATSB will continue its investigations into the crash looking at the track condition, the condition of the train and carriages. So far, the ATSB review had found there were no adverse track conditions that contributed to the derailment."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Stay safe': Tom Cruise's message to fans as Top Gun sequel goes on ice","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/movies\/2020\/04\/03\/tom-cruise-top-gun-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The long-awaited sequel to Top Gun is the latest movie to fall victim to the coronavirus outbreak. Star Tom Cruise has told fans the release of his follow-up to the 1986 classic has been pushed back six months. Paramount’s Top Gun: Maverick had been scheduled for release in the US on June 24, and Australia on June 25. On Friday morning (Australian time), Cruise told fans they’d have to wait a bit longer.  Cruise, 57, reprises his role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell in the now-delayed sequel. Another star from the 1986 original, Val Kilmer, also returns as Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, while Maverick also stars Jon Hamm, Lewis Pullman and Charles Parnell.  Top Gun is only the latest big cinema release to be delayed amid the worsening global coronavirus outbreak. Sony Pictures said on Monday the release of its comic book adventure Morbius, Ghostbusters: Afterlife would be delayed, along with a host of other upcoming flicks. The releases of Disney’s Black Widow, Universal’s Fast 9, and Warner Bros.’ Wonder Woman have also been put off.

The total number of cases is 873 since the outbreak began, up after 39 new cases were confirmed overnight. Four Queenslanders have died. “We haven’t even started to climb the curve. We are about two or three weeks behind NSW and the peak could be in July, August, September,” the Premier told ABC radio on Friday. “We will continue to see increases of cases.” More info on how we’re asking people to treat the rules around gatherings. #coronavirusaustralia pic.twitter.com\/PAJUeiInCI — Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) April 2, 2020  She said 80 to 85 per cent of cases were still linked to overseas travel as Queenslanders return home from high-risk countries. Queensland imposed even tighter border controls overnight, with unauthorised travellers being turned back at the state’s border with NSW. The Premier said 16 people had been turned around since midnight. Under the new rules Queenslanders are being let in, along with freight services. Everyone else is being refused entry unless they hold a government permit proving they are travelling for essential reasons, such as work or medical appointments. Water barriers and check points have been stepped up at Coolangatta, the Gold Coast’s southernmost suburb. And water barriers have been used to close off some streets to stop people trying to avoid checkpoints. There is also an increased police presence at the Brisbane airport. Non-residents who don’t have an entry permit will not be allowed to leave the airport, and will be returned to their point of origin on the next available flight. Australia has now recorded more than 5100 coronavirus cases, including 25 deaths. Social isolation should help limit the scale of the winter flu season but authorities are urging people get their shots now. “We don’t want an outbreak of flu at the same time we have an outbreak of COVID-19,” Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said on Friday. Dr Young said there was “very, very limited local transmission” of coronavirus in Queensland and the situation was nothing like the community transmission that was going on in NSW and Victoria. “We’re such a dispersed state … in this case it’s very very much an advantage,” she told reporters. “(It) means that we won’t see the peak of the impact of this virus across the whole state at the same time. We’ll be able to provide support within the state, wherever it’s needed.” Four additional jets have been put on stand-by to rapidly move people around the state should that be necessary. Health Minister Steven Miles expressed disgust at reports of Queensland Health workers being “vilified, threatened and treated abhorrently” when out in public in their uniforms. “They are heroes. They are are people who go to work every day to take care of us. So thank them, don’t yell at them,” he said. The Premier has warned of a tough six months ahead, as Queenslanders deal with rules that urge them not to leave their homes unless it’s truly necessary. But Ms Palaszczuk has pulled back slightly on the Prime Minister’s advice that households must limit visitors to just one non-resident at a time. “You can have two additional people to your house, and when you go outside you can only have two people,” Ms Palaszczuk said on Thursday. “Don’t have strangers to your house, so I think if everyone abides by those rules we’ll be okay.” The state is also closing most national parks, walking tracks and 4WD areas. The parks will be closed to the public, along with hiking tracks, picnic areas, camping areas, swimming holes and lookouts from Friday. –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Scott Morrison resists push for politicians to take a pay cut","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/politicians-pay-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Morrison government has rejected calls for politicians and public servants to take a pay cut as the country deals with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government has asked the Remuneration Tribunal to impose a 12-month pay freeze. But a cut is not being contemplated. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said salaries made up a tiny percentage of the federal budget. However, he would consider changes if necessary. “I know people are taking a hard hit every day in their businesses,” he told Sydney radio 2GB on Friday. “But I don’t think it’s actually helpful in a crisis to start having people turn on each other about who’s getting what.” Across Australia, many workers have agreed to take cuts of varying amounts during the COVID-19. Hundreds of thousands of others have lost their jobs. But Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said a pay cut for politicians and bureaucrats wouldn’t make much of a difference. “I think MPs and public servants are working very hard right now,” Senator Cormann told Sky News. “I’m not sure how this sort of suggestion would help – in the context of the budget challenge it’s essentially at the margin.” Liberal senator Eric Abetz, who froze politicians’ pay when he served former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2015, said a cut should be considered. “Without being prescriptive, the government will need to tighten its belts and consider its priorities,” he said. NSW Liberal MP Jason Falinski also said a pay cut would remain a live issue.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has written to real estate institutes in each state, saying it was aware some real estate agents were advising tenants who were unable to pay their rent, or who might find that in future, to consider applying for early release of their superannuation. Workers laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic have been told they might be allowed to access up to $20,000 in super savings over the next two years to help pay their bills. ASIC warned any property agent who advised renters to do that might be in breach of the Corporations Act and face a five-year prison term, a $126,000 fine, and a $1.26 million fine for their business. “Tenants facing financial difficulty need sound financial guidance and potentially debt counselling,” ASIC said on Friday “Specifically pointing them to and recommending them to consider the specific possibility of accessing superannuation is, again, likely to amount to a breach of the Act.” The ABC reported on Friday an incident where a tenant in Brisbane was told their ability to dip into their super would be noted on their rental history. The advice came in an email sent about half an hour after federal government announced a six-month moratorium on evictions. The New Daily revealed on Friday that agent Ray White Ascot Vale is one of those that has asked to tenants to say if they intend to apply for early access to their superannuation. ASIC said financial advice must be provided only by qualified and licensed financial advisers, or financial counsellors. It cannot be provided by real estate agents, who neither hold the requisite licence, nor are authorised representatives of an Australian Financial Services Licensee. The watchdog said it intended to monitor the situation closely and “will not hesitate to act swiftly to protect vulnerable consumers”. ASIC’s letter comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison last weekend announced a six-month moratorium on residential and commercial evictions as an increasing number of people find themselves without work due to coronavirus lockdown measures. On Tuesday, Mr Morrison urged landlords and tenants to work together to reach an agreement if the tenant could not pay rent due because of the economic fallout of the coronavirus. “They are going to need each other on the other side,” he said. “They are going to need each other – they are going to need the premises and the landlord is going to need the tenant.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Crack down on Chinese animal markets, says Scott Morrison","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/chinese-animal-markets\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there should be an international push to ban China’s wet markets where coronavirus may have spread to humans.

Mr Morrison said the markets were a real and significant problem. “From a world health point of view, I think this is something the World Health Organisation should do something about,” he told 2GB radio on Friday. He indicated Australia would take a strong stance through the United Nations in pushing China to ban wet markets. “We’ve got to be quite strident on these things in these forums and making sure that they’re dealing with what are quite serious health risks,” the Prime Minister said. –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Just weren't getting it': 16,000 Australians defied warnings not to travel","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-australia-travel-ban\/","transcript":"Thousands of Australians defied federal government warnings not to travel overseas as the deadly coronavirus outbreak worsened – leading to many now being stuck abroad or on emergency flights home. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was bewildered and frustrated by many of the 16,000 Australians who decided to head overseas despite the highest level of government advice not to. “How they actually think they’re going to get back now is going to be very difficult,” he told Sydney radio 2GB on Friday. “I don’t think they’ll find themselves high on the list.” With the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued “do not travel” advice for every country in the world on March 18. It also urged all Australians overseas to head home as soon as possible, warning the country’s borders were likely to close altogether. Even earlier, on March 10, DFAT had told Australians – particularly those with underlying health conditions – to reconsider cruise travel because of the coronavirus spread. Mr Morrison said travellers should have heeded the early advice. “If people behave like that, then we lose lives,” he said. “Honestly, I think it was still an indication that people just weren’t getting it.” Mr Morrison said there were some exceptions among the 16,000 for people who had travelled for aid and scientific work. Following the March 18 warning, the federal government closed Australia’s borders entirely on March 25. Days later, it required all returning travellers to spend their first 14 days back in Australia in enforced quarantine at hotels and other accommodation. There are now thousands of Australians in hotels across the country, monitored by police and Australian Defence Force personnel. Some have complained of the conditions, comparing them to prisons, Others, however, say they understand the arrangements are necessary. There are also hundreds of Australians stranded in countries such as Peru, under military-enforced lockdowns and curfews. A $5000-a-seat charter flight brought hundreds of Australians back from Peru earlier this week. Dozens were left behind because they could not get to the airport in Lima or had not bought tickets. Another flight brought Australian citizens and residents back from Nepal to Brisbane on Thursday. Still more are stuck on cruise ships in Europe, the US and India.

The food-service industry is a massive market for avocado growers, taking fruit that doesn’t make the premium grade sold in fruit shops and supermarkets. Wide Bay, Queensland, avocado farmer Lachlan Donovan said he was lucky he still had orders to fill through chain stores. “With lower-grade stuff it’s certainly not worth the money … processed product, like guacamole that went straight to different takeaway shops or retailers, that is a market that has collapsed.” “There’s probably going to be a reasonable amount of fruit that’ll get dumped.” Far North Queensland grower and Avocados Australia chairman Jim Kochi said the drop in prices had left growers “very apprehensive”. “Avocado growers are [feeling] the same as everyone at the moment,” he said. Australia’s avocado industry has boomed in recent years, last season producing more than 85,000 tonnes, 55 per cent of which were grown in Queensland. Traders at major wholesale markets in capital cities were caught by surprise when Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued a Sunday-night edict that all restaurants, cafes, hotels, pubs and clubs be shut to halt the spread of coronavirus.. The next morning, March 23, orders stopped for Phillip Bugeja, an avocado trader who usually spends Mondays filling orders from independent shops, country greengrocers and providores supplying Sydney’s busy cafes and restaurants. “I don’t think anyone saw this coming,” Mr Bugeja said. “No one saw it coming.” “It’s hard going and it’s going to get harder for a lot of people.” After a week in freefall, he said, the market settled slightly but he expected even premium-grade prices to continue slipping as the harvest continued across Queensland. Mr Bugeja said he was working with retailers on ideas to shift a greater volume of the fruit — including a suggestion to sell them by the kilogram instead of individually. “It may have a few rub marks on the skin but internally, between premium and class-one fruit, it’s all the same. It’s only the look of the fruit, that’s all it is,” Mr Bugeja said. “So it’s just more price driven. If you can sell for the right price, there’s more chance of them buying and hopefully, sooner than later, the food service will come back, not just for me, for everyone.” Avocados harvesting season soon switches from the green-skinned variety called Shepard to the smaller, black-skinned Hass. And growers don’t want consumers to steer clear of the fruit, just because their usual brunch spot is closed. “It’s prime time for avocados at this time, they’re tasting fantastic,” Mr Donovan said. “It’s that little luxury you can have at home, too.” To find the perfect avocado, Mr Kochi recommends shoppers buy while they’re still hard and let them ripen at home. “Keep it on your shelf in your kitchen for a day or two, until it starts to soften to your finger touch,” he said. Mr Donovan believes the poorer reputation of the Shepard variety compared to Hass is not deserved. “The Shepards are probably a lot more forgiving, even when they look bruised, they don’t brown off,” he said. “All you’re wanting to pick is a nice clean avocado. If you want to eat it tonight, just [choose one] a bit soft towards the stem.” And the best way to eat avocado? While everyone has their favourites, Mr Donovan said you can’t go wrong with a few slices of avocado with your steak for dinner. “I love avocado with steak instead of chips. Just avocados with everything.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Outback roadhouse flies beer and pizza to cattle stations in lockdown","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-outback-pizza\/","transcript":"When the Northern Territory’s strict coronavirus travel restrictions slowed passing trade to a trickle, a Top End roadhouse decided it was time to try something new. The Dunmarra Wayside Inn, 315 kilometres south of Katherine, is owned by pilot Gary Frost. Most of the surrounding cattle stations were now in lockdown – so he had little choice but to take to the skies to keep the locals in high spirits. “Nobody can go anywhere, they’re limited to how they get their supplies and refreshments,” Mr Frost said. “We thought we might do something to help them out a little bit. “We make pizzas at Dunmarra roadhouse anyway, so we thought we would get all the pizzas together and see if they were interested, if we can fly them out, so they don’t have to leave the properties.” Hot food and alcohol has already been delivered to stations within a 100 kilometre radius of the roadhouse, with plans to extend the once-a-week service to properties up to 400 kilometres away. With prices remaining the same as in-house orders, the idea has been well received. “We’ve been getting quite a good response actually – everybody is quite excited about it,” Mr Frost said. “Its something unique I suppose, I don’t know of anyone else who has ever done it probably in the world, as far as I could research. “I suppose the cost of it is prohibitive as a commercial venture, but we’re not doing it as a commercial venture. “We’re just doing it as a friendly gesture to try and help people out and create the right atmosphere.” The takeaway products, along with mailbags for the stations, are delivered in a fixed-wing plane, which has plenty of room for the extra cargo. Mr Frost said he was also willing to throw a few extra toilet rolls in the back, if needed. “As long as they don’t come loose in the back of the plane, that’s all right,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australians trapped on Florida cruise ships to end nightmare voyage","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-florida-cruise-ships\/","transcript":"Australians and more than 2000 other passengers and crew trapped on two cruise ships off the coast of Florida for fear they may spread the coronavirus will soon end their nightmare voyages. The holidaymakers on Holland America’s Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships have had their dream vacations destroyed with South American nations refusing to allow them to dock, four elderly passengers dying and others needing immediate critical care. At least two of the deaths were from COVID-19 while 97 passengers and 136 crew on both ships displayed “influenza-like symptoms”, the cruise company said. More than a hundred Australians are among those on board, with guests not leaving the ship since March 14 and having to self-isolate in their rooms since March 22. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis initially refused to allow the two ships to dock because he did not want sick passengers “dumped” in his state. The Republican governor changed his mind on Thursday after US President Donald Trump said the passengers should be treated better. “They’re dying on the ship,” Mr Trump said at Wednesday’s White House press conference. “I’m going to do what’s right, not only for us but for humanity.” The ships were expected to dock at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale on Thursday under strict protocols. Passengers fit for travel will be transferred “straight from the ship to flights for onward travel home, the majority on charter flights”. “Out of an abundance of caution, these guests will be transported in coaches that will be sanitised, with limited person-to-person contact and while wearing masks,” Holland America said in a statement. The Zaandam embarked on a South America cruise from Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and was originally scheduled to end in Chile on March 21. Attempts were made and denied to disembark guests in Chile on March 15 and in other ports along its route to the US. The Zaandam was allowed to sail through the Panama Canal into the Caribbean on Sunday. Passengers who passed a medical screening were moved onto sister ship, the Rotterdam. There were 808 guests and 583 crew on the Rotterdam and 442 guests and 603 crew on the Zaandam. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Global coronavirus infections top 1 million | The New Daily","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-1-million-infections\/","transcript":"Global coronavirus cases have topped one million as the pandemic explodes in the US and the death toll continues to climb in Italy and Spain, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The virus has killed more than 51,000 globally, with the largest number of deaths in Italy, followed by Spain and the US. The first 100,000 cases were reported in about 55 days and the first 500,000 in 76 days. Cases doubled to one million in the past eight days. Total cases reported by Thursday grew 10 per cent from a day earlier, the first time the rate has hit double digits since the virus took hold outside China. There are 117 countries and territories that have reported above 100 cases, 50 with outbreaks of more than 1000 and seven that have reported 50,000 or more COVID-19 cases, mainly in Europe. The global fatality rate is now above 5 per cent of all reported cases, with countries including Britain, the US and Spain reporting a spike in fatalities in recent days. About 22 per cent of total cases have been reported by the US, while Italy and Spain have each reported 11 per cent of global cases. China, where the virus emerged in December, has reported 8 per cent of total cases globally as the epicentre of the pandemic moved to Europe and the US. Europe together accounts for more than half of cases and more than 70 per cent of deaths linked to the virus, as countries in southern Europe with higher older age demographics have been hit particularly hard. The World Bank said it was prepared to spend up to $US160 billion ($262 billion ) in the next 15 months to combat the pandemic as it approved an initial sum in emergency money. The board of executive directors approved the first $US1.9 billion ($3.1 billion) for coronavirus response operations in 25 countries. The World Bank also said it was moving quickly on projects in 40 other countries, and was working to redeploy resources in existing World Bank financed projects. India, the third-largest economy in Asia, will receive $US1 billion ($A1.6 billion) to support better screening for the virus, contact tracing and laboratory diagnostics; pay for personal protective equipment; and set up new isolation wards for those infected. World Bank group president David Malpass said the bank was moving quickly to strengthen the ability of developing countries to respond to the fast-spreading virus. “The poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest, and our teams around the world remain focused on country-level and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis,” Mr Malpass said. The money approved on Thursday included $US200 million ($A328 million) for Pakistan, $US100 million ($164 million) for Afghanistan and $US82.6 million ($135.4 million) for Ethiopia, the bank said.

Hundreds of Australians who returned home after midnight on Saturday have been put up in capital city hotels, where they are being forced to wait out two weeks’ quarantine under tough coronavirus laws. Many are staying at four or five-star hotels like Crown Towers and Swissotel, but some say they are “being treated like criminals” and fear for their mental health. In Sydney, the manager of the Wentworth Avenue Travelodge received so many complaints that he issued an announcement on Wednesday urging travellers to show respect to hotel staff during their quarantine. “We are not prison wardens,” he told his guests. Most of those complaining are staying at hotels in Sydney, while other travellers in Melbourne are leaving positive reviews. Patrick Zippel, 28, had been living in the Swiss alpine town of Engelberg before flying home to be with family amid escalating border restrictions. He arrived at his Crown Towers hotel room on March 31, where he found two queen-size beds, a TV, an ensuite and a “nice view of Melbourne”. He said he had “no sympathy” for fellow travellers forced to undergo two weeks of quarantine in a hotel. “To those people who are complaining, saying ‘Oh we’re in a prison cell’, well you should be in the same situation if you were returning and going home anyway,” Mr Zippel said. “Coming from Europe, where the situation is more dire and harder measures are in place, my attitude is people aren’t taking it seriously here yet because they haven’t seen the direct consequences of (the coronavirus).” He said hotel staff were “bringing us more food than we can eat”, adding guests could buy alcohol or order from a separate menu if they preferred to pay for dishes from Crown restaurants. He said the only frustrating part was being unable to breathe fresh air and exercise outside. Families and friends are not allowed to deliver care packages to guests, either. Ben Michowski, 27, who has nine more days left of quarantine at Crown in Melbourne after returning from the United States, said he believed most of the complaints were unwarranted. “I could think of a thousand scenarios that could be worse,” Mr Michowski told The New Daily. “I think overall, the complaints aren’t that valid considering the whole globe needs to do their part to stop the spread of the virus. “To be taken care of in this way, when all you need to do is nothing, it’s not that big of an ask … I’m probably a bit more easygoing. Maybe they’re really rich and not used to it.” Recruiter Isabelle Campbell, 26, is five days into quarantine at Crown Towers after flying home from London. “It’s a really nice room with a massive view, but you can’t open the windows – that’s the worst part,” Ms Campbell said. “I think we’re lucky we ended up here. Other people have it way worse. “If I didn’t have a window or if it was a much smaller room, I’d probably get really claustrophobic and I’d be freaking out.” Security measures have ramped up dramatically at Melbourne Airport in the fight against COVID-19. Upon arrival, passengers were greeted by Australian Border Force officers and had their temperatures scanned by officials wearing hazmat suits, Mr Zippel said. Passengers were then given information leaflets, dietary requirement forms to fill out, and a lunchbox of food to eat during the 30-minute SkyBus journey to Crown casino in the CBD. “Everywhere we were, there were police making sure we didn’t leg it,” Mr Zippel said of his arrival in Melbourne. “When the SkyBus drove from the airport to Melbourne, we had a police car trailing us the whole way.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Confusion over Governments eviction moratorium leaves renters in lurch","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-renters-evictions\/","transcript":"Confusion over the government’s six-month ban on evictions has left tenants across the country worried they could be in trouble as the job market dries up. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for landlords and tenants to work together to reach an agreement if the tenant was unable to pay rent due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus. “I would urge landlords and tenants to work this out,” Mr Morrison said. “They are going to need each other on the other side. They are going to need each other — they are going to need the premises and the landlord is going to need the tenant.” But not everyone has that leverage. Taylah-Jane Patterson lives in Sydney with her partner, who has lost his job as a tyre fitter. She makes $17 an hour as a childcare cook and has lost 80 per cent of her shifts. The couple are both 22 and support her younger brother. They have lived in their Sydney house for 18 months and are meant to pay $600 a week in rent. “I know this is affecting everybody, but I’ve never done the wrong thing. We always pay rent on time. So I emailed, asking if there was any chance of getting it minimised,” she told The New Daily. Their landlord offered to reduce it to $420, but Ms Patterson says they won’t be able to afford even that. Her partner’s Centrelink Job Seeker claim won’t be processed for another month. The landlord’s counter offer included a clause that they wouldn’t ask for a reduction again. “[The landlord] hasn’t asked her bank if she can freeze the mortgage,” Ms Patterson said. “I know she would be under stress, we are all in this, but I can’t do any more. “Even with the $300 reduction we asked for, it’s going to be so hard to keep the household going.” In some cases, landlords are asking tenants to apply for early access to their superannuation. On its financial hardship application, agents Ray White Ascot Vale, asks tenants to answer if they intended to apply for early access to super. A spokesperson for Ray White said they had contacted the franchise and would be making sure the form was not sent out again. “We have specifically been instructing our offices not to issue financial advice and no form has been issued to our offices by us for use,” they said. “On the other hand, we are aware that some of the institutes have issued such a form, which is obviously confusing for our members.” In another case, Aleks Mothra has lost her job as a tattooist. She asked for extra time to pay her rent on her Melbourne house, where she lives with her 16-year-old daughter. She was also refused by her real estate agent. “I told her rent would be late. She said ‘No, I want it in full on the date. I don’t want the landlord to suffer due to your personal circumstances’.” Her lease ends in two months and she asked for an extension because she did not want to move during the pandemic. That was also refused. “I asked if I could extend. They said no you have to move out. They don’t want to negotiate.” Tenants in a share house at Northcote, who did not want to be named, also told The New Daily they had been refused a rent reduction after two tenants lost their jobs and the third had half their shifts cut. They have took the step of encouraging their landlord to ask the bank for a mortgage freeze. “We asked for a 50 per cent reduction but said it was negotiable, and we wanted to revisit it month to month. We don’t want to do a rent freeze. “Our landlord is still a person and has debt. It’s more an issue moving up the chain. The banks are the ones who need to give leeway and it’s becoming our job to push for that.” The national cabinet is expected to meet on Friday to discuss a rental relief package, but it is understood it will not include a rent freeze. Currently, Tasmania is the only state to pass laws prohibiting evictions for the next six months. For the moratorium to work, the industry needs more clarity from the government, said Leanne Pilkington, the president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW. “We just don’t know what the government is preparing to do,” Ms Pilkington said. “We’re really asking them to get a solution and clear message out, but we do understand the complexity of the situation.” The situation requires landlords and tenants to work together to find solutions. “I know some landlords have been fantastic, and some landlords just can’t. Their mortgage needs to be paid, or it’s what they use to put food on the table,” Ms Pilkington said. She said although it was difficult for everyone, tenants needed to realise they can’t get away with not paying rent. “What tenants need to understand, even though the Prime Minister has come out and said there’s a ban, that doesn’t mean they don’t have to pay rent. They still have an obligation,” Ms Pilkington said. “If the government finds a way to keep money flowing, that helps the tenants, and that helps the agent, which helps the landlord.” Some tenants in Victoria have been directed by their agents towards Launch Housing, a homelessness service. “We’ve fielded over 40 calls in the last four days from renters in distress,” Launch Housing chief executive Bevan Warner said. “That’s a large increase. We expect that will continue while the confusion lasts and peoples’ economic situations are fragile."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"European Union apologises to Italy for coronavirus response","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/03\/eu-apology-italy-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The European Commission has admitted to a “harmful” mistake that left  Italy struggling alone during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. EU president Ursula von der Leyen apologised to Italy for a lack of solidarity from Europe after conceding too many EU countries were tied up with their own problems and had forgotten that unity among nations was the only way through this crisis. “They did not realise that we can only defeat this pandemic together, as a union. This was harmful and could have been avoided,” she wrote in a letter published by the Italian daily La Repubblica on Friday (Australian time). She acknowledged the EU’s subsequent failure to provide swift help to Italy, particularly during the early stages of the outbreak. “Today Europe is rallying to Italy’s side,” Ms von der Leyen said. But that might be too little too late. In the past 24 hours, Italy has reported 760 more deaths from coronavirus, bringing the country’s total fatalities to 13,915. Meanwhile, the number of new cases of infection grew by 4668 to 115,242. There has been widespread dismay in Italy over Europe’s response to the pandemic, starting with an initial failure to send medical aid, followed by a refusal by northern nations to endorse joint bonds to mitigate the cost of recovery. The country’s far-right League party has jumped on the discontent to call into question Italy’s continued membership of the 27-nation bloc, while even staunch pro-Europeans have expressed consternation at the lack of empathy and support. Italy and eight other countries have previously requested that “recovery bonds” are issued on behalf of all eurozone countries to help pay for efforts to rebuild national economies that are expected to dive deep into recession. Conservative leaders in wealthy states such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria have so far recoiled at the idea of issuing bonds with highly indebted nations such as Italy. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged a rethink. “I believe that everyone will eventually realise even in those countries that a shared, orderly, strong and rapid European response is the only solution,” he told Spain’s La Sexta television. “A slow response would be a useless response.” The virus death toll has also continued to skyrocket in Spain, where officials have recorded 950 deaths within the last 24 hours. During the past five days, the country had recorded more than 800 deaths each day, but the figure never passed the 900 mark. The latest figures reported by the Health Ministry bring the national tally up to 10,003 people who have died from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. Despite the new figure, Health Minister Salvador Illa insisted there was reason for optimism, saying that the data shows that the curve has stabilised and “we have reached the highest point and things are slowing down”. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Experts piece together Homo erectus skull","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/04\/03\/homo-erectus-skull\/","transcript":"The earliest known skull of the first human-like ancestors has been pieced together after researchers realised it wasn’t a baboon. A team of international experts unearthed more than 150 pieces of the Homo erectus skull in the fossil-rich Drimolen cave system in South Africa over five years. A report in Science on Friday has outlined how the two-million-year-old fossil was pieced back together to form the cranium of a two- or three-year-old Homo erectus (Latin for upright man). Homo erectus is considered to be the first ancestor similar in anatomy and behaviour to humans. The team originally thought it was piecing together a baboon’s skull until it became bigger and bigger, and then the penny dropped. La Trobe University lead researcher Andy Herries says it is extremely rare to find a human fossil, let alone this skull. “The rarity of this fossil, it is two, three years old, it’s extremely delicate and so the chances of finding it are extremely small,” he told AAP. “When we pulled it out of the ground in pieces and we looked at bits of the cranial vault, it was quite thin because it is quite young, so initially we were like ‘it’s a baboon’ – we find lots of baboon at the site. “As we started putting the pieces back together in the sort of brain case, it got bigger, and bigger and bigger, it was like ‘ah, not a baboon’. A sort of eureka moment.” The discovery proves that Homo erectus existed 100,000 to 200,000 years earlier than previously known, Professor Herries said. “Homo erectus is a very iconic species … this is the beginning of what it means to be human,” he said. “It is tall like us, it has human adaptations, it makes stone tools. “Crucially, it is the first explorer. It is the first human species to get out of Africa – not that they would have known that.” Other research has found stone tools were in China about two million years ago, which is about the same time period as this skull, he said. The discovery proves Homo erectus walked when two other types of humans in South Africa, Paranthropus and Australopithecus, existed. It’s possible that Australopithecus sediba may not be a direct ancestor of Homo erectus, or humans as first thought, he said. Researchers hope to find the rest of the skeleton. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"White House told COVID-19 could be spread by talking and breathing","date":"04-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/03\/coronavirus-spread-through-breathing\/","transcript":"America is considering the widespread use of face masks as research reveals coronavirus could potentially be spread through conversation and breathing. The World Health Organisation is also assessing its evidence on masks amid suggestions Asian countries where they are widely used have been more effective in containing COVID-19. Current medical advice is that the virus is transmitted from person to person through cough or sneeze droplets or contaminated hands and that masks are not necessary for the general public. But a scientific panel has told the White House that COVID-19 could be spread simply by a person exhaling and the virus lingering in the air in “aerosolised droplets”, CNN reports. A person later walking through the air that was infected by the droplets could potentially contract the virus. The revelation comes as global infections reached 1 million, with America leading the world tally with more than 226,000 cases – almost double that of Italy. The findings were explained in a letter to the White House from Dr Harvey Fineberg, chairman of a committee with the National Academy of Sciences, responding to questions about the possibility of coronavirus spreading through conversation. The letter drew on research from a Chinese hospital where it was found the virus could be suspended in the air when doctors and nurses  removed protective gear, when staff moved around or the floors were cleaned. The University of Nebraska also discovered genetic material from the virus almost 2m away from patients, according to the letter. Australian social distancing advice recommends people avoid one another by at least 1.5m to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “While the current [coronavirus] specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolisation of virus from normal breathing,” the letter to the White House states. “Currently available research supports the possibility that [coronavirus] could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients’ exhalation. “While the current [coronavirus] specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolisation of virus from normal breathing.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told CNN the group was actively discussing whether to recommend widespread use of masks with Dr Fauci himself choosing to start wearing a bandana or balaclava when visiting the shops. In Australia face masks are not recommended for the general population but advised for people who have contracted the virus and come into contact with other people. The US is grappling with the fast-spreading virus and the economic impact has been far reaching with a record 6.6 million Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week, doubling the previous week’s record high. The job cuts are mounting against a backdrop of economies in the US and abroad having almost certainly sunk into a severe recession as businesses close across the world. The surging lay-offs have led many economists to envision as many as 20 million lost jobs by the end of April. The unemployment rate could spike to as high as 15 per cent this month, above the previous record of 10.8 per cent set during a deep recession in 1982. Many employers are slashing their payrolls to try to stay afloat because their revenue has collapsed, especially at restaurants, hotels, gyms, movie theatres and other venues that depend on face-to-face interaction. Auto sales have sunk, and factories have closed. Stay-at-home orders, imposed by most US states, have intensified pressure on businesses, most of which face rent, loans and other bills that must be paid. The US Congress significantly expanded the unemployment benefits system in last week’s $US2.2 trillion ($3.6 trillion) economic rescue package. That legislation added $US600 ($1000) a week in jobless aid, on top of what recipients receive from their states. This will enable many lower-income workers to manage their expenses and even increase their purchasing power and support the economy. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘No health risk’: PM talks up ‘free’ childcare, schools open for months","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-free-childcare-schools-open\/","transcript":"Childcare and schools remain safe for children to attend, according to the Prime Minister, as he unveiled a $1.6 billion plan to extend ‘‘free’’ childcare to all workers during the COVID-19 crisis. The ‘‘free’’ childcare will start from Sunday and will be offered even to parents who do not send their children to childcare or after-school care while they are working from home. Despite widespread panic among parents and some teachers over the risk of COVID-19 spreading in schools, Scott Morrison on Thursday insisted there was ‘‘no health risk to children going to school or childcare’’. “What we always have said in the health advice has been very clear and it has not changed,” Mr Morrison said. “There is no health risk to children going to school or going to childcare. So that hasn’t changed. Absolutely no change. “The health advice is clear. Children can go to childcare and children can go to school.” He urged those parents calling for tougher lockdowns and for schools to be closed to keep in mind changes had to be sustainable and remain in place for six months or longer. “We are one of the few, if only, countries that have been talking about the coronavirus pandemic as being one that we are going to have to live with for at least the next six months,” the PM said. “I have been very clear about that. “I really want Australians to understand that we need to be in this for the haul. It will be months.” Parents will secure “free” childcare and be able to keep their booking even for after-school care regardless of whether they attend. #Coronavirus has made it impossible for some children to see their #grandparents in person.

Childcare centres will have to guarantee that they will stay open and provide care for essential workers. The definition of essential workers will include anyone who has a job outside the home – whether that is a supermarket cashier, a nurse, a doctor, a public servant, a journalist or a food delivery driver. The definition of essential workers is broad and captures any worker who has a job they cannot do from home. It may also include families working from home who need toddlers cared for while they work. “We will be ensuring for those parents who are still in that position where they are needing that childcare, it will be free,” the Prime Minister said. “If you have a job in this economy then that is an essential job. “It is important that all of those parents who have children, that they get access to childcare and those facilities will be there for them.” The expert medical advice is that schools should remain open at this time. pic.twitter.com\/7IIxm6YC3C — Dan Tehan (@DanTehanWannon) March 19, 2020 Most childcare centres will also secure the JobKeeper payment, which means taxpayers will subsidise childcare workers’ wages by $1500 a fortnight. “We’re putting a new system in place as of Sunday night,” Mr Tehan said. “So we’ll be mothballing the old system and putting in a completely new system. “What a parent will be able to do in that situation is they’ll be able to keep the continuity with their childcare centre, but they don’t have to attend and they will not be charged fees.” Mr Tehan offered no guarantees school children would physically return to school in Term 2. “So we’ll work with the state and territories who have the jurisdictional responsibility for this and we will make sure that we’ve got the best possible arrangements in place so that they will continue their education in term two,’’ Mr Tehan said. Mr Morrison again said there were no “health reasons” why children could not be at school, and that terms would resume after the Easter break even if it was via distance learning. “One of the things I’ve been most adamant about is that the virus is going to take a lot of things from us in the months ahead – I do not want it to rob our children of their education,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Energy bill relief on its way to Australian households","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-energy-bill-relief\/","transcript":"Australians have one less bill to worry about this month as energy providers roll out new coronavirus support measures for customers facing hardship. Households in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia will benefit from deferred or rebated electricity and gas network charges and won’t be disconnected from the grid without their consent until at least July 31. (Network charges are fees paid to the companies that operate the distribution grid.) “Networks and retailers realise it’s important the industry pulls together to support the many small businesses and households who will face growing challenges over the months ahead,” said Energy Networks Australia chief executive Andrew Dillon. Simon Downes, editor-in-chief of consumer comparison site Canstar Blue, told The New Daily the measures could save people a lot of money but more help was needed. “People often think their energy retailer pockets all their power bill, but in reality network charges can account for up to 40 per cent of it,” he said. “Anyone would benefit hugely from this type of cost cutting, assuming it’s as good as it sounds.” But with more Australians working from home than ever before, Mr Downes said the offers were unlikely to provide enough support as residential power bills were set to skyrocket. “Customers already in hardship programs are being pledged support”, he said. “But the vast majority of households are not involved in these programs and still need help – the last thing people need right now is the financial stress of a large energy bill. The type of support available to households varies depending on their provider. Customers with large providers will have their network charges from April 1 to June 30 deferred if they move on to hardship provisions or a payment plan. Large energy providers include AGL Energy, EnergyAustralia, ERM Power, Lumo Energy, Momentum Energy, Origin Energy, Red Energy, Simply Energy, Stanwell Corporation and all of their affiliates. Three of those businesses – AGL, EnergyAustralia, and Origin Energy – account for a majority of the market share in each of the relevant states.  Households using smaller providers will have their network charges from April 1 to June 30 rebated if they default on their payments. These support packages do however come with a caveat, regardless of whether a household gets their energy from a large or small provider. Rebates or deferments will only be given to people who were customers of their provider before April 1 and had also received a relevant government benefit by that date. Customers who were already on hardship provisions, a payment plan, or in default or arrears before March 1 will also not qualify for support. Some small businesses will also be afforded bill relief. Businesses forced to go into hibernation between the start of April and the end of June will have their network charges rebated. Rebates will only be available to businesses that consumed less than 40MWh or 400GJ of energy in 2019, and the program will only apply to businesses that used less than a quarter of the energy they historically use in the relevant period. Both the government and the banks have also rallied behind Australia’s small business sector. Banks will grant business owners a reprieve from loan repayments for up to six months to boost cash flow. And the federal government has announced a $130 billion wage subsidy program to help businesses pay their staff."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus supermarkets shake-up: What’s disappearing from shelves","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-supermarkets-specials-products\/","transcript":"Supermarkets are being forced to cut promotions and products as the virus shutdown tightens supply lines and hits profit margins. Woolworths this week confirmed it has ditched many of its regular weekly specials as it struggles to keep up with demand prompted by the coronavirus outbreak. Coles has taken a similar path, winding back printing its catalogue, saying it doesn’t want to disappoint customers who might head in store specially looking for an advertised promotion. Customers can start to see stock levels of initially sought-after items – like toilet paper – return to shelves, but there will still be empty shelves throughout the country’s supermarkets. Queensland University of Technology associate professor Gary Mortimer has been doing the rounds of supermarkets daily for the past three weeks. He told The New Daily things are beginning to return to normal, but the knock-on effect from COVID-19 was just beginning. The food retail and consumer behaviour expert pointed to the meat department as a prime example. Although products prepared in store are still in fine supply, we can start to see a shortage of pre-prepared meat and poultry items. “There’s plenty of cows, there’s plenty of chooks but not plenty of people who are skilled to break down an animal (to meet the consumer demand), and that’s why we’re seeing less of these products on the shelves,” Professor Mortimer explained. Cheese and chocolate lovers might also see gaps where their favourite products usually are, Deakin University’s Michael Callaghan said. Many of these products are made offshore – some in China – and the supply chains will start to feel the pinch of border shutdowns, Dr Callaghan said. There’s also the risk in non-perishables; Australian favourites like packaged chips and biscuits. If a worker in a production factory was diagnosed with the coronavirus, the actions of the government could be swift and sharp – Tim Tams aren’t exactly an essential foodstuff. “We could soon see some items disappear because producers and distributors are closing doors,” Dr Callaghan said. There’s also a lot of whispers that fresh produce prices are being hiked, prompting accusations of price-gouging by the supermarkets. As a temporary measure, we have reluctantly decided not to distribute our paper catalogue from this week. We know how important the catalogue is for planning so look out for a digital version next week with specials and recipes – https:\/\/t.co\/Az9KcmLNWa — Coles Supermarkets (@Coles) March 17, 2020 Dr Callaghan, a marketing and management lecturer and researcher, said it would be a hard link to prove. At this time of year, fruit and vegetables usually experience a price hike as the seasons shift. However, he pointed to the supply and distribution chain: If a farmer is also trying to keep their head above water, and prep for an uncertain future, they could very well be selling their products at a higher price. That inflation is passed onto customers. It’s just business, Dr Callaghan said. “The longer this goes on, the less super supermarkets will be,” he said. Before the coronavirus outbreak changed the world as we know it, Woolworths was already struggling to keep its books balanced, Dr Callaghan said. The supermarket was in hot water with its shareholders and on the nose with consumers when it was revealed it owed $315 million to employees after systemic levels of wage theft were revealed. “Woolworths does have a fairly strong reason for maximising profits and minimising costs because they’ve got to pay back all the wage theft they took from employees,” Dr Callaghan told The New Daily. That’s part of the reason consumers might have noticed Woolies leading the way in ‘corona-washing’: Announcing business decisions that paint the company as a hero, such as dedicated community shopping hours, Dr Callaghan said. Add that to the enormous costs all supermarkets have had to outlay to adapt to this societal shift – hiring more staff, upping distribution lines, finding extra warehouses for toilet paper – and that’s a lot of money to recoup. As for Coles, it is taking the back seat and sitting back, watching. “Coles hasn’t really come out and corona-washed their business at all,” Dr Callaghan said. “And for me, that’s the wisest thing to do.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Life in lockdown: Our deserted cities in the age of coronavirus","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-cities-gallery\/","transcript":"With Australia under varying stages of COVID-19 self-isolation, our once-bustling cities have become veritable ghost towns.

Australia’s sharemarket followed the lead of an overnight global crash after US President Donald Trump predicted up to 240,000 American lives could be lost to coronavirus. The ASX closed 2 per cent lower off the back of major slides in the banking sector, hours after the IMF implored governments to enact ‘wartime measures’ to rescue their economies. In a blog post, the fund warned the world is now in the first of two “war” phases as workers contract the virus and strict social distancing measures weaken activity. The IMF said economic policy should meet three objectives to reduce pain in the “post-war recovery” phase: Guarantee the viability of essential sectors like healthcare; support households afflicted by the crisis; and prevent widespread business closures. “If policies ensure that workers do not lose their jobs, renters and home owners are not evicted, companies avoid bankruptcy, and business and trade networks are preserved, the recovery will occur sooner and more smoothly,” the IMF wrote. Following three major announcements from the Australian government, The New Daily examines how Australia’s response compares with the rest of the world’s.  The Morrison government has so far committed more than $193 billion in fiscal stimulus measures to keep a lid on unemployment and boost the cash flow of affected businesses. The latest package – a $130 billion wage subsidy program – was well received by business groups and economists despite leaving many casual workers and international students in the lurch. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans described the JobKeeper payment as a “game changer” and subsequently revised down his peak unemployment forecast from 17 per cent to 9 per cent. Under the scheme, businesses that have lost revenue as a result of the coronavirus will receive $1500 a fortnight for every worker they keep employed during the crisis. They must then pass this on to workers. Those not eligible for the new JobKeeper payment can instead apply for JobSeeker, which was effectively doubled with the introduction of a fortnightly coronavirus supplement. And about 6.5 million Australians – including pensioners, Jobseeker recipients, carers and those who claim Austudy – will receive two payments of $750. However, those who receive the coronavirus supplement will not receive the second payment. As for SMEs, Treasury offered a helping hand in the form of a $20 billion loan scheme, which enables struggling borrowers to access up to $250,000 for a fixed term of three years. And on the health front, Health Minister Greg Hunt unveiled a $2.4 billion package to support primary care (including $100 million for telehealth consultations), aged care, hospitals and medical inventory. “We are ensuring people can access essential care in a way that reduces their potential exposure to infection,” he said. After weeks of partisan squabbling in Congress, President Trump last week signed the biggest rescue package in US history. Its cornerstone measure is a direct payment scheme reminiscent of Kevin Rudd’s GFC cash handouts, which helped keep Australia out of recession. American adults who earn up to $US75,000 ($122,754) will receive $1200 in direct relief, and the amount incrementally decreases by $5 for every $100 increase in salary, up to a limit of $US99,000. Workers who earn above that amount will not receive a payment. The monumental expenditure also includes a contentious $500 billion corporate bailout fund to rescue big businesses – including embattled airlines – and other businesses deemed “critical to the maintenance of national security”. Small businesses received support in the form of a $350 million forgivable loan program designed to prevent mass employee layoffs, as well as refundable payroll tax credit for businesses that employee fewer than 500 staff. In a sign of the massive challenge ahead for the US economy, a record 3.3 million Americans filed for the government’s beefed-up unemployment benefits package last week. The Trump administration’s package also offers workers furloughed or laid off during the crisis an additional $US600 per week and encompasses previously ineligible groups such as gig workers and freelancers. Scott Morrison’s wage subsidies announcement came two weeks after the United Kingdom’s ground-breaking decision to subsidise 80 per cent of workers’ wages – up to a value of £2500 ($5086) a month. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the “unprecedented” three-month scheme would ensure workers remain in the workforce even if their employer cannot afford to pay them. Workers also received welcome relief after Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared a three-month moratorium on private rental evictions and three-month mortgage “holidays”. Small business owners and self-employed workers have also been looked after. The British government established a £330 billion ($671.3 billion) loan package – which amounts to 15 per cent of UK GDP – to assist businesses fearing bankruptcy amid unpredictable economic headwinds. And the country’s near-four million self-employed workers will also be entitled to claim up to £2500 ($5086) a month in government grants in a £9 billion ($18.3 billion) bailout scheme announced late last week. Among the benefits for small to medium-sized businesses include business interruption loans ranging from £1.2 million ($2.4 million) to £5 million ($10.2 million) and £25,000 cheques ($50,837) (per property) for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses. As for other countries, the Centre for Future Work has compiled an extensive list of international initiatives."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"STREAM: Six simple steps for mental health during coronavirus lockdown","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/04\/02\/stream-mental-health-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The coronavirus pandemic has caused what Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described as “twin crises”: Health and economic. With much of the nation now in lockdown in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed, many are also worried about the impact of the crisis on mental health. In South Australia, researchers from the Órama Institute of Mental Health, Wellbeing & Neuroscience at Flinders University have been working to develop effective “wellbeing interventions” that can be used to counter the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis. “As Australia experiences the implications of the coronavirus crisis, the issue is not just a health or economic concern, but also a mental health and wellbeing crisis,” clinical psychologist and Órama Institute director Mike Kyrios said. “Beyond medical and public health interventions that the government is developing to combat COVID-19, it is necessary to start developing wellbeing, mental health and resilience supports for individuals and communities.” The researchers have developed  a simple six-step strategy called STREAM that individuals can put into effect to combat coronavirus panic and stress while quarantining, staying at home, or working from home. Professor Kyrios explained how it works: S is for Social networking Social distancing or quarantining may be necessary for our general health, but it doesn’t mean we should cease all social networking. Remain in touch with people through social media or a simple phone call. Share your experiences to facilitate support, or use the best of Australian humour to lighten the situation. Dinners or dessert and coffee over Skype are always a hoot! T is for Time Out Remember to separate from each other when you’re stuck in the home for long periods. It can be particularly useful to timetable periods of Time Out to minimise the ongoing stress of being in a limited space with others for long periods. R is for Relaxation, mindfulness or yoga strategies Managing anxiety can be helped through using a variety of relaxation strategies. Breathing and muscular relation exercises, mindfulness training, dancing, yoga and playing musical instruments are a few available strategies that are effective. E is for Exercise and Entertainment Burn off some energy if you have a yard or a space where you can get some exercise. Find opportunities in the home to undertake some exercise. Alternatively, entertain yourself by catching up on some reading, streaming services, digital or board games, hobbies, or playing music. A is for Alternative thinking Uncertainty and novelty will lead to heightened tension and stress. Question yourself if you’re becoming angry (such as supermarket or car rage). Are your fears likely to eventuate? What does science tell us about the most likely outcomes? Is your response reasonable? Are there better ways to manage your underlying motivations? Think things through to find resolution, or talk to someone else, such as a friend or a counsellor. M is for being Mindful of others Remember, this is just a short-term situation that we can all get through if we work together. Resolving crisis is not new to Australians. We’ve done it before, working together and maintaining courteous and caring interpersonal relationships. Neighbours help each other and no one gets left behind after fires, floods and other times of need. Make sure it happens now. Check on your neighbours, making sure you maintain good hygiene practices. The elderly and those with previous medical conditions are particularly vulnerable and may need support. Never forget that simple acts of kindness make us feel good about ourselves, the world and the future. Much of what we experience is based on more than objective experiences. It’s also our perception of what happens, our attitudes or beliefs, and how we regulate our emotions. It’s no different in the current COVID-19 crisis. Many people appear to be controlling their fears and their need for certainty or control through panic-buying – but the resulting pandemonium will not see us in good stead in the long run. Panic-buying not only leads to many people in need missing out, but also builds further panic. Numerous irrational behaviours that we currently see will not quell fears or increase our sense of control over perceived uncertainties. Compulsive hoarding of toilet paper, in response to COVID-19, not only doesn’t make sense but is indicative of the mental health challenges we will see at the population level if we don’t take additional actions.

The blocked drains. Turns out, with toilet paper in limited supply, we’ve all turned to nappy wipes, kitchen paper towels and so called ‘flushable’ wet cloths – and your old pipes cannot cope.

It says the number of jobs specifically requesting a plumber to unblock  a toilet or drain, have surged 68 per cent from February to March. Alex Taskun from GT Plumbing says wet wipes are the main problem because they cause ‘fatbergs’ in waterways and homes. “Wet wipes don’t biodegrade very quickly, and they eventually get stuck somewhere, causing a massive clog that will cost you money to unblock,” Mr Taskun said. “I am doing a lot of this type of work at the moment.” So Australia, you’ve been warned.

Hundreds of Australians who returned home after midnight on Saturday are in the early stages of a compulsory fortnight’s quarantine in capital city hotels. Some of the returning travellers forced into quarantine have complained of prison-like conditions and inadequate supplies. Clearly under some pressure from the weight of requests made by guests, the manager of Sydney’s Wentworth Avenue Travelodge issued an announcement urging them to show consideration to hotel staff during their quarantine. “We are not expecting to be sued, we do not want to be sworn at – we are coming to hear your frustrations, but please have some respect,” he said in his announcement issued on Wednesday and quoted by the AAP. The manager also declared exercise bikes and treadmills would soon be available for hire, while a user-pays laundry system would be in place by Friday. “We are not prison wardens,” he told his guests. Quarantined travellers have been vocal in their complaints of their hotel accommodation. Cruise ship passenger Amber Hammond, who is staying at the luxury Swissotel Hotel in the Sydney CBD, told SBS the conditions inside were “abysmal”, and she and fellow passengers were being treated like criminals. “We are not allowed out of our rooms, even with masks and keeping a 1.5-metre distance,” she said this week. “We are not allowed to open our doors except to get food. We are not allowed to get any fresh air and the windows do not open.” Georgina Sindel, staying at the Wentworth Avenue Travelodge, told AAP she missed fresh air, and said she couldn’t help but feel like she was headed for prison after being placed on a bus by the military at Sydney Airport first thing on Tuesday morning. “And then with the police escorting us all to our room here, it felt very prison-like,” the 27-year-old consultant said. “I’ve had my ups and downs – there have been a few meltdowns on the phone to my parents. “But if we stay positive, it’s much easier to get through. I’ll keep exercising, working and try to stick to a schedule.” Musicians Eddie Boyd, 28, and Annie Collis, 24, whose move to London was almost immediately turned upside down by the coronavirus, arrived back in Australia on Sunday morning. Ms Collis, who is being housed at the Hyatt Regency, also in Sydney’s CBD, said a lack of information was a major concern. The phone number for a counselling service was slipped under their door on Tuesday night but little else has been communicated. “They just put us in here and closed the door,” Ms Collis said. “The government doesn’t seem to be worried much about your mental and physical health in terms of being a normal person in this process.” But Mr Boyd said they remained in high spirits, binge-watching Netflix, playing guitar, and brushing up on their French and Italian using Duolingo. The bandmates also shared a laugh at their occasionally comical situation: For a few nights, they had to wash their dishes with face soap in the bathroom sink. “I think we’re pretty lucky actually,” Mr Boyd said. “I’d give it four stars – if we had a window that we could open, that would make it the prime quarantine hotel.” Ms Collis agreed. “We’re glad to be back in Australia and that’s overruling everything else,” she said. “It looked pretty ominous in London and we thought we should just get out as soon as possible. “So we’re just feeling grateful that we got back and that we have somewhere to go.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Shoot them dead': Philippine president's coronavirus lockdown message","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/02\/duterte-philippines-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte told police and the military to shoot dead anyone “who creates trouble” during a coronavirus lockdown of the island of Luzon. In a televised address, Mr Duterte said it was vital everyone co-operated and followed home quarantine measures, as authorities tried to slow the spread of the virus and spare the country’s fragile health system from being overwhelmed. He also said abuse of medical workers was a serious crime that would not be tolerated. The Philippines has recorded 96 coronavirus deaths and 2311 confirmed cases, all but three in the past three weeks. Infections are now being reported in the hundreds every day. “It is getting worse. So once again I’m telling you the seriousness of the problem and that you must listen,” Mr Duterte said late on Wednesday. “My orders to the police and military … if there is trouble and there’s an occasion that they fight back and your lives are in danger, shoot them dead. “Is that understood? Dead. Instead of causing trouble, I will bury you.” On Thursday, the country’s national police chief said police understood that Mr Duterte was demonstrating his seriousness about public order, and no one would be shot. The president’s comments came after media reports of a disturbance and the arrests of 21 residents of a slum in Manila on Wednesday after they protested about a lack of government food aid. The residents claimed they had received no food packs or other relief supplies since beginning a lockdown more than two weeks ago. Those arrested included six women. Police Brigadier General Ronnie Montejo said they will be charged with violating a new law that requires millions of people to stay home under quarantine. They also follow outrage among the medical community about social stigma and instances of hospital workers suffering physical abuse and discrimination, which Mr Duterte said must be stopped. Activists deride Mr Duterte for his fierce rhetoric and accuse him of inviting violence and vigilantism, as shown in his war on drugs, during which police and mystery gunmen have killed thousands of people accused of using or selling drugs.

His comments came after a senior Republican lawmaker questioned Beijing’s data and Bloomberg News reported a classified US intelligence report had concluded that China had under-reported the total cases and deaths it had suffered. The coronavirus outbreak began in China in late 2019 but Beijing has reported fewer cases and deaths than in the United States, which now has the world’s largest outbreak, with 215,000 confirmed cases and 5100 deaths. Mr Trump told a daily briefing by his coronavirus task force that he had not received an intelligence report on China’s data. “The numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side – and I am being nice when I say that – relative to what we witnessed and what was reported,” he added. Mr Trump said he had discussed how China had dealt with the coronavirus outbreak in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last Friday, but “not so much the numbers”. Is Bloomberg only confirming what many Hong Kongers already know? The city is a leader in virus containment with meticulous case tracing efforts. Still, Hong Kong reports about 50 new cases every day. With 200 times the population, China magically has only 36 new cases yesterday. https:\/\/t.co\/FPS53lj8NC — Jason Y.

Mr Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, told the same briefing Washington was “just not (in) the position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China”. “There’s lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are too low,” he said. “You got access to those reports that are coming out of Chinese social media … we just have no way to confirm any of those numbers. Earlier, Michael McCaul, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, accused Beijing of hiding the true number of those impacted. He said he had called for the State Department to investigate Beijing’s “initial cover-up and subsequent actions regarding this pandemic”. The Bloomberg report cited unidentified US officials as saying that a classified report, received by the White House last week, concluded that China’s public reporting on cases and deaths was intentionally incomplete. China reported dwindling new infections on Wednesday and for the first time disclosed the number of cases of people who have the highly contagious disease but do not show symptoms.

Qantas says the employee was spreading misinformation about the safety of working on flights from China but the transport union argues the man was simply telling colleagues about their rights. The Transport Workers’ Union in February wrote to SafeWork NSW urging the watchdog to investigate whether the staff member had been discriminated against. SafeWork NSW recently wrote to Qantas confirming it would investigate the allegations. TWU NSW branch secretary Richard Olsen says the actions of Qantas have been “outrageous”. “If safety reps at Qantas can’t stand up to unsafe work practices, then no worker is safe,” he said in a statement on Thursday. “The TWU believes there is ample evidence to prove that Qantas engaged in discriminatory and prohibited behaviour.” A Qantas spokesman said the company would help SafeWork NSW with its investigation. “A union delegate was stood down pending an investigation after incorrectly telling employees it was not safe to work on aircraft arriving from China in early February,” the spokesman said in a statement. “This was against the advice of health authorities and despite additional safety equipment being provided to employees.” Qantas on February 1 announced it would suspend its two direct services to mainland China from February 9 due to travel restrictions imposed by other countries in the wake of the health crisis. The Qantas employee – who is also a delegate of the TWU and served as a health and safety representative – was stood down on February 2 after voicing concerns about whether the flights were safe.

That represents 1 per cent of the country’s population. “We are the first country to the best of our knowledge that has been able to exceed that mark,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday. The leap comes a week after Australia relaxed rules around testing for COVID-19. Initially, only people who had returned from overseas recently or had been in contact with a confirmed case could get tested – if they were showing flu-like symptoms. As reports of suspected community transmission grew, that was expanded to anyone who felt they had the symptoms. Health Minister Greg Hunt said the enhanced testing regime complemented the “ring of steel” created around Australia through shutting borders to non-residents and citizens and introducing quarantine and isolation procedures for returning travellers. The testing had resulted in an average of just below 2 per cent positive results. The increase came on a bad day for Australia’s coronavirus fatalities, with three deaths taking the toll to 24. They were women in their 60s and 70s, who died in Victoria, and an 85-year-old man who died in Toowoomba Hospital is Queensland. Elsewhere on Thursday, Mr Morrison announced a $1.6 billion boost to make childcare free for all working parents for the next six months. “If you have a job in this economy, then that is an essential job, in my view,” Mr Morrison said. “It is important that all of those parents get access to childcare.” The plan is aimed at helping Australia’s 13,000 childcare centres ride out the economic and health fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Free childcare will be offered from Sunday night (April 5), regardless of family income. “We will be ensuring for those parents who are still in that position where they are needing childcare, it will be free,” he said. “We will be putting in place support arrangements to the childcare facilities, some 13,000 of them, to ensure they remain open and be there for their parents to ensure they can do what they need to do each day.” In other developments, two million Australian workers will be eligible for two weeks’ special “pandemic leave” after the Fair Work Commission fast-tracked changes to their working conditions. The workers – in industries such as hospitality, clerical, retail and cleaning – will also be able to take their annual leave at half pay during the coronavirus outbreak if they need to. Other changes will allow employees to work from home if they need to. The amendments were confirmed by Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter on Thursday. “These types of changes are absolutely critical,” he said. “They would have saved tens of thousands of jobs.” The workplace announcement came after a recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey found half of all businesses had already taken a hit from the developing coronavirus outbreak. Many more – 86 per cent of businesses – expected to be affected in coming months. Mr Porter said the fast-tracking on award amendments was achieved by co-operation between employer and worker groups. They included the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Industry Group, individual employer associations, individual unions such as the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association. “There has been the type of change in three weeks inside the award system that you might otherwise wait 30 years to see,” he said. “The reform has been temporary. It is meant to last for as long as [the coronavirus] crisis lasts.

The free childcare will be offered to essential workers, regardless of their family income. “We will be ensuring for those parents who are still in that position where they are needing that childcare, it will be free,” he said. “We will be putting in place support arrangements to the childcare facilities, some 13,000 of them, to ensure they remain open and be there for their parents to ensure they can do what they need to do each day.” Education Minister Dan Tehan said centres would be asked to prioritise essential workers and vulnerable children who might not be safe at home. “It will be a system that will mean parents will get their children cared for for free,” Mr Tehan said. “What we will be doing is turning off the old system and going to a new system, which will provide that relief to parents. “Can I say to all those parents, what we want to do by doing this is ensure that your childcare centre will remain open, so that you know where you normally take your child to get care, that that will be there for you, so you are not looking to have to go to a new centre. “You do not have the worry and the concern about trying to look for new care for your children.” Under the $1.6 billion coronavirus-driven bailout for the sector, the Morrison government will also guarantee a portion of childcare subsidies that would otherwise have flowed before parents started withdrawing their children. “The way it will work is that we will look at what 50 per cent of the fees up to the rate cap were in the fortnight before 2nd March and we will pay you that amount on a fortnightly basis,” he said. “Now, there are some conditions that we are asking if the sector are to receive these payments. The centre must remain open. It must provide care for those parents who need their children cared for. They must also seek to re-enrol those parents who might have dropped off. “If they need care, they can get that care as well. To help and assist with that, we are backdating to 23rd March the requirement that the sector must pursue from parents a fee. So we are waiving the gap fee for parents going back to the 23rd March. “The hope is that now all parents who need it will get the care they want and those who have sought to disengage from the childcare sector will re-engage with the sector.” But one of the nation’s biggest childcare providers, Goodstart, has raised concerns it will not qualify for the JobKeeper allowance because it has a turnover of more than $1 billion. Talks with the non-profit provider are continuing."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Child killer accused hit with drug and speeding charges","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/04\/02\/abdallah-children-drunk-court\/","transcript":"A driver who allegedly mowed down a group of children on a Sydney footpath, killing four, has been accused of being on drugs and speeding at 45 km\/h over the limit at the time. NSW Police laid an additional 14 charges against Samuel William Davidson when he appeared at Parramatta Local Court on Thursday.

They were four of seven children struck when Davidson’s Mitsubishi ute mounted a footpath on Bettington Road in Oatlands. It’s believed they were going for ice cream. The children’s families did not appear in court when Davidson was hit with the fresh charges including four counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death under the influence of drugs. Detectives allege he had traces of MDMA and cocaine in his system. Mr Davidson was also charged with two counts of driving with an illicit drug present in his blood. He has additionally been charged with four counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death while speeding more than 45 km\/h over the limit, running a red light and not giving his particulars to police. Mr Davidson was arrested after returning a positive roadside breath test and allegedly recording a blood alcohol reading of 0.15 – three times the legal limit. He was previously charged with a long list of offences including four counts of manslaughter, dangerous driving occasioning death, grievous bodily harm, negligent driving and drink driving.

The federal government has announced a raft of direct financial support measures for workers and businesses over the past three weeks. Ministers have also been granted extraordinary discretionary powers to change the value of government payments, which could lead to billions more dollars being spent without Parliamentary approval. Opposition finance spokeswoman Katy Gallagher says getting help to those who need it must be the priority. “However, it’s also important to ensure that such eye-watering sums of taxpayer money are spent as efficiently and effectively as possible,” Senator Gallagher said on Thursday. “Labor believes that appropriate scrutiny by the ANAO is needed to ensure the highest levels of accountability and good governance are met.” Senator Gallagher said the proposed audit was particularly crucial at a time when parliament is sitting less regularly due to COVID-19. The government has so far spent $320 billion, or 16.4 per cent of gross domestic product, on various measures in response to coronavirus. –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Helicopter mission to ferry doctors to treat cruise ship crews","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/02\/cruise-ships-nsw-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A military-style operation will be launched to get doctors on board cruise ships floating off the NSW coast to test thousands of crew members for COVID-19. Doctors will be flown by helicopter to eight foreign cruise ships in a joint government operation to test and evacuate patients needing urgent coronavirus treatment to try to end a maritime standoff. Once crews have been treated, the federal government will increase pressure on foreign cruise companies to sail away from Australia. NSW Police are locked in a stand-off with foreign cruise ships, urging them to proceed immediately to their home ports rather than risk flooding NSW hospitals with COVID-19 patients. Under the federal government’s coronavirus restrictions, all cruise ships are banned from entering Australia until June 15. In an attempt to end the stalemate, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said helicopters would be used to fly doctors on board. “They will go on and they will do an assessment and the standard temperature check and ask questions around symptoms of the virus,” Mr Fuller said on Thursday. “If the crew is fit and healthy, I have no hesitation in asking [Home Affairs] Minister [Peter] Dutton to enforce the orders for them to leave our shores.” Anyone requiring urgent medical attention would be brought ashore. Mr Fuller said there were eight cruise ships off NSW, carrying about 8500 crew members. They include the Pacific Explorer, ­Carnival Splendour, Ovation of the Seas and the infamous Ruby Princess. All known Australian crew had been extracted. Little is known about the state of health of the remaining crew members. But already more than a dozen people have been brought off the ships for medical reasons. More than 1000 crew reportedly remain aboard the Ruby Princess, which has become a major source of coronavirus infection in Australia. It is registered in the Bahamas. Two of the cruise liners have agreed to refuel in coming days and depart Australian shores. “If a small percentage end up with the virus, it will overwhelm our health system and everything we’ve done to date will be wasted,” Mr Fuller said. “Every cruise ship that leaves, I see it as a victory for NSW.” The federal government will pay for the operation, which will be coordinated by the Australian Border Force with assistance from NSW Police. A private company – Aspen Medical – will help test and treat crew members. Mr Dutton met Mr Fuller and NSW Police Minister David Elliott on Wednesday to discuss the cruise ship situation. “What we’ve agreed to do is to look at each of these vessels and to do a proper assessment of what’s happening on board,” Mr Dutton told 2GB on Thursday morning. “If you force these boats to set sail and they have people that die or get seriously sick by the time they get a couple of hundred nautical miles off the coast, they will turn around and come back.” The Maritime Union of Australia said the situation was a humanitarian crisis waiting to unfold. “The Australian government must urgently act to allow the safe repatriation of all crew members not essential for marine operation to their home countries,” national secretary Paddy Crumlin said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Virus-infected tourists visited string of visitor hotspots","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/02\/tasmania-coronavirus-tourists\/","transcript":"Tasmania will move to tougher COVID-19 restrictions, as authorities reveal two virus-infected travellers visited a string of popular tourist attractions last month. Premier Peter Gutwein said an announcement would be made on Thursday afternoon. “I’ve been taking further advice from the Director of Public Health and the state emergency controller over recent days,” he said. “We need to do more to flatten the curve and we will have more to say on this matter.” Mr Gutwein said the island state would keep its borders closed “for as long as we need to”. Tasmania’s virus tally rose overnight by one to 72. It has also been revealed two interstate travellers had the virus while on an organised tour of the state from March 12-23. They visited several tourist attractions, including MONA, Port Arthur, Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre, plus several farms, hotels and restaurants. They were unaware they had the virus until testing positive after returning to their home state, which has not been named. Tasmanian Public Health Director Mark Veitch has urged anyone who develops virus symptoms after being at those locations to visit their GP or contact the public health hotline. It is likely one of the pair was infected for the majority of the trip and the other from March 19. Dr Veitch said he was confident one of the two caught the virus from outside Tasmania. He was unsure about the second person. An investigation has been unable to find the source of two separate cases at Devonport, in the north-west, but Dr Veitch said community transmission could not be substantiated. The state is yet to have a recorded case of community transmission.

That is 18 more than yesterday, representing the state’s largest jump in cases where the source of infection is unknown or a link in terms of contacts between patients and other people is missing. In Queensland, an 85-year-old man died at Toowoomba Hospital overnight, Health Minister Steven Miles has confirmed. The man is the fourth Queenslander to die after being infected with the coronavirus. “All of our condolences, the condolence from the whole of Queensland, go to that gentleman’s family, which is, of course, grieving right now,” Mr Miles says. “Each of these deaths reminds us of just how important our effort to stop the spread of this outbreak, to slow the spread of this outbreak, is.” Queensland now has 835 case of COVID-19, up 54 from yesterday, while Victoria has 1036 cases of COVID-19, an increase of 68. Ms Mikakos announced the  state government had struck a deal with the Victoria’s major hospitals. “This deal will see our healthcare system, both public and private, operating as one in a joint effort to combat COVID-19,” she said. “It will not matter whether you have private health insurance, everyone will be treated equally.” Ms Mikakos said more than 4,000 people had registered their interest in coming out of retirement to work in the healthcare system to help in the response to COVID-19. The government was trying to speed up refreshing their registrations so more people could begin working, she said. –with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Social distancing laws to last 90 days, says NSW police chief","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-laws-nsw-90-days\/","transcript":"NSW’s social distancing laws will end in late June, the state’s police commissioner says. Mick Fuller said the coronavirus laws, which ban gatherings of more than two people and prevent people from leaving their homes without a “reasonable excuse”, had a lifetime of 90 days. He said he wouldn’t seek an extension to the new powers for police after that. “I certainly won’t be seeking an extension, people will have gotten the message by then, hopefully,” he said on Thursday. The laws came into effect on Tuesday, which means they will last until June 29. They are designed to help slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Revelation of the end date came after NSW Police were accused of overzealous enforcement of the regulations. There have been reports of people being moved on from sun-baking in Sydney parks, and gym-goers being fined or warned in the city’s south. But police say they have also been spat on and abused while dealing with NSW residents at parks and beaches. Mr Fuller said he would “personally” review all fines issued in relation to the stringent regulations. “If I think it’s unreasonable, it will be withdrawn immediately and we’ll make personal contact with the individual,” Mr Fuller said. “I get it, and we want people to be able to stay fit and physically and psychologically healthy,” he said. “But, of course, if I said it’s OK to sit on a park bench, then everyone is going to go to the park. And we’re going to end up back where we started.” More than 40 coronavirus patients are in intensive care in NSW with 20 requiring ventilators. There are more than 450 infections linked to cruise ships, including 340 cases from the Ruby Princess and 74 from the Ovation of the Seas. A pop-up COVID-19 testing clinic has been set up in Bondi to help reduce the virus’ spread after clusters developed within Sydney’s backpacker community. NSW Health said more than 115 people were tested within the first few hours of its opening on Wednesday. There were 116 new coronavirus infections in NSW in the 24 hours to 8pm Wednesday, bringing the state’s total to 2298. Other confirmed coronavirus cases in NSW include a teacher at Kambala School in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, another teacher at Wylie Park Girls High School in the southwest and a student at St Mary’s Senior High School in western Sydney. All three schools have been closed on Thursday. NSW has Australia’s toughest coronavirus restrictions, with police having the power to deliver on-the-spot fines of $1000 to individuals who breach those rules. The maximum penalty that can be given by a court is $11,000 and six months in jail. Under the laws, the only legal reasons for people to leave home are to work, study, shop for food or other essential items, access medical care or exercise alone or with one other person. There was also some early confusion about whether the laws barred people from seeing partners they did not live with. Mr Fuller gave that the tick of approval, declaring it allowable under mental health provisions. But the Victorian government initially said no, only for its chief health officer to reverse the ban late on Wednesday. Mr Fuller said NSW Police had issued three tickets in relation to breaches of coronavirus restrictions in the 24 hours to Thursday morning. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has praised people for helping flatten the COVID-19 curve in Australia’s worst-affected state. “The acceleration of cases in NSW isn’t growing, which is a good thing,” she said on Thursday. “We know that we’re having some level of success in reducing the spread. But we have to maintain our vigilance. We are at a very critical phase.” Ms Berejiklian hopes further rules won’t have to be put in place if everyone does the right thing and authorities manage to control the spread. NSW Planning Minister Rob Stokes says the government will relax rules to help struggling companies in sectors such as hospitality and construction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Construction sites will be able to operate on weekends and public holidays to help workers more easily achieve social distancing. “It’ll also help boost productivity in a crucial part of our economy,” he told reporters alongside the premier. So-called “dark kitchens” – which cook meals solely for delivery rather than eat-in diners – will also be granted unrestricted operation and take-away food vans will be able to operate from any land in NSW with the land owner’s consent. –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Prince Charles describes distressing impact of coronavirus","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/royal\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-prince-charles-symptoms\/","transcript":"Prince Charles, who has recovered from the coronavirus, has praised Britain’s healthcare workers and said the outbreak was a strange and distressing time for the nation. Heir-to-the-throne Charles, 71, came out of self-isolation on Monday after suffering mild symptoms of COVID-19. His office said he was in good health. In a video address on Wednesday, the prince said although he had recovered, he was still in a state of social distance and general isolation. His wife Camilla, who had tested negative, will remain isolated until the end of the week in case she develops symptoms. “As we are all learning, this is a strange, frustrating and often distressing experience, when the presence of family and friends is no longer possible and the normal structures of life are suddenly removed,” he said. The number of coronavirus deaths in Britain rose to 1789 people, figures on Tuesday showed. That is a 27 per cent increase in a day – and one of the victims was a 13-year-old boy with no apparent underlying health conditions. “At such an unprecedented and anxious time in all our lives, my wife and I are thinking particularly of all those who have lost their loved ones in such very difficult and abnormal circumstances, and of those having to endure sickness, isolation and loneliness,” Charles said. He also praised those on the front line in the National Health Service, saying they needed the country’s support. “It is clearly essential, therefore, that such key people are treated with special consideration when coming off their exhausting duties and trying to do their shopping, for instance, while having to contend with constant anxiety about their own families and friends,” Charles said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"How coronavirus social distancing rules have changed Melbourne","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-melbourne-viral-siege\/","transcript":"As protocols around self-isolation and social distancing dial-up by the day, how are Melburnians responding? Many honour rules to the letter, edgy and insistent. Others range from the stubbornly ignorant to the crankily recalcitrant. Most people are complying, but scenes at St Kilda beach last week and over the weekend showed that some are still struggling to adhere to this new reality. A team of reporters from The Citizen used the opportunity of their essential outings over the past few days to file intimate observations of a population adapting – and not – to a moment of seismic social and economic change. At a bakery in Toorak Village, people are keeping a comfortable distance as they queue for pastries. It’s warm, and just beginning to cloud over when a well-dressed woman in her mid-’70s marches to the front of the queue where a customer is in the middle of ordering. “Are you no longer taking cash?” she asks. The man behind the counter says the bakery is moving to a cashless system to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “Well, you won’t be having my business then,” responds the woman. The man appears to be a junior employee, but he apologises about the changes. The woman continues to stand there, seemingly unaware of the customer next to her. Down along the Merri Creek track at lunchtime on Friday things are hectic, especially with a seven-month-old Goldendoodle in tow. The track is crowded with joggers, parents pushing prams, and small groups of friends zig zagging well within 1.5 metres of each other. It is a miracle the dog doesn’t bowl a few of them over. The playground behind Northcote High School has tape around it warning people to stay-off, but there are two families playing inside and a man doing pull-ups on the monkey bars. At the CERES community grocery each customer is urged to take a pump of hand sanitiser and rub it in thoroughly before they enter. There are ‘X’s painted on the ground marking the spots people can safely stand 1.5 metres apart to help with social distancing, and aisles are blocked off to steer shoppers around a one-way route. But at the till the layout is so confusing that people have started to double back through the shop, turning their heads as they squeeze by. At Southbank, the usually crowded long walk along the Yarra River has become quiet and empty. With Crown Casino shut, the long taxi line outside the ordinarily pulsing venue is no longer there. Bars and restaurants are all closed, with their tables and chairs piled up outdoors. There is still one ice cream shop open, with a few people waiting for their warm-weather treats — two metres outside the stall. Usually, on a sunny day, the riverside would be closely populated with people sitting on the grass and enjoying the view, but today there is just a solitary lady perched among an undisturbed flock of seagulls. She’s nursing a beer. A stone’s throw distant, a couple sit on the bench huddling against one another. Pastries are in short supply at Coburg Farmer’s Market, which is enforcing social distancing with card-only sales, hand sanitising on arrival and very little food being offered to eat on-the-go. One volunteer is zealously urging even single patrons not to sit down as part of the new social distancing requirements – all part of the ‘get in, get out’ strategy due to coronavirus. Despite the measures, a bottleneck at the cash register of a vegetable seller causes one shopper to yell out. A woman, apparently ignoring the guidance to remain two arms’ lengths away from all other humans, has craned her neck over an elderly couple’s freshly-purchased celery to inspect the produce. She is duly tutted to the back of the line and forced to wait at her designated witch’s hat as the queue creeps forward in 1.5-metre increments. Both men are trying to ignore the white ute that has just pulled up beside the astroturf bearing decals on the doors – “City of Darebin”. A man in lurid hi-vis and work boots steps out and walks over to the die-hard, who after a short conversation reluctantly dismounts the bright orange bike. He walks past, his grey singlet dark with sweat. “They’re closing down everything you can touch,” he says. “You’re still allowed to walk, apparently.” As he wanders off, the council worker pulls out a sledgehammer to ram a long metal stake into the ground with a sign saying the gym is closed until further notice. “We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” Williamstown beach, popular with families from Melbourne’s working-class western suburbs, is closed on Saturday, with four security guards in high-vis vests guarding the walkways down to the sand. The promenade is busy with strolling couples and small family groups clutching hot chips and ice cream from the beachside takeaway. One man who defied the beach closure to walk along the sand is marched off the beach by a security guard. Most beachgoers keep their distance from other people, but there are others gathered on patches of lawn and beside rock pools further down the bay. At the shopping centre in Airport West, business has waned, but there’s still a staggering number of people out. Despite advice to leave children at home, whole families continue to pour through the doors to stock up at Coles, the kids touching everything in sight. At the pharmacy opposite, many of the elderly regulars continue to come and pick up their scripts themselves. Some come in almost every day. At the Coles, toilet paper is back in stock, but the pharmacy’s repeated pleas to suppliers for stocks of masks and hand sanitiser have gone unanswered. An artistic vandal takes advantage of the empty streets, hitting light posts, fences, power boxes with his marker in broad daylight. People who might usually look askance at this walk past with their heads down, paying him no mind. He says he’s noticed lots of impressive pieces popping up in places that would usually be “too hot” to bother with. This morning, walking along Stony Creek in Yarraville, my friend and I pass the Charlotte Street playground. An adult is supervising three young children as they climb, swing and slide across the playground. My friend says she’s seen families there every day this past week, trying to wear out their cooped-up children. On Sunday night Scott Morrison declared that playgrounds would now be closed across the country. There’s no evidence of that coming into force at Charlotte Street.

Director Matt Kunkel said foreign workers who have lost their jobs risk ending up on the street if the government continues to deny them financial aid. “I just don’t know how this government could be so heartless, how it could be so reckless as to know the plight of these workers and explicitly exclude them from the support at this critical juncture,” he told The New Daily. The government’s latest stimulus package gives businesses struggling to keep staff access to a $1500 fortnightly payment for each worker who is an Australian permanent resident or citizen, or New Zealand citizen living in Australia. “You still got 1.1 million temporary migrant workers who have very little way of getting home, no job, or they’re losing their jobs in the tens of thousands, and they have no income support,” Mr Kunkel said. He slammed the Morrison government’s reluctance to expand its range of support measures to include foreign workers. In the past 10 days, the Migrant Workers Centre has been inundated with pleas for help from people who have lost their job or had their hours or pay reduced. Without any help from the government, the best the centre can often do is refer them to food relief organisations and other charities. “Many of the people that we dealing with here have been in the country for more than seven years. Some of them have kids that were born here. Those kids themselves are considered to be temporary migrants,” Mr Kunkel said. “It’s very sad to be left behind,” said Fabrizio Venturini, a chef who holds a temporary visa and was let go from his job on Friday. The 33-year-old migrant from Italy said he will run out of money in one month and is unsure where he will support himself and his wife beyond May. After seven years in Australia, the couple’s only other option would be to fly back to Italy but given the travel bans and the dire situation there, returning home is impossible. “I don’t know what’s going to be my options, but what I know is that the federal government … should take care of all its workers … especially during a crisis,” Mr Venturini said. “What’s going to happen when 1.1 million people are not going to be able anymore to do their groceries?” Manager of Melbourne burger joint Miss Kuku Paul Kasteel said his business is continuing deliveries, but losing money, after the team decided not to shut completely because it would leave migrant workers in the lurch. Last week, staff had a meeting and it was decided that workers who could access Centrelink payments would stand down to keep its five foreign workers employed. It was a matter of “looking after the most disadvantaged and at-risk people” given the government was not doing that, especially with its JobKeeper payment, Mr Kasteel said. He said, “last week, the wage bill was about two and a half thousand dollars and we made $900 in sales before the Uber Eats and Deliveroo have taken their commissions out”. “What’s another three grand a week in wages for a couple of weeks? If I end up in administration, I end up in administration.” Immigration lawyer at EY, Wayne Parcell, said unless temporary visa holders are applying for a special discretionary payment, which they may be eligible for from Centrelink, they don’t have access to any government assistance. “They’re responsible for their own rent, they’re responsible for feeding and clothing themselves and they rely on their salary to make all those payments,” he said. “If their salary ceases, if they don’t have any savings, for many of these people who don’t have family in Australia, they’ve really got not much place to go in terms of support.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"The coronavirus truth is out there - and an Aussie team is hot on its trail | The New Daily Coronavirus truth is out there - and Aussie team aims to find it","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/02\/the-covid-19-truth-is-out-there-and-australians-could-help-find-it\/","transcript":"The truth is out there. It used to be a tagline for the hit sci-fi series The X-Files, in which FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully raced against the clock to solve sinister cases. But what if those frantic investigations really meant the difference between life and death for thousands of people around the globe? Now the truth we all need is about COVID-19. Right now, thousands of doctors and scientists across the planet are in a desperate battle to find ways to treat this pernicious virus. The challenge is formidable. Just three months ago it was a completely unknown disease. Now, as patients flood into intensive care units, experienced specialists are flying blind, with no proven protocols for effective treatment. Confronted by patients whose lungs appear on scans as if they are infused with ground glass, doctors are forced to guess which drugs to use and when to intervene with equipment like ventilators. In some countries, where equipment and beds are scarce, they may even face the awful choice of deciding who will get treatment and who will miss out. The bad news is that COVID-19 is still on an upward trajectory in Australia, although recent crackdowns on people moving beyond their homes seem to have slowed the disease’s relentless march. But there is good news too. The truth – in terms of information that will help identify an effective treatment – is already out there. Australia is now ideally placed to lead a global effort to lock it down, potentially saving the lives of thousands. If this really was an episode of The X-Files, we could expect a flashback to November 2019. The scene would show Brisbane Professor John Fraser, an intensive care specialist with 25 years experience, planning a study intended to track the progress of different flu strains in the Asia-Pacific. By January this year, Fraser and his team were taking international calls from colleagues fretting over a strange new lung disease that was spreading like a stain across China. He decided to convert his “ECMOCARD study” to collect data on the new strain of coronavirus. As confirmed cases grew, so too did Fraser’s database. Today, it is the largest global repository of COVID-19 ICU patients – drawing on notes from 200 hospitals across 40 countries. It grows a little more each day. Somewhere, in all of those numbers, lies the truth – a pattern in the combined data of thousands of cases that will reveal what can stop a patient’s lungs turning to stone. It is true that there is strength in numbers. Statistical strength, anyway. This is the magic of Big Data. Within their own relatively small units in individual hospitals in separate cities around the world, clinicians are trying various methods on patients of differing profiles. But they have precious little time to debrief – and besides, in small groups it is impossible to tell what has been pure luck and what is the result of a particular intervention at a certain time. However, in large enough bundles, that data can be “crunched”. Already, Professor Fraser has secured support from IBM and Amazon to do this, applying their formidable artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to analyse the numbers. But he faces one more hurdle. “Right now, we are still trying to gather this material from clinicians who are already overwhelmed,” Fraser explains. “They’re often working for more than 24 hours at a time, making life-and-death decisions from behind stuffy masks. Fraser is hoping to raise another $1 million to build a full-time team to coordinate and collect data as it flows in. But the clock is ticking and the infamous pandemic curve growing. He says it is a measure of the severity of this crisis that it has united so many doctors from around the world. “Usually we can be quite competitive,” Fraser says. “But so many clinicians have entrusted us with their data and insights because they just want – and need – answers. “The single, most-common feedback we have received globally to date is this: “the lungs from COVID-19 patients are different, we have never seen anything like this before’.” Could an Australian-led initiative solve this mystery? With $1 million more in funds, the truth may be closer than you think."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"The benefits of working from home during – and after – the coronavirus pandemic","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/02\/working-from-home-benefits-2\/","transcript":"A nationwide stay-at-home order to curb the spread of COVID-19 has significantly reduced traffic congestion and saved people hundreds of dollars on everyday expenses. Worldwide border closures also have the potential to halve domestic aviation emissions, new analysis has shown. The benefits of locking down the country have been so great that experts want more people to brave the new work-from-home world even after the coronavirus outbreak has been contained. With about a quarter of Australia’s workforce working from home due to the coronavirus, pedestrian traffic in Melbourne’s CBD has plummeted by almost 90 per cent, according to data collected by the Australian Road Research Board. The Monash Freeway has shown a similar reduction in congestion at weekday peak periods, caused by just 28 per cent (or 20,000) fewer vehicles using the highway. To keep Victoria’s roads operating efficiently, people who can work from home should continue to do so – at the very least on one or two days a week – once the virus is contained, ARRB concluded. “The COVID-19 shutdown offers a critical opportunity for Victoria to understand and deal with its transport issues before life eventually returns to normal,” ARRB chief executive Michael Caltabiano said. “We need to take this opportunity to reimagine now what a post-COVID-19 back-to-work should look like,” Mr Caltabiano said. “Can we reimagine the work people do? “There is also now an opportunity to better understand the choices people make.” Australians are also spending significantly less of their discretionary income on day-to-day expenses, including petrol, parking, public transport and lunches. Financial adviser Glen James surveyed almost 1200 millennials on their experiences of working from home and found 69 per cent were saving $50-$150 a week. He said the results suggested Australians should reassess their personal budgets and consider changing their habits to put more money towards personal financial goals. “It is about being agile with our personal spending,” Mr James said. “What habits can you make now to determine what’s a luxury or a necessity and making changes that better help you when we come out of this.” Restrictions on global travel are not only curbing the spread of the virus but also are reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. A new report by think-tank the Australia Institute found international travel emissions dropped by about 10.3 megatonnes from February to March. That’s a 4.3 per cent decrease compared to February last year and 10 per cent lower in the first part of March compared to the same period in 2019. International Air Transport Association has projected a 38 per cent cut to air travel in 2020 which equates to a 352.7 Mt fall in global civil aviation emissions compared to last year. Locally, if most Qantas and Virgin planes are grounded for nine months emissions could decrease by up to 13.2 Mt or 56 per cent compared to 2019. The Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian says it remains to be seen if COVID-19 will permanently change flying habits. “With the travel and quarantine restrictions in place, there has been an increased demand for alternative solutions – services like teleconferencing system Zoom recorded more active users in the first two months of 2020 than in all of 2019,” he said. “If we can work well together online now, perhaps it will permanently reduce the need for business travel and so emissions over the long term.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"CSIRO tests two potential COVID-19 vaccines in global race for a cure","date":"04-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/02\/coronavirus-vaccine-testing-csiro\/","transcript":"Fast-tracked testing of two potential vaccines is underway at Australia’s CSIRO in a critical milestone in the race to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. Australia’s national science agency is at the forefront of global vaccine testing, launching stage one trials on British and US prototypes – a major breakthrough in the global fight against coronavirus. It comes amid warnings that a vaccine is the only way to beat the coronavirus, which has now infected more than 911,000 people in 205 countries and is approaching the 1 million milestone. CSIRO biosecurity director Dr Rob Grenfell said the pre-clinical trials at the high-containment biosecurity facility in Geelong were significant given the rush by staff to get ready. “Usually it takes one to two years to do this and we have apparently done it in eight weeks, so that’s actually really good,” Dr Grenfell said. “These types of studies are vital to give us the confidence to move into human studies.” The two vaccine candidates were developed in record time by the University of Oxford in Britain and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego biotech company. The phase one trials, which are expected to take three months, will use animal subjects to test whether the potential vaccines are safe and effective. Australia’s COVID-19 cases have reached 4862 and the death toll rose to 21 on Wednesday as deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly warned the virus would not be beaten without a vaccine. Meanwhile, a new overseas study has uncovered the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus, finding 50 per cent of people who tested positive for it did not show symptoms. The study from Iceland, which tested 5 per cent of its population of 360,000 people – including those who were not considered at risk –  found 1 per cent of those tested had the virus and half of them were asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms. The discovery highlights the role of seemingly healthy people in spreading COVID-19 and the difficulty in containing a silent spreading illness. There are about 35 vaccines in various stages of development around the world, with best estimates that it could take 18 months for a cure to become available. The two prototype drugs are the first of many the CSIRO hopes to test and were identified for trials by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, in consultation with the World Health Organisation. Dr Grenfell understands that one of the vaccine candidates is also being tested overseas. If it is shown to be safe and effective in both trials, there would be a rapid conversion into human trials. Professor Trevor Drew, who leads CSIRO’s coronavirus and vaccine work, said they had been studying SARS CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, since January. “We are carefully balancing operating at speed with the critical need for safety in response to this global public health emergency,” Professor Drew said. Dr Grenfell said he was optimistic about the fight against COVID-19 but repeated that a vaccine was up to 18 months away. “The scientific ingenuity that we’re using, the global collaboration and co-operation is astounding,” he said. “We’ve seen some momentous science across many avenues of the vaccine development pathway globally, so yes, I’m optimistic. “At the moment, the best thing that we can all do is to maintain our social distancing and self-quarantining to minimise the spread whilst we’re waiting for effective drugs and vaccines.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"When coronavirus stopped sport, for athletes the work was just beginning","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-sport-australia\/","transcript":"The coronavirus chaos that has seen most sport cancelled worldwide has thrown many players and staff out of work, intruding on lives that previously ran to a seasonal rhythm. And while there had been high hopes in Australian sport that the federal government’s JobKeeper allowance may protect most participants, it is becoming clear that some will fall through the cracks – and not only the casual hot dog sellers. AAP has reported more than half of the A-League’s player pool may not be eligible for the government money, with 50 per cent of them out off-contract at the end of May. To be eligible, it’s understood players must be in continuous employment for a further six months. “Given the players have fixed-term contracts and those contracts expire at the conclusion of May, there is the prospect that those players may not be eligible,” Professional Footballers Australia chief John Didulica said on Wednesday. “It increases the burden that these players need to carry. “All things being equal, the clubs should be eligible for the subsidy. So, in turn, the players within those clubs should have the benefit of it. A-League clubs Perth Glory and Central Mariners have already stood down players, while Western Sydney, Adelaide United, Brisbane, Western United and Newcastle are expected to do so soon. The NRL has also sought clarification on how the subsidies can protect its minimum-wage players should the entire season be wiped out. The Rugby League Players Association on Wednesday had begun sorting through the finer details on a pay agreement with the NRL. Penrith chief executive Brian Fletcher has also admitted that junior development will be a major casualty of the shutdown, affecting jobs and the careers of up-and-comers. “We spend nearly $4 million in development. I can’t possibly see us being involved in all that in the future,” Fletcher told Sky Sports Radio. The AFL’s 18 clubs are also looking at JobKeeper assistance after the league and clubs stood down around 80 per cent of staff. All sporting bodies can expect a thorough review of their finances even after the coronavirus chaos subsides. Sponsorship and broadcast deals are likely to be reviewed and many are expecting longer term spending cuts to budgets, salary caps and staff. In the meantime, support staff for major clubs, teams and competitions are looking for work while the sporting world stops. Nine media reported this week that the coach of Richmond’s VFL team, Xavier Clarke, had offered to help find unskilled labour for coaching colleagues, via a national labour hire company, with support from the AFL Coaches’ Association. AFL senior coaches have remained on staff during the shutdown, on pay rates of less than 20 per cent of normal, but many assistants have been stood down. Media workers, both permanent and full-time, who rely on live sporting events are also feeling the pain. Formula one statistician for Sky’s Grand Prix coverage, Sean Kelly has detailed on Twitter his bid to make ends meet while the season remains in hiatus. In tennis, a sport where lower-level professional players have often struggled to eke out a living, a petition has been gathered by world No.375 Sofia Shapatava seeking assistance from the International Tennis Federation. “Not many will be able to support their everyday life and then come back to playing after three months without competition,” the 31-year-old Georgian said in her online petition, which has attracted more than 1350 signatures. The men’s ATP Tour and the WTA, which runs the women’s circuit, suspended all tournaments until early June. A 2018 International Review Panel report commissioned to address betting and integrity issues said that players in the lowest tiers were susceptible to corruption because of the difficulty in making a living. Only 250-350 players, the report said, earned enough to break even. The WTA and ATP told Reuters they were working behind the scenes to help the players. Still, with so much pain to go around there are some who feel that sports stars and media are the least of the world’s problems. With months to go until there’s any clarity on when sport can resume, expect there to be more economic pain ahead for everyone involved in the sporting world. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus canoodlers: Love finds a way as Vic and NSW axe ban on partner visits | The New Daily Love finds a way as Vic and NSW axe ban on partner visits","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/vic-and-nsw-axe-covid-19-ban-on-partner-visits\/","transcript":"A backlash over tough public health orders banning romantic couples catching up unless they live in the same home has prompted backflips in Victoria and New South Wales. The relaxation of the new rules in the nation’s two largest states means that couples around the country can still visit each other in permitted circumstances. It follows concerns that some of the new measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have unintended consequences and are unsustainable for six months. Television footage of citizens being told to move on by NSW police while enjoying the sun on a park bench have alarmed critics, but the new rules are far more relaxed in the nation’s capital. Canberrans have been granted permission to visit friends as long as no more than two people from outside the household are present. In Queensland and West Australia, anyone who lives alone can have a partner come to visit. People who live in share households can socialise with the family or roommates they live with, but if there are more than two people in the home, no visitors are allowed. In Tasmania, “social support” visits are exempted from the two-person rule, which means that families can visit relatives’ homes and couples can visit each others’ residences. Victorian chief medical officer Brett Sutton announced on Wednesday night that an exemption would be made for partners. “Regarding ‘Stay at Home’ rules: We have no desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners if they don’t usually reside together. We’ll be making an exemption. Hope that helps,” he tweeted. Dr Sutton told ABC radio that it was never the intention of the new rules to ban couples from seeing romantic partners. “It’s not really the policy intent that was required, we were acutely aware that for those that normally live together in a household they’re exposed to each other all the time,” Dr Sutton said. “I think it’s an issue of trying to work this out in a really rapid time, we’re seeing things change every day in terms of this epidemic. We’re implementing policy and legal directions that have never been done in this country previously.” Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville supported the move as a “good common sense outcome”, despite earlier telling journalists: “You cannot visit your partner for social reasons.” Earlier, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews had said it was against the rules to visit romantic partners during the lockdown. “That does not work, that’s not caregiving, that’s not medical care, that’s not shopping for the things you need when you need them, and it does not comply with the rules. People should not do that,” he said. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he regarded the right to visit your romantic partner as a mental health issue. “I would put that under ‘care’, absolutely,” he said. “Mental health, we get it, that’s under care. Absolutely under care.” “We need to look after each other – but don’t take the whole family with you, don’t take your grandparents,” he said. “I understand there’s lots of good questions but we’ve got to care for each other as well.” Dr Sutton also said he believed that people should be allowed to relax in a park, or on a park bench. “Look, I think it’s acceptable,” he said. “We obviously want to reinforce commonsense with all of this. “Other people might come to that shared space but you need to make sure you stay away from those individuals. But If you are out on your own, walking and not in close proximity to others, that is not a risk.” Dr Sutton said he accepted that some of the rules seemed at odds with the fact retailers and childcare centres are still open. “It is a challenge. There are some obvious things that don’t seem We are trying to strike a balance,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus restrictions: Can a tradie visit my property?","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/01\/can-tradie-visit-during-coronavirus-lockdown\/","transcript":"Tough social distancing rules aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 have dramatically restricted what we can and can’t do. Nationwide, social gatherings are limited to just two people, inside or outdoors. And in Victoria, the laws are so strict that Victorians are banned from inviting any visitors over at all – including a partner or a friend. So what do you do if your hot water suddenly stops working? Can you invite a plumber into your home or is that breaking the rules? Good news: You can. Tradespeople are exempt from the two-person rules. Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton says that if it’s work-related, then you are allowed to have a tradesperson over to your property. (So, yes, that rules out just inviting your mate over for a beer because he’s a tradie. He or she actually has to be there to fix something.) “If it’s work that can’t be done remotely, if it’s work (where) you can’t avoid (someone) coming to a property, then yes they can absolutely come to your property to do that work,” Mr Sutton told ABC radio. “If it can be avoided or if it can be deferred, terrific, but yes you’re allowed to.” To help limit the virus’ spread and make sure they are safe on the job, there are some new guidelines that tradespeople must follow. Before a tradie comes over, they are required to check if anyone at your property has been diagnosed with COVID-19, is a suspected case, has been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case, has recently returned from overseas or has flu-like symptoms, such as fever or a cough. They are also required to ask you to stay away from the area where they are working, and they must also practise good hygiene by washing their hands regularly or using sanitiser. After the tradie has left your property, you should disinfect the area where they worked as a precaution.

There’s some who are seeing the drastic shift as an opportunity – Tom Jacobson is one of them. Not only did he convert his Melbourne eatery Smoke & Pickles into a takeaway-only service, he launched a whole new platform to support out-of-work hospitality crew, and deliver some of the city’s best chefs straight to diners’ living rooms. Fairfeed Community Project works out of Jacobson’s site, and brings in a rotation of chefs to create one-off meals that are made available to diners for a smidgen of their usual cost. He’s kept his staff and brought in others who have lost work to help deliver the meals to the masses. There’s a $10.50 delivery fee (or you can pick it up) and $10 goes directly to the delivery driver. Working with local suppliers and producers, it’s a way of building community, Jacobson told The New Daily. Fairfeed opened last weekend, and this week they’ve had their first sell-out days. “You don’t know what’s going to happen at the start of any venture, but I think we’ve got some serious momentum now,” Jacobson says while helping to prep one of the meals for Wednesday night’s menu (char siu pork with Asian greens). “Last week helped supplement eight peoples’ wages, and this week so far we’ve helped five. It’s really cool and we’re doing some extremely good food. “There’s a lot of guys out there who are hurting, not just financially. “It’s hard to keep motivation out there as a chef – we like to be busy, we like pressure.” Jacobson says he’s excited to see what happens next for the project – he’s already got on board chefs from places like Pretty Little and Jungle Boy, and doesn’t want the collaboration to stop. “It’s a good opportunity to give people access to food and chefs that are extraordinarily talented that they’ve never had access to before, so easily,” he said. “There’s so much care and love going into these meals – I’m excited.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Face masks explained, who does and doesn’t need one","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-face-masks-explained\/","transcript":"Australians are increasingly taking precautions against the coronavirus more seriously. This is good. However, there’s still plenty of misinformation circulating in various channels that’s creating confusion, panic, and in some cases, contributing to dangerous practices. One of the biggest ones is masks. Go outside, and some people are wearing them. Some are not. So what’s the right thing to do? The advice all along, and at the time of writing, continues to be that the average healthy person does not need to wear a face mask of any kind. The World Health Organisation reiterated that message again this week in a live conference. “We don’t generally recommend the wearing of masks in public by otherwise well individuals because it has not up to now been associated with any particular benefit,” said Michael J. Ryan, who is the chief executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program. Media briefing on #COVID19 with @DrTedros. #coronavirus https:\/\/t.co\/TaP7YsqSaB — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 30, 2020 Why are masks unnecessary? Because the virus is spread by droplets – meaning you can catch it if you’re within one metre of a person with COVID-19 and they sneeze or cough and you inhale those virus particles, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face before washing your hands. It’s not airborne. So as long as you’re social distancing and washing your hands, you’re keeping yourself pretty safe.  You will be directed to wear a mask if you have to. If you’re not a healthcare worker, or someone who’s coming into close and constant contact with a positive COVID-19 case, the only reason you should be wearing one is if you’ve got the coronavirus yourself.  There has been talk of a shortage of the recommended masks, which has prompted nasty reports of people stealing and hoarding them. This puts at risk our health workers, who are already working under extremely tough conditions to save lives and help return our world to its normal rhythm. Put clearly: If you are healthy, if you are not a healthcare worker, if you are not caring for someone with the coronavirus, you do not need a mask. Wash your hands, and practise social distancing instead. People who are unnecessarily wearing masks can, in some circumstances, put themselves at a higher risk of catching COVID-19. Masks can lull people into a false sense of invincibility, the WHO said, causing them to skimp on proven prevention methods, like hand washing – which is one of the most effective ways of not getting COVID-19. And if you’re wearing a mask, you’re probably adjusting it a few times per shopping trip – therefore touching your face, which we’re not meant to be doing. The DIY attitude that’s emerging around the outbreak can be truly inspiring in some cases – people are getting back to making bread and growing vegetables. But straying into the realms of making your own hand sanitiser and face masks is not inspirational. Neither of these practices are recommended by health experts. And we will not be providing recipes or instructions on how to make either, because that is against all the expert advice available.  Home-made masks fall into the same ‘false sense of security’ territory as just unnecessarily wearing masks, University of the Sunshine Coast nursing lecturer Matt Mason said. Again: Home-made masks are not effective. They are potentially more dangerous than not wearing a mask at all. Mr Mason is consulting for the WHO through a global outbreak alert and response network program. Probably take his advice over an $1.99 crocheted mask pattern available from Etsy. “I would recommend that people do not make their own masks. Using appropriate social distancing, staying at home if unwell, strict adherence to hand hygiene and not touching your face is more effective,” he said. “For those promoting the use of home-made masks they need to fully consider the risks.” La Trobe University public health lecturer Adamm Ferrier really spelt it out, saying it was a waste of time. “Macramé, crocheted and knitted masks will no doubt appear, but will be as useful as a chocolate teapot. “People are far better off staying away from each other and maintaining a physical separation and washing their hands frequently,” Mr Ferrier said. Put the sewing kit down and go wash your hands."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus or 'just' the flu? It's very hard to tell","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-flu-cold\/","transcript":"As Australia enters winter and flu season gears up, every sniffle will be like a game of Russian roulette – is it influenza, a bad cold or COVID-19? Aches and pains, a sore throat, a dry cough. They are common symptoms of both illnesses, and as Australia has a limited number of coronavirus test kits, the cause can be hard to pin down. But COVID-19 isn’t ‘just the flu’. On Wednesday, research published in the medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases revealed the new coronavirus is far less deadly than we first thought, but still far higher than influenza. COVID-19 kills 0.66 per cent of those infected, much higher than the 0.1 per cent of people who are killed by the flu each year. If undetected cases are not taken into account, the COVID-19 death rate sits at 1.38 per cent, a number more consistent with earlier reports that it killed 2 per cent of those who caught it, the study found. “Estimating the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in real-time during its epidemic is very challenging,” Shigui Ruan, a professor in the department of mathematics at The University of Miami wrote in an accompanying commentary. Even though the fatality rate is low for younger people, it is clear that any suggestion of COVID-19 being just like influenza is false. We know about the flu and how typical symptoms include fever and aches, and that it comes on quickly. But doctors are still trying to understand the full picture of COVID-19, as the severity of symptoms can vary wildly. One patient can present with just a cough and mild fever, the next in critical condition, said Professor Nikolai Petrovsky from the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University. “Chinese studies showed that 50 per cent of infected people had no symptoms at all – this was particularly true for younger people,” Professor Petrovsky said. “Of all those who get infected, 80 per cent will have no or mild symptoms. Of the remaining 20 per cent who require hospital care about one in five may end up in ICU.” Essentially, it is impossible without a test. “These viruses have completely overlapping symptoms,” said Professor Petrovsky. “If in doubt, the only way is to run a diagnostic test on the throat or nasal swab. “Loss of smell has been described as an early symptom of COVID-19, so this may provide a clue. But the loss of smell is also common due to common cold or flu.”  The limited number of test kits available means we are testing only those likely to have the coronavirus, Monash University professor of medicine Paul Komesaroff said. “At the present time, testing is restricted. Too restricted, but they’re trying to ration the availability of tests because of the early rush on them,” he said. “That test doesn’t tell you if you’re going to be infected tomorrow. There was a lot of wasted resources. “What they did is strictly limit the test to those criteria.” The overlap of symptoms raises a difficult question for those with a bad cough, or a slight fever. If you have symptoms, should you self isolate to help flatten the curve? “The questions is, what’s the safe thing to do here?” said Professor Komesaroff. “You can’t have a situation where everyone isolates for two weeks when they get the most innocent of colds. “According to the current guidelines, if you’re not in a high risk or suspicious group, you wait for 24 hours and then you can consider yourself no longer infectious. “But that comes from the experience with influenza. It’s not particularly evidence-based.” Australian doctors should be able to test outside the criteria if a patient had suitable symptoms, Professor Komesaroff said. “There should be provision for a GP or others to be able to say ‘let’s do the test now’,” he said. “Even if this person doesn’t fall between that narrow criteria; that’s a significant limitation.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus crisis: Fair Work Commission backs greater flexibility on annual leave payments | The New Daily Fair Work Commission backs flexibility on leave payments","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-crisis-fair-work-commission-backs-greater-flexibility-on-annual-leave-payments\/","transcript":"Thousands of Australian workers are set to get access to up to two weeks’ unpaid leave if they are required to self-isolate due to the coronavirus. The Fair Work Commission has also provisionally ordered that workers on 103 modern awards – covering such sectors as hospitality, clerical, retail and cleaning – be entitled to greater flexibility to take accrued annual leave at half pay. The proposed variations would operate until June 30. The commission is keen to get moving on the change, closing the submission period on April 6. If no submissions are received opposing its view, the commission will determine it immediately. Otherwise a telephone hearing would be held on April 8. Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter says it would give employees and employers a greater ability to manage the impacts of the virus. “This reflects a key change already endorsed across key industry sector awards including restaurants, hospitality and the clerks’ private sector awards,” he said. Modern awards cover about 20 per cent of all employees in Australia. The government is expected to confirm to the commission that the new $1500-a-fortnight JobKeeper payment will be available to employees on unpaid leave, provided the employee and employer in question meet the eligibility criteria for the payment. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey found half of all businesses had already experienced an adverse impact as a result of COVID-19 while 86 per cent of businesses expected to be impacted in the coming months. Meanwhile, the Morrison government has backed an industry call for the annual wage review to be delayed. It was due to be completed by June 30, but the government argues more reliable economic data will be needed for the Fair Work Commission to make an informed decision. The government has already deferred the federal budget until October. “In light of rapidly evolving events relating to the coronavirus pandemic, the government’s position is that the commission should utilise any available mechanisms that enhance its ability to consider all economic data and other information relevant to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic when making its decision,” the government said in its submission. The commission also has the ability under “exceptional circumstances” to defer the start of an order if it chose to go down that path. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"OECD: Morrison is hopelessly optimistic about economic impact of coronavirus crisis | The New Daily OECD: PM is wrong about quick economic recovery","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/01\/oecd-says-recession-will-be-long-and-hard\/","transcript":"Australia’s proposal for the global economy to go into hibernation amid the coronavirus pandemic has been endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but it has warned countries will not “re-emerge very, very quickly” as Prime Minister Scott Morrison has suggested.

The Treasurer told the powerful group, which includes the United States and United Kingdom, the global economy should be put into a controlled hibernation while quarantine measures were in place to fight coronavirus. Mr Gurria told the ABC confinement was the best way to contain the spread of the virus. “We have to fight contagion, we have to stop the spread for human reasons, for ethical reasons, for moral reasons but also for very pragmatic reasons, in that the longer it lasts, the deeper we will be in the hole, the more GDP we will lose and the longer it will take to get out of the hole,” he said. “It is in everybody’s best economic and financial interest that the first part, the virus issue, lasts as little as possible.” “So I would agree with Josh [Frydenberg] that confinement or hibernation — call it what you want — … is the only way is to address the spread.” Economic hibernation is a key plank in Mr Morrison’s plan to contain the damage from coronavirus. He says it will “enable businesses to re-emerge very, very quickly” and “switch on again and get moving again” once the virus is contained. However, Mr Gurria suggested recovery would take time. “Once the confinement efforts have stopped, we are then going to have to pick up the pieces and they are going to be all over the place,” he said. “We are going to have a long period [of recovery] and it is going to be longer than just the time which we take to stop the spread of the virus itself.” “The economic and social consequences will unfortunately be felt for some time to come.” Despite global leaders holding regular teleconferences since the outbreak, Mr Gurria was very critical of the lack of coordination between nations and said they were not doing enough to fight the spread of the virus. “[It has been] less than they should, less than they could, and less than what is needed,” he said. “So they are talking, they are understanding what the others are doing … but greater coordination has still a lot to grow and thus to benefit.” He said their lack of coordination meant the impact on the global economy would be much worse than previously hoped. “For every month of [non-containment of the virus] there will be a 2 per cent reduction in GDP growth,” he said. “We are now talking about recessionary scenario for most countries in the world.” In early March the OECD forecast global growth would halve to just over 1 per cent for this year. Mr Gurria said he now expected it to fall 5 per cent or more. But he praised the Australian Government’s stimulus response to the economic fallout. “It means you’re moving quite actively and with great agility in responding to the challenges, as have a number of countries,” he said. “Now the biggest question is coordination among countries. Any country that wants to go it alone does so at its own peril.” A major concern for the OECD is the potential for widespread social unrest. Recent work by the OECD, whose members account for about a fifth of the global population, found one third of OECD households would fall into poverty if they had to forgo three months’ income. It also suggested half of middle-class people in OECD countries would fall below the middle-class level if they lost only three months of income. Your questions on coronavirus answered: Mr Gurria said the OECD was “extremely worried” this would happen, given the shutdowns across the globe. “You are going to have millions of people who are going to be in that situation, and therefore the impact on inequality will be very severe,” he said. There would be serious economic, financial and political consequences. “Already you are looking at this crisis on top of what was very clear rising discontent around the world,” he said. “This makes the most vulnerable hit the hardest and you are going to see a lot of very serious tensions, social tensions, political tensions.” He suggested governments should “drop the rule book” on government spending and managing debt. “The ultimate duty of governments is to protect the people, to see after the wellbeing of the people, and in this case to protect them against this very harsh and dramatic impact that they are suffering,” he said. Eventually governments would have to account for the costs, but for the time being they needed to keep pouring money into economies so people could stay home, he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Good signs' for Australia – but only a vaccine will eradicate coronavirus","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/australia-curve-coronavirus\/","transcript":"“Good signs” are emerging in Australia’s fight to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, but only a vaccine will eliminate the virus, deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says. “There is this group of researchers around the world very much linked-in to develop a vaccine,” Professor Kelly said. “But vaccines for coronaviruses are not easy. In fact up to now we have never had a successful vaccine against a coronavirus. So this is experimental times,” he said, adding that a usable vaccine could be 12 to 18 months away. “I think we are hoping for a [vaccine], but we can’t just wait for a [vaccine] so therefore we are using what we have right now which are the public health measures that we have all become aware of in recent days,” Professor Kelly said. “I don’t think we can eliminate the virus without a vaccine,” he added. Australia recorded another COVID-19 death on Wednesday, and topped 4800 cases nationwide, but Professor Kelly said the daily increase in confirmed infections was slowing. “In terms of the measures that have been introduced, I think there is good signs now that that is actually working as we had expected,” he told the ABC on Wednesday. “I think this is full credit to the Australian public, who have really taken on enormous changes in their lives over the last few weeks. “We are continuing to get more cases but the curve is flattening and, rather than thinking about a peak we should be thinking about a long haul. That’s really the most important thing.” Australia’s coronavirus death toll rose to 20 on Wednesday, with the death of a 95-year-old woman from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Sydney. It came as NSW Health set up a pop-up COVID-19 testing clinic at Bondi to reduce the spread of the coronavirus after clusters developed within Sydney’s backpacker community. In recent days, states and territories have further tightened movement and social distancing restrictions on millions of people. There have been reports of people being moved on from Sydney parks and gym-goers being fined or warned for flouting stringent regulations in the city’s south. Professor Kelly said the new laws – “difficult as they are” – had brought a decrease in other health issues that often took up intensive care beds. That included changes to elective surgery and a reduction in trauma cases from things such as car accidents and street violence. “Some of those things that are often filling our ICUs with those unfortunate events are not happening. So the capacity has increased,” he said. The majority of coronavirus cases across Australia were still linked to international travel – either in returned travellers or cruise ship passengers, or in people directly linked to those cases. Where there had been local transmission, there was usually an obvious link to a confirmed case. “There are very good signs … particularly in the states that have the most cases,” Professor Kelly said. “But it is not time to take the foot off the brake. We need to continue those measures – possibly for some months.” The looming winter was an unknown factor for the coronavirus outbreak  in Australia, he said. Australians – especially those who were vulnerable – should also have influenza vaccinations. Professor Kelly confirmed that official government modelling of the coronavirus spread across Australia was likely to be released soon. “We will discuss the modelling and look to make that transparent in coming days,” he said. But he cautioned that modelling could be misinterpreted – and could also be wrong."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"US aircraft carrier in crisis as Trump steams into reverse on cruise ship","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/us-coronavirus-aircraft-carrier\/","transcript":"The US’s response to the coronavirus continues to highlight cracks in the nation’s governance, with Donald Trump reversing his position on cruise liners at the same time as the crew of a navy aircraft carrier pleads for help with an onboard outbreak. The US death toll from the coronavirus has climbed past 3500, eclipsing China’s official count, and there is mounting concern about infection rates in New York, which threaten to swamp the health services. On Tuesday (local time), Mr Trump warned Americans to brace for a “rough two-week period” ahead as the White House released new projections that there could be 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the US from the coronavirus pandemic, even if current social distancing guidelines are maintained. On Wednesday, a leaked memo indicated the captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt faced a growing outbreak and had wanted to be allowed to isolate the bulk of his roughly 5000 crew onshore to try to save lives. In a memo to Navy leaders, Captain Brett Crozier said the coronavirus spread was accelerating and removing 90 per cent of his crew from teh carrier was a “necessary risk”. The ship is docked in Guam. Navy leaders are scrambling to determine how to best respond to the extraordinary request as dozens of crew members have tested positive for the coronavirus. “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” Captain Crozier said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press. US Pacific Fleet commander Admiral John Aquilino said on Tuesday that the Navy was working to get as many sailors as possible to shore, while still maintaining a core crew to monitor the ship’s nuclear reactors and keep it running. While that crisis was unfolding, Mr Trump urged Florida officials to open an Atlantic Coast port to a Dutch cruise ship stuck at sea with an outbreak onboard. Weighing in on the fate of Holland America Line’s MS Zaandam during a White House briefing, the US president said he would call Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Mr DeSantis has declared the vessel unwelcome in his state, to prevent its sick passengers from being “dumped” there. “They’re dying on the ship,” Mr Trump said, adding, “I’m going to do what’s right, not only for us but for humanity.” The remarks contrast with his response in February to a different cruise ship, the Grand Princess, which he said should remain at sea instead of coming into port in California. The Zaandam, which had been idling off the Pacific coast of Central America after the cruise line said some passengers had the coronavirus and four had died, was allowed to sail through the Panama Canal into the Caribbean on Sunday. Nearly two-thirds of the passengers – those who passed a medical screening – were moved onto the Zaandam’s sister ship, the Rotterdam, before the canal transit. Both vessels are headed to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, officials said. The Zaandam was carrying nearly 1050 passengers and crew, and the Rotterdam almost 1450. But it remained uncertain who would be permitted to disembark in Florida, where concerns about the spread of coronavirus are mounting. “We cannot afford to have people who aren’t even Floridians dumped into South Florida using up those valuable resources,” Mr DeSantis told Fox News on Monday, referring to the state’s medical facilities. He said he preferred to send medical help to the Zaandam. But in a blog posted the website of Holland America, a unit of world cruise leader Carnival Corp, company president Orlando Ashford urged authorities to show compassion. “We are dealing with a ‘not my problem’ syndrome,” he said. “The international community, consistently generous and helpful in the face of human suffering, shut itself off to Zaandam.” In New York, which is considered the epicentre of the virus crisis in the US, governor Andrew Cuomo said his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, has become infected. “There’s a lesson in this,” Governor Cuomo said of his 49-year-old brother, who is now in quarantine. “He’s an essential worker, a member of the press so he’s been out there. If you go out there, the chance that you get infected is very high.” There have already been about 1550 coronavirus deaths in New York State, the majority of them in New York City. A Navy hospital ship with 1000 beds that docked in New York on Monday was expected to begin accepting non-coronavirus patients on Tuesday. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Couple confusion: Can you visit your partner under coronavirus laws or not? | The New Daily","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-couples-visit-partner\/","transcript":"**UPDATED 5.32pm** As social distancing laws aimed at curbing COVID-19 become increasingly restrictive around the country, confusion reigns about whether people can visit their partners. It comes as Australia’s coronavirus death toll rose to 21 on Wednesday afternoon with the death of a patient at Orange, in Central West New South Wales. The death has taken the NSW toll to 10. To try to slow the virus’ spread, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania have introduced tough public health orders, giving police the power to fine or arrest people who leave home without a reasonable excuse. But the crackdown has left couples who live apart wondering, ‘Can I be fined for visiting my partner under the new rules? Or is visiting them a reasonable excuse to leave home?’. On Wednesday morning, NSW Police Commissioner Mike Fuller confirmed people were allowed to visit their partners in that state, under exemptions for “care” – which includes mental health. Asked if people could still visit their “boyfriend or girlfriend”, Mr Fuller said: “Absolutely, that’s under care.” “Mental health is under care,” he said.  “I think we have to look after each other, but don’t take the whole family with you. Don’t take your grandparents.” The clarification came after NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people could leave their homes only for work or education, medical reasons, to buy essentials or to exercise. Confusion has also been mounting in Victoria, where couples were initially told they could not visit each other if they lived separately, but later told they could. On Wednesday afternoon, just hours after announcing it was against the rules for people to visit their partners, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews backflipped. When questioned about the ban on Wednesday morning, Mr Andrews said: “People should not do that”. “That’s not work, that’s not care-giving, that’s not medical care, that’s not shopping for the things you need when you need them, and it does not comply with the rules,” he said. However by 5pm that afternoon, the premier had experienced a change of heart. Regarding ‘Stay at Home’ rules: We have no desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners if they don’t usually reside together. We’ll be making an exemption.    Hope that helps. — Chief Health Officer, Victoria (@VictorianCHO) April 1, 2020 The New Daily understands partners in Victoria can visit each other under the stay-at-home rules, but they must practise good hygiene and social distancing, including standing 1.5 metres apart. In Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory, you can visit a partner. In Queensland, you can leave home to provide care to an “immediate member of the person’s family”, but there is no provision for leaving to care for anyone else. This seems to imply you cannot visit a partner unless you’re married to them. In Western Australia and the ACT, the rules are not clear. However, WA has restrictions on regional travel, meaning you cannot visit a partner if they live in a different region. Under national rules, two people are allowed to exercise together. Victorian Police and Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville earlier tweeted “you cannot visit your partner for social reasons. There are select reasons you can go to the home of your partner. They are outlined clearly in the directives of the CHO which you can find and read at: https:\/\/dhhs.vic.gov.au\/coronavirus.” You cannot visit your partner for social reasons.

They are outlined clearly in the directives of the CHO which you can find and read at: https:\/\/t.co\/lZt5A46ROh — Lisa Neville (@LisanevilleMP) March 31, 2020  “I know it does seem very harsh,” she said. “But it is part of the directive of the chief health officer based on how this virus can easily spread moving from household to household.” Mr Andrews said people had to ask themselves whether their actions were “worth a life” before visiting a partner or friend. “If you don’t need to do it, don’t do it. That’s a very, very simple thing,” he said. “Stay at home, preserve the health system and save lives. We’ve got a long way to go and I know I’m asking a lot. “We’ve all got to play our part, and I’m very proud of Victorians who are, and I’ve got a message for those who aren’t: you will be caught and the fines are significant, but it’s not dollars, it’s lives. That’ll be the true cost of you breaking these rules.” Mr Andrews said at least eight fines had been issued for people breaching physical distancing rules and thanked Victoria Police for working in “very challenging circumstances”. He said the fines were issued to people who breached the two-person rule and others who left their home before finishing 14 days of quarantine. “The fines are steep. They are a very significant cost if you get caught, and you will get caught if you’re doing the wrong thing. “But ultimately no gathering, no party, no choice that you make is worth someone else’s life.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Creativity in a global pandemic: Nick Cave says it's an indulgence","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/04\/01\/nick-cave-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Australian musician Nick Cave says creating new music and writing during self-isolation was his first instinct as an artist, but he now sees it as an indulgence from a bygone era. Cave and his band The Bad Seeds were forced to abandon a European tour when the coronavirus crisis unfolded. He said his initial response was to jump into “overdrive with ideas of how to fill that space”. However, in his regular Red Hand files – in which Cave responds to fans’ wide-ranging questions and comments – the musician, novelist and screenwriter said it is not a time to be buried in the act of creating. “Together we have stepped into history and are now living inside an event unprecedented in our lifetime,” Cave wrote from his British home in Brighton. “What deranged and divided us a month ago seems, at best, an embarrassment from an idle and privileged time. We have become eyewitnesses to a catastrophe that we are seeing unfold from the inside out. “We are forced to isolate – to be vigilant, to be quiet, to watch and contemplate the possible implosion of our civilisation in real time. “We will know something of our resilience, our capacity for forgiveness, and our mutual vulnerability. Perhaps, it is a time to pay attention, to be mindful, to be observant. “As an artist, it feels inapt to miss this extraordinary moment. Suddenly, the acts of writing a novel, or a screenplay or a series of songs seem like indulgences from a bygone era … “It is a time to take a backseat and use this opportunity to reflect on exactly what our function is – what we, as artists, are for. Cave started the Red Hand files conversation with his fans in response to the death of his 15-year-old son Arthur in 2015. He admitted his response to a crisis has always been to create. “This impulse has saved me many times — when things got bad I’d plan a tour, or write a book, or make a record — I’d hide myself in work, and try to stay one step ahead of whatever it was that was pursuing me. He said when the recent tour was cancelled, he held a video call with colleagues and considered streaming a solo concert from his home, writing an isolation album or an apocalyptic film script. But the performer said he then considered all the recent work he had done, including concerts with violinist Warren Ellis and the Melbourne and Sydney symphony orchestras and thought it was time to just step back. “There are other forms of engagement, open to us all,” Cave writes. “An email to a distant friend, a phone call to a parent or sibling, a kind word to a neighbour, a prayer for those working on the front lines. These simple gestures can bind the world together – throwing threads of love here and there, ultimately connecting us all – so that when we do emerge from this moment we are unified by compassion, humility and a greater dignity. “Perhaps, we will also see the world through different eyes, with an awakened reverence for the wondrous thing that it is. This could, indeed, be the truest creative work of all.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus cruise ships in standoffs with Australian authorities","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/cruise-ships-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Cruise ships on opposite sides of Australia are locked in standoffs with authorities about their immediate fate. The German cruise ship Artania – on which scores of people became infected with coronavirus – remains docked at Fremantle, despite being ordered by Australian Border Force to leave. It has 12 passengers still on board, some of them too unwell or frail to fly home. There are also about 500 crew – who have asked to remain in port for another two weeks. The two-week timeframe is seen as a way to determine whether anyone still on board the Artania has the virus, and to ensure they can be treated if they do. The standoff came as Australia’s coronavirus toll rose to 20 on Wednesday, with the death of a 95-year-old woman in a Sydney hospital. Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter said WA had a humanitarian obligation to ensure the Artania’s frail and ill passengers were fit for their journey home. Seven people from the ship are in intensive care in Perth hospitals, which are also treating dozens of other patients from the vessel. Hundreds of Artania passengers flew home to Frankfurt from Perth at the weekend. “My information is that there are still 12 passengers on board, some of whom are very unwell and their level of either illness of frailty is such that they cannot get in a plane,” Mr Porter told 6PR radio on Wednesday. “We’ve got a responsibility to those passengers to ensure the West Australian health system gives them the available attention to ensure that they don’t – if I could put this bluntly – die on the voyage home because they’ve not received proper attention. “We have a humanitarian obligation.” However, Premier Mark McGowan wants the ship to leave immediately. “I’m very disappointed and I’d urge the Australian Border Force and the federal government to take steps to get the ship away,” Mr McGowan said Wednesday. “We’ve got to get the ship on its way. It has to go back to Germany,” he added. An ABF spokesman confirmed all foreign-owned cruise ships had been ordered to leave Australian waters. But Mr Porter said the Artania did not need to go immediately. Fremantle Ports has the Artania scheduled to leave at midday on Friday. Meanwhile, the operator of the Ruby Princess cruise ship – one of nine cruise ships either docked in NSW or waiting off the coast – has asked the NSW government to take a humanitarian approach to its crew members who are ill with COVID-19. On Tuesday, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller urged foreign cruise ships lingering in Australian waters to return to their home ports immediately, fearing they might flood Australian hospitals with sick passengers and crew. “All the hard work we’ve done could be over. We will continue to allow them to have fuel and food … but it is time to go to your port of origin,” Mr Fuller said. Carnival Australia, however, said it was not safe for the ship to sail away from Australia with sick crew members on board. “While illness on board has been reduced due to strong health management, the ship needs to remain within reach of Australia to access healthcare services if an urgent need arises,” the company said on Wednesday. Six seriously ill crew members have already been transferred from the Ruby Princess to NSW hospitals. The PM said on 15 March that the federal government would stop the cruise ships. That did not happen. 4 days later the Ruby Princess arrived and disembarked all its passengers – without screening or quarantine. The calamitous results keep piling up. 👇 https:\/\/t.co\/OTR94fg4H1 — Kristina Keneally (@KKeneally) March 31, 2020  Carnival said it is “in high-level federal and state discussions with the aim of enabling the repatriation on compassionate and humanitarian grounds”. There are 1100 crew on the Ruby Princess from 51 countries. The ship is registered in Bermuda, but Carnival says its home port is effectively Sydney as it was in Australia on a six-month cruise season. The Ruby Princess has become a major source of COVID-19 cases in Australia after infected passengers were allowed to disembark without adequate checks. There are 324 coronavirus infections in NSW linked to cruise ships, including 211 cases from the Ruby Princess and 79 from the Ovation of the Seas. The Guardian is reporting at least 440 passengers across six states and two territories had tested positive for COVID-19 after disembarking from cruise ships. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Joke's on us as April Fools pandemic highlights life's absurdities | The New Daily","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/01\/april-fools-coronavirus\/","transcript":"If you’re looking for some April Fool’s pranks to cheer you up during the coronavirus pandemic, then perhaps that’s the biggest joke of all. As the world mourns and borders close, the self-isolation policies being imposed by governments mean many families are suffering through a cascade of dad jokes that cannot be escaped from or ignored. Vegemite on the toilet seat … check! Alcohol sales banned during lockdown … yep, mum panicked at that one! All sport, schools and work closed for months … gotcha a beauty! Oh wait, those last ones are true. The reality is that some of the world’s biggest news stories read like one long April Fool’s Day joke. For instance, did you hear the one about Australia’s all-powerful Border Force that knows the location of every Indonesian fishing boat in northern waters, but apparently has no role to play when waving returning cruise ship passengers into central Sydney? One Twitter wag even got a few hearts racing after claiming Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton had resigned over the Ruby Princess debacle. April Fool’s! He’s just missing, not gone. Traditionally April Fool’s pranks have been the specialist domain of the under-12s and FM radio talking heads, with a few advertising men thrown in for good measure. This year, with the world going to hell in a not-so-funny handbag, the marketing men have taken a backseat in fear of getting their timing wrong and blowing up the last two bob of revenue they have coming in. One mob that was not scared of frightening the customers was Optus Sport … which – in an era of no televised live sport – hardly has any customers to worry about. Instead, it offered up marble racing. Search engine company Google ignored the tradition of setting up a page dedicated to pranking people, saying it wanted to show respect for those fighting the pandemic. “Our highest goal right now is to be helpful to people, so let’s save the jokes for next April, which will undoubtedly be a whole lot brighter than this one,” the company said in a statement to staff. And while social media was full of warnings not to joke about the coronavirus – particularly fake diagnostic positives – the governments of India, Taiwan and Thailand have outlawed April Fool’s pranks altogether, with prison terms for offenders. Thailand warned on its Twitter account that there would be harsh penalties for anyone who made April Fool’s jokes about having the coronavirus. It was left to one brave political protestor to offer up his view of the Thai government. Of course, if you’re determined to keep up the April Fool’s tradition in a time of anxiety and family lockdowns, the New York Post – in a unique act of a bastardry – has offered a handy hints guide that includes “swap out the family photos”, “pretend to be typing forever” and that old laugh-a-minute favourite “flatulence”.

The support package includes $110 million to coordinate flights from Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to deliver fresh produce to China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Return flights, under the program, will provide an opportunity for Australia to import medical equipment and medicines. Wednesday’s announcement by Trade Minister Simon Birmingham also waived $10 million in Commonwealth fishery fees and added almost $50 million to the government’s existing export grants program to reimburse marketing costs to exporters. The exports lifeline follows months of uncertainty for the seafood sector, hit hard when markets in China collapsed early in the COVID-19 crisis. Other winners include red meat, dairy and horticulture exporters that have relied on cargo in passenger aircraft to deliver their produce. Since new regulations on air travel were introduced to curb the spread of the pandemic, exporters, fishers and farmers have struggled to maintain access to high-value overseas markets. The government has appointed former Toll Holdings managing director and former Linfox chief executive Michael Byrne as its international freight coordinator to oversee the program, working with airlines and exporters. “Necessary public health restrictions are already placing massive pressure on business viability and job security,” Senator Birmingham said. “We can’t afford for our farmers, fishers and exporters to be under similar pressure just because they can’t get their goods onto a plane. “When these flights return to Australia there will be capacity for them to transport vital medical supplies, medicines and equipment, which will be critical to the ongoing health response.” West Australian abalone exporter Brad Adams has seen his sales plummet since Hong Kong, Singapore and China went into lockdown. Approximately 80 per cent of his product is sent overseas, with the remaining 20 per cent sold around Australia. Before the pandemic, his ASX-listed company, Ocean Grown Abalone, had a market value of $30 million. That’s now halved. He said the government freight assistance wouldn’t solve all his financial problem, but it was a lifeline. “The market we had in Australia has collapsed because there’s no restaurants open, there’s no Chinese tourists, so that important market is gone and probably will be gone for a long time,” he said. “Overseas, obviously demand isn’t what it used to be, but at least we can now get some out.” Mr Adams said, with restrictions lifting in Asia, he had already started to receive orders from customers. But the lack of commercial passenger flights in and out of Australia had left his product stranded. “As the COVID-19 restrictions have been reasonably successful, people are now on the streets, eating out as usual, so we’re seeing our customers start placing orders again,” he said. “So we thought great, we’ll send you some product. Then we started finding out about the options of getting air freight – there was no way of getting it out.” Jennie Franceschi sources fresh fruit and vegetables from around Australia, to send to customers overseas, mainly in Asia. In the past four weeks her export business has ground to a halt. While she did not expect much improvement in the months to come, she said the government freight assistance would be an important tool to help secure ongoing trade. “By keeping Australian exporters exporting and keeping our produce out there, what it will do is secure the position for Australia in those countries,” she said. “Because if other countries move in, then we’ve got to try and win it back, which is hard slog.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"News Corp to suspend 60 community newspapers because of coronavirus","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/news-corp-coronavirus\/","transcript":"News Corp says it will suspend printing of 60 community newspapers in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia from April 9.

But DP World Australia chief operating officer Andrew Adam said the ship was cleared to berth by Australian Border Force. “Any crew members aboard a vessel that has been to mainland China, must have been at sea for 14 days before they are allowed to dock in Australia,” he said on Wednesday. “The union is not allowed to unilaterally declare a vessel unsafe: They are not allowed to create their own set of rules.” The vessel is believed to be carrying toilet rolls, surgical masks, shoe coverings, chemicals for the manufacture of soap and detergent, surgical gowns, laboratory coats, hair nets, tin food and whitegoods. Some 22 wharfies were stood down on Tuesday night, followed by another 40 on Wednesday morning, DP World said. MUA national assistant secretary Warren Smith defended the union’s stance, saying it didn’t want to see a repeat of Sydney’s Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle. “The largest cluster of COVID-19 cases in Australia – which has already claimed several lives and caused hundreds of illnesses – was the result of inadequate measures put in place for the arrival of ships,” he said. “What’s the difference with this ship?” A large number of the coronavirus cases in NSW involves passengers who were on the Ruby Princess and disembarked on March 19.

Victoria has recorded another 51 cases of coronavirus overnight, bringing the total to 968. Community transmissions are now at 39 — another rise, while six people are in intensive care. “If we all work together, we can be successful, or as successful as possible and avoid those terrible scenes that we see on our TVs every day in places like Italy and some parts of the US, France and Spain,” Mr Andrews said. “We have to do everything we can to avoid that. This $1.3 billion is a big part of it, but it’s no more important than every single Victorian doing the right thing — stay at home, protect the health system, save lives.” Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says the package will increase the number of intensive care beds in the state from about 500 to 4,500. It will also fund things like personal protective equipment “that will be needed as we go forward”. “This is worst-case scenario planning. We hope that we will never need to actually use this type of capacity in Victoria, and it is incumbent on all of us to do our bit and to make sure that this capacity won’t actually be needed.” Mr Andrews said the social distancing measures implemented in Victoria were making a difference. “It is helping us to suppress the total number of cases, to flatten the curve as we sometimes say, to protect our health system and to save lives,” he said. The Premier warned if Victorians ignore the state’s enforcement measures, “there are very significant penalties”. “Because if these rules aren’t followed, people will die.

It comes after reports of people being moved on from Sydney parks and gym-goers seen to be fined or warned for flouting social distancing rules in the city’s south. But police say they have also been spat on and abused while dealing with NSW residents at parks and beaches. On Wednesday, Mr Fuller said police were only enforcing the laws, which can include six months in jail and $11,000 fines. Gatherings of more than two people – apart from immediate family – are banned across NSW, and residents are urged to stay at home where possible. “If you need medical assistance, pharmacies, doctors, the hospital – you can leave [your home].

South Australia’s chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier told ABC radio the new cases were confirmed overnight, although she initially couldn’t say how many there were. Later on Wednesday, SA Health confirmed confirmed 11 baggage handlers at the airport had come down with the virus – as had two of their family members. South Australia recorded an overall increase of 30 cases on Wednesday, reaching a total of 367. SA Health said more than 100 other workers were self-isolating after the outbreak, but there was no need to close the airport at this stage. However, it advised anyone who has passed through the airport or its carpark in the past two weeks to self-isolate and seek a test if they develop COVID-19 symptoms. Professor Spurrier said the affected Qantas staff worked in a relatively confined area – which had prompted concerns about the further spread of the virus. “This is a serious situation,” she said. “We’ve met with Qantas and we’re looking at implementing some workarounds to ensure baggage can be off-loaded.” On Tuesday, a Qantas flight headed for Adelaide was forced to turn back to Sydney because of the airport cluster. The airline briefly suspended flights to Adelaide after the discovery, but they had resumed by early Wednesday. Passengers who had arrived in Adelaide on flights in the past few days were advised to wipe their baggage. There were no concerns for other areas of the airport. Professor Spurrier said the jump showed patient numbers would shift as the pandemic continued and emphasised the importance of restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus. “The social distancing, the quarantining, the hygiene, all of these things need to be kept up,” she said. “We’ve got to keep our foot down, not on the accelerator but on the brake.” -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Older Australians targeted in push for April influenza jabs","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/australians-flu-jab-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Over-65s are being urged to book in for “free” new influenza vaccines as hospitals brace for the impact of winter flu cases at the same time as they grapple with the COVID-19 crisis. The new four-strain Fluad Quad shot offers no protection against the coronavirus pandemic, but Health Minister Greg Hunt hopes it will help doctors reduce the numbers of seasonal flu cases and – as a result – make it easier to spot a COVID-19 case that can involve similar symptoms. Mr Hunt announced on Wednesday that 13.5 million doses of seasonal flu vaccines (including Fluad Quad, which is designed for older adults) had been approved for all Australians under the National Immunisation Program in a bid to further sandbag the health system in the fight against coronavirus. Pregnant women, indigenous Australians and children aged between six months and five years will also secure the new flu shot for free. Other Australians can get the vaccine but will need to pay for it. “Receiving a vaccination from April provides optimal protection in the peak period of influenza circulation, usually from June to September in most parts of Australia,’’ Mr Hunt said. “This year it is even more important to be vigilant about the flu because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Morrison government has so far resisted calls for a government-backed volunteer scheme. But multiple communities and Facebook groups are already offering similar schemes in suburbs across Australia. In Britain, the National Health Service was inundated when it asked for volunteers under a similar scheme to help deliver food and medicines to seniors. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the plan on Wednesday, urging volunteers to call to register to help. “I want Queenslanders to join our care army and support a senior in your suburb,” she said. “We can all do this. What does it mean? It means basic things, there may be someone living next door, or down the road, it’s about checking in, getting their contact number, leaving something in their letterbox, or contacting a number we are going to give to you shortly, and hopping on the phone and saying, how are you?. Do you want to have a chat about things? The Queensland government said volunteers would be asked to practice social distancing and care to protect the health of seniors when dropping off supplies. “It’s also about doing some grocery shopping for them, and leaving it at their front door. And perhaps they may leave a script in their letter box and you can go and get the script,” she said. “I know some people have already started phoning up the Queensland government. We’re going to be inundated, I know that, and that is fantastic. But please be patient. We got about 30 people at the moment, they’re ready to take your calls. This is your chance to make a difference.” Queensland Labor frontbencher Kate Jones urged people to talk to seniors in their own family to ask about their needs. “Last time we had a crisis, we asked Queenslanders to put on their gumboots. Today, we’re asking Queenslanders to make a call,” she said. “As the Premier said, we know the most vulnerable people in our community, that are most vulnerable to coronavirus, are actually our seniors. “We’re calling on all Queenslanders to think about who, in your own life, are those people who are over 65, or over 70, that you know, that you can help with key basics such as groceries, medicine, and also companionship. Ms Jones said her own family had made the call not to see her mother, who is in her 60s, because she is also the primary carer for the family’s 91-year-old grandmother. “We as a family had to make a decision that my mother can no longer see my children while she’s the primary carer of a 91-year-old. That’s a family decision,” she said. “We’re calling on other families across Queensland to sit down, call each other, think about what is the best way that you can support the most vulnerable in your own family, to ensure they are getting the support services that they need.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australia records 20th coronavirus death","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/01\/australia-records-20th-coronavirus-death\/","transcript":"Another resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Sydney has died from COVID-19.

The meeting saw the economic leaders of the world’s top economies discuss a new plan to address the risk of debt vulnerabilities in low-income countries hit by the pandemic, and deliver financial aid to emerging markets. Mr Frydenberg said leaders should take quick, strong and co-ordinated action to “minimise the permanent human and economic damage.” “First, our priority should be putting the global economy into controlled hibernation while quarantine measures are in place,” he said in a statement. “That is — finance the global health response, maintain financial stability, minimise job losses, keep businesses going, and ensure the basic needs of the global population are met. “This includes committing to a G20 fiscal support target, to encourage all economies to act urgently, and send a clear signal to citizens that the G20 is doing whatever it takes.” Australia’s own economic hibernation strategy involves $130-billion worth of wage subsidies to try to keep as many people in jobs as possible, even if businesses close for up to six months. Mr Frydenberg also said the G20 must lead the long-term global recovery once the health crisis passes, and that all members should unblock global supply chains, especially for vital medical supplies.

It said roles for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in deploying resources and exploring measures to alleviate a lack of liquidity in emerging markets were discussed. G20 leaders pledged last week to inject over US$5 trillion ($8.2 trillion) into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the outbreak, while working to ease supply disruptions caused by border closures intended to limit transmission of the virus. They also committed to fund all necessary measures to stop the virus’s spread and expressed concern about the risks to fragile countries, notably in Africa. They told their top finance officials to coordinate regularly with each other and with international organisations to develop an action plan in response to the pandemic. G20 trade ministers agreed on Monday to keep their markets open and ensure the continued flow of vital medical supplies, equipment and other essential goods. The group has been accused of being slow to respond to the outbreak, which is expected to trigger a global recession as governments impose curfews and shut businesses.

To put that in context, it’s 500 more than the number of Americans who died in the 9\/11 terror attacks which until this point have been considered one of the country’s deadliest events. It’s also more than China’s official count of its COVID-19 deaths – despite a population 1.1 billion higher than the US, and the virus first taking off in Wuhan. By Wednesday morning, American authorities were dealing with 181,099 COVID-19 cases, making it the worst place in the world for the virus (Italy had 105,792 and Spain had 94,417). New Yorkers are suffering most, with 1550 in that state alone. But it’s looking increasingly likely that Beijing has not been accurately reporting its figures – meaning the true extent of the crisis in the original epicentre is not known. Worldwide, more than 800,000 people were infected and more than 40,000 people had died of the virus by Wednesday morning, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Figures on deaths and infections around the world are supplied by government health authorities and compiled by Johns Hopkins. But the data is regarded with skepticism by public health experts because of different counting practices a lack of testing in some places, and the numerous mild cases that have been missed. There’s also growing concern that some countries – including China, North Korea and Indonesia – are downplaying the severity of the crisis. China has been claiming it has curbed domestic cases, reporting on Tuesday just one new death from the coronavirus and 48 new cases. It said all new infections had come from overseas. But officials there have admitted that it has not been including in its figures people who have tested positive but do not show symptoms of the virus. That looks set to change, with Beijing indicating it may have finally bowed to global pressure to start reporting asymptomatic patients. On Tuesday, China announced more than 1,500 coronavirus cases that had not previously been made public, The New York Times reported. But that could be just a fraction of the real number of cases. Last week, Hong-Kong based newspaper The South China Morning Post cited classified government information that showed asymptomatic cases could be as high as 43,000. Chang Jile, director of the commission’s Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said China would step up screening and investigation of asymptomatic cases (which can still be infectious). Indonesia has also changed its tune after initially claiming the virus had not hit any of its islands. On Tuesday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo declared a public health emergency. Medical experts have said Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most-populous country, must impose tighter restrictions on movements. Known cases of the disease have gone from none in early March to 1528 by Wednesday morning, with 136 deaths. Indonesia suspended all foreign arrivals on Tuesday after a study showed more than 140,000 people in the country could die of the virus without tougher action. Dr. Takeshi Kasai, the World Health Organisation’s regional director for the Western Pacific has cautioned that the risk in Asia and the Pacific “will not go away as long as the pandemic continues”. “This is going to be a long-term battle and we cannot let down our guard,” Kasai said. “We need every country to keep responding according to their local situation.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Your coronavirus questions answered: How accurate are the tests?","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-tests-hair-dryer\/","transcript":"As part of our responsibility to provide the information you need to know when you need it, we’ve been taking your coronavirus questions to the experts. For the past three weeks, they have answered questions about how the virus works, how long this will all last, and if social distancing is working. This is a constantly changing situation and answers are current as of time of publishing. Please check www.health.gov.au for the latest. Monash University Professor of Medicine Paul Komesaroff, who directs the Centre for Ethics in Medicine and Society, is answering your questions about bizarre cures and the situation with testing. Over to him. How reliable or accurate is the COVID-19 test, e.g. What is the rate of false negative results? No test is perfect and all produce some ‘false positive’ results (that is, where the test shows positive when the person does not actually have the condition) and some ‘false negative’ results (when the test shows negative but the person really does have the condition). Related ideas are ‘sensitivity’ (the proportion of true positive cases that are actually picked up by a test) and ‘specificity’ (the proportion of positive test results that are correct). The test being used for COVID-19 detects viral genetic material in samples taken from the mouth or nose of a patient. If the virus is present in the sample, the test is extremely sensitive and specific – indeed, it is capable of detecting and identifying exceedingly small quantities of virus. However, the likelihood that a swab taken from an infected person will actually contain viral material is less clear and, presumably, this will vary from person to person and depend on various factors, such as the severity of the disease. Also, the expertise of the person collecting the sample may be an issue. Calculating this likelihood is further complicated by the fact that there is no absolute, independent ‘gold standard’ on which we can rely to decide whether a test result is true or false. However, if the sample is collected and the test conducted properly, the false positive rate is likely to be very low. Regarding false negatives, the most we can say at present is that, from wide experience with tests for influenza viruses, these rates are 10 to 15 per cent – that is, the proportion of people who show a negative result on a single test who will actually have an infection. What level of new infections per day is the ‘sustainable’ number, where the healthcare system can cope while herd immunity builds and COVID-19 becomes just another virus? The answer to this question depends on the severity of disease and the availability of medical facilities to respond to more serious cases. The level of new infections depends on the extent of testing, detection rates in the community, and the effectiveness of public health measures. The load on medical facilities also depends on the characteristics of the people who contract the illness, including whether they are older, have pre-existing diseases etc. The number of people who need to have recovered from an infection to ensure herd immunity depends on the degree of immunity that results from an infection and the kind of contact that people in the community have with each other. There is no fixed or universal value, but in the coronavirus case it could be 50 per cent or more. A modelling study has estimated that the number of ICU beds needed is about 10 per cent of the total active cases. Australia has around 2200 ICU beds at the present time. These are very rough estimates, but they suggest that if hygiene, physical distancing, and the wider lockdown fail to reduce the rate of increase of new infections, and the ICU capacity cannot be rapidly increased, the latter may be tending towards a maximum when we reach an active infection number of around 20,000. The virus is able to survive in the air for three hours. Does this mean that if you go into a room in which an infected person was in three hours prior, you can catch it? Some viruses, such as measles, become airborne and can cause infection to someone entering a room after they have left. It has, however, not been shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be spread in this manner and it is presently thought unlikely that this will be the case. A study has shown that when the virus is artificially turned into an aerosol in a laboratory it remains viable for up to three hours. But this does not mean that airborne particles can spread the infection because to do so, much larger doses than are possible through this route would probably be needed. Like so many other aspects of COVID-19 this is a question that is likely to be answered as our knowledge expands. There is a video out that says the COVID-19 virus is destroyed in the sinus nasal passages by raising the temperature in those areas to 56 degrees Celsius. Apparently the virus can survive in that temperature. Is this true? If so, is the recommendation of using a hairdryer and blowing hot air into the nasal passage possibly an effective treatment? There is no evidence that such a practice could be effective against COVID-19 and it is likely to be dangerous. It is strongly recommended that the practice referred to be avoided. There have been many other sham ‘treatments’ that have been promoted through social media, often by unscrupulous individuals seeking to make money from the fear understandably being experienced across the community. It is important that people know that, as well as being illegal, promotion of false treatments can be dangerous and we must make sure that this is widely understood. If you have contracted the coronavirus, at what point after are you non-infectious? People infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect others, even if they do not have symptoms themselves – in fact, this may be how the disease is most commonly spread. In people who develop the disease – COVID-19 – viral shedding is known to occur from about two days before symptoms develop and to reach a peak soon after. The question of how long someone remains infectious is more complicated and may vary from person to person. The current Australian national guidelines state that: It is important to emphasise that this is an evolving area. Some studies have shown that people recovering from infections may test positive for up to six weeks after recovery, although others have suggested these tests may not correlate with actual infectiousness. It is likely that these questions will be resolved as further data is collected and more advanced tests become available."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Dating during COVID-19: Can I visit my partner? How should I date?","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/01\/dating-relationships-coronavirus\/","transcript":"**UPDATED 6.12PM** The closure of bars and restaurants across the country has made dinner dates impossible, and strict social distancing rules mean any chance of getting a kiss at the end has been thrown out the window. So how do you date in the era of COVID-19? And if you’re already in a relationship but don’t live together, can you see each other? Are loved-up couples doomed to endure months of distance, even if they only live a few kilometres away? The new rules aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus have raised important questions about love, sex and relationships, and there is still a lot of confusion about what you can and can’t do. It depends where you live. Different states and territories are enforcing their own rules about what constitutes an adequate reason to leave home. In Victoria, visiting your partner was not one of them – until Premier Daniel Andrews reportedly had a change of heart on Wednesday afternoon. Regarding ‘Stay at Home’ rules: We have no desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners if they don’t usually reside together. We’ll be making an exemption.    Hope that helps. — Chief Health Officer, Victoria (@VictorianCHO) April 1, 2020 Prior to the backflip, visiting a de facto partner who lived in a separate household was not considered a reasonable excuse to leave the house. A ban on visiting partners was also understood to exist in NSW, but on Wednesday morning, NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller indicated that it would be allowed. “I would put that under ‘care’, absolutely. Mental health, we get it that’s under ‘care’,” he said in response to a reporter’s question. In NSW and Victoria, you must stay home unless you are going to: You may also leave your home in an emergency or if required by law. In Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory, you can visit a partner. In Queensland, you can leave home to provide care to an “immediate member of the person’s family”, but there is no provision for leaving to care for anyone else. This seems to imply you cannot visit a partner unless you’re married to them. In Western Australia and the ACT, the rules are not clear. However, WA has restrictions on regional travel, meaning you cannot visit a partner if they live in a different region. Under nationwide rules, two people are allowed to exercise together. The latest advice from the federal health department is that it is OK to visit your partner as long as you are the only guest visiting at that time. A government spokesperson confirmed to The New Daily that the rule for partners is the same as the two-person limit on social gatherings. For example, if you want to visit your partner but their housemate already has a friend over, you cannot join them. And you must abide by social distancing rules that require you stand at least 1.5 metres apart from each other. In other words: Look, but don’t touch. It’s not exactly conducive to romance, but it is better than not seeing them at all. Before you make plans to head over, ask yourself: If one of you infects the other with the virus, was it worth it? If either of you is feeling sick, or has come into contact with a confirmed case or who is deemed high risk, you should definitely not visit. And if one of you has recently returned from overseas, stay away. The federal government has made it clear that you should stay inside your home unless it is absolutely necessary to go out. Long distance is the safest option if you don’t live together. You’re not alone either: Couples in countries like the United Kingdom or Italy, where the coronavirus has killed thousands, are living separately. It’s not worth spreading the virus. Right now, there is no evidence that shows the coronavirus can be sexually transmitted. If you and your partner are healthy and regularly wash your hands and disinfect your house while practising social distancing from other people, it should be OK to have sex. Courtship is making a comeback, though it looks a lot more Black Mirror than Jane Austen. Dating should be kept online or over the phone. But some people aren’t getting the message. Melbourne woman Kate, 32, told The New Daily she has been shocked by the number of men on dating apps seeking to meet in person “despite being in the middle of a pandemic”. “You’d think at a time like this people wouldn’t be ignoring the social distancing rules, but obviously there are a bunch of people who don’t care,” she said. “One guy messaged me on Monday night saying ‘Let’s have sex before we die’, and I was like, ‘Excuse me?'” Kate said another man eager to meet in person tried to assure her that he was a doctor and therefore had his “temperature checked every day” so he knew he “wasn’t sick”. “It’s this attitude of ‘It won’t affect me and I’m not responsible’,” she said. Instead of meeting in person, Kate said she’d prefer to get to know people online or over the phone or video calls until the social distancing restrictions are officially lifted. “My parents did a long-distance relationship where they wrote letters to each other before they got married, so it’s nice to actually talk to someone and get to know them,” she laughed. Her advice from one single to another? “Think about your health first,” she said. “If someone is offering a hook-up without asking what you’re comfortable with, then it’s probably someone who is not very safe with their own health or sexual health in general, so it’s not worth it.” My friend is going on a 1st date tonight with a girl he's been talking to on Tinder. They're going to park next to each other at McDonald's and talk with the windows cracked while eating their own individual orders of fries. How's that for romance and longing, JANE AUSTEN? — dave horwitz (@Dave_Horwitz) March 25, 2020 Professor Bruce Thompson, dean of health sciences at Swinburne University, said now was not the time for dating. He warned young people should not ignore social distancing rules just because the chances of them dying from COVID-19 are lower than an elderly person or someone with a pre-existing health condition. “If you’re in your 20s, you could still land yourself with severe pneumonia and potentially hospitalisation, and there are cases where young people have died from it,” Professor Thompson said. “What would also concern me is if you’ve got the virus and you could potentially be spreading it to others. “I don’t think any date is quite worth that.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Write a letter to an elderly pen pal to help them in coronavirus isolation","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/04\/01\/pen-pal-elderly-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Kind-hearted Australians are writing letters to the elderly as part of a nationwide pen pal program aimed at boosting social connections during the coronavirus pandemic. To help protect vulnerable Australians from COVID-19, most aged-care facilities around the country are either in lockdown or have strict guidelines for visitors. Those who live at home have been advised to stay inside at all times. As a result, many of our elderly neighbours, friends, parents and grandparents are feeling confused and lonely while the nation fights to contain the virus. To help safely connect the elderly with the outside world, a pair of women in Sydney have set up an online pen pal program. Karen Buckley, a community engagement manager at Home Instead Senior Care at Bondi Junction, said the idea grew after a call for donations on Facebook. “We posted on the Viral Kindness Eastern Suburbs Sydney Facebook page, then we started getting cards and emails of people wanting to connect with the seniors,” Ms Buckley told The New Daily. “It was absolutely beautiful.” Within one week, a national pen pal program was born. To limit the risk of virus transmission, the letters are only exchanged online. Users can log in and type a letter using a template, or hand write and scan their own letter, then send it off to an aged-care resident. “It’s to give a cyber hug to people,” Ms Buckley said. “It’s to say, ‘We’re thinking of you and you’re part of the community. You’re national treasures and we want to be kind’.” Lou Rice, a member of the Viral Kindness Eastern Suburbs Sydney Facebook group and co-founder of the pen pal program, said the response had been “amazing”. “Right now, people want to help and creating connections with people is the way to do it,” Ms Rice told The New Daily. But she added the elderly weren’t the only people benefitting from the program. “It goes both ways – the residents are obviously shut off and don’t have access to technology as we do … and I imagine it’s very confusing and frightening for them,” she said. “On the other side, for the members of the community who are writing the letters, it gives them a chance to feel connected to someone and that they’re helping. “It’s as much for those people in isolation feeling connected to someone, whether they’re elderly or not.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Letter from healthcare workers’ son shows hidden toll","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-letter-son-nurse-paramedic\/","transcript":"Australia’s frontline healthcare workers are anxiously watching as the number of coronavirus cases among their international peers continues to rise – and their children know it. In Italy, at least 8350 healthcare workers have tested positive to COVID-19, and in Spain they are overloaded. Spanish officials won’t say if any healthcare workers have died, but on Friday 9444 had caught the virus. As with the initial coronavirus outbreak in China, some of those will die. Australia’s frontline healthcare workers also know they can’t stay home. And one little boy’s letter shows how that is taking a toll on their families. Em is an ICU nurse in Melbourne. Her husband is a paramedic. Their nine-year-old son knows COVID-19 threatens the lives of both his parents. Last week, he had to write a letter to his future self for class. “Dear me in the future holidays,” it began. “I want to see my parents more because they are medical workers and they deal with corona stuff. They (I) don’t want them to get the ‘you know’ what. “PS. Hope they don’t die.” On the back is a picture of their little family alive with a big ‘yes’, next to a picture of two tombstones with a big ‘no’ written across the top. “I’m sad that everything going on is causing him anxiety about his parents,” Em told The New Daily. “He’s just always been really socially aware, so even though we’re not acting any different at home, he’s just hyper-aware. “The stores have been emptied out and he puts it together. “I want people to realise the effects of not social distancing, leading to more cases, is having more than just health implications as well.” Em wants people to know that staying home means not just slowing the spread, but also that her son doesn’t “have to worry about his parents and what a future without them would be like”. This week she visited the supermarket, trying to get hand sanitiser, but the shelves were bare. She needs it so she can hug her son and husband when she comes home, without worry. “If people weren’t stressing so much, and just doing social distancing properly, then it wouldn’t be as anxiety-inducing,” Em said. “Don’t blow it up to end of days. Just be sensible. Then you don’t have kids going ‘holy crap’.” Australia’s COVID-19 curve looks like it may be flattening, as the rate of new infections has dropped in recent days. But infection control expert and adviser to the World Health Organisation’s COVID-19 preparedness group, UNSW professor Marylouise McLaws says there’s still much work to be done. “We shouldn’t get overly excited yet,” Professor McLaws said. “Epidemic curves don’t have the classic bell shape that everybody thinks they do in an outbreak.  “We need to remind ourselves that there are many countries that thought they had it under control but that was just a trough. “Our data is a week late, that’s around easing or incubation period. “We’re always looking back into the future. It’s like being in the Tardis – if you’re a Doctor Who fan.” Australians should be ‘quietly pleased’ with the rate in which the virus is travelling, but still, maintain strict social distancing, she said. “What we are doing is working. What the government is doing with border protection will have a positive impact and they should continue to do that,” Professor McLaws said. “It’s like training for a marathon. We’re not on the home stretch yet, but with this effort we will get there.” On Tuesday, new research by the University of Sydney found that compliance with social distancing measures is key to controlling the virus in just over three months. “If we want to control the spread of COVID-19 – rather than letting the disease control us – at least 80 per cent of the Australian population must comply with strict social distancing measures for at least four months,” Professor Mikhail Prokopenko said. “However, if 90 per cent of the population complies, then the duration could be as short as 13 to 14 weeks – meaning if we began tomorrow we could expect control of COVID-19 by July. “Conversely, if less than 70 per cent of the population is adopting social distancing measures, we cannot suppress the spread of the pandemic and any social distancing could be a fruitless effort. “There is a clear trade-off – stricter measures imposed earlier would reduce how long our lives are impacted by this disease. “On the contrary, laxer protocols could mean a longer, more drawn-out and ineffective struggle against COVID-19.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cinemas view coronavirus as another storm to weather","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/2020\/04\/01\/cinemas-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Cinemas operators are broadly confident they can make it through the coronavirus shutdown, though some say relief from landlords will be required and some smaller, independent theatres may not survive. The ban on mass gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus has led to the closure of all cinemas nationwide. Benjamin Zeccola, chief executive of Palace Cinemas, which has 17 sites across the country, said the company would soon need to borrow from the bank, leaving it saddled with an unhealthy amount of debt once it began trading again. It is also not eligible for the federal government’s business support payments, Mr Zeccola said, because it had a turnover above $50 million. “I just don’t see the need for there to be a cap,” he said of the grant scheme. “All businesses are struggling.” He said turnover of that amount did not represent liquidity, and that cinemas, which have high staffing and infrastructure costs, operated on “wafer-thin” margins. “The other area that is the most frightening thing for many businesses right now is landlords,” he said. “We are on pause. Everything is frozen. There are no customers. There is no income. There can be no rent for months. And I don’t think that’s sinking in. I think the government has to step in to support employers.” Hoyts, one of the larger chains, could not make anyone available for an interview, but in a statement said it was too soon to know for certain what the impact on the industry would be. Kristian Connelly, who runs Cinema Nova in Carlton in central Melbourne, said while there was uncertainty for the business and its 50 casual and permanent staff, the cinema was well placed to survive the shutdown, largely because they were coming off a strong summer period. However, he said: “I suspect that there will be a degree of rationalisation across the entire industry where we will see some closures.” Mr Zeccola agreed some cinemas would inevitably not survive. Independents make up 31 per cent of all cinemas, the largest share, according to Screen Australia data, and account for most of the regional venues. “Whilst Australians are still able to access their local shows on TV, streaming and online, the exhibition and distribution market is suffering badly right now,” Screen Australia chief executive Graeme Mason said. “So, when cinemas open again, and they will, we will need to vote with our wallets and go support our exhibitors and filmmakers.” Scott Seddon, president of Independent Cinemas Australia and the owner of two venues in the Hunter region in NSW, said he hoped no independent cinemas would close for good, but that it depended on measures like rent relief, government assistance and forbearance from the banks. “Many independent cinemas were badly affected by the bushfires because their towns were closed,” he said, meaning it had already been a tough start to 2020. Cinemas would also need to make sure they could regularly fire up their projectors throughout the shutdown, he said, because older units particularly can degrade if they go several months without being turned on, potentially leading to a replacement bill in the tens of thousands of dollars. It has already been a difficult decade for cinemas. As the pressure from piracy waned, the arrival of Netflix, Disney+ and other streaming services made for a crowded screen entertainment market. Box office sales were slightly down in 2019, according to a Screen Australia report. Last year, before coronavirus emerged, some analysts were predicting minor growth in cinemas in the coming five years, while others saw a decline, with rising ticket prices failing to make up for a lack of innovation that would increase competitiveness. Now, with film and television production having ceased around the world, some studios have started sending films that would otherwise have gone to cinemas straight to streaming services. The Invisible Man, which has been topping box offices around the world but had its theatre run cut short, is already streaming, as is Emma, the Jane Austen story brought to screen. Trolls World Tour will go straight to streaming, while Frozen 2 will have its release date pulled forward by three months and sent straight to Disney+. But Australian cinema owners the ABC spoke to don’t fear that will become more common after the shutdown ends – that a long-standing norm about the primacy of the theatre experience will be shattered. Already, major blockbusters like No Time To Die, the new James Bond film, have been delayed rather than rushed to streaming services. And after a period of confinement, cinema operators say, the public will be itching to get out and experience storytelling on the biggest screen. Mr Connelly said: “I think people are going to be reminded about how emotionally important cinema is not just to entertain but to connect.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"April Fools Day cancelled? Yes, if you believe Google","date":"04-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/04\/01\/april-fools-day-cancelled\/","transcript":"April Fools Day is cancelled this year. That’s if you believe search engine overlord Google, which is apparently hitting pass on the trickery of April 1, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The revelation came via a leaked email from Google’s chief marketing officer Lorraine Twohill, to all staff saying pranks would be put on hold this year as the platform has more important duties – like keeping the searching masses informed on the most relevant COVID-19 information. Seems legit, but only time will tell. Usually, April 1 is fraught with danger for the general public and the media. News outlet inboxes are flooded with ‘clever’ pitches from PR companies, trying to trick over-tired, unwitting journalists into running their brand name in headlines. Apparently this year, we can just be our gullible selves, no need to be on high alert. In lieu of any trickery, here’s a round-up of some of the best (and most outlandish) April Fools Day pranks we’ve seen in Australia over the years. It’s a shame Google isn’t (allegedly) participating this year – the company is pretty much the undisputed king of pranks.  About a decade ago, Google announced it was getting involved in the AFL, launching a partnership for the gBall: An AFL ball built-in with the best of Google’s tech, to measure location, accuracy and torque of every kick. You could download all this data and more, to keep improving your game. Sounds like every budding Gary Ablett’s dream, right? Google probably tipped the joke over the edge when it claimed the gBall shared its intel with scouting agents. If they were interested and wanted to contact the ball owner, the ball would buzz. National icon Vegemite got us good in 2015, when it announced a Big Vegemite was being erected in Melbourne. Have you heard? Something BIG is coming to Melbourne in the shape of a 60m tall interactive Vegemite jar. Who's keen? pic.twitter.com\/86N7Fsjepo — Vegemite (@Vegemite) March 31, 2015 What made this prank more memorable was that it caught out pop culture news site pedestrian.tv, which not only ran with the pitch, but broke the embargo to get it out first. Thankfully they’re a funny bunch, and took it on the chin. This served as a lesson for media outlets around the country for the next few years. The media of old knew how to prank. Without the sharp minds of the internet ruining everything with one tweet, news outlets could get hours of mileage out of their April 1 exploits. ABC program This Day Tonight  ran a harmless yet humorous trick in 1975, when it made the declaration Australia would be converting to metric time. What’s metric time? According to the program, there would now be 100 seconds per minute, 100 minutes per hour, and 20-hour days. Seconds were now to be referred to as millidays, minutes centidays and hours decidays. Then deputy premier of South Australia Des Corcoran gave the report more weight by praising the new time system on the broadcast. It was topped off by rendered images of the Adelaide town hall displaying a metric time face. Boom-tish. Virgin Money Australia proved you don’t have to go all out to get a launch.  In 2005 it announced it was launching scratch ‘n’ sniff credit cards, which Australians could travel with overseas and rub a little nail on when they wanted to be reminded of home. The cards’ scent was barbecued sausages. Dick Smith cemented himself in Aussie lore in 1978 with his monumental prank. For weeks, he’d been advertising that he was going to tow an iceberg all the way from Antarctica into Sydney Harbour. Why? He’s an entrepreneur. He was going to park it next to the Opera House and chip off small wedges to passersby, selling them for 10 cents a piece. The ‘Dicksicles’ would improve the flavour of whatever beverage they were added to. And lo, April 1 sprung. There was Dick Smith towing his promised iceberg. The public went wild. The press were stirred into a frenzy. And then the heavens opened. The ‘Dickenberg 1’ began to melt and was revealed for what it really was: A layer of shaving cream and firefighting foam over a structure of plastic sheets. Dick Smith said afterwards he was pretty happy with the prank – it only cost him $1450 to pull off."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Is this proof Australia is flattening the coronavirus curve?","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/31\/australia-flattening-curve-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Australia’s medical experts have urged the nation’s political leaders to put the economy into a once-in-a-century coma with one goal in mind: Flattening the curve of COVID-19 cases. Now, there is fresh hope that these graphs offer the first real evidence that measures to lock down entire cities and ban international travel in Australia are working. The real question is how long will Australia need to maintain such measures given the devastating impact on jobs and businesses across the country? And, are we still dramatically underestimating the number of cases in Australia because of current limits on testing? There were 5315 cases of COVID-19 on April 2, while recent decisions to expand the number of people tested could still see cases spike in the coming days. But there’s promising early signs that the majority of cases are still being imported on international flights, one reason why the national coronavirus cabinet has gone so hard on locking down travellers, including Lara Bingle’s mum, in hotels across Sydney patrolled by the army and police. Some early cautious positive signs of the curve beginning to flatten thanks to the extraordinary work of Australians – much more to do but we are focussed on containment to bring the rate down, and building capacity with 30,000 new beds and 57,000 nurses https:\/\/t.co\/nvifaaQYCX — Greg Hunt (@GregHuntMP) March 31, 2020 “We are seeing what I would describe as early promising signs of the curve flattening,” Health Minister Greg Hunt said this week. “Whilst we are making progress, and whilst we are now flattening the curve in the first early stages of progress, there’s more to do. “The new measures we have just put in place, we hope will deliver more benefit.” Flattening the curve means slowing down the rate of infections. It’s a strategy designed simply to help hospitals manage the flow of cases, so that they don’t overwhelm intensive care units to the point that doctors run out of respirators to help the sick breathe. Overseas, most of the countries that have seen high rates have simply had so many cases that they could not all secure appropriate medical care. Even before Prime Minister Scott Morrison ordered a ban on gatherings of 100 people, quickly followed by smaller and smaller gatherings before arriving at the ‘three is a crowd’ rule on Sunday night, it was the death rate in Italy that alarmed medical experts. Images of empty stadiums full of coffins and trucks transporting the dead in Italian streets shocked the world. But this graph of the death rate among COVID-19 cases shows that Australia’s is performing much better than Italy, Spain and the United States. As you can see, Australia’s cumulative deaths is more in line with Japan and Singapore, countries that are regarded as managing the COVID-19 crisis well. Spain and Italy are further along than Australia in fighting the virus, but the death rate is much higher. Once the national cabinet moves to relax the prohibitions on pubs, cafes and gatherings there is real concern that cases could spike again forcing another round of restrictions. This final graph prepared by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet shows the dramatic impact of the policy decisions on COVID-19 have had on the movement of citizens, using mobile phone data.  Although the Prime Minister has dismissed the idea of using this data to track citizens who are supposed to be in quarantine as not appropriate in Australia, he has not shied away from backing laws that have prompted police in Sydney to move on sunbathers this week enjoying the sun in parks. This graph shows the majority of Australians are playing by the rules. Mobile phone data on people’s movement starts dropping as soon as the government introduced limits on gatherings, first on groups of 500 or more before it became a ban on gatherings of 100 or more just days later. But the curve flatlines after the introduction of Stage 1 restrictions on businesses which shut down pubs, clubs and cafes on March 22. If Australia can keep flattening the curve we could emerge as one of the few good news stories in the COVID-19 crisis, but the impact on the economy and jobs could last for years."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"What draconian new coronavirus laws mean for our civil liberties","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/crime-news\/2020\/03\/31\/draconian-coronavirus-laws-australia\/","transcript":"Civil liberties experts have raised concerns over draconian new laws that heavily limit freedom of movement in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus. On Sunday night, Prime Minister Scott Morrison tightened restrictions on gatherings to no more than two people, to be enforced at the discretion of individual states and territories. While the Northern Territory and South Autralia said they would not enforce the two-person limit, three states decided to go even further, with New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania announcing strict stay-at-home laws that came into effect on Tuesday In those states, people must not leave their home unless they have what is deemed a “reasonable excuse”, the definition of which differs between the states. Individuals found to be in breach of the new laws face up to six months jail or fines of up to $20,000. NSW Council for Civil Liberties spokesman Stephen Banks described the restrictions as “extraordinary” and “obviously extreme”. “We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes,” he said. Although the coronavirus pandemic is a valid reason for the restrictions, Mr Banks said that governments and police must “do everything that they can to maintain community support … because if the community ceases to support it, then it becomes unworkable”. The unprecedented laws may be temporarily necessary, but enforcement must be monitored “vigilantly” to ensure they aren’t misused, according to one of the nation’s leading civil liberties organisations. Both the community and government are “rightly focusing” on “what needs to happen to keep us safe” in light of the “threat that is posed to the health and safety of us all” by COVID-19, Liberty Victoria spokeswoman Gemma Cafarella said. But the measures “need to be reasonable, necessary and only in place for as long as strictly necessary”, she said. Stay-at-home directions “give the state extraordinary and unprecedented powers to restrict movement and also impose significant penalties for people who don’t comply with them”, Ms Cafarella said. “We are vigilantly watching [how the restrictions are enforced] to ensure that [they] don’t cross the line into unnecessarily impinging upon people’s rights and freedoms,” she said. The laws also “disproportionally affect people who are vulnerable”, Ms Cafarella warned. “For example, a person who doesn’t have safe and secure housing is far more likely to be moving around, she said. The hastily written and approved laws lack clarity and have caused confusion in the community, Ms Cafarella said. “It’s really essential that there’s clarity about what the rules are, but there are some areas where there really isn’t sufficient clarity,” she said. For example, there is “not a lot of guidance” over what is considered a necessary reason to leave the house. University of Technology Sydney civil liberties law expert Geoff Holland agreed, saying that “it’s not only the public that are going to be confused by this”, but also police. “Unless you are going to have an all-inclusive list of those things that will be acceptable, which in itself creates problems … It means that interpreting a reasonable excuse will need to be done by the police officer who’s enforcing it,” Dr Holland said. If the matter proceeds to court, there is “again, no certainty” around how the law will be interpreted, he said. Another major area of confusion is whether the new restrictions allow partners that don’t live together to spend time with each other. For those in Victoria, the answer was initially no. Police minister @LisanevilleMP providing some heartbreaking clarity to the lovers of Victoria during the Stay at Home period: “You cannot visit your partner for social reasons.” She points to the DHHS website for more details: https:\/\/t.co\/tQdR8Txb20 💔 @theheraldsun #COVID19Aus — Tamsin Rose (@tamsinroses) March 31, 2020  Visiting a partner who lives in a separate household is not considered a reasonable excuse to leave the house and is forbidden, Police Minister Lisa Neville confirmed on Wednesday morning. That was also understood to be the case in NSW, until NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller indicated that it would be allowed in a Wednesday morning press conference. “I would put that under ‘care’, absolutely. Mental health, we get it that’s under ‘care’,” he said in response to a reporter’s question. I asked the NSW Premier’s office about this on Monday & Tuesday. I was told that (while they noted it is up to police to enforce the laws) they thought it wouldn’t be allowed to visit a partner you don’t live with I guess this police advice is the one to go by, then, in NSW https:\/\/t.co\/53AZTxOpZb — Josh Butler (@JoshButler) March 31, 2020  The clarification may have prompted Victoria to reconsider its position, with Premier Daniel Andrews announcing a change of heart on Wednesday afternoon.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week ordered the hospitality industry to shut its doors to the public in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Although the industry was allowed to keep selling food and drinks for takeaway and home delivery, revenue fell off a cliff and venues across the country were forced to axe hundreds of thousands of jobs, with one economist tipping unemployment to reach 17 per cent by Easter. And so, in a bid to survive the coming recession, many cafe and restaurant owners have transformed their venues into neighbourhood grocers – working with their regular suppliers to put together fresh fruit and vegetable boxes for customers keen to support local businesses. So it went with Tanaka coffee shop (formerly known as Bloom) in Carlton, in the inner north of Melbourne. Owners Ruby Clark and Nesbert Kagonda had already hatched plans to offer veggie boxes before the virus took hold in Australia – but the outbreak of the novel coronavirus brought those plans forward. Sourcing produce from a range of local suppliers and Mr Kagonda’s parents’ farm at Toora, south Gippsland, the cafe sells boxes of fresh produce for customers to pick up from the store, or have delivered to their door if they live on the same block. Ms Clark said the cafe started offering the service once “supermarkets got really chaotic”. The first batch of boxes only contained vegetables and were limited to customers who pre-ordered. But after locals started inquiring about other staples, the cafe expanded its list of produce to include bread, milk, eggs, cheese, and meat – part of a gradual transformation into a fully fledged neighbourhood grocer. ‘‘We got really good feedback on all of that, and a lot of people were coming in and kind of expecting to just pick up boxes, not pre-order,’’ Ms Clark told The New Daily. ‘‘So we thought we should just have a constant supply and then maybe shift the whole model into more of a grocer. ‘‘It has been really well received. Everyone’s really excited about the boxes, but also just being able to come by and get little things, like not committing to a $20 box, but just picking up an avocado.’’ Alongside takeaway coffee, the cafe also sells grains and different flowers by weight, and take-home meals by local restaurant Henry Sugar, with individual boxes ranging from $20 (veggies and fruit) to $40 (veggies, fruit, milk, eggs, home-made passata and pickles). Ms Clark said they also plan to expand their range of locally sourced meat. “And anything that we’re not using, we’ll just use to make preserves, or in our own baking, as we’re still doing that,” Ms Clark said. Asked if she was worried about the future of the business, Ms Clark said the cafe should be OK if it maintains the level of trade generated over the past two weeks. But she said her and her business partner were working hard to keep prices as low as possible as they understood that people’s incomes would soon take a hit. Elsewhere, many other cafes are taking a similar approach. Matt ‘Lanis’ Lanigan decided to convert his cafe in South Yarra, in the inner south of Melbourne, into a neighbourhood grocer so that he could keep on as many staff as possible and give something back to his local community. What was once the Lucky Penny cafe is now temporarily operating as the Lucky Penny Grocery – serving takeaway coffee, frozen take-home meals, and groceries pre-ordered online. Customers can order groceries online or over the phone and pick up their orders 48 hours later. The store sells everything from bread and eggs to rice and vegetables, and will deliver food free of charge to anyone with a seniors card. Although he said he didn’t expect to make any money from the project, Mr Lanigan told The New Daily it would hopefully make life easier for locals and help him rebuild his business once the virus has been contained. ‘‘We’re doing wholesale price plus 30 per cent to cover wages, so it’s really a community service rather than a commercial service. We’re not really going to make any money,’’ Mr Lanigan said. ‘‘The driving factor behind this is keeping my team employed, delivering a community service for the necessities and you know, providing some kind of support and connection.’’"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"What Australia’s skyrocketing government debt really means for workers","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-government-debt\/","transcript":"The Australian government has already racked up a hefty debt battling the coronavirus’ economic fallout, and more is expected to come. This week government unveiled a $130 billion ‘JobKeeper’ payment program that will provide eligible employers with a wage subsidy of $1500 a fortnight for every worker they keep employed during the crisis. An estimated six million people (just under 50 per cent of the labour force) will benefit from the fortnightly payments, which employers will be legally compelled to pass on to workers. Despite bringing state and federal governments’ total stimulus expenditure to $200 billion, the package was warmly received by economists. Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers also threw his support behind the package, telling ABC News Breakfast’s Lisa Millar the money has the capacity “to do a lot of good in our community”. Dr Chalmers added, however, that the nation will be paying off those debts for years to come. “The most pressing priority is that we support workers, businesses, communities, families and pensioners through this difficult period. That will come with a big price tag, already something like $213 or $214 billion in direct stimulus,” Dr Chalmers said. “That’s appropriate. We’ve been very supportive of that. “One of the consequences of this is that we will be saddled as a nation with a generation of debt. It might be something like a trillion dollars by the time the government’s finished.” Before government announced its stimulus packages, Treasury forecasters estimated that government debt would hit $379.2 billion by June 30, 2021 – roughly 18.5 per cent of Australia’s 2019 GDP. Add the $200 billion of economic stimulus and the nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 28 per cent, according to independent economist Saul Eslake. And that’s only factoring in the direct expenditure – not the other economic pressures weighing on the budget (including lost income, company and GST tax revenues). If, for example, those tax revenues dropped by $100 billion, Australia’s government debt would climb to $680 billion – or 33 per cent of GDP. That would be one of the highest government debt levels seen since the end of the Second World War. But Mr Eslake told The New Daily it’s really not as bad as it sounds. “It’s still a lot less than many other Western countries, and that’s before the crisis started,” he said. “We’ve gone into this with our public finances in much better shape than many other countries.” ﻿OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2018 Interest rates are also at an all-time low of 0.25 per cent, which makes it much easier for the government to meet its repayments. “The problem is not so much the level of debt, but the government’s capacity to service it,” Mr Eslake said. “Government in the first instance will fund the cost of that wage subsidy package by borrowing the equivalent of $130 billion at an interest rate of 0.25 per cent. “The cost of that is about $325 million a year, which is not huge. At the moment, it’s manageable.” Although there are several ways government can pay off the debt in theory, in practice the most likely solution is to increase taxes and cut public spending. The government doesn’t have to pay its debt immediately and can choose how quickly it does, but it will eventually need to fiddle with taxes and expenditure. And just how it chooses to pay off the debt is difficult to predict, Mr Eslake said. “It’s a political choice, rather than an economic one,” he said. “What mix of higher taxes and decreased spending, and who pays the higher taxes or feels the effects of lower spending – those are all political choices.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bunnings, Kmart and Target to continue trading as coronavirus data monitored | The New Daily","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-kmart-trading\/","transcript":"Bunnings, Kmart, Target and Officeworks could be allowed to continue to trade – for now – if they choose to do so, after promising signs that the coronavirus infection curve is flattening and the number of new cases is starting to slow. While more retailers, including Bonds, announced they would stand down thousands of staff and close their doors on Tuesday, the NSW government is not preparing to announce further formal orders for retailers to close after announcing some of the toughest restrictions this week. The stringent restrictions  effectively require citizens to remain in the family home. Larger retailers may still choose to shut their doors – Ikea has already done so in some countries overseas – but there appears to be no immediate plans for national cabinet to go further. IKEA stores in Australian remain open, with new rules including limiting all lifts to one person or one family group per trip. The company has also chosen to temporarily close its supervised children’s playroom. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Tuesday that while there were signs of community transmission in some suburbs of Sydney, there were also promising signs in the data. “We have had localised break-outs in areas like Waverley and Bondi and, as a result, we will instruct all the medical professionals in that area to increase the level of testing, to increase the numbers of people tested in that community to really reduce community to community transmission,” she said. “We knew NSW has taken every measure we can to control the spread. What is of concern to all of us is the unknown, the level of community transmission that you might not pick up if people don’t have symptoms and that is the real threat. People walking around not realising they have the disease.” The Morrison government’s decision to extend $1500 a fortnight JobKeeper payments to workers has also thrown many businesses a lifeline that will help keep staff on the payroll, even if businesses go into “hibernation” during the lockdowns. Almost 200,000 businesses have registered for the $130 billion JobKeeper wage subsidy in the less than 24 hours since it was announced."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Dr Norman Swan's coronavirus test negative, but process was eye-opening","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/dr-norman-swan-coronavirus\/","transcript":"It’s Saturday night. As I reach for the box of tissues for the second time in half an hour, I groan to myself. There’s no one else around to groan to. This is more than my usual perennial rhinitis. My nose is hosing and the times dictate that a runny nose could be more than just another cold. You see, your nose is the respiratory front line. It’s the warning beacon that invaders have overwhelmed your first response defenders. The question is, whether the attack force is just the usual local viruses who attack, use your body to multiply themselves and move on or could they be novel coronaviruses – these sub-microscopic organisms which are destroying lives and the global economy? Not much I can do. It’s Saturday night after all. Any idea of social contact from this moment on is off the agenda. Let’s see what happens in the morning. Maybe it’ll go away but I recognise that for what it is — male denial. Glad it’s a new box of tissues, because it’s now a lot less full. Around midday there’s a call from someone who could have been a contact, who I reassured it was just a runny nose. The power and cunning of viruses never disappoint and within half an hour of that call they start to punish my arrogance. A sore throat comes on and the first shivers of a fever. Expletive, expletive, expletive – even worse expletive. I call back the person with an urgent revision to the narrative in the hope that the virus is listening and will take pity. I feel like I need to be tested. Not knowing whether you’re COVID-19 positive is unsafe yet I’m pretty sure I don’t qualify for the test. I’ve no desire to wait for two hours at the local hospital to be turned away, so I call the local helpline for my area. It diverts to a state based line which then diverts to the national line. They confirm that I don’t qualify. I ask them what the protocol is for someone with a cold but who can’t be tested. Fourteen days isolation. Without knowing. Gulp. Tegan Taylor, my co-host on Coronacast and Will Ockenden, our amazing producer, and I always record Monday’s episode on Sundays. Today I’ll have to do it from home. It goes well but we all agree that talking about my symptoms would just be a distraction. A bit delirious during the night. Throat on fire. Tissue consumption high. Consumption of liberally honeyed tea remains high (strongly recommended for a sore throat by the way). I’m properly unwell. COVID-19 or not, I need to call my GP tomorrow. Things feel better. Nothing like a new day. I do my regular Radio National segment with Fran Kelly, and at 8am I call my GP who says my high fever means I should be tested. He tells me to come to his underground carpark after I come off air from my regular session with Robbie Buck and Wendy Harmer on ABC Radio Sydney. The talkback with Wendy and Robbie goes well until a caller comments on how I sound congested. Expletive. I have to be open. Yes, I admit, I’ve had symptoms over the weekend and I’m going to be tested straight after this. The testing was surreal. The carpark was a bit like that scene in Watergate where Woodward meets Deep Throat. No-one is there. Eventually my GP walks down the ramp cleverly disguised in a N95 mask, and apron and gloves of course. He comes up to my window and surprises me. “You’re going to have to do the swab on yourself.” I am thinking to myself, you’ve got to be expletive joking. He has obviously seen this reaction before and explains that since he doesn’t have full PPE, this is the only way he can stay safe. So, I tilt my head back and insert the swab up one nostril as far back as it will go. “You’re doing better than most people,” encourages my doctor. “Now twirl round the swab to collect the cells and secretions.” My eyes water. As I’m driving out of the car park it’s 10am and the news comes on. Expletive me dead. There’s actually a news item about how I have symptoms and am going to be tested. The world’s gone nuts. By the time I get home, my editor tells me that I’m trending, whatever that means. Anyway I’ve got more important things to do like work with my incredible 7.30 producer Amy Donaldson on our evening segment and my Health Report producer, the patient, talented and resilient James Bullen. I’m doing this all remotely, thanks to wonders of technology, and am glad to be feeling well enough to work — for now, anyway. With all this going on until early evening there isn’t much time for contemplation. Later on, I’m feeling pretty ordinary again and just feverish enough to begin to think through what isolation will mean for the next two weeks or so if I’m positive. Supplies, keeping in touch, not getting out for exercise, mental frame for work and so on. I’m not worried about becoming seriously ill. Just pondering being alone when I’m naturally very social. The thing is that I don’t really believe I have COVID-19 because I can’t think of a contact and the symptoms aren’t the usual pattern. For example, I barely have a cough, I’m not short of breath and still have my taste and smell intact. Nonetheless the possibility exists and has to be taken seriously. Feverish again. Do my live cross to ABC News Breakfast using the gear that ABC News has sent round to my place which has converted my dining area to a home television studio. Hope they don’t notice that I’m perspiring with a rising temperature. Michael and Lisa are so professional they wouldn’t say even if they did notice. At 9am, I get a call from my GP. The test was negative for SARS-CoV-2 and positive for another circulating cold virus. So what do I feel now? I’m relieved. I was seriously worried that I might have passed the virus to a couple of colleagues. They can be let off the hook. The ABC doesn’t have to do a forensic search for other contacts, and while we’re all largely confined to quarters, I won’t have to depend on others for supplies. And at last, my symptoms are confirmed to be what I’ve always thought they were: man flu, which deserves no special sympathy or attention. But most of all, it’s made me reflect on the many hundreds of people who are in enforced quarantine. It’s what needs to happen to protect our health. They’re doing it tough to help us all. I’ve been interested in pandemics for decades. I even made a four-part series for Channel 4 UK and SBS called Invisible Enemies which screened in the early 90s. But now we’re actually living through one. This pandemic is forcing difficult decisions from those in power. Those decisions are reducing the power we have to make our own choices — but it’s for the public good. I’m lucky. Onward … but where did I put that box of paracetamol and the jar of honey?"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Don't panic, there's enough alcohol for everyone's lockdown","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/31\/alcohol-restrictions-coronavirus\/","transcript":"If social media is any guide, the funniest family joke in these times of self-isolation is telling your parents that the bottle shops are closing down and watching them panic. It’s been these kind of internet pranks, including mocked-up news reports from the US-state of Illinois, have led to panic buying of alcohol in some areas of Australia and forced retailers to introduce purchasing limits. Retail Drinks Australia, representing independent retailers, introduced voluntary purchasing limits this week in a bid to ensure everyone gets a share of of their favourite lubricants. Other major supermarket outlets have also introduced voluntary limits. The limits are generous, however. Buyers will be good to go as long as they require only two selections from the following list: Two cases of beer, cider or pre-mixed drinks, 12 bottles of wine, two cask wines and two bottled spirits. So, to be clear, if you went the beer and cider option, you’d have 96 bottles of full-strength to get you through the day – beyond that coronavirus is not your only problem. The Retail Drinks Australia move came after Western Australia became the first state to limit how much alcohol bottle shops can sell to patrons, with those limits overriding voluntary restrictions in that state. Retail Drinks chief executive Julie Ryan said governments had raised concern that alcohol sales were trending towards scenes similar to the toilet paper run on supermarkets. “We know that consumers like to feel certainty of supply during times of crisis, and our members want to do their part to encourage people continuing to purchase alcohol responsibly as they normally would,” Ms Ryan said. “Our suppliers in breweries, wineries, distilleries and the wholesale and distribution of drinks continue to be fully operational and this means there are no issues of supply. “However, it was clear that uncertainty on the impact of supply following the closure of pubs, clubs and restaurants last week caused some people to purchase differently. “These temporary restrictions are intended to operate per transaction, and are clear and easy for both our retail workers, and consumers, to understand. “Put simply, each category of drinks, whether it be beer, wine, cider, RTDs or spirits, will have a limit for that category. The industry is also keen that consumers keep retail workers in mind if their requested product is not available. “Please remember that our liquor retail staff are working hard to serve you and they deserve to be treated with respect and courtesy while they assist you to understand these changes,” Ms Ryan said. The only ban on alcohol sales in Australia has been on cellar door sales in South Australia after a cluster of coronavirus cases in that state. And while the misleading memes on alcohol bans continue to circulate, one place where a ban has come into force is Britain’s House of Commons. The House Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said he had banned the sale of alcohol at the parliamentarians cafeteria as part of a range of measures to ensure there was enough time for members to cast votes while practising social distancing. “I can confirm that from today the sale of alcohol in the House of Commons catering venues has been suspended until further notice,” the speaker said. There were no hear hears in the chamber."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Private hospitals added to the coronavirus fight | The New Daily","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/private-hospital-beds-coronavirus-fight\/","transcript":"More than 34,000 extra hospital beds will be available to help Australia deal with the coronavirus pandemic under a new deal struck with the private sector. Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Health Minister Greg Hunt said the deal was a “very significant stride” in increasing the system’s capacity while guaranteeing the viability of all 657 private hospitals. The agreement will mean more than 105,000 full and part-time hospital staff, including 57,000 nurses and midwives, will keep their jobs and join the fight against coronavirus, he said. It effectively puts all hospital beds in Australia under a single partnership. Mr Hunt said the private sector had agreed to be fully flexible in what it could offer. That could include taking on public hospital services, setting up flu clinics or testing services in day hospitals, exchanging staff and equipment, making their intensive care units available or providing support for patients coming from aged care homes. “They have committed to be flexible in a way that is beyond conception,” he told reporters in Canberra “Whilst we’re not taking ownership, we have struck a partnership, where in return for the state agreements and the commonwealth guarantee, they will be fully integrated within the public hospital system.” The deal is expected to coast an extra $1.3 billion. At the same time, the government is working to immediately double and then triple the number of ICU beds with ventilators. At the moment there are about 2200 ventilated intensive care beds available – although only about 20 are being used by coronavirus patients at the moment. Deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said that was being immediately expanded to 4400 by repurposing other ventilators, such as those used for anaesthetics, and the private sector’s capacity. “We are working around the clock to procure ventilators,” he said. Manufacturer ResMed is also now making 500 intensive care ventilators and another 5000 non-invasive ones, expected to be completed by the end of April. The government’s overall target is to have 7500 beds with ventilators and accompanying staff. Mr Hunt said that aim was based on the absolute worst-case modelling, but the signs so far were that Australia would not get to such a staggering rate. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus music: Take in some musings from three generations of punks","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/music\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-music-punks\/","transcript":"Bob Dylan amuses himself rewriting American Pie; Pearl Jam stoke up the revolution one more time and the Chats just want a free meal.

The Green Tree Frog was found in the Mackay area and sent north to Mission Beach for an operation to remove its extra leg. Frog Safe founder Deborah Pergolotti says the amphibian is ready to return to the wild but that’s easier said than done. Under Queensland rules, rescued wildlife must be returned to their point of origin once they have recovered. But, with people ordered to stay in their neighbourhoods and avoid non-essential travel, Ms Pergolotti can’t find anyone to take the frog home. “The only reason she has to go back to Mackay is because the Queensland government requires it,” she told AAP on Tuesday. “But that’s not the case now and I’m sure all the wildlife rescue groups are in the same boat.” Ms Pergolotti says the amputee frog could make a new home in the animal sanctuary on her property south of Cairns. But, unless the government relaxes the rules that can’t happen. Ms Pergolotti initially believed her latest patient had a fifth leg growing out of her chest. But the surgery showed the frog was actually growing two legs out of the same front socket – a deformity she’s seen many times before. “It was not quite accurately formed, it had toes on it but the wrong number, and it had an elbow joint, so it was moveable but it was pointing the wrong direction.” Ms Pergolotti wants rigorous research into a dramatic spike in malformed frogs, which she says coincided with the rise of neonicotinoid pesticides and insecticides in the late 1990s. The European Union has banned outdoor use of neonicotinoids due to the serious danger they pose to bees. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is currently reviewing their use amid concerns about bee health. Ms Pergolotti says deformed frogs began appearing in alarming numbers in the late 1990s and there was a huge spike in 2003 when far north Queensland got drought-breaking rain. “Suddenly, out of nowhere, we started to see malformed frogs en masse, and these were coming from different areas too,” she says. “We were getting calls from people spotting tadpoles with multiple limbs in their ponds, high die off rates, eggs that don’t hatch, an incredible amount of scoliosis. And that continues to this day. “There’s so little academic interest in what’s going on with frogs.

Virgin said its bailout proposal was “subject to approval by the Virgin Australia Holdings board and the Australian government” and “may or may not include conversion to equity in certain circumstances”. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce warned against federal government assistance for his airline’s competitor, saying help should not be offered to businesses that had been “badly managed”. Mr Joyce has repeatedly said airlines are facing a “survival of the fittest” scenario as the coronavirus pandemic grounds thousands of planes. He has previously said Qantas is not seeking a bailout, but has warned that if Virgin gets government aid, the federal government needs to “level the playing field” to avoid distorting the market. A Qantas source confirmed the airline’s revenue was three times higher than Virgin’s, meaning it would want a $4.2 billion loan. Last week, Qantas raised about $1 billion in additional debt from the market in a loan secured against planes it owns. The company has $3.5 billion in other remaining assets it can use to raise more cash. Qantas has temporarily stood down 20,000 of its workers, while Virgin has temporarily stood down about 8000 of its staff. Virgin went into a trading halt shortly before 10am pending a market announcement. It later released a statement confirming the company “continues to explore a range of options to manage through the COVID-19 crisis”, including “requesting financial support from the Australian Government in the order of $1.4 billion as part of a broader industry support package to prepare for a prolonged crisis”. Its share price was up 22.5 per cent to 9.8 cents at 12.49pm AEDT. “We have been in ongoing discussions with government about the support the whole industry will need if this crisis is prolonged,” a Virgin Australia spokeswoman told ABC News. “Companies like ours are taking a range of measures to respond and manage the financial impact. “However, the support we’ve proposed will be necessary for the industry if this crisis continues indefinitely, to protect jobs and ensure Australia retains a strong, competitive aviation and tourism sector once this crisis is over.” There is speculation a bailout could involve the government becoming a part-owner, but Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has not ruled that in or out. Mr Frydenberg said the government strongly supported the sector, and had already announced $715 million worth of measures, including waiving certain government fees and charges on the airlines. “I’ve been in close contact with leaders of the business community including the aviation sector, [Virgin boss] Paul Scurrah and [Qantas chief] Alan Joyce,” Mr Frydenberg said. “We have already illustrated our commitment to having a viable, sustainable aviation sector.” Virgin chief executive Mr Scurrah wrote to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims alleging Qantas was engaging in anti-competitive conduct, designed to damage Virgin. Mr Sims has urged restraint and cooperation, arguing, “we really need companies working together during this crisis and talking about the survival of the fittest could be seen as quite unhelpful”. Virgin Australia is 90 per cent owned by offshore airlines including Etihad Airways, Singapore Airlines, Nanshan Group, HNA Group, and Richard Branson’s Virgin group, which are all facing their own cash-flow challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic. Credit Suisse analysts estimated last week that with virtually no revenue coming in, Virgin could eat up most of its $900 million cash balance by June and would require additional liquidity to survive the crisis. Despite Government stimulus aimed at airlines, some industry experts want further action including relaxing foreign ownership rules. Rating agencies S&P Global and Fitch also last week downgraded its outlook on the company after Virgin announced it would slash domestic capacity by 90 per cent and ground its budget airline Tigerair indefinitely. S&P said its position had not factored in federal government support for the airline, but the agency believed “that the government may have an incentive to support Australian carriers given the temporary nature of this crisis”. “We nevertheless believe the scale of the COVID-19 exogenous shock has created an immediate and sizable cash outflow,” it said. “We estimate that up to half of Virgin Australia’s operating costs are fixed and that a reduction in variable costs will not offset the collapse in revenue.” S&P said the benefit provided by forward bookings and the Velocity Frequent Flyer business was now likely to partially unwind. “As a consequence, Virgin Australia’s previous $900 million unrestricted cash buffer is likely to materially reduce in the very near term,” it said. A “default or distressed exchange appears increasingly likely over the next 12 months, absent timely government, or other support, and\/or a swift reversal of the COVID-19 outbreak”. Fitch Ratings is a little more optimistic in its outlook on Virgin, taking into account the government’s support package so far. But, on Friday Fitch also argued Virgin’s “liquidity could come under pressure quicker than we previously anticipated”. It said the company would “experience significant working capital outflows for the remainder of FY20 as customers seek refunds and forward bookings fall significantly, alongside cash outflows for aircraft rent, staff costs and other charges”. “Should the travel restrictions remain in place and demand remain subdued for longer than we currently envisage, and if additional funding is not secured over the next few months, this would lead to further negative rating action,” it added."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Please come help us in New York, now’: Medical volunteers on the way","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-new-york-hospital-ship\/","transcript":"As the US becomes the new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, New York’s governor has issued an urgent appeal for medical volunteers amid a “staggering” number of deaths in his state, saying: “Come help us in New York, now.” NY Governor Andrew Cuomo’s call came as the state’s death toll climbed by more than 250 in a single day to a total of more than 1200 victims, most of them in the city. So far there have been more than 2900 deaths and some 160,000 confirmed cases in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data. “There is no American who is immune to this virus,” Mr Cuomo said on Monday (local time). He ordered a lockdown for all non-essential businesses across New York state 11 days ago, leaving just grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential operations open. All non-solitary outside activities, such as basketball and other team sports, were banned. Most of New York City has ground to a halt since, but the escalating emergency is rising daily. There are estimates one million health workers are needed to tackle the crisis. In an emotional image of hope on Monday, a 1000-bed hospital ship used after the September 11 attacks made its way up the Hudson River and a convention centre was converted into a 2900-bed hospital in just three days. “This is like adding another hospital here in New York City,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “The nation has heard our pleas for help.” But he acknowledged the city needed to triple its hospital bed capacity by May. Pictures also showed a small field hospital being erected in tents in the city’s famous Central Park. Across the US, 163,429 people have tested positive to COVID-19. That is almost 50,000 more than Italy and 70,000 more than in Spain. The virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, has torn through New York with frightening speed. The first known infection in the state was discovered on March 1 in a healthcare worker who recently returned from Iran. “We’ve lost over 1000 New Yorkers,” Mr Cuomo said. “To me, we’re beyond staggering already. We’ve reached staggering.” The spike in deaths in New York was another sign of the long fight ahead against the global pandemic, which is filling Spain’s intensive care beds to capacity and shutting millions of Americans inside. The virus is spreading globally even as the crisis in China, where the outbreak began in December, eases. More than 235 million people – about two of every three Americans – live in the 33 states where governors have declared statewide orders or recommendations to stay home. In California, officials put out a similar call for medical volunteers as coronavirus hospitalisations have doubled in the past four days and the number of patients in intensive care tripled. Addressing Americans from the White House, President Donald Trump said the next 30 days would be crucial. “Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and this is a very vital 30 days,” Mr Trump said. “The more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis.” The World Health Organisation’s emergency chief Dr Michael Ryan warned against letting up on tough containment measures. Three-quarters of a million people worldwide have become infected with COVID-19 and more than 37,000 have died, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.

John Van Lieshout has declined to extend rent relief to all businesses across his $1 billion-plus property portfolio. Commercial landlords will be banned from evicting their tenants after the national cabinet on Sunday announced a six-month moratorium. Mr Van Lieshout said he was considering requests for rent relief but would not commit until he knew what the government was doing. His company has asked tenants to detail any government assistance they will receive which, after Monday’s federal government announcement, could include wage relief of $1500 a fortnight per employee. But he said he would help those in distress, depending on their size and length of time trading. “I’ve got some tenants that have only started you know, a beauty salon for 12 months,” Mr Van Lieshout said. “Some of those people I’m going to be very kind to because I know that they cannot possibly [pay] because the government’s closed it down completely. “But the burden of this should be also accepted by the tenants themselves that have run successful businesses for many years.” Arif Memis, owner of Cowch Dessert Cocktail Bar in South Brisbane, was told by Mr Van Lieshout’s company that rent was due despite his trade being “decimated” by the ban on restaurant dining. “I don’t understand what planet he lives on,” Mr Memis said. Mr Van Lieshout, the former owner of Super Amart, was ranked this year by The Australian as the 35th richest person in the country with a $2.4 billion fortune. The 74-year-old told the ABC he believed business owners had a “moral obligation” to reach into their own pockets first before turning to landlords given that “a lot of these tenants – I know for a fact – are wealthy people”. Mr Van Lieshout said he knew it was a tough argument to make amid perceptions that “landlords are all bastards, they’re terrible people, they are capitalists and they should pay”. “But the thing is, take a tenant that has a good business, that’s been in business for 10 or 15 years, say he has a holiday home, he drives a nice Mercedes, and he has money in the bank,” he said. “This [the coronavirus pandemic] happens suddenly – I think he has a moral obligation first to use some of his own capital. “He might be paying $100,000-a-year rent and for three months, a quarter, he has to dip in his pocket for $25,000 of his own money instead of coming to me and saying, ‘How about you put up this money for me?’. “Why is it that people look at landlords and say, ‘Well landlords, you cop it’. If these people sack their staff and don’t pay any rent, they’re almost off scot-free.” Commercial lawyers say it comes amid a wave of disputes brewing between landlords and business tenants facing wipe-out across Australia. Some large institutional landlords have been pro-actively extending rent holidays. An email from the centre manager, state government-owned QIC (Queensland Investment Corporation), told retail tenants on March 27 “you may defer your upcoming April rent payment until 30 April”. Ange Kondos, managing director of retail lease consultants LeaseWise, said some private landlords such as Mr Van Lieshout had not “shown the empathy that’s required”. “I think the conduct of this particular landlord is abhorrent,” Mr Kondos said. “If [landlords] want to play that hard line, they’re going to end up with lots of empty malls.” Mr Kondos said the ban on evictions was welcome but rental terms remained unclear. “Even working with landlords, the harsh reality is some people just won’t make it through the longer this goes on,” Mr Kondos said. Mr Memis said another of his landlords, the Westfield shopping centre at Chermside on Brisbane’s northside, had given him a rent holiday. Meanwhile, he said trade at his flagship South Bank store had dwindled to about six takeaway orders a day. “I think people are scared to order and people are scared to use the Uber and Deliveroo platforms or come out and pick up,” he said. “We had about 35 staff … we’re down to three.” Mr Memis said he had been appealing for weeks for rent relief and had sent financial information when requested. But he said he had received several “letters of demand explaining that rent is due and payable right now”. The owner of a carvery outlet in Windsor in Sydney, Terry Hasan – who is the tenant of a different property owner – said he shut his award-winning business on Saturday. “We’re in a cash-burn cycle now where we’re throwing our own money to burn it, our staff as well are saying with coronavirus they’re afraid to work, so I’ve knocked it on the head,” Mr Hasan said. “I feel as though it’s extremely unfair for us to pay rent.” Mr Van Lieshout said he was not subject to bank pressure because he owned properties outright “and that’s something that should not be used against me – for the fact I’ve been very frugal and that I’ve taken care of my affairs”. “As I could, I owned my own premises because that got rid of two of the biggest worries in my life, which were banks and landlords,” he said. “I hated bank managers because I feared them because they had control over me. “Second thing was I had an early dislike for landlords because as a retailer … you had to negotiate with them all the time.” Mr Van Lieshout said: “What I’m saying here can give me a lot of trouble because people say, ‘Well, he’s in a very sound, financial position and he won’t do this, he won’t do that’.” “But I always kept capital reserves in [my] business,” he said. “I couldn’t go bust because I always made sure that I kept substantial reserves – always – because as far as I was concerned, I had two responsibilities: One was to be able to pay the staff at all times and secondly, my suppliers. “I’m very, very paranoid – always very paranoid – about ever going bust. “As a businessman, you have to save for a rainy day – and right now it’s a cyclone – [but] I run a business the same as everyone else does. Why do I become the scapegoat at the end?”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Inner-city bar fined for breaching coronavirus rules","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/bar-fined-coronavirus-rules\/","transcript":"A Melbourne bar and an unlicensed Queensland brothel have been slapped with hefty fines for flouting the new social distancing and quarantine regulations. A licensed venue in inner-city Fitzroy in Melbourne was hit with a $9913 fine on Monday after police found six staff serving two customers drinks at the weekend. In Queensland, two infringement notices were issued at a Brisbane massage parlour on Monday afternoon for failing to comply with COVID-19 public health directives. Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said a person working at the Lutwyche business was fined $1334, while the business itself copped a $6672 fine. “This related to a compliance check of licensed and unlicensed brothels we are carrying out,” she said on Tuesday. “It’s alleged … the massage services were offered in contravention to (the coronavirus) directive.” Victoria Police’s deputy commissioner Shane Patton said the venue, which has not been named by police, was being treated as “open for business totally”. That was despite a ban on in-person dining at restaurants and bars amid the escalating coronavirus outbreak. “Unless you’re living under a rock, or unless you’re an idiot, it’s quite clear the restrictions are there, the restrictions are to be abided by,” he said on Tuesday. It is the first on-the-spot fine issued by Victoria Police for breaching social-distancing measures. In the past 24 hours, officers have conducted 1225 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services across the state. From Tuesday, individuals can be fined $1652 if they leave home for any reason that is not essential. Victoria has imposed stringent restrictions on movement and work as it tries to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The new social-distancing rules also restrict public gatherings to two people. Playgrounds, skate parks and outdoor gyms will also close. Businesses found to be flouting restrictions face a $9913 fine. However, larger fines can also be issued through the courts. There are similar rules in NSW, where Premier Gladys Berejiklian has implored people to stay at home unless they “absolutely” have to go out. She said the biggest concern was the level of community transmission in some areas, such as Waverley and Bondi in Sydney’s east, where people might be unaware they have coronavirus. “Its really important for people to assume they have it and to act like they have it,” she said on Tuesday. Police Minister Lisa Neville said Victorians could leave their homes only to buy essentials, exercise, seek medical attention or go to work or study – if they cannot do it from home. “People will not get the leniency we have seen in the past,” she said, but noted there might be times when discretion was used. Ms Neville encouraged people to call police if they saw others flouting the rules, instead of taking matters into their own hands. “Don’t fight with your neighbours, we want to come out as a community stronger,” she said. From Tuesday, Victorians will also be banned from buying guns and ammunition until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, after a spike in panic buying. Mr Patton said it was concerning that applications for firearms had doubled recently. The ban on gun sales applies only to sport and recreational use and not primary suppliers or people who use guns for work, such as farmers and prison guards. The ban follows similar measures in Western Australia and Queensland. Victoria confirmed 96 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing its tally to 917. Four people in the state have died from the virus. The cases continue to grow at about 10 per cent, down from a previous high of 25 per cent, Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said. He was cautiously optimistic about how the crisis was developing. “We can cap cases in Australia to 10,000 to 15,000,” he said on Monday. “The alternative is hundreds of thousands, that means hundreds or thousands of deaths.” Across the state, more than 40,000 orders to socially isolate or quarantine have been made as authorities work to stem the spread of coronavirus. An additional 55 cases of the virus were confirmed in the state overnight, bringing the total to 743 with three deaths, 65 people are in hospital and seven in intensive care. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said authorities will ramp up efforts to keep track of the thousands of people ordered to either socially isolate or quarantine for 14 days. Isolation is used to separate ill people with a communicable disease from those who are healthy, while quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of well people who may have been exposed to the virus. Strict border restrictions will be enforced from Friday, meaning anyone wanting to enter Queensland who is not a resident must have an approved border permit or they will be turned away. Public gatherings – including those in private homes – have been limited to just two people and police have the powers to issue fines for individuals and businesses not adhering to quarantine orders or social distancing measures. All passengers arriving on international flights in Queensland, who are returning home or passing through, will be held in local hotels for 14 days under new quarantine measures that came into effect on the weekend. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coles, Kmart and construction workers all confirmed with COVID-19","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/coles-kmart-coronavirus-melbourne\/","transcript":"Several retail workers at supermarkets and discount chain Kmart have tested positive for the deadly coronavirus. Two workers at a Coles supermarket in south-eastern Melbourne have been confirmed with the infection, while two employees at the Kmart at Chadstone Shopping Centre – one of Australia’s busiest shopping malls – were among other confirmed cases. A Melbourne construction site has been temporarily shut down after a worker there tested positive on Monday night. The Chadstone Kmart was also closed on Tuesday afternoon after the positive diagnosis. However, Coles said its Brandon Park supermarket in Mulgrave, in Melbourne’s outer south-east, would remain open despite the positive tests. “Health authorities have not instructed Coles that it is necessary to close any stores, including in cases where team members or customers are diagnosed with COVID-19,” a Coles spokesperson said. “The Victorian Department of Health has reconfirmed that Coles has undertaken all necessary safety measures in stores where positive cases have been identified.” The supermarket had been cleaned extensively and staff who had been in contact with the infected workers have been told to self-isolate.  Elsewhere, Multiplex’s $2.8 billion Melbourne Square worksite at Southbank was closed on Monday night after the construction worker’s diagnosis. “We immediately carried out a full clean and sanitisation of the site in accordance with latest protocols,” regional managing director Graham Cottam said on Tuesday. Work at the site is expected to resume within 24 hours. In a statement, the construction union said all workers on the site had been notified. “Twenty of these workers who were identified as having been in direct contact with the individual are now in self-isolation for the next 14 days,” a CFMEU statement said. The union said the worker immediately began self-isolating after his partner was diagnosed with COVID-19. Victoria recorded another 96 confirmed cases of the coronavirus into Tuesday, taking the number of people testing positive to 917. On Monday, 56 cases were reported.  The Department of Health defines close contact as face-to-face for at least 15 minutes. It also applies to people in the same closed space for at least two hours. Australian National University infectious disease epidemiologist Meru Shee told the ABC it was difficult to follow health advice to not touch hard surfaces, including trolleys, baskets and self-service checkouts, where the virus could survive for several days. “You can’t really do that while you’re shopping,” she said. As the major supermarkets increase efforts to sanitise surfaces and create social-distancing markers at queues, washing hands and avoiding touching surfaces was paramount, she said. “You want to come home as quickly as possible, but if you have access to a toilet at the shopping centre, go and wash your hands with soap and water immediately, or use a bit of alcohol-based hand sanitiser to clean and disinfect your hands,” she said. “Also minimise touching your face without cleaning your hands. That’s the biggest thing.” Coles supermarkets issued an updated advisory on its website on Tuesday, extending trading hours and offering click-and-collect services to carers, friends and neighbours who can shop on behalf of customers who can’t get to the supermarket. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus toll rises as Tasmania records second fatality in as many days","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-death-toll-australia\/","transcript":"Tasmania has recorded its second coronavirus death in as many days, with a man in his 80s dying at the Royal Hobart Hospital on Monday night. His death came after a woman in her 80s died on Monday at a hospital in Burnie, in the state’s north-west. As at 10am Tuesday (ADST), Australia’s coronavirus death toll was 19. Both Tasmanian deaths are associated with travel on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The Ruby Princess has become a major source of COVID-19 spread in Australia after infected passengers were allowed to disembark without adequate health checks. Three crew with severe coronavirus symptoms were taken to hospital on Sunday night. Three more crew were ferried to hospital on Monday. Six people from the Radiance of the Seas, which is offshore near Port Kembla, were transferred to shore on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller urged foreign cruise ships lingering in Australian waters to return to their home ports immediately. Mr Fuller said nine cruise ships were either docked in NSW or waiting off the coast. Only three of them are registered to NSW addresses. “There are thousands of people, potentially, in cruise ships off our coasts that aren’t members of our state and if we take them in, then that could well flood our system unnecessarily,” Mr Fuller said on Tuesday. “All the hard work we’ve done could be over. “We will continue to allow them to have fuel and food … but it is time to go to your port of origin.” By Monday night, there were 285 coronavirus infections in NSW linked to cruise ships, including 189 from the Ruby Princess. Mr Fuller said health authorities would continue to treat stranded cruise passengers on humanitarian grounds. That included two pregnant women from the Ruby Princess who have asked to come ashore. “We are receiving people sensibly back into NSW. They get the required healthcare, then go into mandatory isolation,” he said. Following the Ruby Princess fiasco, NSW has banned all cruise ship passengers from disembarking until new protocols are in place. Mr Fuller has said no cruise passenger will enter NSW without his personal approval. In Western Australia, hundreds of passengers from the cruise ship Artania were flown back to Germany at the weekend. A further 29 are being treated for COVID-19 in a private hospital in Perth. Hundreds more passengers are in quarantine aboard ships docked in Fremantle or on Rottnest Island. WA Premier Mark McGowan earlier urged two ships to leave Australian waters – and called on the Navy to help. “Its home port is actually Germany, so what we’re saying to the ship is ‘you need to leave’, and we’re saying to the Commonwealth ‘you need to help us get that ship to leave’,” he said. WA, which has closed its borders to non-residents, says 84 per cent of its coronavirus cases are linked to travel, whether on a cruise ship, interstate or overseas. “[Some] 32 per cent have been directly related to cruise ships,” Mr McGowan said. In Tasmania, Premier Peter Gutwein again implored people to follow strict social gathering guidelines and stay home. “Social distancing and abiding by the rules will save your life, it will save your family’s life, it will save lives in our community,” he said. “This is a very sad time. It serves as a warning to us all that these are going to be tough and difficult times,” Mr Gutwein said on Tuesday. “Most Tasmanians have put in place the measures that they need to and most are doing what they can in terms of social distancing and importantly in terms of self isolating. “We’ve had unfortunately our second death, there is a message in that for all of us: This virus is deadly. This virus will kill you. “Take the necessary steps that you can. Utilise the rules to your advantage. Social distancing and abiding by the rules will save your life, it will save your family’s life, it will save lives in our community,” he said, referring to strict two-person gatherings around Australia which came into effect from midnight on Monday. As of 6.30am on Tuesday, the federal health department confirmed 4359 of COVID-19 in Australia, with another 266 new cases in the past 24 hours. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Businesses jump at unprecedented $130 billion wage subsidy plan","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/31\/jobkeeper-wages-subsidy-businesses\/","transcript":"Almost 200,000 businesses have signed up to the federal government’s historic $130 billion JobKeeper plan since Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s announcement on Monday afternoon. Within five hours of the scheme’s announcement, 66,000 businesses had registered. By 8am on Tuesday, Mr Morrison revealed that figure had jumped to 113,000 businesses and by 2pm there were 192,558 businesses registered for the wage subsidy. Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg expects the plan to benefit at least six million Australian workers, almost half the country’s workforce. “Australia’s never seen income support like this,” Mr Frydenberg said. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the government committed the equivalent of 16.4 per cent of Australia’s GDP to keeping the economy on deck. “It’s an eye-watering amount … It is a very, very significant investment,” Senator Cormann said. Employees who were stood down from March 1 will receive a flat-rate payment of $1500 a fortnight through their employers in a bid to lessen the economic blow caused by the virus. The wage subsidy will start flowing to businesses on May 1 and will last for six months. It applies to: Mr Frydenberg said while more financial help was on the way, none of it would match Monday’s announcement in dollars. He said it would take years to pay off the debt generated as a result, but the government had to do what was needed. Mr Morrison said some countries would face economic collapse or hollowing out in coming months as the disease spread globally. “In the very worst of circumstances, we could see countries themselves fall into chaos – this will not be Australia,” he said. Parliament could sit as early as next week to pass legislation related to the new JobKeeper payment. Labor is likely to back the overall package, which unions and business groups support. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the historic package was a step in the right direction. Flight Centre chief executive Graham Turner, who has stood down thousands of Australian employees, is lukewarm on the wage subsidy scheme. “It’s a very positive step … but only 45 per cent of our business is in Australia,” Mr Turner told ABC radio. “Hibernation is a catchy word. Going to sleep and waking up in the spring time is just not feasible from a business point of view.” Deloitte Australia economist Chris Richardson said the scheme could save half a million jobs. “It pretty much is the kitchen sink, the scale is enormous,” he told the ABC. Business Council chief executive Jennifer Westacott said the subsidies were a fair way of making sure workers stayed connected to employers during the crisis. “This huge package will keep people in jobs and, vitally, make sure Australia is ready to rebuild quickly once this challenge passes,” she said. “We must safeguard as many jobs as we can to prevent long periods of joblessness and poverty.” The $1500 a fortnight payment amounts to about 70 per cent of the median wage. ACTU secretary Sally McManus said while the decision was welcome, the amount might not be enough. “We believe that allowing this amount to increase up to the median wage of $1375 a week is what is needed.” Ms McManus also raised concerns for casuals who had worked for the same employer for less than 12 months. As it stands, they are not covered by the scheme. Australian Industry Group welcomed the package but said the government needed to guarantee the manufacturing sector could keep running. “Talk persists and businesses continue to worry that they could be caught up … in any future lockdown,” Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus laws: Australians ignoring rules to face $11,000 fines or jail","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-police-fines\/","transcript":"New public health orders in NSW, Victoria and Tasmania will allow courts to jail Australians who leave home without a reasonable excuse including those who attempt to head to their holiday house to ‘self-isolate’. Authorities will be watching for people disobeying the limit on gatherings and anyone outside without a valid reason, with police in Western Australia confirming they will even use drones to identify people flouting the rules. In some states, offenders could cop fines of up to $11,000 if they ignore the social distancing laws which have been put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19. Businesses that have already been ordered to shutdown – including nail salons, tattoo parlours and brothels – could be slapped with fines of up to $55,000 if police catch them trading during the lockdown. In NSW, the new laws will also empower the NSW Premier to shut down retailers that currently remain open in the state. That could mean the premier could force Bunnings, Target, KMart, and Officeworks to close their doors. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is understood to be closing more retailers, despite promising signs that the growth rate of COVID-19 cases is slowing. The new rules threaten stiffer penalties than those that have applied in virus hotspots including Italy. Signed at 10.20pm on Monday, the NSW orders direct that a person must not, without reasonable excuse, leave the person’s place of residence. The new orders expressly prohibit citizens ‘self-isolating’ at beach holiday homes: “Taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse.” Acceptable reasons to leave home include buying food or other essentials, travelling for work or education, exercise and medical reasons or caring for others. Caring responsibilities can include a trip to the vet for pets or travelling for the purposes of attending childcare. People can still go out to exercise and they may attend a wedding (five people including the celebrant) or a funeral (10 people) subject to strict size limits. Moving home, donating blood, and accessing welfare, domestic violence or mental health services are all permitted. For divorced parents, children who do not live in the same household as their parents or siblings or one of their parents or siblings can continue existing arrangements for access to, and contact between, parents and children or siblings. Priests, ministers of religion or member of a religious order can also attend places of worship or travel to provide pastoral care to another person. As previously flagged by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday night, the provisions prohibit anyone participating in a gathering in a public place of more than 2 people. Exceptions include—(a) gatherings of members of the same household, and (b) gatherings essential for work or education. Those that fail to comply with the order could face up to 6 months in jail or a fine of up to $11,000 or both plus a further $5500 fine each day the offence continues. Businesses that fail to comply with a direction are liable to a fine of $55,000 and $27,500 each day the offence continues.

But they say that the mutations aren’t any more dangerous to human health. Scientific labs across the globe have submitted 2000 genetic sequences of COVID-19 to open database NextStrain, showing the virus is mutating every 15 days. But the mutations are so small that there is no strain of the virus that is more harmful than the other, said Nextstrain co-founder Trevor Bedford. And, while the eight mutations are circulating around the world, they remain “completely benign” and are simply useful as a “puzzle piece” to better understand how the coronavirus is spreading, he said. Mr Bedford added that COVID-19 mutates like any other virus and their work has been to identify exactly how it migrates and splits into similar but new subtypes. More researchers are dissecting the genomes of coronavirus and discovering the strains that have emerged since the virus is thought to have first jumped from animals to humans in a Wuhan, China, wildlife market late last year. “In the literal sense of ‘is it changing genetically?,’ the answer is absolutely yes,” Harvard University infectious disease epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told America’s National Public Radio. “What is in question is whether there’s been any change that’s important to the course of disease or the transmissibility or other things that we as humans care about.” The strains emerging are only slightly tweaked, with no variations in how lethal they are, experts said. “The observed rate of mutation (about two mutations per month) is completely normal for a virus,” Bedford wrote on Twitter. “Flu and the common cold have similar mutation rates. Even a bit faster for flu.” While the genomes retrieved so far are providing reassuring information about how the virus can be stopped and whether social distancing is working – indications are that it is – they do not provide more than a sketch, the experts said. Scientists agree that there is much more to be discovered. But the microscopic changes are helping them map the pathogen’s pathway through the human population. “The outbreaks are trackable,” Charles Chiu, a professor of medicine and infectious disease at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, told USA Today. “We have the ability to do genomic sequencing almost in real-time to see what strains or lineages are circulating.” The UK is one week into its lockdown and, already, there are hopeful signs that social distancing is slowing the outbreak, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist advising the government. Speaking to BBC Radio, Professor Ferguson said the number of virus-related hospital admissions on March 30 “does seem to be slowing down a little bit now”, suggesting the lockdown measures were having a positive effect. “It’s not yet plateaued as the numbers are increasing each day, but the rate of that increase has slowed,” he added. “We see similar patterns in a number of European countries.” More and more countries are increasingly relying on social distancing to curb the virus’ spread. Spain has entered its third week of a near-total lockdown, with the government strengthening social distancing measures after announcing at the weekend that all non-essential workers must stay home. The US has also extended social distancing rules for another 30 days, until April 30 due to concerns that the death toll could peak in two weeks. Italy, the world’s hardest-hit country which accounts for more than a third of all global fatalities, saw its total death tally rise to 11,591 since the outbreak emerged in northern regions on February 21. More positively, the number of new cases rose by just 4050, the lowest amount since March 17, reaching a total of 101,739. Back home in Australia, more than 100 million surgical masks will be pumped out by a South Australian company in the coming months under an agreement with the federal and SA governments that also includes the manufacture of respirators. The agreement with Adelaide’s Detmold Group is for 145 million masks, with 100 million to go to the National Medical Stockpile and 45 million to SA. “We have a sufficient supply of masks at the moment, but this work will ensure we sustain that supply over the months ahead,” federal Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said in a statement on Tuesday. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Follow these social distancing rules or face fines and jail","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-rules-exercise-family-housemates\/","transcript":"Social distancing rules aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus now stop more than two people gathering outside. On Monday night, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania went even further by making it illegal for people to be off their property without a valid reason. And it was made clear that travelling to a holiday home to self isolate was definitely not an acceptable excuse for leaving home. “Taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse,” the orders which passed in NSW state. The message has been repeated loud and clear: Stay home unless you absolutely have to go out. That will save lives. Police are going to be enforcing the rules and in some states you can be fined a hefty sum – up to $11,000 or five times that for a business – if you don’t adhere to the guidelines. You could even be jailed. So what are the new restrictions? We all have questions: Can I visit my family? Can I still exercise outside?  Social gatherings are now limited to two people at indoor and outdoor settings, as well as at private properties. This means you can no longer do a group bootcamp at the park, nor can you have two friends over for a cup of tea – even if you all stand at least 1.5 metres apart. Mr Morrison said the two-person limit was created with women’s safety in mind so “they wouldn’t be required to walk on their own”. The two-person limit does not apply to people within your household. For example, a family of five can take the dog for a walk at the park together. It depends on the state or territory in which you live. In Victoria, you face an on-the-spot fine of more than $1600. In NSW, police will be cracking down but no fines have been announced yet. In South Australia, you can be slapped with a $1000 fine. In the ACT, you may receive an official warning for now, but police will soon be able to issue fines. In Tasmania, police can arrest and charge you. Yes. A family split across two houses can meet. You can visit your parents or a sibling, but the usual social distancing rules (like no touching, and standing 1.5 metres apart) apply. There are no new rules for older people – just strong recommendations. People aged 70 and over have been encouraged to stay home and self-isolate as a precaution, as well as anybody aged over 60 with a chronic illness. The advice for Indigenous people is that anyone over the age of 50 should stay home. “This does not mean they cannot go outside,” Mr Morrison said. “They can go outside and be accompanied by a support person for the purposes of getting fresh air and recreation, but should limit contact with others as much as possible.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Just #StayAtHome during coronavirus and try these ways to stay sane","date":"03-31-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/31\/coronavirus-home-ideas\/","transcript":"Readers of The New Daily have proved that abiding by life-saving isolation rules does not have to be boring, unproductive or isolating.

Hellmut Seifferth told The New Daily he has used the extra time at home to sort out “thousands” of photos on his computer and decorate garden pots in his backyard by planting succulents around the edges of them.

He saved a life that day, but for a long time the 54-year-old couldn’t see it that way. “I used to say to myself ‘I didn’t save one, I lost one’,” he told The New Daily as one of 83 recipients of the Australian Bravery Award announced on Tuesday. That one he “lost” was mother-of-two Leanne Smith. Mr Fyfe managed to pull her then 25-year-old son Ryan out of their burning car, which had been struck from behind with such force that it spun out of control before catching fire. When the car exploded for the first time after the crash, the pair was still trapped inside. Mr Fyfe recalls seeing, through the flames, a pair of men’s boots sticking out the passenger window before, without hesitation, making a beeline for the burning car. That’s when the vehicle blew up, sending him flying through the air – but Mr Fyfe wasn’t down for long. He again raced to the crushed car, managing to grab hold of the boots and, after “three or four hard pulls”, dragged Ryan to safety. The car exploded again, trapping 51-year-old Leanne inside. Mr Fyfe later revisited the scene of the tragic incident on the Sturt Highway, near Blanchetown in South Australia. “I went back six weeks later to say ‘sorry Leanne, I couldn’t get you out’.” As a truck driver, Mr Fyfe was in his own accident 12 years before the Blanchetown incident. Then, he suffered an acquired brain injury and needed three skull reconstruction surgeries after his truck rolled over. His back was broken in three places and multiple ribs were crushed. After recovery, Mr Fyfe couldn’t bear going back to work because of the trauma of that day – so he stayed without a job for 12 years. Eventually, he ran out of money and decided to return to driving trucks interstate. Mr Fyfe was just three months into his new role when he came upon the  accident involving Ryan and Leanne. On his way from Sydney to Adelaide, Mr Fyfe saw what looked like a fireball up ahead. “Every time I talk about it or someone brings it up, I just start crying,” Mr Fyfe said. “I was there on my own. He hasn’t worked since that May 2015 day – and now lives in a mental health facility that has been helping him, for the past few years, deal with the trauma. The hardest thing for Mr Fyfe to accept has been that Leanne’s death was not his fault. In fact, the man who rear-ended her car, Ian Peter Clarke, was arrested and charged with dangerous driving – a charge to which he entered a guilty plea earlier this month. Of his actions that day Mr Fyfe believes “any caring person would have done the same thing”. Given all that he’s been through, Mr Fyfe wants others to know “it’s easy to be a good person” and “anyone can do it”. He also has an especially important message for his daughter. “I haven’t seen my daughter since she was two and I was just hoping if I ever went on telly (sic) or anything, she might see me and think I’m not as bad as her mum made me out to be. She would be 30 now.” Governor-General David Hurley said all awards recognised “courage and sacrifice” and “people who, in a moment of danger or threat, think of others ahead of their own safety”. “We celebrate their bravery and the example that they set: Putting others before self and a willingness to help strangers, the vulnerable and those in danger in the most difficult of times.” Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Mr Fyfe and the other recipients will receive their award during a ceremony at their state or territory Government House at a later date.

On Monday, he did just that and some more – and the nation is better off for it. Scott Morrison has unveiled a breathtaking government jobs subsidy package costing an eye-watering $130 billion. Just last Friday Finance Minister Mathias Cormann ruled out the very idea – and in that he was lockstep with the Prime Minister and Treasurer, who had been dismissing it for weeks. On Monday morning, Josh Frydenberg claimed the government had been working on that scheme for a while. If he was telling the truth, then he and his colleagues had been misleading us all. More likely it’s a bit of face saving and further evidence that, faced with a crisis of this size and speed, any government would be flying by the seat of its pants. We shouldn’t be surprised that in our democratic system of contest parliamentary governance, Morrison and his merry band – or I should say band struggling to have anything to be merry about – were also playing politics. When @AustralianLabor unions and business proposed a broad wage subsidy it was dismissed by some – now the principle has been adopted and legislation will be considered by Parliament #makingadifference — Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) March 30, 2020 It is ingrained in our version of the Westminster system that governments and oppositions are always trying to get one up on each other to impress the voters. Before the lethal COVID-19 bug began spreading worldwide, the one-upmanship in Australia had degenerated into mindless tribalism. Anything the other “mob” put up was, by definition, hopeless. Such a paradigm could not survive a situation as grim as we are all in now. We are still seeing competition and we are seeing different world views being applied to the urgent search for remedies to this health-induced economic collapse. Morrison admitted as he began detailing the JobKeeper package that for some it would be “too little” and for others “too much”. In itself, this is an admission the government is taking a calculated risk. In its own ranks there is acceptance of this caution, but its political opponents in the Labor Party have been saying for weeks now this is not good enough. Precious time has been lost. Our response to the coming announcement on wage subsidies. It needs to be for all workers, employers big and small & generous so we can save jobs #COVID19Aus pic.twitter.com\/SpoVmE2ZD0 — Sally McManus (@sallymcmanus) March 29, 2020 Lessons from the coronavirus outbreak in China, Asia and Europe have taken too long to sink in if the thousands of sacked workers who queued outside Centrelink offices last week are any guide, not to mention the slowness to respond to quarantine and border issues. Australia was given a three-week start, and the opposition, business groups and the unions have not been unpatriotic in pointing this out. Nor has the call for more urgency been petty nit-picking. As we’ve seen from the first two responses from the government, the sheer amount of money – $70 billion – doesn’t mean they’ve got it right. Business commentators like the Herald Sun’s Terry McCrann thought the first effort was solving the wrong crisis. “Stimulus” wasn’t needed, but survival support was. This latest mega amount is directed squarely at the heart of the calamity. Even so Jim Stanford, an economist advising the ACTU, says it will probably see the budget plunge at least $100 billion into the red and – at $1500 a fortnight – won’t save enough of the six million workers it is aimed at. And if the govt lowballs the eventual subsidy (capping it too low, and\/or – unbelievably –  excluding part-timers), then they will squander so many of its potential benefits. https:\/\/t.co\/DMtQWvLg5l — Jim Stanford (@JimboStanford) March 30, 2020 Morrison, who didn’t include Labor leader Anthony Albanese in his national coronavirus cabinet, says he is now consulting the opposition’s key people to expedite passage of the legislation needed through an emergency session of parliament. But if we really are “at war” with this virus, as Morrison told 60 Minutes, wouldn’t it have been better for  the Prime Minister to emulate the country’s leaders in World War II and set up an across the Parliament Advisory War Council giving the opposition a bigger earlier say?

Sweden has garnered criticism for what some experts say is a “relaxed” response to COVID-19 that has resulted in a higher number of deaths than other comparable countries. In an article published in The Conversation, two epidemiologists from Sweden’s Lund University highlighted the growing concern among Swedish doctors and scientists over their government’s approach to COVID-19. “Unlike its Nordic neighbours, Sweden has adopted a relatively relaxed strategy, seemingly assuming that overreaction is more harmful than under-reaction,” Professor Paul Franks and Professor Peter Nilsson wrote. However, Sweden has a much higher number of COVID-19 fatalities than neighbours Denmark and Norway, despite having a similar number of confirmed cases, the researchers noted. So how does Sweden compare to Australia? As of Monday morning, the Scandinavian country had a similar number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to Australia (3700 v 3980), but many more deaths (110 compared to 16). University of New South Wales infectious diseases expert Raina MacIntyre said the difference in the number of deaths may be partially due to Australia’s testing regime. Case fatality rate (CFR) is an epidemiological term for “the proportion of people who die from a specified disease among all individuals diagnosed with the disease over a certain period of time”. “The case fatality globally has been varied, is generally lower in countries that have tested more (and therefore identified more people with mild infection) and highest in countries where ICU capacity has been stretched or exceeded, such as Italy and Spain,” Professor MacIntyre said. “Australia is still within capacity of the health system, and has also done a lot more testing than Sweden, I suspect. This may be contributing to the lower case fatality rate.” Epidemiologist Abrar Chughtai, a lecturer in international health at UNSW, has been tracking CFR globally. Australia is “doing well in testing” and is “far ahead of many countries”, Dr Chughtai said. The CFR is low in countries doing “wide testing”, such as South Korea and Germany, he said. As of March 30, Germany had a CFR of 0.7 per cent, while South Korea had a rate of 1.6 per cent, with both countries doing “wide testing”, while Australia had a CFR of just 0.4 per cent. The worldwide CFR of COVID-19 CFR is 4.7 per cent, but “might be lower as mild cases are not reported”, Dr Chughtai said. Overall #COVID19 CFR 4.7%, but actual might be lower as mild cases are not reported. CFR is very high in Italy (10.8%), Spain (7.9%) and UK (6%). Huge variation in CFR among countries, might be due to various factors such as testing, age structure, control measures, etc. pic.twitter.com\/W3EZ7dLh0z — Abrar Ahmad Chughtai (@doctorahmad75) March 30, 2020  Factors such as relatively closed borders compared to European countries, a strong health system, and early interventions may play a role in Australia’s low CFR, he said. “I think we are doing quite well.” Many countries with high CFR such as Italy (10.8 per cent), Spain (7.9 per cent) and the UK (6 per cent), are “doing limited testing”, Dr Chughtai said. However, he emphasised that testing is “just one factor in low CFR”, with other interventions also important. Although Australia is doing many things well, Dr Chughtai said further improvements can be made. “I think testing can be improved further to include mild symptomatic cases as well, but of course this require more resources so [there’s a] need to plan carefully,” he said. More social distancing measures such as school closure “can be considered”, he said, “but we need to understand that all these measures involve severe financial implications”. The CFR of COVID-19 is also “increasing over time”, and will rise once the outcome of cases currently under treatment become available, Dr Chughtai said. “We need to understand that this is a novel virus and we don’t know many things about it,” he said. “We are passing through an unprecedented time.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Ten questions about the $1500 wage subsidy people need answered","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/30\/10-questions-about-coronavirus-wage-subsidy\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison will unleash an unprecedented $130 billion of taxpayers’ money with one mission in mind: Putting the Australian economy on life support and protecting jobs. It’s a radical experiment that the Prime Minister concedes is unprecedented. It’s also a gamble on the hope that COVID-19 rates will not spike again before a vaccine is found, forcing governments to re-introduce draconian measures and shut down businesses again. The JobKeeper Payment is designed to help bosses keep staff on the payroll during government-ordered shutdowns and reduced profits. The hope is they are ready to go back to work or increase hours when the business emerges from ‘hibernation’. Workers don’t have to be stood down, you just have to prove turnover has taken a hit. But it will also help sole traders, casuals and part-timers whose hours have been reduced as a result of COVID-19. Mr Morrison predicts it could help six million Australians workers. Here’s how it works. To be eligible, a worker must have worked for a company for 12 months or longer. The employer needs to prove the business is down 30 per cent as a result of COVOID-19 or they expect it will soon be the case. Eligible workers need to be an Australian citizen, the holder of a permanent visa, a protected special category visa holder, a non-protected special category visa holder who has been residing continually in Australia for 10 years or more, or a special category (Subclass 444) visa holder. Any business with a turnover of less than $1 billion that has had turnover reduced by more than 30 per cent will qualify. That’s likely to include cafes and restaurants that have laid off staff and retailers including Cotton On that have temporarily closed down. But it could also help companies like Target that have far fewer customers than usual. Even big businesses with a turnover of $1 billion or more will qualify if their turnover is reduced by more than 50 per cent, relative to a comparable period a year ago. That sounds like the scheme is been tailor-made to offer assistance to airlines like Qantas, which has stood down more than 20,000 staff. If you’re a small business with five employees who all currently earn $1700 per fortnight before tax, you could continue to pay your staff their full wage while only incurring a $200 wage cost per fortnight before tax per employee above the $1500 per fortnight. Yes. The minimum payment eligible workers will get is $1500 before tax. But your boss could choose to use it as a wage subsidy during the downturn, but continue to pay you more than that if, for example, you are still working or choose to pay you the minimum amount while you’re stood down and not working. Employers need to contact the Australian Taxation Office to participate in the scheme. You will need to provide supporting information demonstrating a downturn in their business. The ATO will also need to know the number of eligible employees employed by the business. Workers don’t need to apply but they need to talk to employers if they have been laid off after March 1. Workers don’t get the $1500 as a welfare payment. It will be paid by employers through the payroll system. According to the Prime Minister, because the payments will be run through the ATO, that will provide the mechanisms for it to follow up with employers. “This is a payment per employee that will be able to be followed through on what is known as the single-touch payroll system, which is now being broadly implemented right across Australia,” Mr Morrison said. “And that puts the checks and balances in place for the tax office to be able to ping those who are not doing the right thing.” If an employee already receives $1500 or more in income per fortnight before tax, they will continue to receive their regular income according to their prevailing workplace laws. The JobKeeper Payment will assist their employer to continue operating by subsidising workers’ pay. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said there is a legal obligation on the part of employers. “This is a psychological and tangible material boost to employees around the country,” he said. As long as an employee was on your books on March 1 and continues to be engaged by that employer – including full-time, part-time, long-term casuals and stood-down employees, you’re eligible. If you have already stood down employees before the start of the scheme, you can still participate. If the employee is receiving the Jobseeker payment or “the dole” after being stood down or having their hours reduced and the employer will be eligible for the JobKeeper Payment, the staff member will need to advise Services Australia of their new income. If an employee has been stood down, their employer must pay their employee, at a minimum, $1500 per fortnight, before tax. Superannuation on any additional wage paid because of the JobKeeper Payment is at the discretion of the employer. Part-time workers and casuals qualify if they’ve worked for an employer for 12 months or longer. Even if you earn less than $1500 per fortnight you will get the full amount under the scheme. That means some workers will even qualify for a short-term pay rise. If you have more than one employer you can only claim for the $1500 payment once which is paid to the company, not directly to you in the first instance. If you’re a sole trader or self-employed you may will be eligible if you can prove you have suffered or expect to suffer a 30 per cent decline in turnover relative to a comparable prior period. That means you don’t even have to prove your turnover is down 30 per cent, you just need to say you expect that. So, if you’re a hairdresser and you expect business will dry up under the new rules in NSW where you can’t leave the house for non-essential purposes, you could stand down staff and pay them the $1500 per fortnight. For example, if you’re a florist who expects to lose money over COVID-19 you can apply and potentially receive $1500 per fortnight before tax, paid on a monthly basis. If you’ve been laid off and applied for the JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement, you’re eligible to receive $1124.50 before tax per fortnight. But if you can convince your employer to re-hire you under the JobKeeper Payment, you can receive $1500 a fortnight before tax while you are stood down. However, you need to tell Services Australia about the income. You are no longer eligible for the JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement from Services Australia as a result of receiving the JobKeeper Payment. It’s a temporary measure that will last for only six months. The idea is that businesses can keep people in their jobs and re-start when the crisis is over. For workers, it holds the hope they can keep their job and earn an income – even if their hours have been cut. The subsidy will start on March 30, but payments won’t start until the first week of May. That means millions of bosses and sole traders will get a big lump sum in that month."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Renters offered coronavirus relief as Government pauses evictions","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/property\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-rent-moratorium\/","transcript":"Australian renters struggling to cover their rent payments have been thrown a lifeline after the federal government introduced a six-month moratorium on evictions. Under new rules announced on Sunday, commercial and residential landlords will be unable to turf out tenants who can’t pay the rent because of the coronavirus pandemic. “There will be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months under those rental arrangements,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. Tasmania was the first to implement these measures on March 25, giving renters a 120-day grace period if the pandemic leaves them unable to pay for the roof over their heads. “Any appeals from tenants for a notice to vacate due to rental arrears that are currently waiting to be heard by the Magistrates Court will be put on hold,” said the state’s minister for building and construction, Elise Archer. Incentives will be included for tenants to keep paying their rent through the pandemic where they’re able to do so, Ms Archer added. But the remaining state and territory governments are yet to specify how they will apply and implement their moratoriums. A Productivity Commission report found two-thirds of renters in the private market experience rental stress (defined as spending more than 30 per cent of their disposable income on rent). With so many people under pressure at the best of times, Anglicare Australia CEO Kasy Chambers said a moratorium is a welcome measure. “We’re thrilled that government has heard the call [for a moratorium],” she told The New Daily. However, the lack of detail provided by government leaves many questions unanswered. “We’re still pushing a little bit around, things like what will happen to arrears when the moratorium finishes, how we relieve tenants but still support small landlords for whom rent is their only income,” she said. Dr Chris Martin, senior research fellow with University of New South Wales’ City Futures Research Centre, flagged similar concerns. “An eviction moratorium in the present public health crisis we’re experiencing is essential to deal with both the health and economic aspects of the problem,” he said. Dr Martin cautioned that by linking the eviction moratorium to financial hardship, it still leaves landlords with other ways to evict their tenants. In most states, landlords could still force out their tenants without grounds to evict after their fixed-term agreement expires. Without specifically addressing these concerns, Dr Martin said a partial moratorium will be the same as no moratorium at all. One of the biggest problems facing Australia’s renters is the unforgiving legal structures governing disputes with landlords. Banks and other financial institutions have a legal obligation to offer some flexibility to customers (through hardship provisions, for example), but landlords face no such requirements. Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive Gerard Brody said this needs to change. “Even before this crisis there should have been obligations on landlords to consider flexibility, whether that’s moratoriums or reduced payments to get through a tough time,” he told The New Daily. “With that, importantly, there needs to be some kind of service that acts as arbiter to resolve any disputes fairly.” Mr Brody noted that Australia’s financial service system includes a multitude of ombudsman services, such as Australian Financial Complaints Authority and the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. But there’s no equivalent service for renters. Instead, the only path of recourse for renters is to take their concerns to a civil tribunal, which Mr Brody said is unlikely to recognise the unique circumstances posed by the coronavirus. “Tribunals are typically run as law. They will follow what the law requires them to,” he said. These hearings are also expensive and time-consuming, making it even harder for struggling renters to have their case heard."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Read all about the pandemic, but beware viral marketing","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-beware-viral-marketing\/","transcript":"Across the world media consumers are flocking to established news sites to get the latest information on the coronavirus as infection rates soar and governments change their policies daily. The result has been huge increases in readership and viewing numbers, with a rising tide lifting all boats – although consumers may well want to read the fine print on subscription offers as companies seek to lock in those eyeballs for the future. Australia’s News Corp this week announced it will provide free access to pandemic stories and provide free 28-day subscriptions to new digital metro and news apps. The Nine network had already been offering its live blogs, with most virus stories as a free service. Other longer stories on the pandemic have remained behind a paywall.  News Corp has been heavily spruiking its offer of health-related stories for free on its cable television service SkyNews, including extended interviews with the editors of some of its leading mastheads. However, one thing missing in those entreaties from the fearless editors was the reality that the free subscription reverts to the usual masthead fee after the introductory period. In selling the marketing offer, News Corp Australia chief executive Michael Miller claimed his company’s “responsibility is as clear as it is big, to keep the public informed and adapt to COVID-19’s profound impact on Australia and the communities we serve”. It’s a noble statement and one that could equally be applied to climate change mitigation – but there’s apparently less money in that. In a media world that has seen free-to-air TV, radio and newspapers disrupted by digital media in recent years, the interest in coronavirus news is bringing mixed fortunes. Audiences are surging, but advertising revenues are in grave doubt as businesses pull in their horns. With limited dollars in the field, the rush is on to highlight who is winning the battle for the most viewers. On social media senior ABC personalities have been welcoming their bigger numbers, but the Nine network has also had high-profile boosters in the field, including senior Canberra journalist Chris Uhlmann. The often combative journalist raised eyebrows with recent posts that appeared to take aim at his former employer, the ABC. And if you thought it was just talking heads on Australian television shouting about their increased audience numbers, you’ve clearly forgotten about US President Donald Trump. The mass media marketer-in-chief has spent the past few days bragging about how his newly re-animated daily White House briefings are a ratings hit. Mr Trump claims one of his recent 6pm briefings attracted 6.2 million viewers, tweeting it was “an astounding number … more akin to the viewership for a popular prime-time sitcom”. This website, The New Daily, operates on a free subscription model and has also had an increase in traffic during the recent crisis. Month on month, TND has increased traffic to its site by 25 per cent since February. It has an audience of 3.85 million monthly unique visitors, with daily growth through the crisis. Ultimately, the numbers men will sort out the traffic and the advertising issues, but we would all be better served if journalists just worked towards providing factual and useful information targeted to the audience that they know consume and enjoy their work. It’s masks, medical equipment and holding power to account that is required in this time of crisis – not egos and mine’s bigger than yours comparisons.

Two separate investigations, one by the guild and another by Los Angeles Opera, of which Domingo was previously general director, found that sexual harassment charges against him were credible. The investigations led to a string of cancellations of Domingo’s European concert dates, including London’s Royal Opera House and a concert organised by Spain’s National Institute of Performing Arts and Music.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the new measure in Canberra on Monday afternoon, urging Australians to keep the faith as the government responded to “a whole new set of rules”. Even during the Great Depression, a wage subsidy of this size and scale was never offered in Australia. It will offer workers nearly three times what the unemployment benefit was just weeks ago, before it was doubled to $550 a week to help the thousands of workers laid off amid the expanding coronavirus crisis. But it will be designed to help businesses keep workers on the books, rather than send them to the dole queues during government-ordered shutdowns. “Now is the time to dig deep,” Mr Morrison said. “This calls for unprecedented action. Governments are making decisions like they never have before. We are working now to a whole new set of rules.” The payment will be available to full-time, part-time and casuals who have been working for a company for more than a year. “Some will say it’s too little. Some will say it’s too much,” Mr Morrison said. “Many countries in the months ahead may well see their economies collapse. We may see countries fall into chaos. That will not be Australia. Workers who have been laid off after March 1 will be eligible for the new payment. Treasure Josh Frydenberg said the government wanted Australians to know it “had their backs”. Labor’s treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers urged Mr Morrison to recall Parliament to pass the new laws. “We welcome the government’s admission that Australian workers and businesses desperately need wage subsidies,” he said. “Every day that wage subsidies have been delayed has meant more Australians joining unemployment queues, which are already unacceptably long. “For wage subsidies to be effective, they need to be conditional on the link between employers and workers being maintained and there are helpful indications on that front. But, to be effective, wage subsidies also need to be broad enough.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Like a jail cell': Travellers vent about conditions in hotel quarantine","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/hotel-quarantine-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Some of the returning Australian travellers forced into two weeks’ quarantine in city hotels under tough coronavirus restrictions have complained of prison-like conditions and inadequate supplies.

She told SBS news the conditions inside were “abysmal”, and she and fellow passengers were being treated like criminals. “We are not allowed out of our rooms, even with masks and keeping a 1.5 metre distance,” she said. “We are not allowed to open our doors except to get food. We are not allowed to get any fresh air and the windows do not open.” Another cruise passenger, 74-year-old John Poole, said the situation had been badly handled. “It feel like we are in a jail cell. Prisoners in Long Bay are being looked after better than we are – and we don’t even have the virus,” he said. “We aren’t the high-risk people. We need fresh air.” Sydney arrivals are also being put up at the Hilton, the Intercontinental and the budget Ibis. In Melbourne, returned travellers have been taken to the four-star Crown Promenade and the Crown Metropol. All had their temperatures checked on arrival at airports. They were then bundled onto buses by police and the military to go the city hotels. Life in the hotels will be restricted – quarantined travellers cannot use shared facilities and their rooms are under guard to make sure rules are followed. Bridget Lindsay told the ABC on Monday that her journey from Sydney airport to the Hilton hotel took five hours. She and her boyfriend arrived back in Australia on an American humanitarian flight back from Ecuador that cost them $14,000. “It’s a lovely room, I’ll give it that,” Ms Lindsay said. “It’s quite confronting, actually, to see all these bans being put in place on us. It’s very, very isolating.” She said the couple understood they presented a risk to the community, but would have liked to be “treated a bit like a human”. “We’ve been treated somewhat a little bit like animals, I feel, since yesterday from the airport,” she said. Research adviser Carina Wyborn was scathing about the care pack she found when she finally got to her room. But her comments drew little sympathy from other social media users. “Try have a grateful heart. There are people who cannot even afford a holiday, let alone afford to feed themselves or children or even have a roof over their head. You wont go hungry,” responded one Twitter user. “Sorry to see the goods provided to you for free by the Australian taxpayer are not sufficiently meeting your outrageous sense of entitlement,” wrote another. “Sending thoughts and prayers.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Hundreds of cruise ship passengers in quarantine as three crew members taken to hospital | The New Daily","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/cruise-ship-chaos-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Three crew members from the stricken Ruby Princess cruise liner who were suffering acute respiratory symptoms have been admitted to a Sydney hospital. The three were among 1100 crew quarantined on the ship off the coast of Sydney as the number of confirmed Australian cases from the ship jumped to 215 by Sunday night. The latest development comes as all 797 passengers from another cruise liner docked at Fremantle, the Vasco da Garma, were allowed to disembark over the weekend. Six hundred went into quarantine in Perth hotels and 197 were transferred to Rottnest Island on Monday. The New Zealand passengers were flown home on Sunday morning. And after a stand-off in WA with German cruise liner the Artania about who would treated its infected passengers, 29 out of 41 who tested positive for COVID-19 will be cared for at a private health facility in Perth. The federal and state governments, along with the Joondalup Health Campus, have struck a deal to care for the patients in the 145-bed private hospital. “This humanitarian hospital care will be provided in one of the state’s premier facilities, which is fully prepared for and is already treating COVID-19 patients,” Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday. Joondalup Health Campus chief executive Kempton Cowan it was important that the private sector could help the sick passengers. “Our teams are ready with the appropriate training and strict infection controls and safety protocols in place,” he said. The ship’s other passengers have been flown home to Germany. Three-quarters of WA’s 311 confirmed coronavirus cases have come from flights or cruise ships. Operators of the Vasco da Gama, CMV Australia said that it was comforting for their passengers to finally learn the state government’s decision. “Although it took almost five days to receive details of these passenger arrangements since the WA Premier’s initial media announcement, at least we have now been able to let our guests know what the next steps are for them. “We’re happy to report no cases of COVID-19 on board. After being at sea for over two weeks straight, and with so much change happening around the world, we are glad to give our passengers some certainty,” managing director Dean Brazier said. Meanwhile, chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the three Ruby Princess crew, who are not Australian nationals, were evacuated with the help of a police launch boat once the ship had anchored near Botany Bay. “It was assessed that they needed to be unloaded from that cruise ship and receive better care,” Dr Chant said on Monday. “We’ve always indicated we’d put the lives of the crew-members above everything else.” In the wake of the Ruby Princess fiasco, NSW has banned cruise ship passengers from disembarking until new protocols are in place. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said no one would leave the ship without his personal approval. “Anyone who has to come off, comes off at my approval,” Mr Fuller said on Monday. “Three people needed medical attention and we facilitated the removal of those three people.” Two Ruby Princess passengers, a 77-year-old woman in NSW and a 75-year-old woman in Queensland, died after contracting COVID-19. Australian Border Force chief Michael Outram last week said the decision to disembark passengers without adequate checks was the responsibility of NSW Health and the federal agriculture department. Meanwhile, CMV said the Australian Border Force had ordered the Vasco da Gama to “leave Australian waters as soon as possible” after its passengers disembark. Its 552-strong crew will not be allowed to take flights home. Te ship and crew were to depart Fremantle for London at 7pm (WA time) on Monday. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Former PM Julia Gillard urges ‘prioritising’ mental health in the months ahead | The New Daily","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/julia-gillard-mental-health-beyond-blue\/","transcript":"Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard has urged people to reach out to mental health support services amid a $74 million funding package as families struggle to come to terms with isolation in the coming months. In an exclusive interview with Nine’s 60 Minutes program on Sunday night, Ms Gillard, now chair of the mental health awareness organisation Beyond Blue which has received a $10 million funding boost, says the organisation has been swamped with calls, with one in three related to COVID-19. Speaking from her home in self-isolation after returning from an overseas trip a week ago, she said: “We’ve actually seen levels already that are greater than what we experienced during the bushfires. It’s just telling you a fair bit about how anxious people are. “It is normal to feel anxious. People do have to think about how they’re going to meet that anxiety, and make sure that it doesn’t snowball,” she told 60 Minutes. “It’s the suddenness… that is what, I think, is snowballing people’s sense of insecurity. When so much has changed so quickly, it’s understandable that people are anxious about what’s going to happen next?” Over the past week, there has been a 30 per cent increase in calls and emails to Beyond Blue’s existing 24\/7 Support Service. “This pandemic is having profound impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of many Australians – we are seeing that with our current services,” Ms Gillard said. “People are looking for support to cope with the effects of widespread anxiety and uncertainty, self-isolation and loneliness, family stress, and business collapse, job loss and financial hardship caused by COVID-19. Ms Gillard said she knew millions were hurting, and her advice to small business owners and employers was not to blame themselves for having to close their businesses and stand down staff. “Don’t blame yourself, would be a really principle message,” she said. “People would feel that burden on their shoulders. But you know, at the end of the day, the individual business owner did not cause this pandemic.” She told 60 Minutes: “We’ll get through it together. We’ll get through it by working together to save lives,” she said. “This is temporary. There will be the other side. But right now, let’s just do what we’re being asked to do and keep people safe.” La Trobe University psychology lecturer Matthew Ruby says past research has linked isolation to a higher risk of depression, loneliness and anxiety. He says the risk of those outcomes are even higher for people with disability, the elderly, people experiencing domestic violence, and those who had recently lost their jobs. “It’s important to be kind to yourself by lowering the bar,” Dr Ruby tells AAP. “In the midst of a global pandemic, don’t expect that you’re going to maintain your normal level of productivity, stay quite as active as usual, or always make ideal food choices.” The online forum Coping during the Coronavirus outbreak discussion thread is already up and running and is attracting an average of 2000 views a day. Mental health professionals will continue to be available on the Beyond Blue Support Service via phone 24\/7 on 1300 22 4636 or via beyondblue.org.au\/get-support for online chat (3PM – 12AM AEST or email responses within 24 hours)."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Dozens of Australians left behind as evacuation flight departs Peru","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/australians-peru-evacuation-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Hundreds of Australians trapped in Peru have begun the journey home on a charter flight costing $5000 for a one-way ticket, while another 150 left behind fear they have been abandoned by the Morrison government. About 260 passengers were picked up in buses in Peru on Monday morning (Australian time). They were told to wear face masks or they would not be allowed to board the flight. But there was also confusion at the military airport, when some Australians on the waitlist were told to get ready to leave only to be refused permission to board the plane. Karolina Ristevski, who flew into Peru on March 15 for a wedding, has been desperately trying to return home since the country’s coronavirus lockdown began nearly a fortnight ago. But when she arrived at the military airport on Monday, she was told by Australian officials she could not board the plane. “I just want to go home. I don’t want to die here, basically,” she told The New Daily. “I was in tears. I couldn’t believe it. I was looking at someone from the embassy, saying ‘we are here and we will pay $5000 for the ticket’, and they are not taking you. I felt lost.” A day earlier, Ms Ristevski’s Airbnb had received a call urging her to head for the military airport in the hope there might be spare seats because about 20 New Zealanders had been removed from the flight. “There was a lot of miscommunication. We received a call. We weren’t home at this Airbnb,” she said. “Many things things had transpired and we were at the military airport as at 7am. Australia officially is the only country that has announced that they will not repatriate their citizens. “What we witnessed at the military airport from our government and the way other officials treated us was appalling. Peru was outstanding, they were gobsmacked at Australia leaving us stranded.” “Everybody was stunned. We were told the Australian ambassador Diana [Nelson] was going to come and talk to us. She didn’t. “It’s been a very long day. The Australian buses waiting for 2.5 hours while all other country buses drove straight in.” On March 17, Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned all Australians overseas they must return home as quickly as possible as borders closed around the world. While the US, Britain and Israel have organised free or low-cost repatriation flights for stranded travellers, Australia has refused to do so and simply assisted a private company called Chimu to secure clearances to leave from military airports. Confusion about the Chimu flights and concerns they might be a scam left many Australians unsure whether to book seats. By the time Ms Nelson used Twitter to officially urge Australians to book on the flights, they were sold out, leaving them stranded. Many stranded Australians have also pinned their hopes on Qantas tickets that have been cancelled, or hopes the airports would reopen. This is despite repeated official warnings that flights have been suspended and the international airport is closed. Some Australians also did not book on the Chimu flights because they believed the Peruvian government was likely to lift border closures on March 31. There have also been repeated warnings that this is highly unlikely and the lockdown could go on for months. Dozens of Australians in rural Peru have no way of getting to the airport for the flights without a police escort organised by diplomats because roads are closed, with police checkpoints. To date, those clearances have not been secured by Australian officials in Peru. But their plight could soon be shared by thousands of Australians around the world – including in India, Thailand, and Bali – as nations look to close borders and social unrest rises around the world. Sympathy for those stranded in Peru, particularly those who had the chance to book and board on Monday flights but declined to leave in hopes of a cheaper option, also appears to be hardening in Canberra. The Morrison government has repeatedly stated it will not offer free repatriation flights. It is working with Qantas and Virgin to organise further flights and clearances to leave the military airport as exemptions for some flights allow foreign nationals to return home. Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong said many Australians trapped overseas had tried to leave but had been unable to through no fault of their own. “The Peruvian flight … the advice we have from people on the ground is that a similar fight for residents of the United Kingdom costs about £250 ($A500); Australians are looking to stump up $5000,” she said. “These are very large amounts of money for people who are finding it very difficult to get back and we would say to the government: cost shouldn’t be a barrier to travel in these circumstances. I mean, this is an unprecedented set of circumstances.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"ABC's Norman Swan tested for coronavirus","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/norman-swan-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The ABC’s medical expert Norman Swan was tested for coronavirus on Monday morning, after developing symptoms.

Dr Swan was tested by his GP. “OK, so now I have to admit I’m at home because I do have symptoms and after I finish this I’m going to get tested,” he told ABC Radio on Monday. The results will take a day or so to come back. Dr Swan is the presenter of the Health Report on Radio National and is a multi-award-winning producer and broadcaster. His career has been highlighted by his desire to keep the Australian public informed of health developments as they happen. The executive producer of the ABC’s 7.30 program, Justin Stevens, confirmed Dr Swan would “still be be doing his regular segment tonight and recording it from home”. Dr Swan is also a presenter on the ABC podcast Coronacast, which helps answer questions about COVID-19. He has spoken about testing before on Coronacast. He said it was important to find out who had been in contact with someone who has COVID-19 over the previous 24-48 hours. “If you don’t do testing, you’ll end up with a situation which you’ve got in the United States and Italy,” he said. According to Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, Australia’s testing of the virus is “one of, if not, the highest testing rate in the world”.

The supermarket is rolling out an $80 box of basic groceries that will be delivered to isolated people by Australia Post and other distribution channels. The box includes meals, snacks and a few essential items, and can’t be customised. It can be ordered online from this week in the ACT, NSW and Victoria. Orders should arrive in two-to-five working days and phone support will be available for people who are not comfortable ordering online. Other states will be added in coming weeks. Woolworths said last week it would cut hours at more than 40 of its supermarkets across Australia to allow them to focus on orders for vulnerable customers. The government has urged Australians over the age of 70 to stay at home for their own protection as the nation’s coronavirus tally reaches more than 4000 cases, with 17 deaths. The $80 price includes contactless doorstep delivery by Australia Post and Woolworths has said it won’t make a profit from the service. Woolworths said people who could shop for families or friends who were isolated should do so, to limit demand on the online service. “There will be some in our community who don’t have that option, and we need your help to put the most vulnerable first,” Woolworths Group CEO Brad Banducci said on Monday.

Average levels of noxious nitrogen dioxide fell in cities such as Brussels, Paris, Madrid, Milan and Frankfurt from March 5-25 (compared with the same period in 2019), according to Sentinel-5 satellite images released on Monday. That coincides with lockdowns in many European countries that have curbed road transport – the largest source of nitrogen oxides – and slowed output at gas-emitting factories. The new images, released by the European Space Agency and analysed by the non-profit European Public Health Alliance, show the changing density of nitrogen dioxide, which can cause respiratory problems and cancer, like heat maps. Daily weather events can influence atmospheric pollution so the satellite pictures took a 20-day average and excluded readings where cloud cover reduced the quality of the data. Data from the European Environment Agency showed a similar trend from March 16-22. In Madrid, average nitrogen dioxide levels decreased by 56 per cent week-on-week after the Spanish government banned non-essential travel on March 14. However, the EPHA said people living in polluted cities might be more at risk from COVID-19 because prolonged exposure to bad air can weaken immune systems. “That connection is very likely,” EPHA clean air policy manager Zoltan Massay-Kosubek said. “But because the disease is new, it still has to be demonstrated.” Air pollution can cause or exacerbate lung cancer, pulmonary disease and strokes. It’s not the first sign of reduced pollution amid coronavirus lockdowns. Early in March, residents of Venice said the abrupt drop in tourist numbers because of Italy’s shutdown meant the city’s famous canals were cleaner than they had been for years. China also recorded a drop in nitrogen dioxide pollution in cities in February, when the government imposed draconian lockdown measures to contain the raging coronavirus epidemic. “This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,” Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA, said. In some regions of Poland, however, nitrogen dioxide levels remained relatively high during the period despite its lockdown, perhaps due to the prevalence of coal-based heating. Countries that went into lockdown later – such as Britain, which did so on March 23 – are likely to enjoy a similar pollution reprieve in coming weeks, EPHA said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"PM announces $130 billion jobs funding as states move to tougher restrictions | The New Daily","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-stage-three-restrictions-victoria-nsw\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced the federal government’s third and biggest round of stimulus packages, with a $130 billion economic package over the next six months to support jobs and livelihoods of six million Australians who will need a “lifeline”. On Monday afternoon, Mr Morrison announced a $1500 a fortnight “job keeper” payment for businesses to keep workers – both full and part-time workers – in jobs while the “economy is idle”. “We want to keep the engine of our economy running through this crisis,” Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra. The latest round of federal government stimulus funding comes as two elderly women in their 80s are the latest Australian victims of the coronavirus pandemic, bringing the nation’s death toll to 18. A woman died in Burnie, in Tasmania’s northwest over the weekend and another woman died in hospital in Canberra after catching the virus overseas. There are now 4163 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia. In all, there have been eight deaths in NSW, four in Victoria, two in WA, two in Queensland, one in Tasmania and one in the ACT. NSW remains the worst hit with 1918 after 127 new cases were confirmed on the weekend while Victoria recorded 56 new cases, taking the state’s total to 821. The ACT’s chief minister Andrew Barr said the latest deaths were a reminder to observe the new rules on social distancing announced by the National Cabinet on Sunday night. “It is terribly sad news today, of our first death recorded in the ACT, and I hope that serves as a tragic reminder of just how serious this situation is. The latest deaths come as three states moved overnight to enforce tighter restrictions on social distancing. Victoria, NSW, Tasmania and Queensland moved to introduce tighter restrictions on movement as of midnight on Monday after the national cabinet, meaning heavy on-the-spot fines for people who gather in groups of more than two. “We’re not doing it for any other reason than this is life and death,” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in announcing the stage three restrictions on Monday morning. “Unless you want to be burying an elderly relative or your best mate, or your parents, if they’re younger, do the right thing. It is very, very simple. Stay at home!” “My message to every Victorian is that there are only four reasons to leave your home: Food and supplies, medical care, exercise and work or education. “We will not be breaking up household family dinners – but barbecues with the neighbours cannot happen any more. Playgrounds, skate parks and outdoor gyms will also close.” Mr Andrews said if people breach these directions, they faced on-the-spot fines of $1652 for individuals and $9913 for businesses. Larger fines could also be issued through the courts. “This is critically important. We cannot have people out socialising and gathering as if this wasn’t happening. We have to protect the health system and we have got to save lives. We have to protect jobs.” Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on Monday afternoon the state would also restrict gatherings and strengthen border enforcement as another 23 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed overnight, taking the total number across the state to 689. “These measures are going to be put in place for a month. So let’s see how they go and let’s see if we can flatten that curve,” she said. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says she appreciates the measures are “frustrating” but people need to follow them for the good of the community. “Gatherings outside or inside should not be more than two people unless it is your immediate family – that is something we will enforce,” she told reporters on Monday. “We want everybody to practise that from today. Enforcement starts from midnight.” Ms Berejiklian said people in their 20s and 30s were the “worst offenders” when it comes to flouting coronavirus rules. “I do use that age group, in particular, because we are seeing an increase in the statistics in that age group,” she said. “Also, the worst offenders in terms of not sticking to the rules are those people in those age groups. You can’t socialise as you used to.” “Whilst it is pleasing we have seen a stabilisation in case numbers, it is important to know that they can vary and jump around day to day based on testing numbers,” NSW’s chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant told reporters on Monday. The Australian Medical Association says infected patients are putting the lives of doctors, healthcare workers and patients at risk by seeking treatment for other ailments while “hiding” their coronavirus symptoms. “There have been some disturbing incidents of people hiding their symptoms in order to get treatment for other health issues,” AMA (NSW) president Dr Kean-Seng Lim said on Monday. Dr Lim said health workers had to limit scarce supplies of protective equipment to treat symptomatic cases. “We know doctors in other countries have already died as a result of coronavirus. Fatalities and high numbers of healthcare worker infections would further strain the health system’s ability to respond to this pandemic,” Dr Lim warned. Recent NSW coronavirus cases include two teachers and a student from Normanhurst West Public School, as well as a staff member from the Long Bay prison hospital. The number of confirmed Australian cases from the Ruby Princess cruise ship had jumped to 215 by Sunday night. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'No viruses here': Belarus fills soccer void amid COVID-19 halt","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/30\/belarus-soccer-coronavirus\/","transcript":"With professional soccer at a virtual standstill worldwide, fans in need of a fix are getting it from an unlikely source – the Belarusian Premier League, which is carrying on with matches despite the coronavirus outbreak. The competition is one of Europe’s least glamorous, and its teams rarely reach the group stage of UEFA’s elite Champions League. But it is drawing foreign fans’ attention and a string of new broadcast deals in its new season, which began early in March. It is one of the few leagues still playing around the world, and the only one in Europe. The league has said it has no intention of postponing matches or cancelling the season. On Saturday, the league played six top-flight games, including a derby between FC Minsk and Dinamo Minsk watched by a capacity 3000 crowd in the Belarussian capital. “It so happened that this derby was practically the only official football match on Earth,” read Dinamo’s match report after its 3-2 defeat. Belarus, a former Soviet nation, has so far reported 94 coronavirus cases, and no deaths. It has taken few measures to curb the outbreak. President Alexander Lukashenko, who has held power in the country of 9.5 million people since 1994, has downplayed the need for social distancing and bragged that he continues to play ice hockey and embrace fellow players. “It’s better to die standing than to live on your knees,” he told local television on Saturday after a hockey game. “There are no viruses here [at the rink] … I don’t see them.” The decision to carry on and allow fans into stadiums has helped the Belarus Football Federation secure broadcasting deals with sports networks in 10 countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Israel and India, where fans have been left with nothing to watch. Most of the league’s teams are unknown to the majority of soccer fans, except perhaps BATE Borisov and Dinamo Minsk. Dinamo Minsk’s popularity has spiked on social media as interest has grown in the local league. Unfortunately for the Belarus players, when top European soccer resumes interest in them is likely to disappear. “They will not only watch English or Italian leagues, but also the Belarusian one from time to time,” Yuri, a Dinamo Minsk supporter, said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Harry, Meghan defend 'privately funded security' after Trump's demands","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/royal\/2020\/03\/30\/trump-harry-meghan-security\/","transcript":"Britain’s Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle say they have made “privately funded security arrangements” following their move to the US. The Sussexes are reportedly settled in Los Angeles, after leaving the Canadian island they have called home since before Christmas 2019. But the cost of their private security – estimated to run to millions of dollars a year – remains contentious. US President Donald Trump took issue with it over the weekend, declaring: “They must pay!” The prince and his wife stunned the royal family in early January with their announcement they would step down from their roles as senior royals. That will happen on March 31. Canada had been picking up part of the tab but said it would cease doing so when Harry and Meghan stood down as working royals. Reuters reported in February that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been assisting London’s Metropolitan Police with security for Harry and Meghan “intermittently” since November, when the couple began a six-week vacation in Canada. A spokeswoman for the couple said later: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no plans to ask the US government for security resources. Privately funded security arrangements have been made.” I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen & the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2020 The Sussexes are thought to have moved to the US, with their infant son Archie, after returning from their last royal engagements in Britain in early March. Britain’s Sun newspaper reported last week the couple took a private flight to Los Angeles but did not say when. There is no indication that either Harry or the British government had asked the US government to cover security costs. Earlier in March, the US and Canada agreed to close their border to non-essential travel at land crossings to ease the strain on health systems caused by the coronavirus oubreak. The duchess was raised in the Los Angeles area and her mother, Doria, still lives there. Meghan, who married Prince Harry in 2018, criticised Mr Trump during his 2016 election campaign as misogynistic and divisive. Last year, Mr Trump, on being told of the criticism, said: “I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.” But he also wished her well in her new life as a British royal.

In a sign of how bad things have become, that was a number to celebrate. Italy’s death toll on Sunday represented the second successive fall in the daily rate, however, its total number of fatalities remains the highest of any country in the world, at 10,779. On Friday, the country recorded 919 deaths, making it the largest number of fatalities recorded by Italy in a single day since the outbreak. This was followed by 889 deaths on Saturday. The toll dropped to 756 by the following day. Italy’s Civil Protection Agency also noted that the rate of new infections had slowed, with an additional 5217 having caught the virus on Sunday – a smaller increase than Saturday’s 5994 new recorded cases. Sunday’s figures showed an additional 646 people had recovered from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing Italy’s total to 13,030. But with close to 98,000 infections, Italy is by far battling one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks worldwide. As Britain struggles to get ahead of the coronavirus, with more than 19,700 infections and 1228 death recorded, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said lockdown measures could be in place for six months. Her warning came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote to 30 million households in Britain urging them to stick to strict rules to prevent the publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) from being overwhelmed by a surge in cases. “We know things will get worse before they get better,” Mr Johnson said. Britain has now placed a manufacturing order usually only seen in wartime as the nation rushes to bolster its defence against the virus. Ford, Airbus and Rolls-Royce have been asked to make thousands of ventilators for use in the fight against the worsening pandemic – similar to how the UK repurposed industries in the World War II effort. “This is an unprecedented step in peacetime,” said housing minister Robert Jenrick, adding that all parts of the country were now on an “emergency footing” as strategic co-ordination centres were established. The number of tests being carried out has hit 10,000 a day, senior minister Michael Gove said. Meanwhile, in the US, the virus has infected more than 135,000 people, making it the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections. The outbreak has become an uncontrollable burden, so much so that the government’s top infectious-disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the US will likely end up with millions of coronavirus cases. Speaking to CNN, Dr Fauci also said the death toll in the US could top 100,000 but he was hesitant to make projections. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus rules: Three is a crowd, playground and boot camp banned","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-lockdown-rules-gatherings\/","transcript":"New rules will limit outdoor gatherings to just two people to stop the spread of COVID-19 while over 70s will be urged to remain inside “for their own protection” under the National Cabinet’s latest measures to combat the virus. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the changes on Sunday night, confirming playgrounds, skate parks and outdoor gyms should be regarded as “closed for business” from midnight on Monday. Mr Morrison stressed that parents can still take their kids outdoors for exercise but should not meet in groups with other families for catch-ups. “The strong advice is don’t gather together in groups. That’s the simple way of putting it. Just don’t do it. It’s not helpful,” he said. “It actually creates the risk. And when you’re going out for shopping, you should be going for just stuff you need and do it and get home. It’s not a time for browsing. “You must stay at home except for the following reasons: (A), shopping for what you need, food and other essential supplies that enable you to remain at home and to do that shopping as infrequently as possible; (B), for medical care or compassionate needs; (C), to exercise in compliance with the public gathering rules that I’ve already outlined; and (D), for work and education if you cannot work or learn remotely,” he said. Retailers including supermarkets, pharmacies, Kmart, Target and Bunnings will remain open for “essentials”. State and territory governments will, however, consider further restrictions in each jurisdiction to limit shopping to essential services. Asked why you could visit shopping centres with potentially hundreds of people but only hold a gathering of no more than two people outside, Mr Morrison gave the example of his wife, Jenny, going to buy a jigsaw puzzle. “What we’ve said today is you should be only going out to shop for things that you actually need and you should be doing it on an irregular basis,” he said. “I’ll give you an example. Our kids are at home now, as are most kids, and Jenny went out yesterday and bought them a whole bunch of jigsaw puzzles. I can assure you over the next few months, we’re going to consider those jigsaw puzzles absolutely essential. “It’s important that parents and families and households can get the things that they need to completely change the way they’re going to live for the next six months at least. And so what we’ve done is sought to be practical about these issues. “I mean, people are buying sporting equipment at the moment, gym mats and things like that so they can exercise at home. These are things they’re going to need.” The Prime Minister said the limits on how many people could attend weddings (5 people) and funerals (10 people) were unchanged. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy also revealed there were early signs that Australia was not going down the path of Italy or Spain and that the measures put in place were having an impact. The 3987 confirmed cases are “much less than some people might have predicted some time ago without mitigation” he said. “We are not Italy, we are not the United States, we are not Spain,” Dr Murphy said. “We have one of the highest rates of testing per head of population in the world and one of the lowest positive test rates so we think, unlike countries unfortunately like Italy, Iran and even the US, that when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in the community that were undetected.” The Prime Minister said the advice for over 70s to stay indoors was a guide and not an edict. “There is strong advice – this is not a compulsion, this is strong advice – that people aged 70 and over should stay at home and self isolate for their own protection to the maximum extent practicable,” he said. “This does not mean that they cannot go outside. They can go outside and be accompanied by a support person for the purposes of getting some fresh air, some recreation. But they should limit contact with others as much as possible. These arrangements should also apply to those with chronic illness over 60 and Indigenous persons over the age of 50.” National Cabinet also agreed that states and territories will be moving to put a moratorium on evictions of small businesses as a result of financial distress. “And so there will be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months under those rental arrangements,” he said. “We’re asking businesses to adapt to what is not a usual set of circumstances. They must be sustainable because they will run for, we believe, at least six months and we want to be able to get everybody through. So we are seeking their support. We will have more to say about commercial tenancies in the days ahead.” Indoor and Outdoor Public gatherings National Cabinet agreed to limit both indoor and outdoor gatherings to two persons only. Exceptions to this limit include: Individual states and territories may choose to mandate and\/or enforce this requirement. National Cabinet’s strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for: Shopping for what you need – food and necessary supplies; medical or health care needs, including compassionate requirements; exercise in compliance with the public gathering requirements; work and study if you can’t work or learn remotely. National Cabinet agreed that playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms in public places will be closed. Bootcamps will be reduced to two people, including the trainer. These measures will be in place from midnight Monday. National Cabinet discussed further restrictions on activities and venues. States and territories agreed they would implement further measures specific to their own region, including closing categories of venues, where medical advice supported this action. These measures would be risk-based and targeted at non-essential activities. Australians will still be able to access the goods and services needed to safely and sustainably live their lives. All Australians respect and value the contribution that older Australians make to our community. Coronavirus has more serious impacts on older Australians, those over 70 years of age and Australians with existing health conditions or comorbidities. National Cabinet’s strong advice is for self-isolation at home to the maximum extent practicable for Australians: National Cabinet agreed to a moratorium on evictions over the next six months for commercial and residential tenancies in financial distress who are unable to meet their commitments due to the impact of coronavirus. Commercial tenants, landlords and financial institutions are encouraged to sit down together to find a way through to ensure that businesses can survive and be there on the other side. As part of this, National Cabinet agreed to a common set of principles, endorsed by Treasurers, to underpin and govern intervention to aid commercial tenancies as follows: National Cabinet will meet again on Monday 30th March 2020."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Lionair coronavirus medevac plane crashes in Philippines","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-medevac-philippines-plane-crash\/","transcript":"A Japan-bound plane carrying medical personnel and equipment helping to fight the coronavirus pandemic has burst into flames during take-off in the capital of the Philippines, killing all eight on board. The Lionair aircraft destined for Haneda, Japan, exploded in a ball of flames as it took off from Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila about 8pm local time, the airport said. Video footage showed a huge plume of smoke rising into the night sky as fire crews doused the fuselage with foam. The doomed Lionair Flight RPC 5880 was carrying three medical personnel, three flight crew, a patient and a companion, Richard Gordon, a senator and head of the Philippine Red Cross said. In a Twitter post, he described the fire that erupted as “enormous”. “Unfortunately, no passenger survived the accident,” the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) said in a statement. Among the passengers were six Filipinos, one American and one Canadian, a flight manifest later revealed. The runway has been closed and an investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Authority of the Philippines was now underway, MIAA said. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine – the agency leading the fight against the coronavirus in the Philippines – frequently uses Lionair, which is a Philippine charter flight company, to transport supplies to the medical workers on the front line, the government said. Lionair is a separate carrier rom Indonesia’s Lion Air that left 189 people dead after its Boeing 737 Max plane crashed in October 2018. Donald Mendoza, deputy director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, said Lionair would be grounded after the crash. “It’s quite alarming, but we’re looking into the records of this unfortunate event that happened to Lionair. Definitely, we’ll have a thorough investigation,” Mr Mendoza said.

But just like every other challenging time in history, this period will pass and we will bounce back again. In the meantime, it is important to remember there are some things you can do to help keep your brain balanced while staying at home. We are all in this together so if you are feeling anxious, it’s likely your friends and family are feeling the same way. Take advantage of technology and reach out to them. Organise a group video chat, play a game online, send your friends a funny meme or FaceTime your parents. Although it’s not the same as face-to-face contact, there are countless ways we can brighten up each other’s day. It’s the 21st century – make the most of it. Set an alarm. Make your bed. Exercise. Have a shower. Eat breakfast. Whatever you can do to keep up a semblance of a normal daily routine will help you get through your temporary life under lockdown. Keep a to-do list and set yourself tasks, such as clearing out old food items from the fridge or cleaning your bedroom. This way, you’ll feel like you’re achieving something every day – even if it’s small. The internet can be our best friend or our worst enemy. Spending time on social media can be a good way to feel connected, but it can also bring us down. Remember there are a lot of other ways to be productive online – it doesn’t have to be a mindless scroll of news feeds. There is a wealth of information online and an endless supply of DIY tutorials and support groups. Use it to your advantage. Google how to fix that broken zipper on your sleeping bag or find a YouTube tutorial that will teach you how to play your favourite TV show’s theme song on guitar. Read a book, prepare a healthy meal, write a diary or try yoga. It’s OK to say ‘no’ to friends or family if you don’t have the mental energy to talk to them. Try to find something you can do each day that makes you feel good. Go for a run or a walk outside when you can. Not only will it help boost endorphins and make it easier to feel positive, you’ll also be giving your body the best chance of fighting off illness. The fewer people in hospital, the better. The best thing you can do to help our health workers during the coronavirus crisis is to stay healthy."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"On This Day: Revered rock and blues guitarist Eric Clapton was born","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/30\/on-this-day-eric-clapton\/","transcript":"On this day in 1945, one of the world’s most influential guitarists was born. Eric Clapton turns 75 today. Known for co-writing popular songs Tears in Heaven, Cocaine and Layla, the English rock and blues guitarist, singer and songwriter is the only musician to be inducted Into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame three times – once as a solo artist and separately as a member of The Yardbirds and of Cream. More than 50 years into his career, enormous crowds still flock to concerts around the world to hear Clapton’s dazzling guitar solos. But his illustrious career has also been marred with great sadness and loss. On the day of his birth in Surrey, in the final year of World War II, no one could have predicted Clapton would live a life of stardom. He was the son of 16-year-old Patricia Clapton and a 24-year-old Canadian soldier stationed in England. His father was shipped off to war before Clapton’s birth and returned to his wife in Canada – never meeting his son. Abandoned and left to fend for herself as a single teenage mother, it was incredibly difficult for Patricia to raise Clapton on her own so her parents stepped up as surrogate parents. Clapton grew up thinking his mother was his sister, and that his grandparents were his parents, until the truth was revealed to him at nine years old. He became moody and distant, stopped putting in effort at school and failed his final exams. Two years later, he entered an art school. Many of his most popular songs have a tragic meaning behind them. The hit song Layla was inspired by the classic poet of Persian literature, Nizami Ganjavi’s The Story of Layla and Majnun, a book that moved Clapton deeply about a young man who fell in love with an unavailable woman and went crazy because he could not marry her. The 1991 song Tears in Heaven was written as a memorial to Clapton’s four-year-old son Conor who fell 50 storeys to his death from a New York City apartment building."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus at home: How are you and your household passing the time?","date":"03-30-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-lockdown-photographs\/","transcript":"How are you keeping yourself sane amid the #StayAtHome movement?

Shyam and Aruna Sardana travelled to Delhi on February 12 for a wedding but have been unable to return home to Sydney. Like thousands of Australian tourists and expatriates, the pair has been stuck in lockdown since Tuesday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly imposed strict rules and cancelled all flights in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. Life under lockdown has been brutal for many locals in India, with residents facing the threat of police beatings and villagers forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to return home. The poor are starving with nowhere to go, and street crime is reportedly increasing as millions of workers who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus resort to theft to survive. In recent days Mrs Sardana, 60, was attacked by a pair of masked men on a motorbike who tried to snatch her necklace as she walked to a dentist appointment in Delhi. “My wife is very stressed and very anxious because we are trapped here without any support and so far from our children,” Mr Sardana said. “We want the Australian government to make an effort to help us get back home.” The Sardanas, Australian permanent residents, are just two of hundreds of Australians desperate to return home. “We have tickets booked for a flight on the second of April and most likely many other Australians have done the same,” Mr Sardana told The New Daily. “We want the government to negotiate with the Indian government and let that flight leave for Australia.” The federal government has already announced repatriation assistance for Australians stuck in other parts of the world. That included a rescue flight to evacuate hundreds of Australians and New Zealanders trapped in Peru. In India, there’s been no such luck for Australians. For Sardanas it could be the difference between life and death. Mrs Sardana has abnormally high blood pressure, while Mr Sardana suffers from a serious heart condition and rheumatoid arthritis. He has just two weeks’ left of medication. “We both are high-risk vulnerable people and we will most likely die if we catch COVID-19,” Mr Sardana told The New Daily. “Public hospitals in Delhi are not equipped to handle a pandemic like COVID-19. The couple is too scared to leave their house for fear of contracting the coronavirus and of Indian police, who have been beating people who breach curfew with bamboo bats. One of their sons, who lives in Sydney and wishes to remain anonymous to protect his job, told The New Daily he has been lobbying the federal government for help but hasn’t received any answers. “My biggest fear is getting a call in the middle of the night from someone saying ‘Your parents have COVID-19’ and I won’t be able to get there,” he said. “If something happens to my parents, we’ll lose our family members, but in my eyes the Australian government will lose its credibility. “At a time when families need to stick together and support each other, they’re putting down dividing lines. “If they don’t do anything, they will have blood on their hands if something goes wrong.” India’s population of 1.3 billion people was given less than four hours’ notice that lockdown loomed. Residents and tourists have since been forced to stay indoors under rules to be in place for at least three weeks. It’s the world’s largest lockdown. “There will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes … forget what going out means,” Mr Modi told the nation last week. On Monday morning (Australian time), the PM apologised for the harsh measures while noting their impact on the poor. “I know some of you will be angry with me,” he said on radio during his scheduled monthly address. “But these tough measures were needed to win this battle.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Queensland Police shoot dead man after 12-hour siege","date":"03-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/29\/queensland-police-shoot-dead-man-siege\/","transcript":"A man has been shot dead by Queensland Police after a 12-hour siege near Palm Cove on Sunday afternoon. Chief Superintendent Brian Huxley said the man was shot in waist-deep water at Tomatis Creek, off the Captain Cook Highway north of Cairns, after he allegedly raised a gun towards police. Superintendent Huxley said the man was critically injured about 3.15pm when police returned fire and was pronounced dead at the scene. Earlier, police had declared an emergency in an area between Holloways Beach and Yorkeys Knob after being called to a break-in at a telecommunications building off the Captain Cook Highway about 4.30am. Specialist police and a helicopter then tracked a man armed with a gun, who it was alleged deliberately collided with a police vehicle attending the incident. A police statement said officers immediately requested further assistance and multiple crews responded. A short time later at Smithfield the man allegedly deliberately veered towards a 26-year-old constable on the side of the road. The officer suffered a suspected broken wrist and other non-life-threatening injuries. Police said the man’s vehicle stopped on the Captain Cook Highway at Yorkeys Knob, where he allegedly set it on fire. When police approached, the man allegedly produced a firearm and discharged a shot at officers before running from his vehicle. Police then established a cordon around an area to the west of the Captain Cook Highway to contain the man. ABC reports that Superintendent Huxley said a special emergency response team in a boat reached the man. “As a result of attempts to apprehend him, they have been threatened and they have returned fire,” Superintendent Huxley said. The man was critically injured and pronounced dead at the scene. “Every attempt to try and save this man’s life has failed,” Superintendent Huxley said. “This is a tragic set of circumstances.” The matter is under investigation by Ethical Standards Command on behalf of the State Coroner, subject to oversight by the Crime and Corruption Commission. -with ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Public gatherings limited to two people, deal for rental evictions moratorium","date":"03-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/29\/coronavirus-public-gatherings-rental-evictions-moratorium\/","transcript":"Federal and state governments have moved to further to further restrict public gatherings by reducing groups from 10 people to two. And older Australians have been told to stay home for their own safety unless they need to shop for food and other essential items, medical care, compassionate needs, exercise and work or education. In a statement following a meeting of the national coronavirus cabinet on Sunday night, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said some states and territories were considering whether to make the two-person limit legally enforceable. “Don’t gather together in groups,” Mr Morrison said. “That’s the simple way of doing it. Just don’t do it. It is not helpful.” Under more stringent measures introduced as part of the government’s hibernation approach, skate parks and public playgrounds will be closed. But arrangements for funerals (10) and weddings (five) will remain, with discretion exercised on compassionate grounds. Outdoor gyms, or boot camps, will be restricted to training on a one-on-one basis. The new limit will not apply to households, education or employment. In additional changes for older Australians, Mr Morrison said the advice for people aged 70 or over was that they should stay at home for safety, as should people over 60 with chronic illness, and indigenous people over the age of 50. “This is for their own protection to limit their interaction with others in the community,” Mr Morrison said. “This does not mean they cannot go outside. They can go outside and be accompanied by a support person for the purposes of getting fresh air and recreation, but should limit contact with others as much as possible.” In another major announcement, the PM said private renters will be offered a moratorium on evictions as part of a series of principles that had been agreed at Sunday night’s meeting. “The most significant of those is that states and territories will be moving to put a moratorium on evictions of persons as a result of financial distress … for the next six months,” he said. Further work is being done on commercial tenancies, but Mr Morrison urged landlords to immediately work with tenants and banks on solutions. “We need you to sit down, talk to each other and work this out,” Mr Morrison said. “There is no rule book for this. “We are in uncharted territory, but the goal should be shared and that is a business can reopen on the other side, not weighed down by excessive debts because of rental arrears, a landlord has a tenant so that they can continue into the future to be able to support the investments that they have made, and banks have clients.” Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy also spoke of “some early hopeful signs” of flattening the curve to contain the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. The rate of increase of coronavirus infections has been falling, from 30 per cent this time last week to about 9 per cent on Sunday. The 3987 confirmed cases are “much less than some people might have predicted some time ago without mitigation”, Professor Murphy said. But more needed to be done."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Bigger than anything so far’: PM previews coronavirus subsidies to keep job numbers up | The New Daily PM previews coronavirus subsidies to keep job numbers up","date":"03-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/29\/subsidies-coming-to-foil-corona-jobless-rise\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison has urged employers to hold off on sacking workers over COVID-19 shutdowns, confirming a wage subsidy worth more than the dole is being worked on and could be up and running within weeks. The Prime Minister has assured distressed businesses that the federal cabinet is working on a plan to help businesses retain staff by paying workers reduced salaries through the existing payroll and welfare system. The latest announcement comes as economists predict a national unemployment rate soaring to as high as 17 per cent. The purpose of the scheme is designed to ensure businesses forced into “hibernation” during the crisis are ready to restart when the crisis is over. “The last package we announce with the Treasurer was about broadening and strengthening the safety net for those who are going to immediately impacted by the shock of losing their jobs,” Mr Morrison said. “The next stage, which will be given bigger than anything you have so far seen, will go broader than that and ensure that we are working together with companies to keep people connected to companies. “This is part of the hibernation strategy of ensuring we keep people connected with their business and with their jobs so that, on the other side of this, Australia can bounce back stronger.” The wage subsidy is likely to be capped at average earnings and will be less than the 80 per cent proposed in Britain. The Morrison government also confirmed it is considering relaxing welfare rules that cut off the unemployed from the dole if their partner earns $48,000 a year. Although Britain is guaranteeing a wage subsidy worth 80 per cent of workers wages, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said Australia’s plan would not mirror the UK model. “Our first priority was to provide a significant income boost to those Australians who have lost their job and we are providing income support, double the rate compared to what was in place before,” Mr Cormann said. “We are working to significantly expand it as part of a third wave of reforms as we flagged. “But we are going to do it in an Australian way. We’re going to do it in a way that actually is going to be able to be delivered, using our existing systems and our existing architecture.” Earlier, the Prime Minister announced a $1 billion package of measures to allow patients to see GPs online in telehealth consultations and to seek counselling as many Australians grapple with anxiety and depression. A new WhatsApp message service will also deliver official government updates. “If you simply go into WhatsApp and type in “aus.gov.au\/whatsapp” you will get access to a new messaging service which enables us to talk to more and more messaging services, which enables us to talk to Australians in terms of basic health advice, updates on the measures that are being put in place by state and federal governments, and that will assist you to get accurate and timely information,” Mr Morrison said. “I can also say that on the Apple app store, the coronavirus app, you can now download.

Organising committee President Yoshiro Mori suggested there would be no major change from 2020. “The games are meant to be in summer, so we should be thinking of a time between June and September,” Japanese news agency Kyodo reported Mori as saying on Saturday. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, after the postponement was announced in Switzerland on Tuesday, left open the possibility of spring dates, but this option now seems unlikely to be adopted. The postponed games were to have opened on July 24 and closed on August 9. Mori suggested some decisions could be made as early as this week, when the organising committee’s executive board meets. Any final decision will be made between local organisers (LOC) and the IOC, and hundreds of sponsors, sports federations and broadcasters. Athletes have been left in limbo by the postponement with many forced to stop training because of the spreading coronavirus virus. Even those who can train have no idea about how to schedule training to reach peak fitness at the right time. Mori and organising committee CEO Toshiro Muto have both said the added cost of rescheduling will be “enormous.” Early estimates put those costs at between $2-3 billion ($A3.2-4.9b) with the several levels of Japanese governments likely to foot most of the bills. Tokyo organisers say they are spending $12.6b ($A20.4b) to stage the games. However, a government audit report said it will cost at least twice that much with all but $5.6b ($A9.1b) being public money. “The extra cost that will arise from this postponement is inevitable,” Mori wrote in a letter addressed to the 33 international federations of sports that make up the Tokyo Games programme. Deciding who will bear these costs and how it will be done will be a major challenge.” The Switzerland-based IOC has contributed $1.3b ($A2.1b) to organise the Games in Japan, according to LOC documents. It has a reserve fund of about $2b for such emergencies and also has insurance coverage.

A five-year-old boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran. Iranian media has reported nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 made ill by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country’s Health Ministry says the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with close to 3000 people sick. The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country. Iran, home to 80 million people, has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic. “Other countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here,” said Dr. Hossein Hassanian, an adviser to Iran’s Health Ministry. “We have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus.” In messages forwarded again and again on Iranian social media, accounts falsely suggested a British school teacher and others cured themselves of the coronavirus with whiskey and honey. Mixed with messages about the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, some wrongly believed drinking high-proof alcohol would kill the virus in their bodies. The Islamic republic has reported over 29,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country in the Middle East. International experts also fear Iran may be under-reporting its cases.

Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said New Zealanders could no longer be in any doubt as to the seriousness of the pandemic, “particularly for older people, and those with underlying pre existing health conditions”. As hospital staff were not equipped with the specific personal protective equipment to deal with a COVID-19 case, 21 hospital workers have been placed into self-isolation. Of the 514 New Zealand cases of the disease, nine are receiving hospital care and just one other is in intensive care requiring the use of a ventilator. Some 56 Kiwis have recovered. The 63 fresh cases in the past 24 hours is a drop from the 83 announced on Saturday and 85 announced on Friday. Ms Ardern said that didn’t mean New Zealand was out of the woods. “We’ve had discussion over what it is our case numbers might be telling us at present. None of us are willing to draw any conclusions at this early stage,” she said. “We must remember that there is a considerable lag time in any of our results. “So we all need to be vigilant. No one can be complacent.” Dr Bloomfield said the opportunity for Kiwis to be lifesavers was right in front of them. He quoted Wellington Hospital Intensive Care Specialist Dr Paul Young who said, “If New Zealand pulls together as a community and stays at home, you will save more lives than I will in my entire career”. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus claims two more lives, lifting national toll to 16 | The New Daily Coronavirus claims two more lives, lifting national toll to 16","date":"03-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/29\/coronavirus-australia-toll-rise-to-16\/","transcript":"The deaths of a woman in Queensland and a man in Victoria take the national coronavirus death toll to 16, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison announces a $1.1 billion package targeting telehealth services, mental health support and domestic violence initiatives. The 75-year-old woman, who had been a passenger on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship, died in Queensland, and a man in his 80s died in a Melbourne hospital. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the rate of new coronavirus cases in Australia has fallen from 25-30 per cent last week to 13-15 per cent. “They are still strong rates of increase, no doubt about that,” Mr Morrison said. “But because we take the measures we have been taking and put them in place and we have the cooperation from the Australian people, that in turn has an impact on how we are managing the spread of the virus. “It’s also how that impacts on our health system, on the population, and people’s jobs and livelihoods.” The first busloads of international arrivals have been taken to quarantine hotels across Sydney under new coronavirus rules that came into effect this morning. Arriving passengers collected their bags before they were escorted to waiting charter buses for the short trip into the city, in a convoy led by federal police. Some have raised concerns about those passengers with special needs. Andrew Cowling, who arrived to collect his 85-year-old father flying in from the United States, said he was not confident the Government would be able to adequately meet his father’s needs. “He’s been at his house in lockdown in Philadelphia, he’s not from New York,” Mr Cowling said. “Unless he’s got it on the plane, we feel as an 85-year-old person with his own health issues, that he needs support of breathing, he’s going to need medication, “I don’t how any of this is going to be managed by the Government.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus layoffs: Economists warn 17 per cent will be out of work by Easter | The New Daily Economists warn 17% will be out of work by Easter","date":"03-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/29\/coronavirus-layoffs-will-triple-unemployment\/","transcript":"Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the Morrison government is working on a wage subsidy plan, as a leading economist warned the unemployment rate could soar to 17 per cent by Easter as the coronavirus bites. The government has resisted the idea of a wage subsidy similar to the UK, which would fund 80 per cent of the payroll of a business so it can keep its workers on the payroll rather than having to join a lengthening dole queue. “We are going to do it in an Australian way,” Senator Cormann told ABC television’s Insiders program on Sunday. “We’re going to do it in a way that actually is going to be able to be delivered, using our existing systems and our existing architecture.” He said from his understanding, the UK’s plan had yet to be rolled out. “We are working very hard on further expanding the level of income support through businesses to enable more businesses either to stay in hibernation or to survive through this difficult period ahead for a strong bounce back on the other side,” Senator Cormann said.. He declined to go into the specifics of the plan but said the government intended to make an announcement “over the next few days”. This will form part of the government’s third stimulus package – two previous packages total more than $80 billion – aimed at trying to shield the economy as much as possible from the impact of COVID-19. Even so, former ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan said the crisis had rapidly become an employment problem. “I think a wage subsidy is critical at this juncture … because we have such a significant amount of jobs losses,” former ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan told Sky News. Treasury had estimated the impact of the coronavirus would see an additional one million people out of work, but already firms are shedding or have stood down between 60 to 90 per cent of their staff. “I think very quickly we can talk about out over a million jobs being lost. It looks like were going to get through that in very short order,” Mr Hogan said. “I think by the time we get to Easter we are going to probably see about 1.5 to 1.8 million job losses due to standdowns. That would see the unemployment rate soar from 5.1 per cent as of February to somewhere above between 15 and 17 per cent. Senator Cormann said having doubled the level of income support under the JobSeekers payment, formally called Newstart – the government is also going to ease restrictions in terms of partner income. This will that ensure that those with partners who are seeking support will not be negatively impacted. The current partner income test kicks in once a partner earns more than $48,000. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW woman charged after allegedly bursting through SA coronavirus border blockade and coughing on police | The New Daily Police: Woman ran border blockade then coughed on us","date":"03-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/29\/woman-charged-coughing-on-police\/","transcript":"A New South Wales woman will face court after speeding through a South Australian border checkpoint and coughing in the faces of two police officers.

With two-thirds of the country’s 3635 cases from or closely linked to overseas travellers, vacant hotels and other accommodation services are being used to ensure no more travellers have a chance to spread the disease. NSW Police urged friends and families to stay away from Sydney Airport, saying those being quarantined would not be able to see or communicate with their loved ones. Returned travellers will live out their 14 days of quarantine in state-funded hotel rooms, with doors guarded by state police, defence personnel or private security guards. In Sydney alone, 3000 people are expected to land on Sunday. “We will treat these people with absolute respect and dignity but we will need their support,” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said. “The 14 days, I am sure, will be a challenge for them and perhaps the food is not up to standard or they feel that the bed is not as comfortable as their own. “They need to understand that we are trying to protect the community of NSW.” Overseas arrivals have sharply declined in Brisbane, with health minister Steven Miles saying only 1047 arrived on Friday down from about 7000 just a week prior. Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Queensland reached 625 with the majority people who had returned from overseas. Deputy federal chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the compulsory quarantine was supported by the “very best” medical evidence. “Realistically, a vaccine for the coronavirus is many months away. In the meantime, Australians can be reassured we are constantly monitoring COVID-19 developments – both domestically and abroad – and adapting what we do to minimise its spread,” Dr Kelly said in an opinion piece released on Saturday. He said that a “blanket lockdown” hadn’t been implemented in Australia because “unlike countries such as Italy, Spain and Iran, and cities such as Wuhan in China, we have remained ahead of the curve”. Meanwhile, private and non-profit hospitals are calling for funding certainty after bans on surgery left them laying off staff. The doctors union also called on government to move urgent and semi-urgent medical care services into private hospitals to free up public hospital capacity for escalating COVID-19 admissions. The Australian Medical Association also wants governments to reduce barriers to access of surgical masks and other personal protection equipment for hospital workers and other primary carers. “Diminishing PPE is a key health workforce challenge that needs to be solved for our healthcare system to keep working. PPE supply must be at the heart of all health sector planning,” AMA vice-president Chris Zappala said. Meanwhile, all Australians will be able to consult their GP over the phone and access new coronavirus-specific mental health support under a $1.1 billion package. The Morrison government is expanding Medicare subsidies for telehealth to the entire population, giving more money to domestic violence and mental health support services, and providing $200 million to charities and community organisations who give emergency relief, such as food banks, and financial counselling.

He said New York residents are leaving the state and “we don’t want that,” adding that the quarantine would be “enforceable” and would restrict travel outside the state. He later added that, if the decision was made, “it won’t affect trade in any way”. Federal restrictions on travel would be an extraordinary measure by Trump and a significant escalation on the current orders from the governor for New York residents to remain at home, which are largely being enforced through social pressure. Trump’s statement was met with surprise by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who said Trump did not mention a state-wide quarantine in a phone call between the leaders on Saturday. “I don’t even know what that means. I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable,” Cumo said at a press briefing. “I don’t even like the sound of it.” Cuomo said his state has more than 52,000 reported cases of coronavirus, amounting to nearly half of all reported cases in the US. Meanwhile, New York is preparing for an apex in cases within 14 to 21 days and is stockpiling medical equipment, Cuomo said. “When that curve hits the highest point it is too late to try to acquire what you need,” Cuomo said at a press conference. “Acquire what you need now.” The US leads the world in reported coronavirus cases at more than 105,000, including more than 1800 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, cases of the coronavirus topped 600,000 on Saturday, just two days after the world hit the landmark total of half a million. To help alleviate the state’s embattled health care providers, a US navy hospital ship will depart to New York on Saturday and is expected to dock there on Monday. Trump will see the ship off during a ceremony on Saturday. Cuomo added that his state has postponed its presidential primary from April to June – adding to a growing list of over 10 states – amid the pandemic. Meanwhile, the United Nations announced that it will be donating a quarter of a million protective face masks stored at UN headquarters in New York to the United States."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"$1.1 billion funding boost for telehealth, domestic violence, mental health","date":"03-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/29\/coronavirus-telehealth-package\/","transcript":"The health of Australians stuck at home is the focus of a $1.1 billion package to boost telehealth and tackle the hidden side effects of the pandemic such as domestic violence. All Australians will be able to consult a GP from home under expanded access to telehealth services such as phone consultations or video-conferencing. More money will go to domestic violence programs amid warnings of a possible surge in family violence with people forced to stay at home. Funding will also cover mental health and charities as stressed and anxious Australians struggle with the impacts of job losses and social distancing restrictions. The new support comes as thousands of returning Australians are shuttled from airports to makeshift quarantine hotels guarded by police, army and security for mandatory 14-day isolation. Under the measures which came into effect midnight Saturday, families have been told they cannot see their loved ones who are being housed in state-funded hotel rooms in a bid to stop travellers spreading the virus in the community. About two-thirds of the country’s 3635 cases are from or closely linked to overseas travellers. In Sydney alone, 3000 people are expected to land on Sunday and will be discreetly processed before being admitted to a hotel room. “We will treat these people with absolute respect and dignity but we will need their support,” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said. “The 14 days, I am sure, will be a challenge for them and perhaps the food is not up to standard or they feel that the bed is not as comfortable as their own. “They need to understand that we are trying to protect the community of NSW.” Deputy federal chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the compulsory quarantine was supported by the “very best” medical evidence. He said a “blanket lockdown” hadn’t been implemented in Australia because “unlike countries such as Italy, Spain and Iran, and cities such as Wuhan in China, we have remained ahead of the curve”. The bulk of the Morrison government’s $1.1 billion package will expand Medicare subsidies for telehealth to the entire population, with $669 million to cover consultations by phone or video-conferencing such as FaceTime or Skype. Charities and community organisations that give emergency relief, such as food banks, and financial counselling will receive $200 million. Another $150 million will boost existing domestic violence programs amid warnings of a possible surge in family violence with people forced to stay at home. To encourage GP practices to stay open for people who still need face-to-face services, the bulk billing incentive will be doubled between now and the end of September. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the latest round of spending aimed to deal with the secondary effects of the health and economic crises the coronavirus is causing. “As we battle coronavirus on both the health and economic fronts with significant support packages in place and more to come, I am very aware many Australians are understandably anxious, stressed and fearful about the impacts of coronavirus and what it brings,” he said on Sunday. “We will get through this crisis by staying together, by supporting each other and ensuring that no Australian, even though we have to be isolated, should have to go through this alone.” Domestic violence services have warned about a likely spike in violence as people are forced indoors through the social distancing needed to stop the spread of the virus. They pointed to increased domestic violence rates in China while it shut down. And Google has told the government is it seeing a massive increase in people searching online for domestic violence help, spiking in the first week of March to the highest number of searches in five years. Funding to services will include counselling, the 1800RESPECT domestic, family and sexual violence counselling service, Mensline Australia, the trafficked people program, and support for women and children experiencing violence to protect themselves to stay in a home of their choice when it is safe to do so. To bolster mental health, a new dedicated coronavirus wellbeing support line will be set up by BeyondBlue, funded with $10 million from the federal government and $5 million from Medibank. It will help people who are concerned because they have been diagnosed with the disease, or are experiencing stress or anxiety due to employment changes, business closure, financial difficulties, family pressures or other challenges. As well, the government will give existing mental health support line services, including Lifeline and Kids Helpline a $14 million boost. There will also be dedicated support for health workers, older Australians, indigenous communities and young people. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Your coronavirus questions answered: Should we be in a lockdown?","date":"03-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/28\/coronavirus-question-lockdown\/","transcript":"As part of our responsibility to get you the information you need to know when you need it, we’ve been taking your coronavirus questions to the experts. Last week, they answered questions about how the virus works, how long this will all last, and how to do social distancing properly. But some things are secret from us, and that means they are secret from you. The Australian government won’t tell us how many phases of lockdown there are – or whats happens in stage three, which is expected to be rolled out in Victoria and New South Wales soon. The Australian government won’t share with us their modelling of how many us they’re expecting to catch COVID-19, or how many us will die. They won’t tell us what modelling they’re using to monitor how many ICU beds will be full and at what point. In lieu of this, we put some of your questions to Adjunct Professor Bill Bowtell from the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity. He was a key architect of the Australian government’s successful response to the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. Over to him. Should we all just go into full lockdown? We should follow New Zealand and move to a full close down – this has been advocated by many senior Australian and world experts. If we just locked down for two weeks would it be over? Then we could test those that need it and isolate them. Whatever happens, I doubt that this will be over at the end of two weeks. That must depend on how effective a shut down is in practice and how much it impedes transmission of the virus. Some countries that are further along the trajectory than Australia have seen a levelling off of new cases but not a sharp falling away. This is a new virus for which there is no immunity, vaccine or cure. No-one, least of all me, can predict how its course will run in Australia. Some other countries, such as Vietnam, announce flight numbers once they can link a confirmed coronavirus patient to them. Why isn’t the government announcing the flight numbers of planes thatwere carrying people who then became ill? They don’t but they should. There has been almost no level of effective surveillance at Australian airports since the virus emerged at the end of last year. Why steps like those taken in Singapore, Hong Kong and elsewhere were not taken here is extremely puzzling, to say the least. Is social distancing working? How it is working today becomes apparent over two weeks or so in the new caseloads. Of course, it must be helping to impede the spread of the virus but greater distancing would help with better outcomes into the next two weeks or so. Is the government choosing money over lives? The government has made it very clear that it will follow policies that in its view should accept the spread of the virus as a trade-off for maintaining economic activity. But this is not borne out by the immense scale of economic collapse under present policy settings. It would have been better to act more drastically sooner rather than step by step and to somehow see this as a binary choice between the economy and public health. “Economy” is just another word for people. Why can’t I just go someone where and get tested? In theory, Australia has opted not to test asymptomatic people but to test those with symptoms. This varies in practice from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from hospital to hospital. The more tests conducted, the better the data and the better we can understand what’s happening. Other countries have tested far more than Australia but this seems to be changing as more tests are sourced for use in Australia. If we did absolutely nothing and let the virus spread what would be the outcome? The situation in December\/January in Wuhan and then in Italy, Spain and New York demonstrates pretty clearly what happens when the virus spreads totally or almost unchecked. How can a beach in the open air, with a few hundred people on it, be closed as unsafe when commuter trains carry 1500 or more in peak hour, crammed like sardines be OK to continue? All of these guidelines and structures make no logical sense. The virus infects on an equal-opportunity basis, regardless of these distinctions. The closer you are to an infected person or surface, the greater the risk. The more distant you are, or the less contact you have with possibly infected surfaces, the less the risk. Will they adjust their modelling when it becomes clear the hospitalisation and ICU impact is nowhere near what they’ve forecast? The modelling undertaken by the government has been kept secret so we do not know their assumptions and projections. How long will the pandemic last? No one can know the answer to this question. While viruses emerge from nature, their effects on us are entirely a reflection of the decisions made by governments and the people. Some countries and cities handle these things very well and others in a more chaotic and less organised way. Australia falls somewhere in the middle now, when we should have been able to organise a response more like Singapore and Taiwan. In time this will pass, but the economic and social impacts will change the world and Australia in profound ways. Why are daycare centres still open? These are decisions taken for political reasons, so you would have to ask the governments concerned. None of the advice or reasoning is made public. I live in a block of units, where two separate neighbours had visitors and friends over on the weekend. I’m in a highly vulnerable group and am wanting to know how to make young people follow the protocols? Clearly, some people have not got the message which, given the lack of any official information or mobilisation until very recently, is completely understandable. As things stand today, the guidelines allow gatherings of this size."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus lockdown Australia: What is happening around the country?","date":"03-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/28\/coronaviurs-lockdown-australia\/","transcript":"Around the country, most Australians are staying home to stay alive. They are keeping 1.5 metres away from those they don’t live with and avoiding public gatherings. Aussies coming home from overseas are holing up in hotels around the country. Although most of us are bunkering down in an effort to “flatten the curve”, some people are not taking the guidelines seriously. As a result, they are putting us all at risk. In part, this has been fuelled by confusing instructions from the Australian government and health officials. The 30-minute haircut, and its subsequent reversal, a key example of mixed-messaging. The states and territories are now rushing to police gatherings and quarantines. They have rolled out big fines and jail time for those who do not comply and are putting extra blue boots on the ground in certain cities. Here is what is happening around the country. People and businesses will face jail time and hefty fines if they fail to comply with mass-gathering bans. On Wednesday, NSW Police Minister David Elliott announced the measures, saying individuals would be given fines of $1000 and corporations $5000 for breaches. These penalties also apply to those found not following self-isolation rules. Breaching a public health order will leave you up to $11,000 out of pocket, or six-months jail time. Last week a 65-year-old woman from the Hunter region who returned from Bali was slapped with $1000 fine after defying self-isolation orders. The owner of a Sydney massage parlour also felt the sting, after being fined $5000 for operating after being ordered to close. Three staff members were fined $1000 each. To enforce these new measures, Sydney will be flooded with police during the lockdown. On Saturday morning Victoria followed suit, also introducing fines for businesses and individuals who break operating or isolation orders. Individuals will be smacked with a $1600 fine, and businesses $10,000 for breaching the state’s new restrictions on freedoms. “I hope we don’t have to fine anybody,” Premier Daniel Andrews said on Saturday morning. “I hope we don’t have to go to these levels of enforcement. But giving people these sorts of powers is very important. “Follow the rules, do the right thing, keep your distance, stay at home. That is the key message. And if you’re flouting those rules, you’ll be punished.” Breaching a public health order carries a maximum penalty of $20,000 in the state. Queensland police have launched a crackdown on people flouting the health regulations and are armed with the ability to hand out fines of up to $1334.50 for individuals and $6672.50 for businesses. If a person does not comply with the quarantine directions, penalties of up to $13,345 for individuals and $66,672.50 can be doled out. Emergencies officers have also been given the power to direct businesses, like supermarkets, to open and close. Non-essential indoor gatherings of 100 people have been banned. Queensland Police announced last week they would start monitoring crowd numbers in the state’s party precincts to ensure they adhere to the new rules. Revellers have also been asked to limit their attendance at venues to less than two hours’ duration. On Friday Premier Peter Gutwein announced fines of up to $16,800 for people gathering in groups over 10, both in public or private. “Stay home, unless you are going to work or school or to get supplies, stay at home,” Mr Gutwein told reporters. “No camping, no parties, no picnics. Don’t have barbecues with your mates or a booze-up in the park. “It’s not on. The message is clear. Unless you need to go to work unless you need to go out to get supplies, stay at home and save lives.” Exceptions have been made for families with over 10 people. The maximum penalty for defying a public health order in Tasmania is $8400. On Saturday it was announced that South Australians who gather in groups more than 10, face on-the-spot fines of up to $1000. Businesses who flout the rule face fines of up to $5000. Breaching a public health order can result in fines of up to $20,000 for individuals and up to $75,000 for businesses. Individuals who failed to adhere to self-isolation restrictions could be hit with a $1000 fine. Announcing the bans, Premier Steven Marshall said they were “not optional.” “We are only as strong as our weakest link,” he said. “Everyone needs to understand that from today failure to follow the directions to the letter of the law will leave individuals and businesses liable for significant on-the-spot fines.” The Western Australian government is currently mulling over on-the-spot fines, but no decision of they will implement them has been made public. The state has closed its borders to the rest of the country and the government is considering subdividing the large state to restrict further travel. Like Tasmania, WA, SA and QLD, the Northern Territory has closed its borders to the rest of the country. Non-essential sisters to the state are forced to quarantine for 14-days on entry. The penalty for noncompliance is a fine of up to $62,800. They will also face six months in jail. Police are conducting random checks to ensure self-isolation is enforced. The ACT will be issuing fines of up to $8000 for individuals and $40,500 for businesses who do not adhere to directions on self-isolation and business closure If the business is a utility company, the fine jumps to $1,620,000.

The level of turnout in the 77 local government polls and by-elections in the state seats of Currumbin on the Gold Coast and Bundamba at Ipswich is unclear. Results could take days after more than 500,000 people voted by mail to avoid queuing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s unknown what impact the virus may have on the polls. Government officials have for weeks urged Queenslanders to stay at home to avoid spreading the infection and simultaneously told them to go out and vote. Labor’s Lance McCallum is set to retain Bundamba, according to ABC election analyst Antony Green, while Laura Gerber was on track to hold Currumbin for the Liberal National Party. Those results would not change the government but are a sign of what’s to come at October’s state election. Meanwhile the LNP’s Adrian Schrinner was leading in the race to become Brisbane mayor, followed by Labor’s Patrick Condren. Tom Tate was tracking ahead on the Gold Coast, while Teresa Harding was ahead in poll for Ipswich mayor and Darren Power was leading the pack in Logan. Queenslanders have begun what could be a long wait to find out who will sit on their new council and claim two seats in state parliament. With just 29.9 per cent of the vote counted in Bundamba, Labor candidate Lance McCallum is ahead with One Nation’s Sharon Bell coming in second. The seat was left vacant by the resignation of long-term Labor MP Jo-Ann Miller. Her exit from politics came after Jann Stuckey quit politics after holding the Gold Coast seat of Currumbin for the Liberal National Party. Laura Gerber is running for the LNP there and is ahead. These polls will not change the government but will be watched closely as indicators of what’s to come at October’s state election. Labor holds a sizeable margin in Bundamba, while the LNP has held Currumbin since 2004. However, the results may not be known by the end of the night, as more than 570,000 residents were expected to vote by mail. Results for 77 councils are unclear. Brisbane is Australia’s largest council and has been held by the Liberal National Party since 2004. Adrian Schrinner was sworn in as Lord Mayor last year when Graham Quirk resigned. He is now in his first race for the job against Labor candidate Patrick Condren. The former television journalist is his biggest threat.

The United States now has the most coronavirus cases of any country, with nearly 85,000 infections. Hospitals in cities including New York and New Orleans are struggling to cope with the wave of patients. China has reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus infections for the previous day and a small reduction in new cases involving travellers from overseas. China has temporarily suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits, effective from Saturday (local time). Airlines have also been ordered to sharply cut international flights from Sunday. Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market and which had been on lockdown for more than two months, was open to incoming traffic late on Friday although cars were not allowed to leave. Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, removed border restrictions on Wednesday for all but Wuhan, which will allow people to leave the city starting on April 8. President Xi’s offer of assistance to the United States in a telephone call came amid a war of words between officials in Beijing and Washington DC over various issues including the coronavirus epidemic. Mr Trump and some US officials have accused China of a lack of transparency on the virus, and Mr Trump has at times called the coronavirus a “China virus” as it originated there, angering Beijing. In the call, Mr Xi reiterated to Mr Trump that China had been open and transparent about the epidemic, according to an account of the conversation published by the Chinese foreign ministry. Mr Trump said on Twitter that he discussed the coronavirus outbreak “in great detail” with Xi. “China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the virus,” Mr Trump said. “We are working closely together.

Mr Bolsonaro has also cast doubt on Sao Paulo’s death toll from the outbreak and accused the state governor of manipulating the numbers for political ends. Mr Bolsonaro’s accusations were the latest broadside in an ugly battle with Brazil’s governors, who have differed from the President’s view that protecting the economy takes priority over social distancing measures to combat the spread of the highly contagious virus. Following the advice of public health experts, the vast majority of the country’s 26 governors banned non-essential commercial activities and public services to contain the outbreak in their states. However the Brazilian leader disagrees with the approach, taking a strikingly phlegmatic view. “I’m sorry, some people will die, they will die, that’s life,” Mr Bolsonaro said in a television interview on Friday night. “You can’t stop a car factory because of traffic deaths.” Mr Bolsonaro said that in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil’s economic powerhouse, the death toll seemed “too large.” Sao Paulo has the most cases and deaths so far of coronavirus in Brazil, at 1,223 cases and 68 confirmed deaths. The national tally is nearly 3500 cases, with 93 deaths. Mr Bolsonaro’s popularity has slipped during the crisis, and many people across Brazil bang pots and pans in their windows nightly in protest at his handling of it. In counter-protests on Friday, Bolsonaro supporters drove honking caravans through major cities to oppose the lockdowns, sharing social media videos with the #BrazilCannotStop hashtag.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s personal homelessness adviser has written to local authorities telling them “communal night-shelters and any street encampments” must be “closed down for the time being” as they are “high risk” for spreading COVID-19. The email, which was sent to homelessness managers and rough sleeping co-ordinators in every local authority, is quoted by the charity Crisis as saying: “As you know, this is a public health emergency. “We are all redoubling our efforts to do what we possibly can at this stage to ensure that everybody is inside and safe by this weekend, and we stand with you in this. ***BREAKING NEWS **** 📣 The Government has written to local authorities asking them to house everyone sleeping rough or in hostels and night shelters, by the weekend.

The Health and Social Care Committee of MPs, which met on Thursday (local time), heard concerns that some hotels were resistant to making rooms available for homeless people. Conservative MP for Watford, Dean Russell, said his impression was that hotels are open to helping NHS workers and people in care but “fear there might be damage to rooms or related issues” if they help the homeless. A Ministry spokesman said: “We are working intensively with councils and the sector to get everyone who is sleeping rough off the streets and into appropriate accommodation – backed by APS1.6 billion of additional funding for councils to respond to pressures during this national emergency.

GM said in a statement in response that it has been working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems and GM suppliers “around the clock for over a week to meet this urgent need” and said its commitment to Ventec’s ventilators “has never wavered.” “They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed ventilators, ‘very quickly’,” Mr Trump said on Twitter of GM and Ventec’s effort. “Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar.” General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!

Following Mr Trump’s tweets, Ford said it was moving as fast as it could to gear up its ventilator manufacturing efforts and was in “active conversations” with the Trump administration seeking approvals. Ford said it has “teams working flat-out with GE Healthcare to boost production of simplified ventilators.” The attack on GM and Ford coincided with rising tension between Mr Trump and the Democratic governors of New York and Michigan, who have criticised the administration’s response to the COVID-19 epidemic.

But the June hearings have been cancelled by the Liberal-led committee, despite objections of Labor. Liberal MP Tim Wilson who chairs the committee said it remains important that the banks are held publicly accountable. “However, the banks are fully occupied in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mr Wilson said in a statement. “Therefore, it is prudent to defer the hearings until the situation improves. This comes just days after the Morrison government cancelled future federal parliamentary sittings until August, a decision that was also rejected by the opposition. “At a time when the banking sector is receiving unprecedented government support, it’s only reasonable that the major banks should give evidence for an hour or two to the House Economics Committee,” Labor’s deputy chair of the committee Andrew Leigh told AAP. “When billions of taxpayer dollars are involved, it’s only sensible to have proper parliamentary oversight.” He said the bank CEO’s wouldn’t even have to leave their offices when teleconferences are becoming the norm in the present environment.

Ms Kemp has been paying her rent, but her landlords have lost work due to the coronavirus outbreak and need to move back into their house. “Given the crisis, the availability of properties and real estate agents ceasing open home [inspections], looking for a new premise now doesn’t seem reasonable,” she said. “I do not know what I’m going to do.” Ms Kemp is one face of the virus-induced crisis brewing in the rental market. Many industries have been shut down for health reasons, including tourism, the arts and swathes of hospitality, or are limping badly because global travel has stopped, and people are cocooned in their homes. Australia’s rental system is made up of 3 million households that rent homes, and landlords who rely on the payments for income and to service mortgages. “My landlords have got mortgage repayments, plus the rent they’re paying on their own house,” Ms Kemp said. “I respect and understand exactly where they’re coming from, and it’s a very unfortunate circumstance, however something needs to be done to prevent landlords being stuck through this time, as well as all tenants.” Commercial tenants are stuck in the same mire. Shopping centre landlords such as Stockland and Scentre Group have done little, tenants claim, as they await Government action. At nearly 200 Just Cut salons across the country, business has collapsed. First foot traffic diminished, then social distancing rules made customers wary — its 2,500 employees are sitting ducks. “We’re concerned for the health of our stylists and our clients,” Just Cuts chief executive Denis McFadden said. Mr McFadden had called for a government-sanctioned shutdown of the hairdressing industry as protection from landlords. By Friday, he could not wait any longer and decided to shut all stores for at least four weeks, without a forced closure of hairdressers. “National cabinet has today failed to act on our pleas to add hairdressing to the list of non-essential services,” Mr McFadden said. “Our stylists are scared. Our customers are scared. How can we ask them to continue when everything and all the medical experts say the risks are too high? “So, we have today taken the decision to shut our doors for at least the next four weeks and are recommending to our independently owned and operated franchisees that they do the same.” On Friday, weeks after fears of the virus dried up foot traffic and trade, the peak body for shopping centre landlords, the Shopping Centre Association of Australia, called on its members to not terminate leases of small and medium businesses if they can’t pay rent. “Governments have received direct feedback that some owners are not engaging with the empathy that is required during these times,” the Association’s chair Peter Allen wrote. “This is surprising, and if correct, very disappointing and frustrating to hear.” Billionaires don’t wait to be asked their opinion. Under the banner of Premier Investments, retailer Solomon Lew owns brands including Just Jeans, Smiggle and Peter Alexander. On Thursday, Premier announced it would shut more than 850 stores across the country, stand down thousands of staff and refuse to pay rent for the duration of the shutdown. In a statement to the stock exchange, Premier noted that 70 per cent of its stores in Australia and New Zealand had leases expiring this year or were already in holdover periods, which Roger Montgomery from Montgomery Investment Management described as a “threat to close stores if landlords don’t play ball.” On Friday, Premier escalated matters, issuing a scathing statement reminiscent of Mr Lew’s public rebukes of retailer Myer. In the statement, Premier Investments executive director Mark McInnes criticised Scentre Group, alleging the Westfield owner failed to inform Premier that its team members had been exposed to customers who had tested positive for COVID-19. “It is unacceptable for landlords to play roulette with the lives of retail employees and customers by not doing everything they can to protect them,” Mr McInnes said. Scentre Group rejected Premier’s claims about its behaviour. “In relation to Westfield Carindale, our retail partners and centre management followed the correct Qld Health protocols,” it said. “The Qld Health advice was these individuals posed no risk to any customers, retailers or employees. “As a precaution, the relevant retailers closed their stores temporarily for deep cleaning. Centre management also conducted additional cleaning. We continue to follow the advice of health authorities.” Tenants of Adelaide City Council have not had to take matters into their own hands — they won’t pay any rent for at least three months. “We know that it’s easier for business to crank up than to close down and open again,” Adelaide Lord Mayor Sandy Verschoor said. “So, we want those tenants to still be there at the end of this.” Small landlords including Michael Illief are making accommodations, and Mr Illief might be the smallest — he rents out two car park spaces. “[The tenants] basically want a free rental … I actually agree with that, there’s no issue. I did mention to them, I can talk to them again back in June,” he said. Residential or commercial, everyone is waiting for details on rental policy from the National Cabinet, which was delayed all week. Tasmania has offered a stopgap solution — this week its Parliament passed laws banning evictions for at least the next four months. In addition, Australia’s largest banks have already offered to pause mortgage repayments for six months. Advocates for renters want to see an immediate stop to evictions until the crisis is over. “We have people, and we’ve had people coming to us for the past week, saying, ‘I have no income now, I can’t afford to pay my rent, today’. So this is an urgent problem, we need to see the action immediately,” Tenants’ Union of NSW senior policy officer Leo Patterson Ross said. Australia’s economy is deeply rooted in the value of housing. A spike in evictions and forced sales could accelerate what is already expected to be a sharp fall in property prices. Pausing mortgages on loans and preventing evictions could buy both sides of the rental equation valuable time to work out a soft landing. “We need to have a conversation, a whole of community conversation, about how to manage the rent arrears burden, the mortgages, the utility costs,” Mr Patterson Ross said. “To make sure that the whole community survives this crisis together and recovers from it together.” For single mother Kye Kemp, there is no simple answer. Her landlords have lost their jobs in the city and now want to repossess the home they had rented out. Ms Kemp does not want to go — her family are nearby, there is work to consider and her daughter is in a kindergarten located at the primary school she will attend next year. “There’s thousands of Australians in this predicament and it’s only going to get worse,” she said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Victoria Police to issue fines for breaking social distancing rules","date":"03-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/28\/victoria-fines-social-distancing-rules\/","transcript":"Victorians who breach social distancing rules designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus will face on-the-spot fines.

Italy’s latest figures included 4401 new contagions, a 6.6-per-cent daily increase that is consistent with the trend recorded in recent days. Experts see this as evidence that the contagion is slowing down. Earlier this month, the increase in new contagions was on some days above 20 per cent. “From March 19-20 (…) the curve seems – and I stress the word ‘seems’ – to be flattening,” National Health Institute President Silvio Brusaferro said before the release of Friday’s data. “We have not reached the peak, we have not gone past it,” he added. “We have signs of a slowdown that lead us to presume that we are near this situation.” “Contagions are definitely not increasing and I think they are starting to fall,” the head of the northern Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said in another press conference. Lombardy, which includes Italy’s financial and fashion hub, Milan, is the flashpoint of the epidemic, with almost half of total cases and nearly two-thirds of deaths. On Friday, the region reported 1706 new cases, a 7.7-per-cent increase, and 541 more fatalities, bring total cases to more than 37,000 and the dead to a staggering 5402. Mr Brusaferro called for no let-up in virus containment measures, amid concerns that the contagion crisis may shift to poorer southern regions. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Myer to close all stores for a month and lay off 10,000 staff | The New Daily Myer shuts all stores and lays off 10,000 staffers","date":"03-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/28\/myer-shutters-all-stores\/","transcript":"Another 10,000 Australian retail workers are headed for the Centrelink queues after Myer became the latest business to go into “hibernation” because of coronavirus. The retail giant announced on Friday it would temporarily close all its stores and stand down 10,000 staff without pay, sparking union calls for an urgent rescue package for the sector. The shutdown for at least four weeks from Sunday was “one of the toughest decisions this company has faced in its 120 years of operation”, said Myer chief executive John King. It follows outdoor adventure outlet Kathmandu closing all its stores as well as surfwear chain Rip Curl, while outdoor shoe retailer Merrell emailed customers advising that all its stores would be temporarily shut. The SDA – the union representing retail, fast food and warehouse workers – estimated some 30,000 retail workers had been stood down in the past week and called on the federal government to release a rescue package. “Myer’s decision makes the situation even more serious and urgent – this is a brand that has not only been a major employer, but a symbol of Australian retail success, for more than a century,” SDA national secretary Gerard Dwyer said. “How many more major and minor brands – retailers big and small – (will) take unilateral action because the government has left them no choice and the prime minister fails to extend to them what the community expects.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday that details of the plan to effectively cocoon businesses will be announced in the next few days as part of a third stimulus package, which will also include commercial and residential rental assistance. Mr Morrison said there were some businesses that would have to close their doors and the government wanted them to effectively go into hibernation for six months. The government has repeatedly baulked at the idea of wage subsidies for workers. In a statement published to the Australian Stock Exchange on Friday night, Myer said the health and wellbeing of customers, team members, their families and the community was its “absolute priority”. “We are, therefore, fully supportive of the various measures undertaken by both governments, and their respective agencies, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social isolation and distancing measures, including staying at home, wherever possible.” While its stores are shut, Myer will continue to operate all online business, and full and part-time staff are being given greater flexibility to access annual leave and long service entitlements. A small group of “business-critical roles” will be maintained, the statement said. Associate Professor Gary Mortimer, of Queensland University of Technology, warned that many retailers that were already suffering before the pandemic may not survive. “It’s become inevitable that we will see retail as we know it grind to a sudden halt as more and more operators shutter store,” Professor Mortimer told The New Daily. “Many apparel, footwear and accessories retailers, already weakened by limited discretionary spending, may not survive this challenging period. “Ultimately, we will see shopping centres close temporarily as many tenants, including anchor tenants like Myer, close their doors. “In the first few weeks of 2020, we had several major brands fall into voluntary administration, like Curious Planet, Jeans West and Bardot. This was before the impact of COVID-10 restrictions.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Boris Johnson contracts coronavirus, tells the nation 'I am working from home' | The New Daily Coronavirus: Boris Johnson tells the nation 'I'm infected but still working'","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/uk-news\/2020\/03\/27\/boris-johnson-gets-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The UK’s pandemic fightback has been dealt a blow after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his health secretary contracted coronavirus while England’s chief medical officer has developed symptoms. Mr Johnson is self-isolating in an apartment in Downing Street, with meals and briefings left outside his door, after coming down with a fever and persistent cough. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also tested positive and is isolating at home while England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty has developed symptoms. Mr Johnson says he will continue to lead the UK’s pandemic response from the study in 11 Downing Street, part of the warren of rooms and corridors at Number 10, while he self-isolates for seven days. Mr Johnson, 55, is the first leader of a major power to contract coronavirus but he has told the world via his Twitter account that his symptoms are mild and he can continue to work via teleconferencing. “I’ve taken a test. That has come out positive,” Mr Johnson said in a video statement on Twitter. “I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That’s to say – a temperature and a persistent cough. “So I am working from home. I’m self-isolating. “Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.” Mr Johnson had been criticised previously for continuing to shake people’s hands in public despite advocating social-distancing measures and for initially reacting slowly to the threat of coronavirus. It was not immediately clear how many Downing Street staff and senior ministers would now need to isolate given that many have had contact with Mr Johnson over recent days and weeks. Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus. I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus.

A video posted to Instagram shows the prince joining the nationwide applause for health workers as he clapped from home. Mr Johnson, 55, experienced mild symptoms on Thursday (local time) – a day after he answered at the prime minister’s weekly question-and-answer session in parliament’s House of Commons chamber. The moment he felt symptoms he took steps to avoid close contact with anyone, a spokesman said, adding that ministers would need to self-isolate if they developed symptoms. Previously the government has said Mr Johnson had the option to delegate to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab if needed. It was not immediately clear whether Mr Johnson’s 32-year-old fiance, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, had been tested. The UK has reported 578 deaths and 11,658 infections, and cases are estimated to be doubling every three to four days. The UK toll is the seventh-worst in the world, after Italy, Spain, China, Iran, France and the United States, according to a Reuters tally.  -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus confusion isn't made any clearer by political messaging Coronavirus confusion isn't made any clearer by political messaging","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/australian-politics\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-politics-morrison-matthewson\/","transcript":"If there’s one clear message to emerge from Australia’s efforts to combat Covid-19 it’s that there’s no one clear message. Everywhere you look, from traditional news outlets to social media, there are widespread and vocal complaints that people are being made even more anxious by the mix of confusing and competing information that’s flooding across our screens and jamming the airwaves. This is obviously a problem – simple, clear and understandable messages are needed in times of emergency or crisis, particularly when lives could depend on us being able (and willing) to follow any instructions. So why is Scott Morrison and his Chief Medical Officer finding it so hard to get the message out to Australians? It might be easy to conclude the government is just not really very good at communicating. There’s plenty of evidence to back up that assumption. But there are three other more complex reasons that are making the task even more difficult. The first, and most challenging reason, is that medical experts are unable to agree on the best way for Australia to tackle COVID-19. The Morrison government’s staged approach, gradually closing down some but not all parts of our economy and society, follows the advice of its expert panel, which is made up of the national, state and territory chief medical officers. But another group of medical experts disagrees with this gradual approach, and has argued that a complete shutdown, essentially placing the entire nation into a month-long quarantine, would arrest the spread of the virus. While the second group of medical experts acknowledge this would have an even more devastating impact on jobs and the economy than we’re seeing, they’ve argued it would be less destructive overall because Australia could move quickly to restore its economy once the month-long quarantine was over. The first group of medical experts don’t believe the virus can be stopped in a month, even with a complete shutdown of Australia. Meanwhile, those of us without high level qualifications in infectious diseases and immunology are stuck in the middle, unsure who to believe. Citizens who voted for the Coalition at the last election are more likely to favour the government experts; those who tried to vote the government out are more likely to believe the contrary view. So, we’re trying out Deputy Chief Medical Officer No.3.Pleading with us to believe their best medical advice. #auspol #COVID19au — Cheryl Kernot (@cheryl_kernot) March 26, 2020 And this is where the second complexity comes in, which we have discussed before: the government’s trust deficit with voters. When a community trusts a government to act in its best interests, citizens will generally do what that government instructs them to do. Even if the message is garbled. But when that government is distrusted, citizens fall prey to their own cynicism, preferring to believe almost anything that runs counter to what the government says. Take a look at #auspol on Twitter to see this Covid-19 counter-revolution in all its sordid glory. The Morrison Govt must stop hiding behind Treasury to justify its  ineffective Trickle- down approach to stimulus which is one of the worst in the developed world #auspol — Wayne Swan (@SwannyQLD) March 25, 2020 Of course, this is not to suggest that governments should not be scrutinised or criticised during times of emergency or crisis. However, the media, opposition parties, and anyone else with a platform or audience have a responsibility to strike a balance between holding governments to account and ensuring that Australians are provided with the facts they need to make informed choices. For some, finding that balance seems to be too much to ask. Everyone from former prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott to the local Uber driver has an opinion on what Mr Morrison and his government should be doing better\/differently. Remember when the government threatened to kill Johnny Depp’s dogs because of quarantine risks and then let in an entire cruise ship of people who were quarantine risks? #auspol #coronavirusau — JD Kent (@polsandlols) March 26, 2020 This is the third element making it difficult for the PM to get out a clear, simple message: base political motivations. Mr Morrison can’t find enough humility in his heart to bring his chief political opponent into the national cabinet. And, in turn, that opponent, Anthony Albanese, can’t resist the temptation to reward the rebuff by agitating against almost everything the PM proposes. In the midst of this life-or-death emergency – when clear and consistent messages are needed more than ever – differences of expert opinion, voter distrust and political expediency are making the communication task even harder for the Morrison government. The government is to blame for much of it. Australians are left wondering what to do, who to trust, and how to endure the ultimate outcome. That’s the only other clear message."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus boom: the businesses thriving amid the pandemic","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/markets-and-shares\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-market-boom-zoom\/","transcript":"The coronavirus pandemic has toppled global markets, but from the economic ashes several innovative and vital businesses are rising. In the US, companies helping other businesses take their workplaces online have become hot property, notching up percentage gains well into the double digits. Teleconferencing company Zoom has been a standout, Saxo Capital Markets’ market strategist Eleanor Creagh said, with the stock price lifting more than 80 per cent since mid-January. The company’s gains have been so immense, investors have since named the rally in work-from-home stocks the “Zoom boom”. And according to Ms Creagh, there are plenty of others seeing a similar surge in value. “There’s also a bunch of cloud and software stocks that have benefitted from the work-from-home environment, such as Citrix and DocuSign,” she told The New Daily. It’s a rally that has the potential to outlive the coronavirus, as the sudden shift to working from home may lead to “structural change” in many industries. “It’s not going to be a 100 per cent transition, but I would say the capacity to work from home has now been proven,” she said. “In that sense, I think there’s the beginning of a shift towards people being more flexible.” It’s also a positive indicator for other businesses too, suggesting that many are able to make the leap to working-from-home and potentially keeping workers employed. The coronavirus-infected has hit stock markets as badly as it did the rest of society, shuttering already weak businesses and leaving the survivors too nervous to move. Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 market index saw historic falls in early March as businesses and investors started to feel the full force of the coronavirus’ spread. But in a stunning reversal of the axiom ‘what goes up, must come down’, the index has since recorded incredible gains. From market open on Monday, the ASX 200 gained 8.5 per cent by 10:30am on Friday when it hit its highest weekly point, before losing some of those gains in the afternoon. But by close, the market was still 1.2 per cent above it’s opening level on Monday. “This has been one of our best weeks in some time,” Bell Direct market analyst Jessica Amir told The New Daily. “It’s an unheard of gain. Looking at the data, the last time we saw a gain of this magnitude or anything close was March 29, 2019, so it’s been a strong week.” Those gains were underpinned institutional investors, all of which are legally required to rebalance their investment portfolios for their clients ahead of the third quarter’s end on March 31.. “That’s why we’ve seen some stocks make outstanding gains,” Ms Amir said. But it’s not the only reason markets rallied – immense stimulus packages both in Australia and abroad (particularly the $US2 trillion package floated by the US) helped stocks rebound. It’s a rare bit of much-needed good news, but sadly in the short term it’s unlikely to last. Ms Amir said the economy is expected to “grind to a halt” as recession grips the country, cautioning the next quarter could be “one of the darkest periods for GDP growth” that we’ve ever seen. In the long term, things are a little different though. Economic conditions will likely start to pick up later in the year, Ms Amir said. In the meantime, businesses within the consumer staples sectors (such as groceries, energy, and healthcare services) will likely see continued strength. For would-be investors, Ms Amir had some parting advice: “Investors need to focus on quality stock – things with low debt, and high repeatable earnings.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"avirus questions answered: How can we protect ourselves from COVID-19","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-covid-questions-answered-2\/","transcript":"As part of our responsibility to get you the information you need to know when you need it, we’ve been taking your coronavirus questions to the experts. Last week, they answered questions about how the virus works, how long this will all last, and how to do social distancing properly. This is a constantly changing situation and answers are current as of time of publishing. Please check www.health.gov.au for the latest. Professor Emeritus Gerry Fitzgerald is a public health expert from the Queensland University of Technology. He was previously Chief Health Officer for Queensland. Over to him. Is it best to not take paracetamol if you have a fever to help promote a high a fever as possible to cook the virus out of you? It is ordinarily wiser to keep your core body temperature down. So taking paracetamol [most common brand name Panadol] will not change the outcome. If you are in any doubt you should discuss this with your medical advisor. Should I be wearing a mask when I go to the supermarket? As long as you are not personally ill, there is no advantage to wearing a mask. The types of mask you can generally buy in the chemist do not filter out virus particles. There is no harm to wearing them. What is the government’s end goal? Are they hoping to flatten the curve or extinguish the virus? I don’t think it is appropriate for the public to be left in the dark about this crucial information. The aspiration of the authorities is clearly to prevent a significant community outbreak in this country. Almost all of the cases so far have been among people who have returned from overseas or those who have been in contact with them. There are a number of people still under investigation in which the linkage is not clear and that is causing concern that there has been some community transmission. Thus, the strategies include identification of everyone with the disease, isolating those people and then contacting, testing and monitoring those who have been in contact with them. However, if it’s not successful in eliminating the disease then at least these same strategies will flatten the curve and allow the health system to cope with the number of people who do fall ill. Eventually, the disease will go away. Should married couples sleep in separate beds\/rooms in case one becomes infected, particularly if aged 70+? It would be better to try and protect both by isolating them both and protecting either from getting the virus. Certainly, if one gets the virus then they should isolate form each other. Should we proceed with dental appointments? The risk is very small. Nevertheless, most dentists have stopped all routine visits for the moment How should I clean the house after recovery? Normal cleaning methods are appropriate. Soap and water will clean away the virus and common disinfectants will also help. The aim is to clean commonly used surfaces. The virus can last up to nine days on surfaces but it will eventually die. So cleaning commonly used surfaces will be good, but you don’t have to scrub every millimetre of the house. After quarantine, lockdown, social distancing, etc. What happens then? Does the virus weaken and just die? When are we not at risk of infection and catching it again? Because viruses need living cells to stay alive and replicate, if we can break the transmission of the virus from one person to another, eventually the virus will go away. However, we may be able to control it in Australia but it may continue to spread around the world and so we will remain at risk from re-introduction of the virus into the country until it disappears from all countries. The history is that eventually these viruses do disappear. This will be sped up if we can develop a vaccine for the virus. We don’t know for sure as yet if you will be at risk of contracting it again. However, leading authorities such as Nobel Laureate Professor Peter Dougherty believe recovery from the virus should give us immunity to it and that, therefore, a vaccine should be able to do the same thing. The doubt is raised by the fact that the most common coronavirus we are familiar with is the common cold and this does not provide immunity because of the frequent changes in the virus structure. How long can the virus stay on your hands without washing them? Coronaviruses have been shown to stay on surfaces for up to nine days. I am not sure anyone has tested how long it stays on hands. The best advice is to wash your hands before you touch objects that others may touch and after as well. For example, if you go to the supermarket, you may be wise to wash your hands on the way in (or use sanitiser if it is available) clean down the trolley and then, when you have finished handling the products, wash your hands again. Remember the risk is low at present, Can I play singles tennis? The risk of playing tennis is very small provided you keep a distance from others. Wash your hands before and after. However, watch government advisories about going out of your own home. My sibling is a renal patient and has dialysis three times a week.  When it comes to total lockdown can I still take him there or will he have patient transport? We don’t live in the same house. This is tricky as your sibling will be at risk should they contract COVID-19. Perhaps this is one for your medical advisors. It is said that people with high blood pressure are at greater risk of symptoms becoming more serious. Does this include people whose blood pressure is stable on medication? I don’t know at present. This is an unusual risk factor and so it is not clear whether it relates to hypertension which is under control or not. What is the timeline between contact with coronavirus and a positive test? The World Health Organisation currently estimates the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days, with a median incubation period of five to six days. To date, the exact nature of transmission of COVID-19 is not well understood. Most people contract the disease from someone who is symptomatic. However, there is a technical possibility that you could contract it from some in whom symptoms have not yet begun or in whom the symptoms are very mild. Thus, authorities are following up anyone who may have had contact one to two days before the onset of symptoms. The current test looks for the presence of the virus in the nose and throat. Thus, it may only be positive while the person has symptoms and for one to two days before. New tests have been developed which test for the presence of the antibody in blood and this may be positive before symptoms and during recovery. Can we please have a comprehensive list of symptoms? The symptoms include: The Australian Government Health site describes the symptoms of Covid-19 and is available here."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus has stranded hundreds of Australians in India","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-australians-india\/","transcript":"Hundreds of Australians are stuck in India, some struggling to find adequate food supplies after the entire country was locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced he would lock down the country’s 1.3 billion people, banning them from leaving their homes for three weeks. Brad Humphries and his wife, Kunti, from Sydney, are stuck in Mumbai. They have tried to book flights home, but every time they’ve had one, it has been cancelled. “It gets hard. We’ve booked various flights and they’ve said, ‘Oh yes we’ve got a flight for this date’. Then we get an email cancelling it,” Mr Humphries told The New Daily. “It’s frustrating. We contacted the High Commission, they said to contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). They asked if we were safe, and said they couldn’t get involved. “They were supportive, but it was like, I might as well ring a helpline. They really weren’t offering anything. “There is no way to come home. And we’re scared.” The couple has been in the country since March 10. They said the COVID-19 case numbers were low when they flew out, so they didn’t think it would be an issue. What was meant to be a relaxing holiday visiting family and friends has turned into a desperate rescue plea. They are now in a WhatsApp group with 120 other Australians trying to get home. Everyone is desperate and willing to pay their own way if the government could help them arrange a flight. Currently, the couple is burning through at least $150 on food and accommodation per day. Although their accommodation is comfortable, the cost  is unsustainable. It is not just the financial element they’re worried about, it is catching COVID-19. “If you get sick, you want to be at home. The last thing we want is to fall sick here and end up in an Indian hospital. They have a great health system, but it will be overwhelmed,” Mrs Humphries said. “They aren’t testing enough people. The reality is, they just don’t know the case numbers. She called on the Australian government to follow Germany’s lead. “What the German government did was, they found where their people were and arranged busses to Delhi or to a place where they could fly them out,” she said. “They were working around the clock, getting the Germans, getting them out of towns. “We don’t know if Modi will extend the lockdown. We just want someone to help us get out of here.” Although all domestic and international travel has been banned, some countries, including Germany, France, the United States and Israel have managed to get their citizens out. Hundreds of Australians are thought to be stuck inside the country after their ‘rescue flights’ were cancelled – they’ve been given no other option but to stay put. Some are struggling to find bottled water, and many supermarket shelves are bare. Others need medication they can’t get. Karandeep Singh, from South Australia, is stuck in with his wife and two-year-old daughter in Mohali, a city in Punjab. They have been in India for two months, after travelling to the country for his brother’s wedding. Now they can’t leave. “We’ve been here for two months. We had a flight on March 23 and it got cancelled,” Mr Singh said. He contacted the Australian High Commission In India, who told them to ‘stay where they are’ but they are struggling to get proper food for their daughter. “We are struggling to get food for her because she’s not used to drinking the milk over here. We’re not getting it due to lockdown,” Mr Singh said. “And we can’t get her medication, you’re not allowed to go outside. “I don’t know what we will do.” Mr Singh works in mining, his wife works in a nursing home. Booking the flight home, the one that was cancelled, has already cost them thousands of dollars. “We booked the flight a second time and it got cancelled. We’ve already paid but if we need to re-book we need to pay again – that’s what Singapore Airlines told us.” He said he feels deserted by the government, and worried about how long the lockdown will go for. “We’re Australian citizens, I pay a good amount of tax. I thought the government would help us out,” he said. “We are happy to pay if they’ll take us. Like the same thing they did with China, at least then we would know we are going back.” Another couple from Melbourne are stuck in Bhuj, a city in India’s west. They are running out of medication. “We are in a bad situation at the moment,” said Mehul, who only wanted his first name used. “With me being diabetic with high cholesterol. I’ve got only two days of medication left and no means to get to a pharmacy due to lockdown.” He said he and his wife were staying at a friend’s house, where there was no water supply. “We are meant to be on our way home to with Singapore Airlines, which got cancelled several times within a week. Now we are not getting any response from Singapore Airlines or our travel agent back in Melbourne. “I beg the Australian government to kindly help us get back home. Like I said, my medication will only last me till the morning.” The New Daily contacted the DFAT, asking specifically how many Australians in India had asked them for help and if anything could be done to provide assistance. After 24 hours, the department had provided no response."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus outbreak: Home-made hand sanitiser not the best idea","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-home-hand-sanitiser\/","transcript":"Hand sanitiser has been a hard-to-find commodity for some weeks, and people are increasingly turning to recipes to make their own at home. Although everything on the internet looks credible, health experts are advising against getting your DIY on. Why? One, you could create a concoction that actually damages the skin on your hands. Two, your product could very well be ineffective – and if that’s all you’re doing for hand health, you’re leaving yourself wide open there. Washing your hands with soap and water is still the most effective way to kill germs – including the coronavirus. Sing Happy Birthday, sing My Sharona, sing TLC’s classic No Scrubs – just make sure you’re washing ’em right. Here’s a handy little graph that demonstrates how to best clean your hands. So what exactly is the problem with home-made hand sanny recipes? To start with, the most effective component of hand sanitiser is alcohol. To kill germs, Choice explains, the product has to be a minimum 70 per cent alcohol. So while some recipes do list pure alcohol as the main ingredient, unless you’ve got a background as a budding chemist, it can be tricky to get the ratios right when you start adding in other ingredients (aloe vera; nice smelling oils are common add-ons) and making sure you keep up that alcohol percentage. Other recipes don’t even hint at alcohol – it’s all essential oils and plant extracts. The next problem: Most of the alcohol you can buy freely is rubbing alcohol, that’s what most recipes will suggest. Rubbing alcohol is actually anywhere between 50 and 70 per cent pure. So if it’s 70 per cent, and you mix it with just a smidgen of aloe or oils, it loses that 70 per cent concentration. Therefore, ineffective. Follow? No. You cannot. Most spirits hover around the 40 per cent mark, so just save the gin for your quarantinis. There’s a few recipes doing the rounds that suggest using methylated spirits or vodka. Metho is 90 to 95 per cent alcohol, and as mentioned, vodka is about 40 per cent. Maybe don’t trust the maths on these ones. Just because there are lots of spirits companies dedicating their equipment to making sanitiser over artisanal products, doesn’t mean you can switch from making spag bol for dinner to a hygiene product at home. Organic chemist and American Chemical Society member Richard Sachleben put it quite well. “Companies spend a bunch of time and money to pay chemists specifically to formulate hand sanitisers that work and that are safe,” he told Consumer Reports. “If you make it yourself, how can you know if it’s stable or if it works?” All said and done, if you do know what you’re doing – don’t let us stop you. But as we said before, washing your hands with water and soap (properly) is more effective than commercial or hand-made hand sanitiser."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Trump goads China with a dramatic boost to support for Taiwan | The New Daily Trump goads China by boosting support for Taiwan","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/trump-goads-china-backing-for-taiwan\/","transcript":"With China-US tensions already running high, President Donald Trump has provoked further anger from Beijing by signing into law an act that requires increased US support for Taiwan internationally. China claims democratic and separately ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and regularly describes Taiwan as its most sensitive and important issue in ties with the United States. While the United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, the Trump administration has ramped up support for the island, with arms sales and laws to help Taiwan deal with pressure from China. The Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, signed by Trump into law on Thursday with strong bipartisan support, requires the US State Department to report to Congress on steps taken to strengthen Taiwan’s diplomatic relations. It also requires the United States to “alter” engagement with nations that undermine Taiwan’s security or prosperity. Taiwan complains that China is poaching the dwindling number of countries that maintain formal ties with Taipei and has prevented it from participating in bodies like the World Health Organisation. China says Taiwan is merely one of its provinces, with no right to recognition as a country. Taiwan’s foreign ministry welcomed the US law and thanked the United States for its support for Taiwan’s “diplomatic space” and right to international participation. “We are also willing to work with the United States and countries with similar ideals to promote the shared common goals of freedom and democratic values, and continue to strive for even wider international space for Taiwan,” the ministry said. There was no immediate reaction from Beijing, which is already angry about Trump’s accusations that China poorly handled the coronavirus outbreak. China’s defence ministry on Thursday accused the United States of playing a dangerous game with its support for Taiwan, after a US warship passed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait. One of the act’s authors, Senator Cory Gardner, said the law was needed to respond to Chinese pressure on, and bullying of, Taiwan. “This bipartisan legislation demands a whole-of-government approach to ramp up our support for Taiwan, and will send a strong message to nations that there will be consequences for supporting Chinese actions that undermine Taiwan,” he said in a statement. The United States has been particularly concerned about China hiving off Taiwan’s allies in the Pacific and Latin America, areas of the world Washington traditionally considers its zone of influence. Taiwan now only has diplomatic relations with 15 countries, almost all small and developing nations like Nauru, Belize and Honduras. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Two weeks before we know if our coronavirus restrictions are working","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-restrictions-effectiveness\/","transcript":"Experts say it will be Easter before we know whether what we have been doing to limit the spread of coronavirus is working. There are now more than 400,000 cases in 169 countries and almost 19,000 people have died from COVID-19. In Australia, there are more than 3,000 cases and 13 people have died. Governments have implemented a range of measures to tackle the spread of the virus. Some have opted for tightly controlled lockdowns, like India and New Zealand. Others have been slower to respond and have taken a less stringent approach. In Australia the focus has been on flattening the curve. People are being asked to stay at home as much as possible and only those in essential industries are meant to be turning up to their places of work. Data shows the success of Australia’s plan to fight coronavirus relies mostly on reducing the speed of its spread, and the numbers are tight. The modelling says it will move through the population rapidly unless at least eight in 10 Australians stay home as much as possible. If that drops to just seven in 10 people it will be very difficult to flatten the curve. But even if the fight is going well, how long will it be until we know that? Medical experts say we will need to wait weeks for an answer. Hassan Vally, associate professor of public health at La Trobe University, said that is due to the long incubation period of coronavirus. “It’s going to take some time for us to know whether our public health interventions, including social distancing, are actually working and of course, the only measure of that will be how many cases we see about 10 days to two weeks from now,” he said. “The biggest worry, of course, is that we get a nasty surprise two weeks from now and find out that what we’ve been doing hasn’t been working. “And then we’re in a bit of a situation where we’re going to ramp everything up very quickly.” Professor Michael Kidd from the Chief Medical Officer’s team said reduced numbers of new cases across NSW and Victoria in the past few days had shown that self-isolation and social distancing has been working. “It’s working but we can’t take the level of comfort that I think you are wanting to take from seeing numbers going down slightly over a 24-hour period,” he told Channel Nine this morning. “We have to be watching the trend over many weeks.” NSW Chief Medical Officer Kerry Chant also indicated that it would be up to a fortnight before it was clear if what Australians are being told to do was helping to stop the spread of coronavirus. Without a vaccine or treatment available, the uncertainty is likely to continue, Professor Vally said. “We’re now at a point where the biggest influence on how this is going to play out are individuals,” he said. “It’s how well people will listen to the advice to practise social-distancing measures, because that is going to be the greatest influence on how much this virus is transmitted.” On Friday the National Cabinet announced further restrictions, mostly around quarantine provisions and enforcement. From midnight on Saturday, everyone arriving by plane will be quarantined in hotels and other facilities for two weeks, in the city in which they arrive. The Australian Defence Force will also be deployed to assist police with enforcing self-isolation and quarantine measures. Here’s a list of the other measures, which were introduced on Wednesday: Activities and business to be shut down: Australian citizens travelling overseas (with strict exemptions) Amusement parks and arcades Indoor and outdoor play centres Community and recreation centres, health clubs, fitness centres, yoga, barre, spin facilities, saunas, wellness centres Public swimming pools Galleries, museums, national institutions, historic sites, libraries, community centres Auction houses Real estate auctions and open house inspections In-store beauty therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons and tattoo parlours, spa and massage parlours (excluding allied-health-related services, like physiotherapy) Food courts within shopping centres will only be able to sell takeaway. Shopping centres themselves will remain open Limits on weddings, funerals and exercise: Personal training and boot camps are limited to a maximum of 10 people Weddings can continue, but only with the couple, the celebrant, and witnesses totalling a maximum of five people Funerals are limited to a maximum of 10 people Outdoor and indoor food markets will be addressed by individual states and territories Businesses remaining open: Cafes and restaurants (only takeaway and delivery) Hotels (only accommodation) Supermarkets Banks Petrol stations Pharmacies Convenience stores Freight and logistics Food delivery Bottle shops Hairdressers and barbers The first stage of restrictions forced the shut down of venues including clubs, pubs, sporting venues and places of worship. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Army to monitor mass quarantine of returning Australian travellers","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/quarantine-coronavirus-australia\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison has called in the army to help manage the mass quarantine of returning Australians as the fight against the coronavirus pandemic steps up yet another level. The Prime Minister made the announcement after the latest meeting of the national cabinet on Friday afternoon. The mass quarantines will apply to everyone who arrives at an Australian airport from midnight on Saturday. Travellers will be quarantined for 14 days at hotels or other accommodation in the state they fly to, regardless of their home state. “You have come back into Australia, you need to live up to this pledge,” Mr Morrison said. “The state and territory governments are going to make sure you do. And there are strong penalties for those who don’t comply with this and the states and territories are already moving in their enforcement measures.” The federal government will support the states and territories with logistics and other issues. “We will be supporting them also by providing members of the Australian Defence Force to assist in the compliance with these arrangements,” Mr Morrison said. ADF personnel will also help local law enforcement agencies check on those who are self-isolating at home. Local police forces will retain the enforcement powers. Almost two-thirds of the more than 3000 cases of coronavirus recorded in Australia are among people who have returned from overseas. A significant percentage of the remaining cases are believed to have been transmitted to others by returned overseas travellers. There are still about 7000 travellers returning to Australia each day, despite closed borders and mass flight groundings. That number is down on about 48,000 at the same time in 2019. NSW Health confirmed 186 new coronavirus infections on Friday, bringing the state’s total number of cases to 1405. Of that, another 41 cases were confirmed in people who were aboard the Ruby Princess, meaning 162 of NSW’s total infections are from that cruise ship. Earlier this week, NSW Health said another 26 people on the Ruby Princess had tested positive and were interstate. That means the total number of infections that can be linked to the cruise is almost 200. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said on Friday afternoon that state had 574 cases of coronavirus, up 54 from Thursday. Of those 22 are in hospital, three of them in intensive care. “One of the highest risk groups is those travelling back to Australia or, in our case, back to Melbourne, having been overseas,” he said. “It almost does not matter what country they come from. This is running so wildly rampant in a number of other countries that if you have been in international airports and are returning from anywhere, really, you are an unacceptable risk if we just let you go about your business.” He said returning travellers would no longer be able to self-isolate on an “honesty basis”. Victoria has 5000 hotel rooms on standby for returning Australians. “It is a big step to take away someone’s liberty and make them go to a certain place and stay there for two weeks but this is life and death,” Mr Andrews said. “There is too much at stake to do otherwise.” Queensland said on Friday it had a total of 555 coronavirus cases, up 62 on Thursday. Australia’s death toll from the virus remained at 13 on Friday afternoon. The most recent was a cruise ship passenger in his 70s who died in Western Australia late on Thursday. Mr Morrison said the new quarantine measures were tough but insisted they were necessary and non-negotiable. He urged Australians wanting to fly home to do so as quickly as possible, given countries are rapidly closing their borders as the deadly disease continues to spread. “It won’t be too long before it will be very difficult to get back into Australia,” he said. The states and territories will shoulder the cost of quarantine in hotels. That means NSW will have the greatest burden, as it has the most arrivals. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus fires up production at Australia's only medical mask factory","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/medical-mask-factory\/","transcript":"The factory floor is frantic inside Australia’s only medical mask manufacturing company. “We were making about maybe 2 million masks a year and all of a sudden now we’re potentially looking at, with added machines, making as much as 50 million masks a year,” Med-Con CEO Steve Csiszar told 7.30. Before the coronavirus outbreak his small business supplied about 5 per cent of the Australian market from its factory in Shepparton in Victoria. “Our staffing is approximately 17 people but with what’s happened now it’s been a total upheaval,” Mr Csiszar said. “We’re hiring people by the day, machines are running 24\/7 and we’ve never seen so much activity in Shepparton.” As the scale of the coronavirus became apparent, the Federal Government approached the company to see if it was in a position to make millions of medical mask as quickly as possible. “We explained our situation, we explained our limitations of our current resources,” Mr Csiszar said. “We only had two machines operational, we had a third machine mothballed, and we only had two trained operators.” Mr Csiszar and the Government worked out a way to quickly increase production by deploying 14 Australian Defence Force personnel to the factory three weeks ago. “It almost looks like an army barracks now,” he said. “We’ve got army personnel in there, we’ve got guys on the floor who are actually very highly trained soldiers, some of them are electrical engineers. “Actually they’re running them very, very well at the moment. “I wish I could keep them forever, they’re fantastic, but that’s not the goal. The goal is to get local employment going.” Now the factory has the capacity to make more masks, the biggest hurdle is getting enough raw materials from overseas. “There are no raw material supplies in Australia of this type so that is a big problem,” Mr Csiszar said. The countries that Med-Con would normally order supplies from are holding onto their stocks for domestic use. “They’re very reticent about letting us have some. “We’ve got the embassies working on our behalf to go to the manufacturers in the respective countries and trying to get them to release materials.” Mr Csiszar said there were 10 12-metre containers of raw materials on the way to the factory. Med-Con has been operating in Australia for decades but was only supplying a very small percentage of Australia’s medical industry due to competition from China. “We need to have more industry here so we don’t face this situation again, particularly if it happens in the future,” Mr Csiszar said. “Easily the bulk (of PPE) would be coming out of China and the centre for China as a manufacturer actually happens to be Wuhan, where the whole thing started.” There are currently severe shortages of Personal Protective Equipment worldwide. The prices of masks and gowns have surged since the virus outbreak. “We have a lot of experience going back 30 years … all sorts of PPE products that over time have stopped being made primarily because Australia wasn’t competitive,” Mr Csiszar said. “But we can ramp up all those processes — we can make gowns, we can make all sorts of products.” Last week, the Federal Government issued a request for companies around Australia to come forward if they could help produce PPE. Australia’s capacity to produce more equipment locally will now be mapped. More than 130 companies have come forward so far. “I’d like to think that we alone could do it but that’s not the case,” Mr Csiszar said. “I think you probably need a few people doing it because you just need the security that if someone goes down you’ve got someone else there to back them up.” In a statement, the Federal Government told 7.30 it continues to purchase supplies of PPE as part of the National Medical Stockpile to ensure support of essential health services. “The Government is working with international and in-country suppliers to continue to increase PPE supplies in the short and long term and has already sourced over 400 million surgical masks and a range of other PPE supplies,” the Department of Health said in a statement. Mr Csiszar hopes that once the pandemic passes, local manufacturing will continue to be supported. “I think people need to be cognisant of the fact that we need Australian manufacturing and when the drama and this virus calm down, not to forget about us,” he said. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cruise ship passengers will be flown back to Germany","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/cruise-ships-coronavirus-wa\/","transcript":"Hundreds of people stranded on a cruise ship off Perth will be evacuated to Germany within days, although seven passengers with coronavirus will likely be treated locally. Most of the almost 832 passengers onboard the German-owned Artania will be dispatched to Frankfurt on charter flights. “By the end of the weekend, nearly all of them will be evacuated on three planes back to Germany,” Senator Mathias Cormann told Sky News on Friday. Seven people – five guests and two crew members – have been infected with coronavirus and have mild symptoms. Senator Cormann indicated they would receive medical care in Australia. “Some appropriate arrangements will be put in place locally, again, in close coordination and consultation between the federal and state governments,” he said. The Western Australian government has been insisting the Commonwealth manage the people from the cruise ship. Premier Mark McGowan has also called on the Navy to move the Artania out of Australian waters. One ill person, who does not have coronavirus, was taken off the liner on Thursday for medical treatment. The hundreds of passengers who will be returned to Germany this weekend will be allowed to take only one piece of luggage, and will be accompanied by company tour guides. The company said they would be transported to Frankfurt, but those who were not German would need confirmed onward journeys. “In order to be able to organise this, we are in contact with the respective embassies or consulates,” it said. The Artania was allowed to dock in Fremantle on Friday morning after a second person became unwell with an unrelated illness. No one else has disembarked from the ship. There are no Australians on the vessel or on a second cruise ship, the Magnifica, that is anchored off Fremantle. It has no coronavirus cases among the 1700 people on board. About 200 locals onboard the Vasco da Gama will next week go into quarantine on Rottnest Island for 14 days. About 600 other Australians will likely return to their home states. “We would prefer they go home and self-isolate in their home state,” Mr McGowan said. The Vasco da Gama had been due to berth on Friday, but that has been delayed until Monday. The WA government wants all foreigners, including 108 New Zealanders, to remain on board the cruise ship until they can fly home. But Dean Brazier, managing director of the ship’s owner Cruise and Maritime Voyages Australia, said all those on board held visas to live in either Australia or New Zealand.

Mr Maduro and his top lieutenants ran a “narco-terrorism partnership” with leftist Colombian guerrilla group FARC for the past 20 years, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said. “The scope and magnitude of the drug trafficking alleged was made possible only because Maduro and others corrupted the institutions of Venezuela and provided political and military protection for the rampant narco-terrorism crimes described in our charges,” he said on Thursday (local time). Venezuala’s defence minister and chief Supreme Court judge were among the officials charged. The State Department offered a reward of up to $US15 million ($A25 million) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Maduro, who has been in power since 2013. Mr Maduro already faces US sanctions and has been the target of a US effort aimed at pushing him from power. Venezuela’s information ministry did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.  US officials have long accused Maduro and his associates or running a “narco-state”, saying they have used drug trafficking proceeds to make up for lost revenue from a Venezuelan oil sector heavily sanctioned by the United States.

Clapping, banging pots and pans, cheering and waving at neighbours with whom they are no longer able to shake hands because of the national lockdown, vast numbers of people took part in the “Clap for carers” initiative – which mirrors similar events in other countries. Sporting and entertainment venues – including London’s Royal Albert Hall and the National Theatre – were among dozens of landmarks that lit up in blue across the British capital in tribute to the NHS logo, as the mass applause kicked off at 8pm on Thursday (local time). The movement was widely spread on social media and called on people across the country to deliver a round of applause in appreciation for doctors, nurses, and all those tackling the COVID-19 outbreak. Among those to respond were Prince William and Kate Middleton. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge shared a rare video of their three children to their Instagram. It shows Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis side by side, clapping and smiling to show their thanks for those at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his next-door neighbour, Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, also joined the national applause from the front of 10 Downing Street. In a video posted on his Twitter page, Mr Johnson thanked NHS staff and said the government would support them “in any way that we can”. Mr Sunak then said: “Whatever you need, that’s what you’re going to get.” Britain is battling a devastating spread of coronavirus. On Friday (Australian time), its coronavirus death toll rose from 475 to 578, and there were 11,658 confirmed cases. More ominously, the BBC reports that it was the first time COVID-19 deaths had risen by more than 100 in a single day. Prince William’s father, Prince Charles, 71, tested positive for the virus earlier this week. He is said to be suffering only minor symptoms and is in self-isolation with the Duchess of Cornwall. Charles posted his own video to social media, showing him and his wife Camilla clapping from separate rooms in self-isolation at their Scottish home, Birkhall.

Police from Thursday were given the power to hand out on-the-spot fines of $1000 to individuals and $5000 to businesses that breach public health orders or ministerial directions. It hasn’t taken long for concerned citizens to dob in their neighbours for doing the wrong thing, with NSW Police receiving about 600 calls in just two days. “I gave a clear warning that the time for cautioning people over not adhering to self-isolation was over,” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told reporters in Sydney on Friday. Among those who have been fined already are staff from a Sydney massage parlour, and a 65-year-old woman from Lake Macquarie. “What’s disappointing is this lady had a caution on Monday to self-isolate, yesterday she was found walking around the streets – $1000 fine,” Mr Fuller said. He says before the new powers were introduced, Crime Stoppers had received 200 calls about people ignoring restrictions. “Since then, that has gone up to 800, (with) 600 calls in two days,” Mr Fuller said.

New figures mapping out the local government areas with the most infections show NSW and Victoria council areas with higher income levels have been hardest hit by the pandemic. In NSW, Waverley Council in Sydney’s eastern suburbs has recorded the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases. The council, which includes Bondi Beach, has 105 coronavirus cases. The City of Sydney, which spans the CBD and inner suburbs, has recorded 69 cases. The Northern Beaches and Woollahra areas, located on the Pacific and home to many mansions, have recorded 68 and 66 cases respectively. In Victoria, Stonnington Council is the most affected with 57 cases. Encompassing Toorak and South Yarra, it is one of the richest areas in Australia. Mornington Peninsula is second, with 36 cases, City of Melbourne is next with 32 and Boroondara – which includes Kew and Hawthorn – with 29.  The City of Melbourne’s higher number of cases could also be partly due to the large number of students living within the area’s boundary. Glen Eira has 26 cases and Port Phillip has 25 cases. In Queensland, Brisbane and the Gold Coast have by far the largest number of cases. Brisbane’s metro north region topped the list with 144 cases followed by metro south with 123. The Gold Coast has 91 and Sunshine Coast 56. West Moreton, which includes Ipswich, has 17 cases. But it’s not just the wealthier neighbourhoods that have seen higher numbers of COVID-19 cases. In NSW, the Central Coast, Canterbury-Bankstown, Sutherland Shire, Ryde, Randwick, Blacktown and Hornsby councils have all recorded more than 30 cases. In Victoria, Moreland and Greater Geelong councils all have more than 20 cases. NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said the government was “looking very closely” at the impact of Monday’s shutdowns on pubs, cinemas and churches. If they weren’t sufficient, further action would be taken. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the full effect of the second stage of shutdowns – in place from Thursday – wouldn’t be known for some days.

Kathmandu had already closed stores in regions including Brazil, Europe, New Zealand and North America. The board has suspended dividend payments to shareholders. Senior executives will have their pay cut by 20 per cent. Football Federation Australia also stood down staff on Friday. Just three days after confirming the suspension of the A-League until at least April 22, FFA chief executive James Johnson said the organisation would stand down 70 per cent of its employees – about 160 people. Mr Johnson said a handful of staff would stay on to maintain operations and communication with the community. “We view this as a temporary stoppage of football,” he said. The FFA, Kathmandu and Adairs employees join tens of thousands of Australian workers stood down from their jobs without pay in the economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. On Thursday, Premier Investments – which owns the Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans and Just Jeans stores – stood down 9000 workers around the world. “This is the hardest decision ever made by Premier – our team are our family and we want to do everything we can to keep them employed, but we believe that it is necessary and the right decision for them, their families, our customers, and the country,” Premier chief executive Mark McInnes said. Jewellery chain Lovisa and Athlete’s Foot owner Accent Group on the same day temporarily closed 400 shops and 500, respectively. Accent, which also owns the Platypus and Hype shoe chains, will stand down a reported 5000 staff. Mosaic Brands – the owner of Noni B, Rivers and Katies – has said it will stand down 6800 employees in 1300 shops, while Michael Hill Jewellers is pulling down the shutters on 300 outlets, including 165 in Australia. The travel industry has also suspended huge numbers of workers. Qantas has stood down 20,000 of its 30,000 workers, and Virgin Australia has done the same for 8000 workers. Virgin has also flagged more than 1000 redundancies. Flight Centre says an initial 6000 of its global sales and support staff globally will either be stood down or made redundant. In rare bright spots, supermarkets are among the few companies hiring workers. Woolworths will take on 20,000 staff to meet a surge in demand, and Coles has said it will hire 5000. “We’re working with a number of customer-focused businesses impacted by recent government measures to stop the spread of COVID-19,” Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said. On Friday, Woolworths said it had placed about 3000 of its stood-down ALH Group team members in new roles across its supermarkets and alcohol outlets BWS and Dan Murphy’s.

Mr Cormann says the federal government will announce alternative stimulus measures within the next few days. Business and unions have urged the government to consider UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s 80 per cent wage subsidy aimed at keeping people employed during what could be a prolonged coronavirus crisis. Queensland’s Deputy Premier Jackie Trad is joining has joined the call for the Australian government to pay the wages of workers as claim for unemployment benefits skyrocket. “If we don’t have a compassionate and effective way to respond to this, as opposed to the long queues outside Centrelink … then I’m afraid there’s going to be huge amounts of social dislocation,” Ms Trad told the ABC on Friday. It’s not hard. The UK, Germany and New Zealand can manage it, why can’t Australia? Australians are just as deserving, and equally in need. There’s not a minute to waste, we need a wage subsidy now. — Andrew Giles MP (@andrewjgiles) March 26, 2020  But the Australian government has repeatedly baulked at the idea. “No, we will not look at a UK-style system because in an Australian context that just wouldn’t work,” Senator Cormann told Sky News on Friday. He said the country was looking at six months of economic disruption from COVID-19, so support needed to get to people “as quickly as possible”. “If we came up with a completely different system, a completely different approach and had to start up a system from scratch it would take us way too long to get that into the community.” But he said the government continued to assess ways to improve levels of income support, while further expanding support and incentives for business to hold on to staff. “We would expect an announcement in the next few days,” he said. A survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released on Thursday, showed almost half of all Australia’s businesses have felt the impact of the coronavirus and four out of five expect to be hit in coming months. Thousands of workers have already lost their jobs in the past week alone as the impact of virus bites. The hospitality, travel and retail sectors have had the bulk of the casualties with outdoor leisure equipment Kathmandu adding to the dole queues on Friday by standing down 2000 workers. Other outdoor retailers are likely to follow suit. Labor has been particularly critical of the length of time improved unemployment benefits are getting into people’s hands under the government’s current stimulus package. The coronavirus supplement – paid at a rate of $550 per fortnight – will effectively double the JobSeeker payment, which recently replaced the Newstart allowance. But the supplement won’t reach sacked workers until April 27. The second payment won’t be paid until July 10, while pensioners and families will have to wait 16 weeks for the payment. Senator Cormann defended the timetable, saying making payments of this magnitude to so many people is a significant logistical exercise. “We have got to make sure we get this right,” he said. “Logistics is what is driving the timetable … we are working as fast as we can and we are working to the tightest possible deadlines.” –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"US has world's highest number of coronavirus cases","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/us-coronavirus-worst\/","transcript":"Confirmed coronavirus cases in the US topped 81,000 on Thursday, more than any other country and overtaking both Italy and China. Official figures showed the US had 81,378; China has 81,285, and Italy is third with 80,539 cases. Worlwide, there are now more than 500,000 coronavirus cases. The US’s grim tally includes at least 1178 deaths and comes after the country’s deadliest day since the beginning of the pandemic, when 223 people died on Wednesday (local time). The figures come from The New York Times, which has been monitoring confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Official reported numbers have skyrocketed since last week, when coronavirus tests were made more easily available for Americans. The rise comes as New York, New Orleans and other hot spots face a surge in hospitalisations and looming shortages in supplies, staff and sick beds. New York, with 37,000 confirmed diagnoses and 1290 people fighting for their lives in intensive care, is the epicentre of the American outbreak. There are also fears for other states, including California and Washington. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said an expected shortfall of ventilators – machines that support respiration for people who have lost the ability to breathe on their own – was substantial, as a surge of cases overwhelms hospitals. “Any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare system,” he said. “The number of ventilators we need is so astronomical – it’s not like they have them sitting in the warehouse. There is no stockpile available.” At least one New York hospital has begun a trial of sharing single ventilators between two patients. Dr. Craig Smith, surgeon in chief at New York-Presbyterian\/Columbia University Medical Centre in Manhattan, told staff teams had worked “day and night” to get the split-ventilation experiment going. Neighbouring New Jersey is another hotspot, with 6876 cases – 2000 new on Friday (Australian time) – and 81 deaths. Asked about guidelines for allocating ventilators to patients in case of a shortage, Governor Phil Murphy was blunt: “We have to hope for the best, but plan for the worst.” Elsewhere, Forbes magazine reported on Friday that New Orleans had the world’s fastest rate of growth in new coronavirus cases and might become the pandemic’s next epicentre⁠. Mardi Gras celebrations last month are believed to have fuelled the local outbreak. Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans hospitals would struggle to manage their patient loads into April. He said Louisiana, which has about 1800 infections, including at least 83 deaths, is rapidly running out of beds and ventilators. The expanding pandemic comes as President Donald Trump insists the US lockdown should end in time for Easter so the economy can restart. “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” he has tweeted. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Pack your own bags, use tap-and-go, Coles tells shoppers","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/27\/coles-bags-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Coles wants shoppers to pack their own groceries to help limit the spread of coronavirus. The supermarket giant has written to customers with a new set of rules aimed at keeping its stores safe for shoppers and staff. People have been told they must not enter stores if they are sick, and should handle their own bags and pack their own groceries to limit the risk of spreading the virus. They have also been asked to wash or sanitise their hands before entering stores and shoppers must stay 1.5 metres away from others at all times. Special directions will be provided at checkouts to make sure people in queues don’t get too close together. The retailer is spending an extra $1 million a week on extra cleaning and security guards, with special attention paid to sanitising high contact surfaces including trolleys, baskets, and checkout areas. And customers are being encouraged to pay via tap-and-go. Masks and gloves are not being recommended for shopping, in line with health department advice. Bakery departments are also making changes, with items including bread baked on site to be pre-wrapped to ensure products are not contaminated. “Finally, we’ll be regularly rotating our teams on checkouts throughout the day to help keep everyone safer,” Coles said in a letter to customers on Friday. “Please respect the guidelines we’re putting in place as your health and safety remains a priority to us.” The moves are being mirrored across the retail industry. Bunnings has announced it is providing its staff with gloves and sanitiser and will increase in-store cleaning for counters, trolleys and baskets.

NSW and Victoria are pushing for stage-three lockdowns that would mean all non-essential workers would need to stay home, except for grocery shopping, medical needs and outdoor exercise. Premiers Gladys Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews have already indicated they could move ahead of the federal government if necessary. However, top health officials say it could be a week until the effect of a second wave of shutdowns, which began on Thursday, reduces case numbers. Prime Minister Scott Morrison joined US President Donald Trump and other members of the G20 through a video link-up overnight. The leaders have struck a deal to co-ordinate efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, collectively pledging $A7.5 trillion to kickstart the global economy. The number of confirmed cases in Australia has risen to about 3000. Health experts are begging Australians to stay at home if they are sick and to keep their distance from other people even if they’re healthy. Professor Brendan Crabb, an infectious disease researcher and director of Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, believes further stages of containment “need to be taken immediately” and imposed for two to six weeks. This is not radical, it’s mainstream pandemic action – @WHO It’s our best chance of keeping infections very low, and of protecting our vulnerable populations and health workers And it’s our best chance of getting society up and running in the shortest possible time https:\/\/t.co\/luiZC9i3uM — Brendan Crabb (@CrabbBrendan) March 26, 2020  “The reason being that at this point in time, it’s all we’ve really got, quite a blunt instrument – lockdown,” he told ABC Radio on Thursday. He said the number of cases needs to remain “at an extremely low level”. “I would recommend we pull every suppression lever we have now,” Professor Crabb said. “That means not just flatten the curve, but bend the curve down to a very low level … and then you come out of that.” Labor has urged the government to put tougher measures in place, with deputy leader Richard Marles saying current steps weren’t enough to stop exponential growth in cases. “That is a recipe for being behind the game,” he told the Nine Network on Friday. The Greens are pushing for a full lockdown. But the government says it doesn’t want to rush into tighter measures, given strict restrictions were put in place just days ago. Senior health official Michael Kidd has reminded Australians to be “absolutely scrupulous” with washing their hands, to keep 1.5 metres away from others and to stay at home when sick. “Everybody has to do their part in making sure that we are protecting each other, and especially protecting the most vulnerable people in our society,” Professor Kidd told ABC News. Australia has tested more than 178,000 people and deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says the rate of positive tests is low, at about 1.5 per cent. Three Victorian men and one from Western Australia, all aged in their 70s, were confirmed on Thursday as Australia’s latest fatalities. Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia joined Victoria and the ACT in moving school holidays forward to give teachers time to switch to online learning. Teachers will still be at schools so parents who have essential jobs, such as healthcare workers and supermarket shelf-stackers, can send their children. But all other students are being asked to stay home. Professor Kelly says millions of masks are expected to arrive in Australia over the coming months. The nation has already had two waves of business closures this week – leading to thousands losing their jobs – in a bid to stop people gathering in large numbers or in closed spaces. Thousands more businesses were shuttered on Thursday and many large retailers stood down staff and closed stores voluntarily. NSW and Victorian leaders are foreshadowing further moves, potentially including full statewide lockdowns, if the increase in new cases doesn’t slow. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Youngest royals lead video tribute to healthcare workers","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/royal\/2020\/03\/27\/george-charlotte-video-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Prince William and Kate Middleton have shared a rare video of their three children giving a round of applause for health and emergency workers battling the deadly coronavirus pandemic. The clip – posted to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 11 million Instagram followers on Friday morning (Australian time) – shows Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis side by side, clapping and smiling to show their thanks for those at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19 around the world. “To all the doctors, nurses, carers, GPs, pharmacists, volunteers and other NHS staff working tirelessly to help those affected by #COVID19: thank you,” the post reads. The video, which is part of a British social media campaign called “Clap for our carers”, is a rare glimpse of the three Cambridge siblings – six-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, 4, and Prince Louis, who turns two in April.

The video is thought to have been shot in the garden there. Britain is battling a devastating spread of coronavirus. On Friday (Australian time), its coronavirus death toll rose from 475 to 578, and there were 11,658 confirmed cases. More ominously, the BBC reports that it was the first time COVID-19 deaths had risen by more than 100 in a single day. Last weekend, Kate and William visited an NHS centre in south London to show their support for emergency workers, and highlight the work being done during the coronavirus pandemic. They heard non-emergency calls to the centre had risen four-fold since the outbreak began – up to 25,000 a day across London alone. Emergency calls in Britain have also doubled to nearly 8000 a day.  Catherine and I were proud to visit staff working at NHS 111, to pass on our personal thanks, along with those of my grandmother and father, to staff working around the clock to provide care and advice to those that need it most. • The last few weeks, and more recent days have been understandably concerning with the continuing spread of coronavirus. • But it’s at times like this when we realise just how much the NHS represents the very best of our country and society – people from all backgrounds and walks of life with different experiences and skills, pulling together for the common good. • Not only are NHS staff and emergency workers responding to the needs of the public, they – like the rest of us – are concerned about their families, friends and loved ones. • They need our support as much as we need theirs. • All of us have a part to play if we’re going to protect the most vulnerable. • That means acting on the latest expert advice, staying home if we or those we live with have symptoms, and avoiding non-essential contact to help reduce the spread of the virus. • — The Duke of Cambridge A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Mar 20, 2020 at 10:59am PDT  Meanwhile, Prince William’s father, Prince Charles, 71, tested positive for the virus earlier this week. He is said to be suffering only minor symptoms and is in self-isolation in Scotland, with the Duchess of Cornwall. The Queen and her 98-year-old husband, Prince Philip, are at Windsor Castle. The 93-year-old monarch left London for her Easter break a week early after the British government said the spread of COVID-19 in the capital was weeks ahead of the rest of the country. “It is likely the Queen will stay there [at Windsor Castle] beyond the Easter period,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Woolies to hire 20,000 workers amid virus panic buying | The New Daily","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-woolworths-jobs\/","transcript":"Up to 20,000 jobs are up for grabs as Woolworths takes on workers across Australia to keep up supplies of food and drink during of the coronavirus outbreak. The roles in its supermarkets, e-commerce, supply chain and drinks businesses are expected to be filled in the next month. “These are uncertain times for many industries and we have an important role to play keeping Australians employed through this crisis,” Woolworths Group CEO Brad Banducci said in a statement on Friday. “These new roles will not only help us better serve the increase in demand we’re seeing in stores right now but also allow us to scale up home delivery operations in the months ahead.” The new jobs will be welcome news for the thousands of Australian, mainly in the hospitality and retail sectors, who were laid off last week. However, Woolworths said its immediate focus would be to redeploy its ALH workers impacted by this week’s mandatory hotel closures. Some 3000 people have already been placed into new roles across BWS, Dan Murphy’s and Woolworths supermarkets. Woolworths also plans to offer up to 5000 short-term roles to Qantas employees taking leave without pay, including more than 1500 in its distribution centres. As well, Woolworths has set up a streamlined application process for “thousands” of short-term roles for displaced workers from Village Entertainment, Michael Hill Jewellers, Cotton On, Accor and Super Retail Group. “We’re working with a number of customer-focused businesses impacted by recent government measures to stop the spread of COVID-19,” Mr Banducci said.

It comes as the Australian cabinet prepares to convene on Friday morning to consider rent and tax relief measures to help businesses and the unemployed amid a crippling retail shutdown. Prime Minister Scott Morrison joined US President Donald Trump and other members of the G20 in a video link-up overnight Friday. In a communique issued on Friday morning (Australian time), Mr Morrison and other leaders described the pandemic as “a powerful reminder of our interconnectedness and vulnerabilities”. “This virus respects no borders,” they said. “Combating this pandemic calls for a transparent, robust, coordinated, large-scale and science-based global response in a spirit of solidarity.”  The number of people infected with coronavirus has reached 500,000 as economies around the world reel from the impact of widespread lockdowns. Italy has shut down most of its industry, and a record-shattering 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits in a single week. In India, where the country’s 1.3 billion people were under orders to stay home, legions of poor were suddenly thrown out of work, and many families were left struggling for something to eat. The virtual summit was called by Saudi Arabia, which is chairing the forum this year. G20 finance, health and trade ministers are set to meet in coming weeks to develop specific action plans to deal with the economic and health impacts. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres told the leaders they needed a war-time plan. “It took the world three months to reach 100,000 confirmed cases of infection,” he said. “The next 100,000 happened in just 12 days. The third took four days. The fourth, just one and a half. “This is exponential growth and only the tip of the iceberg.” International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva asked G20 leaders for their backing to double the fund’s $US50 billion ($A84 billion) emergency financing capacity. She said vulnerable households and businesses need targeted financial support to stay afloat and get back to work quickly. Financial help could soon be on the way for renters as the federal government discusses the idea of income tax cuts for landlords. It’s hoped that will encourage other landlords who are not already doing so to offer lower rents to businesses that are under financial pressure due to the coronavirus pandemic. Labor has further called for a freeze on all evictions during Australia’s coronavirus shutdown as thousands of people lose their jobs. There are concerns if people are kicked onto the street it will not only impact on the lives of families but make containment of the virus much more difficult. Banks have already offered freezes on mortgage repayments while energy companies are being urged to show compassion on unpaid bills, with Australians facing unemployment due to businesses closing. Some landlords are offering discounts on rent to tenants who are under financial pressure. Retail mogul Solomon Lew stood down 9000 staff as he declared his businesses would not be paying rent on commercial premises. The billionaire holds a 43 per cent stake in Premier Investments, which runs outlets including Smiggle, Just Jeans and Peter Alexander. Premier said it was shutting all of its stores down for a month, saying it was the “right decision” for its employees and the country. The three states where the coronavirus is most widespread have revealed the areas which have recorded the highest number of infections. Almost 30 per cent of Queensland’s coronavirus cases have been found in Metro North, which occupies Australia’s largest hospital service. The Metro North Public Health Unit is managing the greatest number of infections in Queensland – 144 of the state’s 493 coronavirus diagnoses. Meanwhile, Waverley Council in Sydney’s eastern suburbs has recorded the most confirmed coronavirus cases in New South Wales. The local government area has had 105 cases of COVID-19 out of NSW’s total of 1219 cases, data published on NSW Health’s website shows. The Sydney LGA has recorded 69, while Northern Beaches and Woollahra have recorded 68 and 66 cases respectively. The number of NSW coronavirus cases jumped on Thursday to 1219, a rise of 190 on the previous day. There has been at least one coronavirus case confirmed in 54 of Victoria’s 79 local government areas. At 57 cases, Stonnington leads with the highest number of infections, followed by the Mornington Peninsula (36), City of Melbourne (32), Boroondara (29), Glen Eira (26) and Port Phillip (25). -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Worried about coronavirus I tried social distancing. Here's why it failed.","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-social-distancing-stay-home\/","transcript":"We desperately need to avoid a COVID-19 catastrophe. The good news is, we can. Besides washing our hands and not touching our faces, we need to take seriously the guidelines for social distancing. Those two words have come with a lot of confusion (it seems last weekend many Sydneysiders thought it meant hitting the beach with a few hundred new best mates). To show why the rules are so important, I spent last week trying to do it seriously – and to show how many people you can come into contact with even while armed with sanitiser and a determination not to touch anyone. Last Monday, I started recording how many people I had contact with, and how many each of those people had gone near. There were some parameters – they needed to have touched or been in close physical proximity to them. In other words, close enough to pass on a deadly virus. The odds were stacked against me. There are five of us at my place, and two of those have partners. It’s a big place, but seven people are regularly sharing the space. Day one I didn’t leave the house, or really the couch if I’m being honest. I did some washing, went for a run. I was doing well until one housemate invited a friend for dinner – the friend had worked all day at a cafe. I had woken up thinking my social distancing number would hit five. When I went to bed it was already 25 (potentially more). Fine, I’ll go to the country, I thought. Just me, two mates and a whole heap of non-coronavirus-infected surfaces. Tuesday last week they picked me up. One had been with five people, the other with one – that took the tally to 33. It wasn’t going well. But the clean air proved good for my building anxiety and good for my number. Include the fix-the-gas guy who visited briefly, and I stayed on 34. On the way back to Melbourne on Friday, I met my parents for lunch in a small town cafe. They were about to travel home to Tasmania before the border controls, and depending on how this all goes, I might not see them for a while. So lunch was a risk I was willing to take (and eat). Our waitress told me she had served roughly 75 people before us. Chuck in the 13 people my three family members came in close contact with on that day, and the four people my housemates saw, and I hit 129. I started to feel a bit embarrassed. Taking social distancing seriously was harder than I thought. My hand sanitiser started to make squelching noises. It was running out and so, too, was my confidence. On Saturday my housemates went to their partners’ places and came back having made contact with six people – for all I know, bringing a fresh wave of coronavirus with them. Great. The hand sanitiser was running low. The risky numbers were rising. On Sunday I caught public transport to Sunbury to buy a PlayStation, as rumours of lockdown continued to circulate among my friends. Once the bottle was refilled, I applied my hand sanitiser liberally. I met two people, and their newborn baby, and headed back to my house. I hoped I wasn’t carrying it. ‘Corona and a baby won’t be fun,’ I thought. Then I went for a walk with a mate. Before seeing me she had served more than 100 people at Bunnings. We didn’t hug, we tried not to touch at all, to embrace the new no-contact world instead. But like an extrovert pretending to fit in a hermit’s shell, I made some mistakes. I got too excited. Too close. Her housemate invited me up for dinner and – never one to turn down a free meal – I accepted, and thus my number grew to 238. I had one more day. But my housemates had seen some friends (though they answered my slightly-too-high-pitched questioning with reassurances they had all stayed 1.5 metres away) and I finished the week on 251. I wondered what the point was. Then I read this fact in the The New York Times: If everyone in the world stood 1.5 metres away from each other for two weeks, the hell we’re all going through would be over. And I realised: Social distancing isn’t just going about our normal life and bumping elbows instead of kissing cheeks. For this to work, we actually need to stay at home. I’ve wanted to scream. Because this, here and now in Australia, has only just started. And if we don’t act immediately, it could go on for months. “We know what will happen if we don’t take this seriously,” said Paul Komesaroff, professor of medicine and director, Centre for Ethics at Monash University. “We’ve seen in China and in Italy where one thing leads to another. “So many people became ill simultaneously, the system is overwhelmed. In some cases, people are left to die. “You can’t even have funerals. People are locked down in their homes.” We need to start thinking about social distancing as an act of care, he said.  “Normally, you would give someone a hug, but as a gesture of warmth and loyalty you have to keep physically away from them,” Professor Komesaroff said. Instead of risking it for a biscuit, don’t go over to your friend’s for dinner, skip the lunch date – and please, for all of us, avoid hanging out at the beach. Find other stuff to do. Make a list. Now. Join Houseparty. Drink a beer with friends over video call. Panic-buy a PlayStation (but have it delivered). Re-arrange your bookshelf. Actually read the books. Do what I did and get your housemate to cut you a mullet. (Edit from the boss: Hmm, maybe don’t copy Cait on that one if you have work meetings via Skype). And don’t forget to call your mates. Ring Gran, text mum and dad, FaceTime Karen. “We need to maintain a physical distance from each other without losing the important connection we have. That enables society to function as it does,” Professor Komesaroff said. “It might even bring us close together.” Cait Kelly is a reporter at The New Daily who promises that when the crisis is over, the mullet will be, too"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Can can you catch coronavirus from the mail? And is the post office safe?","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-mail-post\/","transcript":"Around the country, non-essential services have shut down to stop the deadly coronavirus from spreading. Only a handful remain open, including Australia Post. And it has raised a lot of questions. The third most ‘Can I catch coronavirus from …’ styled question Australians typed into Google last week ended in ‘mail’. Australia Post has taken measures to protect its workforce and its customers during the pandemic. You can still go to a post office, but it might just look a little different. Bright tape has been placed on the floor of post offices around the country, guiding customers to stand 1.5 metres apart. In some stores, the staff will be wearing gloves and masks. “In our post offices, we are reminding people to maintain social distancing through signage,” a spokesman told The New Daily. “If needing to pay for anything, our preferred payment method is card. “Obviously though, as we act as a bank for some customers where they do need to come in, they can still complete their banking. “Masks and gloves are a personal decision and our people can wear them should they choose.” Several stores, including the Heathcote Post Office in Victoria, have taken safety precautions further and asked customers to not lean on counters or come in large groups. “To further reduce risk of transmission we ask that you please modify your behaviours to the benefit of the community by not leaning across counters,” management said in a recent announcement. “Couples or families should pick one person only to enter the shop while the rest wait elsewhere. “(And) ensure you have everything you need, are prepared before you come in, and complete your tasks quickly. “This may include completing multiple tasks in one visit, rather than over the course of several visits.” Posties, delivery drivers and post offices will continue to operate across the nation. To date, there have been no confirmed cases in the Australian workforce of more than 80,000 people. To make it safer for customers, self-service terminals at post offices are temporarily closed to ensure customers and staff keep a safe distance from one another. And all parcels – be it at a post office or at a residence – no longer require a signature for delivery or collection. The jury is still out on how long the virus survives on surfaces, but the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have said the likelihood of anyone become infected by their mail is low. WHO has stated that: “The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low, and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low”. Similarly, the CDC has said: “In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures”. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Health said the best defence against the virus on mail and other surfaces is washing your hands. “People can minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from any surface by following good hand hygiene practices and cleaning items where possible,” the spokesperson said. “Hand hygiene means washing hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or rubbing your hands with alcohol-based hand rub for about a minute, immediately after coming into contact with frequently touched surfaces and objects.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus defence plan: Ex-nurses, abandoned hospitals play key role","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-hospitals-nurses\/","transcript":"Retired nurses are pulling on scrubs again and abandoned hospitals are reopening around the nation as Australia boosts its frontline defence to prepare for the worst of the coronavirus crisis. As the number of locally confirmed COVID-19 cases climbs beyond 2420, hospitals are bracing for an influx of patients before the expected peak in May or June. Millions of Australians could become infected, with hundreds of thousands needing medical assistance every day. Already, healthcare workers fear they won’t have enough protective wear, such as masks, or intensive care unit beds to cope with the looming crisis. To help alleviate their stress, dozens of retired nurses and paramedics are offering to come back to work. So far, more than 100 nurses and paramedics in Victoria have put their hands up in response to a callout from the state’s Health Minister Jenny Mikakos. “I would encourage any other healthcare worker who has retired, who hasn’t been practising for some time, to assist us in this challenging time,” Ms Mikakos said. But to accommodate more health workers and patients, we need more hospitals. In South Australia, the state government recently announced it would reopen two decommissioned hospitals to provide an extra 188 beds for coronavirus-infected people requiring treatment. The dedicated facilities at ECH College Grove and Wakefield hospitals were in use up until a few months ago and are expected to be operational by April. Wakefield Hospital will be dedicated to caring for mildly acute COVID-19 patients in a 130-bed facility. In the Victorian town of Warburton, residents and local councillors have been pushing for the state government to reopen the private Warburton Hospital to help treat coronavirus patients. Among the facilities at the decommissioned hospital, which opened in 1910 and has been closed since 2006, are 50 hospital beds, a high dependency unit and a 24-hour emergency department. Campaign leader Daz Nankivell said the hospital, though old, was “well equipped”. “You could have it up and running again within days – all you need are doctors and nurses,” Mr Nankivell told The New Daily. “We need more beds to be able to save more lives. It’s a shame to have all those resources and equipment sitting there not being used.” During Tuesday night’s council meeting, Yarra Ranges councillors unanimously agreed to consider reopening the hospital to treat COVID-19 patients. Councillor Jim Child said the hospital had recently had a $250,000 upgrade before going to market, “so it’s better equipped than ever”. “Reopening it would also take the load off local GPs, who we really need to throw our support behind at this time,” Cr Child said. Eildon MP Cindy McLeish added the hospital would be “ideal” for aged care or rehabilitation services for vulnerable patients. The community’s push to reopen Warburton Hospital is among a growing number of campaigns aimed at recommissioning former hospitals across the country in the fight against the pandemic. In south-west Victoria, a campaign to reopen the former Geelong Private Hospital succeeded this week after a charitable trust came to the rescue. The contribution by Percy Baxter Charitable Trust means 50 new beds costing more than $365,000 will be funded at the hospital. The state government had already allocated $437 million, which will include new beds, additional equipment, funding for emergency departments and intensive care units. The hospital will be recommissioned and will include consulting rooms and virus clinic capacity."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Race to rescue Australians in USA as death toll skyrockets","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/27\/coronavirus-us-flights\/","transcript":"The race is on to repatriate thousands of Australians stuck in the US as cases of coronavirus skyrocket and deaths top 1000, behind only China and Italy.

Australia’s consulate-general in Los Angeles, Chelsey Martin, issued a stark message urging Australians in the US who wanted to return home to not waste any time. Qantas and Virgin Australia are about to cease flights from the US to Australia. United Airlines will continue a limited schedule. “Whatever your circumstances, given the escalating COVID-19 crisis I wanted to reach out and encourage any Australians wishing to go home to do so as soon as possible,” Ms Martin said in a video message posted on the LA consulate’s Twitter page. “After the end of this week, commercial flight options will be incredibly limited. “Qantas’ final scheduled flight is out of LAX (Los Angeles) on Friday, the 27th of March. “Virgin’s final scheduled flight out of LAX is on Sunday the 29th of March. “United Airlines has advised us that they will continue with a limited flight schedule from San Francisco to Sydney in the weeks ahead, but the situation is changing rapidly and I would encourage anyone who is still deciding whether or not they would like to return to Australia, not to delay taking that decision. “These are unprecedented and anxious times for many.” 🇦🇺🇺🇸 A video message from me to all Australians 🇦🇺’s in the South-West US in relation to COVID-19. @dfat @Smartraveller @AusintheUS @healthgovau pic.twitter.com\/uVrckOA9qC — Chelsey Martin (@AusConsulateLA) March 25, 2020 The US is fast becoming a virus epicentre with 75,233 cases and 1070 deaths (Friday morning). Retail shutdowns have also forced a record 3.3 million more people to register as unemployed. New York is the country’s hotspot, with 37,000 confirmed diagnoses and 1290 people fighting for their lives in intensive care. Cases in the bustling metropolis are doubling every three days. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 3.28 million last week from a revised 282,000 the previous week. That eclipsed the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982, the US Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast claims would rise to one million, but estimates have been as high as four million. The jobless blowout was announced shortly after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told NBC the US “may well be in recession”, but progress in controlling the spread of the coronavirus would dictate when the economy could fully reopen. Ms Martin said the LA consulate would remain open “around the clock” to provide consular assistance. Australians were also being urged to follow the consulate on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for information updates. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Evacuation hope for tourists trapped in Peru, with $5000 flight on Sunday","date":"03-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/27\/evacuation-hope-peru-flight-sunday\/","transcript":"The first rescue flight to evacuate hundreds of Australians and New Zealanders trapped in Peru is now set to leave on Sunday, with passengers told to source a face mask or they will not be allowed on board. The Australians will be taken from their hotels under police escort to the flight, which has involved delicate negotiations with Foreign Minister Marise Payne. Confirmation that Peru is preparing to clear the plane to fly despite a national lockdown is good news for dozens of Australians who have secured the one-way tickets for an eye-watering $5000 and business-class seats for $10,000. But hundreds of Australians left behind can’t afford the flights or can’t reach the airport. On Thursday night the travel company organising the flights, Chimu Adventures, confirmed “the paperwork requirements to operate the repatriation flights from Lima and Cusco have now progressed the final stages and departure is looking very positive”. “At this point, we still don’t have detailed timings for the flights, but the paperwork is currently being submitted to the Peruvian authorities for a Sunday (29\/03\/2020) departure,” a Chimu Travel spokesman said. “The Lima flight will depart from the military airport terminal next to the main international terminal in Callao, called Grupo 8. “Lima passengers will be transferred from their place of residence to Grupo 8 on the day via government-sanctioned transfers. “Cusco passengers will be transferred, also via government-sanctioned transfers, to Cusco airport for an earlier flight in order to connect with the main flight from Lima.” But passengers must first obtain a face mask before they are picked up and driven to the airport. “Travellers will also be required to wear a mask for the entire duration of the flight, from collection at their place of residence,” Chimu Travel said. “Chimu will be endeavouring to source some spare masks, but we can’t guarantee at this point that we will be able to get them. “We have asked all travellers to please ensure that they source a facemask for themselves as soon as possible. “Travellers will not be able to board the flight without this. “We are co-ordinating a large number of vehicles to transfer people to the airport, including police escorts and this takes some preparation. “I’d note that there may be a possibility to make some changes to the manifest tomorrow morning Australian time, but this will be done on a “best efforts” basis. “We cannot guarantee any refunds or changes post tomorrow am.” Proposed flights from Buenos Aires will not be proceeding, with all travellers to secure refunds. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack conceded this week that not all Australians from around the world will be able to return home immediately as countries close their borders to fight the coronavirus. Australians trapped in Peru also face a fresh threat, with backpackers in a hostel with a confirmed case of COVID-19 told they can no longer leave, even for food or medical supplies, for the next 30 days. Perth man Mervyn Sng, 26, has told The New Daily that his holiday now feels like “a prison”. Authorities have told him he could be quarantined at his hostel for four weeks, or even longer. That means he will not be able to join any rescue flights leaving the country and could be stuck in Peru for months. “If it didn’t feel like prison before, it’s starting to now,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: What does the pandemic mean for the property market?","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/property\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-property-sales\/","transcript":"The coronavirus pandemic is forcing Australians to stay in their homes, creating a confusing situation for those trying to buy or sell property. For many, their home is more than their castle – it represents the biggest financial asset most people own. As of March, Australia’s residential property market was worth $7.2 trillion, according to the latest ABS data. Established and aspiring home owners are now rightly concerned the coronavirus pandemic could dent this critical market and have a lasting effect on their finances – with economists suggesting prices could fall by as much as 20 per cent if one in 10 Australians lose their jobs. The short answer is yes – there are no restrictions specifically preventing you from buying or selling a home. But that’s not to say sales will progress as normal. The federal government has paused on-site and in-room auctions and banned open house inspections for the foreseeable future. In response, the real estate industry is taking its lead from the thousands of Australians working from home and finding innovative ways to keep the market operational. Potential home buyers would rarely put their money down without inspecting the property first, but social distancing rules will make that a little more complicated. Open inspections have been banned outright for the time being, but agents will still be able to conduct digital tours of the property using videos and live-streaming. And if they like it enough, buyers will still be able to book private inspections – although they must adhere to the government’s social distancing rules. That means standing 1.5 metres apart from others and never having more than one person per four square metres in any given room. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has put a pause on on-site and in-room auctions until the outbreak is under control. But sellers can still sell their homes via virtual auctions. These come in a range of formats, but essentially operate the same way as a normal auction would, with an auctioneer working to get the highest price they can from a group of potential buyers bidding in real time. Instead of being physically present, however, those buyers instead make their bids via their computer or phone. Transactions can still go ahead, but AMP chief economist Shane Oliver cautioned sellers that now is “probably not the best time” to enter the market. “There’s probably not a lot of buyers out there,” he told The New Daily. “I think a lot of selling will dry up too because people will think that now is not the time to move. “People will feel that, given the shutdown, it’s an unnecessary risk to take to participate in property transactions, which involve coming across a lot of people.” With unemployment climbing, Mr Oliver said these factors will push property prices down between 5 and 20 per cent during the coming months. But recent moves from Australia’s major banks – specifically to offer vulnerable customers a pause on mortgage repayments – should ease some of the pressure by limiting the number of forced sales. “Five per cent falls were contingent on a mild rise in unemployment. Twenty per cent was contingent on a bigger rise; a doubling in unemployment,” Mr Oliver said. “The banks have announced payment holidays for people affected by the coronavirus so that might take some of the pressure out, which could lead to price declines being less than 20 per cent even if unemployment gets to 10 per cent and beyond.” As for purchasing property, buyers should weigh up the risks associated with taking on large amounts of debt during an economic downturn."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Why this cat’s hiding place is confusing all of the internet | The New Daily","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/26\/hiding-cat-toys-bed\/","transcript":"Meet Obi the cat.

Government has unveiled a slew of new measures to help businesses endure the coming months and keep paying wages. Not all businesses will be entitled to assistance, though, and the type of help on offer depends on the size of the business. For business owners trying to keep their heads above water, here’s what’s on offer and how to access it. Keeping workers in jobs is a core part of the government’s coronavirus response, and that means plenty of support for employers to help their staff through this difficult period. Eligible businesses will receive wage subsidies in the form of a tax refund paid through the ATO from April 28. This is part of the government’s ‘Boosting Cash Flow for Employers’ program. For businesses that withhold tax on their staff’s salaries and wages, the payment will be equal to the amount of tax withheld – from a minimum payment of $10,000 up to a maximum of $50,000. Businesses that aren’t required to withhold tax on their staff’s wages and salaries will still receive $10,000 if they meet the eligibility requirements. An additional payment will also be introduced “in the July – October 2020 period”, according to the ATO. The second payment will be the same as the first – meaning eligible businesses will receive a cumulative sum of between $20,000 and $100,000, depending on the amount of PAYG tax withheld. Businesses which retain apprentices or trainees are entitled to further wage subsidies, in addition to the cash flow support. From April, these businesses can apply to receive up to 50 per cent of the wage paid to trainees and apprentices between January 1 and September 30, 2020. Employers will be reimbursed that money up to a limit of $21,000 – roughly $7000 per quarter. However, this subsidy will only be available to businesses which employ less than 20 staff. Employers hoping to apply for the subsidy need to speak with an Australian Apprenticeship Support Network provider. Employer support is targeted at small and medium-sized businesses, and not-for-profit organisations, that employ staff and have an annual turnover below $50 million. The payments will only be made to businesses which remain active throughout the coronavirus pandemic (based on their business activity statement lodgings with the ATO). Further, government is only providing support to businesses which were established before March 12, 2020 – although not-for-profits set up after this date will still qualify, in recognition of the fact that some charities have been set up to handle the impact of the pandemic. Not every business employs staff, meaning they won’t qualify for the cash flow or apprentice support payments. For sole traders, the main form of assistance is the fortnightly coronavirus supplement for individuals who lose their job or significant amounts of income. Sole traders can apply for increased Centrelink payments by applying either online or over the phone. Sole traders and workers who lose at least 20 per cent of their hours or revenue will also be able to access $20,000 from their superannuation, however this controversial strategy can cause more problems at retirement. Companies which do not hire staff have access to other measures. These include a temporary increase in the threshold for creditors to start bankruptcy proceedings, and increases to the instant asset write-off. This latter change means businesses can now purchase items they need for their business up to a value of $150,000 each (formerly $30,000), and instantly write that expense off against their profits. To allow more businesses to use this write-off, government is also increasing the eligibility criteria. Previously only businesses with a turnover under $50 million a year could use this strategy, but that cap has been lifted to $500 million. The write-off will only apply however to items first used or installed and ready by June 30, 2020."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"As coronavirus exposes Trump failures, New Yorkers look to ‘new Giuliani’","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-donald-trump-andrew-cuomo\/","transcript":"In 2002, Andrew Cuomo ran for governor of New York State. He was the ambitious son of the legendary three-term governor Mario Cuomo, and was, like his father, a pugnacious and scrappy pol with a tongue both silvery and sharp. It was just months after the 9\/11 attacks, and New Yorkers were still fragile and grieving. One day on a campaign bus, Cuomo declared that his opponent, incumbent Governor George Pataki, was a mere bystander to the heroic leadership of New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the days after the terrorist attacks. “He stood behind the leader,” Cuomo said. “He held the leader’s coat.” Cuomo had politicised a tragedy, and the reaction was swift, brutal and bipartisan. He was forced to abandon his campaign in humiliation, and his political future looked bleak. Eighteen years later, New Yorkers are no less uncertain. In my Greenwich Village neighbourhood, the bars are padlocked and restaurants leave goodbye-for-now letters in their windows. The best bakery on Bleecker Street closed this morning, no longer willing to imperil its workers and customers over loaves of rye. When I walked our dogs last night, there were no traffic noises on Seventh Avenue – just the squeals of rats hiding out underneath parked cars, scurrying forth for dinner amid the kerbside trash. I tell myself I should call the city about the rats, but I figure they’ve got more pressing problems. Into these dire straits strides Governor Andrew Cuomo, long recovered from his 2002 faux pas but never as powerful as he is today. He is the new Giuliani, leading the state through the coronavirus crisis with a steadiness that is dazzling the country. His daily virus updates have become appointment television – an unscripted mix of administrative mechanics, bleak facts, tactical anger, heartfelt empathy, improvisation, family lore, local boosterism, soothing wisdom and epic competence. These daily messages – secular sermons, really – are in vivid contrast to the day’s later programming: The White House Coronavirus update led by President Trump. In those events, Trump mirthlessly and mindlessly cheerleads, touting unproven drugs one day, insulting reporters on another. He is bathed in the adoration of his hired hands, particularly from the obsequious Vice President Mike Pence, who has an uncanny sense of when the First Ego is in need of a deep tissue massage. Trump is a man of limited tools in a fight like this, lacking as he does in any empathy or imagination. And to be fair, trying to buoy Americans in tough times is not easy. But his pep talks are vague and Orwellian. He acknowledges no setbacks or failures. He sees himself as a modern-day Churchill, unaware that before the stirring “never surrender” stuff, Churchill had unflinchingly delivered to Britons the grim truth of the Dunkirk debacle. Trump said on Monday he wants the country back to business by Easter. If you look at his words carefully (always perilous), it’s clear it’s a desire, not a deadline. He was already backing off that claim by Tuesday night, promising to at least keep listening to his medical experts Cuomo could use his daily pulpit to savage Trump – his incompetence, his ignorance, his selfishness, his volatility. But he doesn’t. Instead, he gently prods him, laying out each day what New York needs. That Trump has often failed him is obvious to any viewer. But Cuomo pulls his punches, criticising “the federal government” rather than Trump by name. On Wednesday morning, he took note to compliment Trump by name, noting how responsive he has been. Does Cuomo get everything he wants? No. He has begged for 30,000 ventilators, but received only 4000 from the feds. He was furious, but bit his tongue when it came to Trump. Cuomo has learned – the hard way –that it can be more effective to coo than to criticise. He knows the way to Trump’s federal wallet is through his ego, and complimenting Trump (while still maintaining your dignity) is the way to save his state. We are going to fight every way we can to save every life that we can. That’s what it means to be an American and that’s what it means to be a New Yorker. pic.twitter.com\/1cREWGx9t9 — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) March 25, 2020 So far, Cuomo’s snake-charming is working. “It’s hard not to be happy with the job we’re doing,” Trump crowed on Wednesday, telling reporters Cuomo was “happy” with his co-operation. But history shows Trump may soon sense his comeuppance and take it out on New York and its governor. Or he may act out on what he already knows: That the hardest-hit states are places that didn’t vote for him, so why should he care what happens to them. In times of crisis, that shouldn’t matter. But this is no ordinary president. But until that reckoning, let him keep holding Cuomo’s coat. Just don’t let him know what he’s carrying.

Government has changed the rules to allow hard-working Australians early access to their superannuation balances to help them manage through the coronavirus shutdown. But the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST) has warned that scammers are already trying to exploit the system and steal from needy Australians. “Unfortunately we’ve seen this before with early release super programs,” AIST head of advocacy Mel Birks told The New Daily. “Basically you have unscrupulous operators who take advantage of people in financial hardship.” ACCC data found that scammers stole $1.4 million from Australians in 2018, with super scams playing a significant part in those losses. In total, the ACCC recorded 73 cases of identity theft relating to super that year. Super scams can be particularly devastating as the money stolen would have accrued compounding interest over the life of the account. This means the money scammers take out now could shave off tens of thousands of dollars from Australians’ retirement balances. There are two ways scammers are taking money from super members: Scammers impersonating their targets can directly access members’ accounts and send the early release money to themselves. Those offering to provide a service use the free online myGov portal that members would normally use, but charge them for doing so. Members won’t get their money any faster or easier, but they will wind up with less. “With these scams, it’s either outright fraud or asking for an unnecessary fee,” Ms Birks said. The people running these cons typically sound very professional, friendly and helpful, Ms Birks warned. “It’s not somebody ringing you from a pub, these are quite well developed networks of scammers,” she said. Fortunately for members, several tell-tale signs give them away, and learning what to look for could save members thousands. According to Ms Birks, scammers are already contacting their targets. But the government’s early super access scheme does not start until mid-April, so anyone calling you about accessing your super before then is likely a thief. The kinds of information these people ask for – and how they ask for it – can also provide clues as to their motive. “They’ll typically ask if you’ve been contacted by your super fund yet,” Ms Birks said. “When you say no, they’ll reply ‘well you should have’, and ask for a few details so they can allegedly help you out.” Ms Birks added that members should be wary of anyone asking for their tax file number or trying to pressure them into something over the phone. Both of these are “pretty strong warning signs that something isn’t right”, she said. If you receive one of these calls, ask for the caller’s name, get off the phone, and ring your super fund. If you’ve given your details to possible scammers already, you need to change your myGov details as quickly as possible. You should also report the same to the ATO (13 10 20) or the financial regulator, ASIC (1300 300 630). Both organisations take these matters very seriously and will investigate possible scams to protect others from falling victim. If you’ve lost money, ASIC’s advice is to contact a financial counsellor to get your super back on track."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus and the beach: Here’s what police say you can and can’t do","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/26\/victoria-police-beach-patrol-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Sunny weather is expected in all capital cities this weekend, but before you make plans to go to the beach, you need to know the rules. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases is rising every day in Australia, and it is vital we practise social distancing to slow the disease’s spread. Lives depend on it. Although it may be tempting to take advantage of the sunshine by going to the beach with friends, police are strongly warning against it. And they will be out in full force ensuring we don’t have a repeat of Bondi Beach last week in Sydney, where thousands flocked to lap up the sun and exposed each other to the killer virus. Images of the crowded beach attracted worldwide condemnation and prompted the New South Wales government to seal off the beach completely. Police are determined to make sure it doesn’t happen again. In Victoria, where temperatures are expected reach a top of 25 degrees on Friday and 27 on Saturday, police are considering flying drones over beaches and bays to detect people congregating in groups. The aerial technology will be used to supplement patrol officers scouting beaches on foot for groups of people gathering together on the sand. Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton has urged anyone planning to meet friends at the beach to “do the right thing by each other” and stay home instead. “We do not want to see what happened last weekend in NSW,” Commissioner Ashton told reporters on Thursday. “We absolutely do not want to see large groups of people sitting cheek to jowl on the beach, on their mats, blowing up their blow-up things and getting on them. That’s just ridiculous.” He urged Victorians to “use common sense” as the coronavirus claims more and more lives around the globe. “We’re in a state of emergency,” Commissioner Ashton said. “Going to the beach is a nice thing to do on a hot day. We are not in that situation at the moment. “If you do not need to go out, don’t go out.” Although we are banned from going to the beach with others, for now it is OK to run or walk along the beach by yourself or with someone from your household. But do not move in a group and do not stop and chat to friends. If passing others, keep a distance. Commissioner Ashton said he recognised that some people used the beach “on their exercise route”. “We don’t want to see large groups flocking to the beach and creating a risk of transmission of this disease over the weekend,” Commissioner Ashton said. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"A Perth man in his 70s dies, bringing national COVID-19 toll to 13","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/26\/perth-man-coronavirus-toll-13\/","transcript":"A Western Australian man aged in his 70s has died from the coronavirus on Thursday night, bringing the pandemic’s toll in Australia to 13.

It’s been described by one currency strategist as a fiscal “bazooka”. But with so much money on the line, negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on the exact measures of the bill have been tense. Coronavirus update: Follow all the latest news in our daily wrap The agreement has come after days of dispute, and the bill has just passed the Senate. It still needs to be approved by the US House of Representatives. But some renegades have suggested they might still block it. So we’ve had a look at what the US Government is planning to do and what has been holding it up. It’s been described as the largest rescue package in American history. More than $US2 trillion ($3.3 trillion) will be poured into America’s economy with the aim of trying to save it from the damage inflicted by COVID-19. Just to give you an idea of how much money is at stake in the stimulus legislation, the amount exceeds what the US spends on national defence, scientific research, highway construction and other discretionary programs, combined. Or to put it another way, it is half the size of America’s $US4 trillion annual federal budget. The package includes money to help recently unemployed Americans pay bills, gives emergency loans to small businesses, and increases funding for hospitals, health systems and other health care needs, among other things. But perhaps the biggest measure contained in the bill is a $US500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries with loans, and another fund to provide direct payments of up to $US3,000 to millions of US families. There are some similarities to Australia’s stimulus package, including the payments to furloughed workers. One of the big problems Democrats had voiced over the bill earlier this week was the approximately $US500 billion in funds for loans and loan guarantees for companies, states and others experiencing financial distress. They blocked the legislation and asked for more concessions, arguing that there hadn’t been enough guidelines or oversight to make sure companies used the money appropriately. While Republicans have since agreed to add more oversight, some Democrats are still wary given their experience with the Troubled Asset Relief Program during the 2008 global financial crisis. Back then, banks awarded executives with bonuses after receiving bailout money. It sparked public criticism of the lack of oversight provided in the Government’s bailout measures. So, this time, some have argued they will be pushing to make sure that any corporation receiving assistance under the new legislation “does not lay off workers, cut wages or benefits, ship jobs overseas, or pay workers poverty wages”. Just a reminder that there is absolutely no good reason why Senate Republicans are tying a historic corporate giveaway to getting relief money in the hands of families. They could just authorize sending checks to families today, right now, & deal with the rest. But they refuse. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 25, 2020  While Republicans are keen to limit the economic fallout, Democrats have also said they want to ensure that any bailout for large companies will primarily benefit workers. The proposed stimulus bill is more than 500 pages long. But one passage in the unemployment section has enraged some Republican senators: “The amount determined under subsection (a) shall not be less than $600,” the bill says in the recovery rebate section. That would give all unemployed Americans $US600 (more than $1,000) a week to stay afloat. The current unemployment benefit in the US is about $US385 (or $652) a week. A group of Republican senators initially said they wouldn’t vote for the stimulus package until that section was changed. “This bill pays you more not to work than if you were working,” South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham said. “If this is not a drafting error, then this is the worst idea I’ve seen.” The Republicans said the unemployment proposal would encourage employers to lay people off so they could access the payment. They also believed it would dissuade people from returning to work once the coronavirus crisis subsides. Only in Senator @BernieSanders world does it make sense to pay people more NOT to work than TO work. I am all for making peoples salaries whole. However, I am not for increasing people’s salary through the unemployment insurance system. https:\/\/t.co\/Kc3JfB42TX — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) March 25, 2020  Democrat senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders threatened to block the bill until the Republicans dropped their objections. “I cannot at the last minute allow some right-wing senators to try to undermine the needs of workers and think they are going to get away with that,” he told The New York Times. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dismissed Republican concerns about the unemployment benefit, saying most people will want to keep their jobs. The renegade Republicans backed down, and agreed to vote for the bill. It now heads to the House, where Mr Mnuchin hopes it could be approved as quickly as tomorrow. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has urged her Democratic colleagues to vote in favour of the bill. “Be confident. Be positive.

The New York congresswoman has said she has concerns about the package because it favours corporations over families. It’s hard to say at this stage. When Mr Mnuchin was asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, he replied: “We’ve anticipated three months”. “Hopefully, we won’t need this for three months,” he added. The Government faces a tough task ahead, with the US Federal Reserve’s James Bullard predicting the unemployment rate in America could hit 30 per cent.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced schools will have student-free days from Monday but vulnerable children and the kids of essential workers will still be able to attend. “Next week Queensland schools will move to student free and of course though it is also really important to recognise that schools will remain open,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “It will allow children to remain at school and for teachers to prepare to learn from – prepare to move to learning from home.” The Premier says the directive applies to all schools, not just state schools. More info here: https:\/\/t.co\/7ht0jdRfe3 — Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) March 26, 2020  South Australian schools and pre-schools will also be pupil-free in the week before the Easter holidays, with the state government announcing a move to online learning in term two. The state government said four pupil-free days before Good Friday would give teachers time to prepare to transition to “flexible learning” at the start of term two. However, the teachers’ union has criticised the announcement as “too little, too late”, saying some staff were feeling “terrified” because of the risk to their health. Education Minister John Gardner said schools would remain open in a “modified environment” for the children of parents who have to work, and for vulnerable children. Like Queensland, the measures are expected to apply across the Catholic and independent school sectors. Meanwhile, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has announced term 1 at public schools will finish a week earlier than usual to allow teachers to prepare for classes to move to online. The Premier had previously said that parents were free to choose whether they sent their children to school. The latest announcement means the term will finish at the end of the school day on Friday, April 3, with parents being encouraged to keep their children home from next week. “From now until next Friday, all children who attend public schools will continue to be taught,” Mr McGowan said. “Staff will continue to be on hand to ensure that this can occur. “However, the state government encourages families to keep their children at home if they can access the online or other resources for the education of their children to continue.” Mr McGowan stressed the education system would continue to support families. “I want to reassure parents that our schools are well prepared to continue to provide education for their children,” he said. I know the situation around our public schools has been causing angst for parents, teachers, staff and students. I understand that it may be confusing, but we’ve kept them open, consistent with the best medical advice at hand through the National Cabinet process. pic.twitter.com\/Db4rXQ1fTF — Mark McGowan (@MarkMcGowanMP) March 26, 2020  The decision follows the announcement that private schools across the state will also move to online teaching. All five of WA’s major universities have made accommodations for online learning, with University of Western Australia having moved to a digital campus as of yesterday. Queensland recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus overnight, taking the total to 493, but no one is currently in intensive care. In announcing the student-free move, Premier Palaszczuk said there had been no change to the health advice that’s kept schools open so far. But she said the change was about striking the right balance, including the needs of essential workers and community concerns about the schools-open policy. Vital staff, from healthcare workers to supermarket shelf-fillers, can continue to send their kids to class from Monday. Vulnerable children can also still attend and arrangements will be made to protect high-risk education workers. But parents in non-essential jobs should keep their kids home, and make sure they are learning, not “out and about at shopping centres”, the Premier said. Teachers will use the student-free days to prepare for mass online and remote learning. “We are making it very clear that student-free days mean that teachers are going to be at school. The schools are going to be open,” Ms Palaszczuk told reporters. “We have a lot of frontline workers out there … that actually need to have their students at school.” Education Minister Grace Grace said community kindergartens would also go pupil-free from Monday. But long daycare centres would remain open to ensure vital workers can continue working. WA Education Minister Sue Ellery said schools would supervise children whose parents were continuing to work. She said the following week, in the four days beginning April 6, schools would provide supervision only, not teaching. Ms Ellery said this would give teachers flexibility and time to prepare for how classes could operate in term two. “With significantly less students attending next week, schools will have the flexibility to rearrange classes as appropriate,” Ms Ellery said. “This will reduce some of the pressure. “In the week of the 6th of April, teachers and education assistants and other school staff begin the preparation for what education in a combination of physical school settings and distance and online education will look like in term two.” Western Australia’s move to finish the current term a week early comes after State School Teachers’ Union urged the government to follow Victoria’s lead to shut schools to give educators adequate time to prepare for the next phase of remote learning. Union president Pat Byrne, who had earlier warned teachers were “flying blind” attempting to navigate the pandemic’s challenges, said people were making “huge assumptions” about the ease of setting up online learning. Children do not have equitable access to devices once they are out of the classroom environment, she told West Live host Jenna Clarke. South Australian Mr Gardner said absenteeism across the board had reached 25 per cent and attempts were being made to move towards a remote learning model. However schools will remain open for those families in need, as well as vulnerable students. “It’s very, very challenging to deliver an effective model of education when you’re deal with two cohorts in an in-classroom environment and a learning-from-home environment,” Mr Gardner said. “We are giving these four pupil-free days to ensure that our teachers and our schools can become familiar with the resources we are providing for them. “The message for parents is this – if you are capable of supervising your child at home so they can learn from home, we are now supporting you to do so. “Some of those students are going to be learning from home, some of them are going to be learning at school, supervised, but some of the teachers will be doing the instruction working from home. Some of them will be in the school site. “The model of learning must be consistent across those cohorts.” –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Third Victorian dies from coronavirus as national toll reaches twelve","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-national-toll-twelve\/","transcript":"Victoria has recorded its first coronavirus deaths, with three people succumbing to the virus in less than 24 hours.

Victoria’s total number of confirmed cases has also risen to 520. The number of new cases has decreased slightly, but Professor Sutton said that does not mean the community can become complacent. Professor Sutton also said he had provided “frank and vigorous advice” to Premier Daniel Andrews and the state government about going hard on shutting down parts of the community to curb the spread of the virus. Earlier, Garry Kirstenfield, 68, from Toowoomba, died after receiving treatment in an intensive care unit. Mr Kirstenfield, whose family described him as “kind and adorable”, is believed to have contracted COVID-19 on board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship that docked in Sydney last week. Queensland Health said the man “had a serious underlying medical condition before contracting the virus”. It reports that Mr Kirstenfield’s wife is in self-isolation, together with the rest of his immediate family. He is the second Queenslander to have died after a 77-year-old woman died on March 15 from the virus in Sydney after a flight from the Sunshine Coast.

The footage shows confused crowds of returning travellers being herded close together in long queues that do not meet strict new rules imposed as the virus pandemic spreads. Twitter user Sally Prosser, who posted the footage, who told the ABC it was filmed by a family member. “I just feel like it was a real kick in the guts to everyone out there doing the right thing,” she said. “At the front line, there’s nothing, there’s no one even encouraging people to stand apart.”  Australia’s borders are officially closed to foreign travellers, and Australians cannot travel overseas. However, there are still some flights for Australian citizens and permanent residents returning home as COVID-19 spreads across the world. The public sector union, which represents biosecurity and Australian Border Force officers, said the disturbing scenes in Sydney were due to unplanned and badly communicated changes. Changes introduced on Thursday morning meant every returning passenger is now tested for COVID-19. “The testing space is too small for all passengers, and disembarking is not being staggered to allow for social distancing,” the union said. CPSU deputy national president Brooke Muscat-Bentley said the crowds were a direct failure of government. “It is astonishing that the government is telling the nation to social distance and take the utmost precautions but cannot take steps to assure us at our border,” she said. “This is a failure of planning, just like we have seen with Services Australia this week. The government has known what was coming, but have just been unable or unwilling to prepare for it.” Sydney Airport said in a statement it had since placed security guards in its terminals to “remind people of their obligations”. It said its priority in any crisis was the health and safety of its staff and that of everyone who came to the airport. The footage comes amid a blame game between border force and NSW Health about which was responsible for letting sick passengers off the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney last week. More than 130 passengers from the vessel have tested positive for coronavirus, including a 77-year-old woman who died earlier this week. Another cruise passenger died in Townsville on Wednesday, and two more in Victoria on Thursday – bringing Australia’s coronavirus toll to 11. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has now been given responsibility for controlling and quarantining cruise ships and other vessels. Labor’s Kristina Keneally said that left Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton with questions to answer. “The NSW Police are taking over cruise ship arrivals. Airport queues are violating social distancing rules. The Australian Border Force is getting mixed messages and directions,” she said. “The Minister for Home Affairs needs to get on top of our borders, today.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Introduce stronger coronavirus measures before it's too late, doctors urge","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-measures-doctors\/","transcript":"Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone says it is time for a comprehensive nationwide shutdown, including closing schools and any sectors not actively fighting coronavirus. Dr Bartone said too many Australians were disregarding existing rules, while mixed messaging from governments had brought confusion and anxiety. “It’s clear from all the data that we do need to – because of the lack of consistent messaging, because people have been flouting the earlier advice regarding social distancing measures – that we need to move further and more quickly to ensure that whatever we’re seeing around the world doesn’t mimic and occur in our front doors,” Dr Bartone told the ABC on Thursday.

At 3pm on Thursday (ADST), there were 2793 COVID-19 cases across Australia. However, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth has come out strongly to combat criticism the federal authorities have been too slow to restrict movement and the spread of the coronavirus in Australia. Dr Coatsworth said the effectiveness of ramping up social isolation restrictions was “a contested point”. Echoing comments from fellow deputy CMO Paul Kelly on Wednesday, he said there were “two schools of thought” about how to respond to the outbreak. “The experts around the table of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee do not think that this will be over in weeks if you put in harder and faster measures. So, this is about degrees. We’ve gone hard and fast,” he said. Dr Coatsworth referenced ABC health journalist Norman Swan as putting forward a view at odds with the AHPPC. “I disagree with Norman [Swan] when he thinks that this is going to be over in weeks if we go for harder and faster lockdowns,” Dr Coatsworth said. “I would like Norman to go to Darwin and tell the people of Darwin why they have to stay in their houses when we’re a continent and there’s differential expression of this virus and its impact across the country.” “We’ve gone hard and fast.

Dr Bartone acknowledged that some jurisdictions around the world had not closed schools and managed to have lower and flatter curves than Australia. However, “we also know that they have had much more significant measures when it comes to social isolation and managing the community spread of COVID-19,” he said. On Wednesday, Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said whether or not the government brought in stricter measures depended on how seriously Australians took the current arrangements. But Australian Society of Anaesthetists president Suzi Nou warned the health system would not cope with a massive spike in demand unless more was done to flatten the curve. “We must drive behaviour, and we must move early,” Dr Nou said. “Every day without drastic action from now is likely to result in a more severe and extended crisis, owing to the cruel mathematics of pandemic.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Julian Assange denied bail in UK amid coronavirus pandemic","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/26\/julian-assange-coronavirus-bail\/","transcript":"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been denied bail after his lawyers said he should be released because he was at “high risk” of contracting the coronavirus in prison. The Australian made the application in the Westminster Magistrates Court on Wednesday, with less than 15 people in attendance due to the coronavirus lockdown. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that Mr Assange had absconded before and said that Belmarsh prison is following government guidelines to protect detainees with no confirmed virus cases there yet. She accepted that government advice may change rapidly but for the time being she denied strict bail for the 48-year-old. “As matters stand today this global pandemic does not, of itself, yet provide grounds for Mr Assange’s release,” Judge Baraitser ruled. “In my view there are substantial grounds to believe that if released today he would not return to face his extradition hearing. “There are no conditions that allay this concern and this application is therefore refused.” Defence lawyer Edward Fitzgerald QC wore a face mask and his colleague Mark Summers attended via Zoom, while US government lawyers dialled in. Mr Fitzgerald said Mr Assange has prior chest and tooth infections, and osteoporosis, placing him at a higher risk from the virus. The QC described prisons as “epidemiological pumps” where diseases spread rapidly and said the defence team had recently been denied entry to Belmarsh because 100 prison staff were self-isolating. “If he continues to be detained in prison … there is a real risk that his health and his life will be seriously endangered in circumstances from which he cannot escape,” Mr Fitzgerald told the court. The lawyer also raised the prospect of Mr Assange’s next extradition hearing on May 18 being postponed due to lockdown measures. He said witnesses overseas could be unable to travel and Mr Assange may be unable to meet his counsel in the locked-down prison. Clair Dobbin for the US government, said Mr Assange’s history showed the high risk he would abscond. Mr Assange remained holed up in the embassy for seven years. He was eventually dragged out after Ecuador revoked his asylum. “There are insurmountable hurdles for Mr Assange being granted bail,” Ms Dobbin said. “He has been tested before and failed.” ‘For we wrestle not against flesh & blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places’ Eph 6:12 We fight on for you Julian..#FreeAssange#NoUSExtradition#BringJulianHome pic.twitter.com\/M6NRxjniS8 — Mrs Christine Assange (@MrsC_Assange) March 25, 2020  But Mr Fitzgerald insisted that Mr Assange’s past actions should not be a basis for refusing bail. “The focus of someone in his vulnerable position, with his family ties here, is on survival, not on absconsion,” he said. The defence also revealed that Mr Assange had a partner and at least two children living in the UK. Last month, Mr Assange’s bid to leave the dock and sit with his lawyers in court was also knocked back by Judge Baraitser. The US government is trying to extradite Mr Assange to face 17 charges of violating the Espionage Act and one of conspiring to commit computer intrusion over the leaking and publishing of thousands of classified US diplomatic and military files.

Managing director Michael Schneider said the new measures were designed to ensure nobody missed out on items that were in high demand during the coronavirus outbreak. “As the uncertainty continues, we want to make sure we can reassure customers that if you come to Bunnings you can get the products you are looking for,” Mr Schneider told the Today show. “You can get the things done at home you need to.” Under the new limits, which came into effect on Thursday, Bunnings shoppers will be limited to four items per person for cleaning and storage products, garden sprayers and batteries. There will be also a maximum of one item per customer on generators, gas bottles, respirators or face masks, fuel cans, methylated spirits and turpentine. Mr Schneider said most Bunnings products were still available as usual, although the hardware chain had noted increased demand as restrictions increased with the widening coronavirus pandemic. “We are working closely with suppliers to get stock into stores to meet customer demand and our suppliers have been a huge support in making this happen,” he said. “Our store teams are doing an incredible job looking after our customers and working to get stock onto the shelves as it comes in.” The hardware chain has already ditched its famous sausage sizzles and noted a run on vegetable seedlings and do-it-yourself products as Australians prepare to stay at home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, an exhausted Bunnings worker broke down in tears on Melbourne radio on Thursday while describing the chaos in stores as the COVID-19 pandemic deepens. The employee, identified only as Luke, told Melbourne’s GOLD104.3 that retail employees had been pushed to the limit by customer behaviour during the crisis. “We are run off our feet, we are trying our best – understand that everyone. And, for those that are giving us respect and are being patient, we can’t thank you enough,” he said on Thursday. “I understand people are losing their jobs but there’s no excuse to come in and be rude or think you’re the one that should be served first. “There are lines, there is self-distancing put in place, and you’ve got people that wont respect that.

Motorists queued in bumper-to-bumper traffic for several kilometres on Thursday morning as they tried to cross the NSW-Queensland border at Tweed Heads to the north. Each car must pass through a police checkpoint after Queensland’s border restrictions came into effect on Thursday. There are exceptions for freight and essential travel. However, the border remains open in the other direction. Byron Shire Mayor Simon Richardson wants NSW to impose a tit-for-tat border closure with Queensland to further curb the movement of people. Mr Richardson said allowing people to freely travel into NSW was putting the health of his citizens at risk. “It’s really important that the community in the Byron Shire has an opportunity to deal with its challenges without the added burden of many hundreds or thousands of Queenslanders coming into our spaces,” he said. “It’s only going to increase the likelihood of spreading a virus and making our spaces more overloaded or unhygienic.” There are 443 cases of coronavirus in Queensland and 1219 in NSW. Thousands of people commute across the border at Tweed Heads for work every day, making it the busiest state crossing in Australia. Those attempting to travel into NSW must now pass a checkpoint where they are questioned by police. Tweed Shire mayor Katie Milne said it was hard to know how the closure would play out for the 8000 Tweed residents who normally work over the border in Queensland. “There’s a lot of people to get over that border and a lot of people to get to work by 9am, and even earlier if they are tradies,” she said. “The last thing we want is gridlock in Tweed, but I have to say there are still far too many people moving about unnecessarily.” Cedric Tiopira, who lives at Banora Point, which is seven kilometres south of the border, was caught in Thursday morning’s queue for more than an hour. “I’m feeling good about it, we just all have to do our bit,” she said. Further west, patrols are in place in other border shires, including Tenterfield. Mayor Peter Petty said the closure was hampering recovery from bushfires that ringed the town late last year, and a drought that almost ran the town reservoir dry. “The whole community was looking forward to some upcoming festivals, stuff to get us going again, then we get this,” he said. “But anyway, we can’t control this and people just have to be sensible and self-isolate, until we get to where we need to go in terms of lockdown and that graph stops going up.” To further discourage people from hitting the road during the pandemic, Parliamentary Secretary for the Hunter Catherine Cusack wants a shutdown of regional motels and caravan parks. She said she had approached the state government about the issue but was looking for more support from local councils. Ms Cusack said the experience in Spain showed what happened when people fled urban areas with high rates of coronavirus. “It has caused geographic dispersion of this illness all over Spain, and that is the massive problem for all of their health services, for their testing,” she said. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Thousands more workers lose jobs amid retail carnage","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-retail-jobs\/","transcript":"Thousands of staff from brands such as Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans and Just Jeans are among the latest to lose their jobs in this week’s virus-driven retail carnage. Billionaire retail mogul Solomon Lew stood down 9000 staff worldwide on Thursday, and declared the brands’ parent company, Premier Investments, will not pay rent during the coronavirus-driven shutdown. Premier said all of its shops would close for a month and all Australian employees will be stood down without pay. The 9000 staff is a global figure – it’s not clear how many are Australian jobs. “This is the hardest decision ever made by Premier – our team are our family and we want to do everything we can to keep them employed, but we believe that it is necessary and the right decision for them, their families, our customers, and the country,” Premier chief executive Mark McInnes said. Additionally, Premier intends not to pay rent globally for as long as the shutdown lasts. It cited “extraordinary circumstances”, and the fact that 70 per cent of its Australian and New Zealand shops were already in holdover or had leases expiring in 2020. Mr Lew has long railed against the level of rent charged by landlords and just last week threatened to close more shops if they refused to play ball during the COVID-19 outbreak. Premier’s announcement follows a slew of other retailers rapidly shutting their doors as people stay away from the shops amid tightening government quarantine restrictions. Also on Thursday, jewellery chain Lovisa (400 shops worldwide) and Athlete’s Foot owner Accent Group joined Mosaic Brands (1400 shops, 6800 staff) and Michael Hill Jewellers (300 shops, 1600 workers) in temporarily shutting down Australian operations. Accent, which also owns the Platypus and Hype shoe chains, will close more than 500 shops from Friday and stand down a reported 5000 staff. JB Hi-Fi Australia remains open but the company has closed its 14 New Zealand stores. Super Retail Group also continues to trade but has cancelled its interim payout to shareholders. It comes as thousands of workers face being laid off in the travel and retail sector as the global economy grinds down in the face of the coronavirus. Virgin Australia said on Thursday that more than 1000 of 8000 workers asked to take leave in the face of the pandemic will probably be made redundant. The airline has asked 80 per cent of its 10,000 staff to take a mixture of holiday, long-service leave and leave without pay. “Of the 8000 that we asked to stand down yesterday, there is probably going to be more than a 1000 of those (who) we do make redundant,” Virgin Australia managing director Paul Scurrah told the ABC on Thursday. “This is the worst airline crisis the world has ever seen.” Rival Qantas had already said it would stand down two-thirds of its 30,000 staff.

If you are unwell or in isolation, it’s important to stay at home for the full duration of the 14-day quarantine period, even if you have tested negative for COVID-19,” Dr Dhupelia said. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has told Queenslanders it’s safe for the elections to proceed, with a third of people having already voted. She cited medical advice supporting the decision to press ahead but said people must stay at least 1.5 metres away from others. The Queensland Electoral Commission is telling voters to bring their own pens, and no more than 100 people will be allowed at polling centres at a time. The QEC has also promised to provide hand sanitiser where available, additional cleaning of booths, and a focus on social distancing rules. There is also a ban on how-to-vote or other election material being handed out. Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate backed the call to proceed with the elections, saying there was only a low risk of people getting the virus at polling booths. “I don’t want to box at shadows but it won’t be that busy,” he said, noting the high pre-poll rate. “Reputation wise, (there would be) more reputable damage if it was cancelled against Queensland Health advice.” Mr Tate said the state needed to push ahead with the polls so local councils were not stuck in caretaker mode, unable to fully function."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus passengers confirmed on cruise ship off WA","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-cruise-perth\/","transcript":"Western Australia’s premier wants the Navy to help move on a cruise ship that is anchored off the WA coast with seven confirmed coronavirus patients on board. WA Health Department officials boarded the Artania on Wednesday after 25 passengers reported respiratory illnesses. Since then, seven passengers have been confirmed with COVID-19. The vessel is carrying about 1300 crew and passengers, although none are Australian. WA has closed its borders and authorities have said only people with life-threatening medical situations will be allowed to come into the state. WA Premier Mark McGowan wants the Navy to help get the Artania to leave Australian waters, and said the Commonwealth should help treat any sick patients in a secure facility. “The Commonwealth has assets here, it has defence assets, it has the Navy. We’d like their assistance to try to get the Artania to leave as soon as possible,” he said. “Its home port is actually Germany, so what we’re saying to the ship is ‘you need to leave’, and we’re saying to the Commonwealth ‘you need to help us get that ship to leave’.” Mr McGowan said on Wednesday that 800 Australians on board a second cruise ship that is due to dock in Fremantle on Friday will be taken straight to Rottnest Island for two weeks quarantine. The remaining passengers and crew – mostly New Zealanders and Britons – will remain in quarantine on board the Vasco de Gama when it docks. It comes as NSW said it would block cruise ship passengers and crew from disembarking there until new border protections are in place. The move will leave thousands of cruise ship passengers and crew stranded. The federal government last week restricted all cruise ships from entering Australia for 30 days. But about 12 ships that were at sea when the restriction was introduced now want to dock in NSW. “No one will be allowed to leave any of these cruise ships until we have settled on the agreed new measures,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. The NSW and federal governments are working on guidelines, but what they will include and when they will be decided upon is unclear. The move came after a war of words broke out between federal and state authorities over who was to blame for allowing 2700 passengers to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise ship last week. More than 130 passengers from the vessel have tested positive for coronavirus, including a 77-year-old woman who died earlier this week. Another cruise ship passenger died in Townsville on Wednesday, and three more in Victoria on Thursday – bringing Australia’s coronavirus toll to 12. When the Ruby Princess docked in Sydney, 13 people were suffering from respiratory problems and were tested, but passengers were allowed to leave before the results came back. The Australian Border Force said it was NSW Health that allowed passengers to disembark. “The Department of Agriculture officials advised my officers that NSW Health had conducted a risk assessment, had rated the risk as low and that health officials would not be attending the vessel,” ABF commissioner Michael Outram said. “As a result of that information, all of the passengers were given a green light to disembark.” But NSW Health said it had followed and exceeded national protocols. The state has already strengthened its rules for cruise ships after being criticised for its handling of the Ruby Princess. NSW Police now has given responsibility for controlling and quarantining cruise ships and other vessels. Meanwhile, the federal government is trying to come up with ways to rescue more than 3000 Australians stranded on dozens of cruise ships overseas. The stranded Australians are scattered across more than 30 vessels in waters off South America, Europe and the US. “We are working directly with them,” Foreign Minister Marise Payne told the Nine Network on Thursday. There are generally hundreds of thousands of Australians overseas at any one time. Thousands of people are desperately trying to get home but are finding it extremely difficult, with countries such as Nepal and South Africa grounding flights altogether. There are additional pressures in countries such as Peru, where public gatherings, free movement and business operations have been heavily constrained. “We are very focused in the most difficult areas of working with partners who can assist us in returning Australians,” Senator Payne said. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has had more than 18,500 requests for assistance from Australians stranded overseas since March 13. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Christchurch terrorist pleads guilty to mosue shootings","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/26\/christchurch-terrorist-pleads-guilty\/","transcript":"The Australian man accused of killing 51 worshippers in an attack on two Christchurch mosques last year has changed his plea to guilty. Brenton Tarrant, who was due to stand trial in June on 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder, and one count of terrorism, admitted carrying out the attacks in a High Court hearing in Christchurch on Thursday morning. TVNZ, one of just a handful of media outlets allowed into Thursday’s hearing due to New Zealand’s COVID-19 lockdown, reported every name of Tarrant’s victims was read to him before he entered his guilty plea. Justice Mander imposed a one-hour embargo on reporting the news to allow for survivors and the families of victims to be informed, before the wider public. “It is regrettable that the Covid-19 restrictions that presently apply do not permit victims and their families to travel to be present in the courtroom when the defendant entered his pleas of guilty,” he said. A sentencing date is yet to be set, but Mr Tarrant can be expected to face life imprisonment. Tarrant, who describes himself as a far-right fascist, came to his radical views from conversations in dark corners on the internet, consolidated on trips to Europe. He moved to New Zealand in 2017, settling in the South Island town of Dunedin. Tarrant carried out his attacks on March 15 last year, carrying camera equipment that allowed him to live-stream his horrific crimes. He was apprehended by police after fleeing the Linwood Islamic Centre, the second of two mosques targeted, after the Al Noor mosque. Tarrant also published a manifesto detailing his hateful views. Both the live-stream and the manifesto are illegal to obtain or read in New Zealand. The immediate reaction to the pleas was relief. Tony Green, of the Al Noor mosque, said the sudden decision caught his community by surprise. “There has been a mighty flurry of WhatsApp messages and the overriding quality through all of those is of enormous relief,” he told AAP. “Many tears. And that speaks to the kind of anguish that continues to run through the community.” Mr Green said the long-running judicial process added to the trauma suffered in the March 2019 mosque attacks. “The protracted nature, being held in suspension by the court process, that has exacerbated the grief,” he said. “There will be now a welling of emotions, driven by relief as people try once again to make sense of a new state.” Aliya Danzeisen, of the Islamic Women’s Council, said it was “a blessing families don’t have to go through trial” on Twitter. Omar Nabi, who lost his father Haji Daoud Nabi as he prayed at Al Noor Mosque, welcomed the change of heart. “It’s about time. His plea should have been earlier but it’s good he’s changed his mind. And good to have it done,” he told the NZ Herald. “There shouldn’t have been a trial anyway … he was caught red-handed, it speaks for itself. “God will give him his own punishment. Just like on earth, you are punished, and when you die your soul will be tried.” Energy Minister Megan Woods, the government’s most senior MP from Christchurch, said “I know the huge relief so many people in Christchurch will be feeling now that they do not have to face the trial and reliving the horrors of that day”. Christchurch mourned the first anniversary of the event earlier this month, though a national remembrance service was cancelled due to coronavirus restrictions. Tarrant has been remanded in custody until May 1. –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'We will go further' – Premier's warning on coronavirus lockdowns","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-lockdown-nsw\/","transcript":"Millions of Australians in NSW, Victoria and Canberra will soon be locked down and urged not to leave their houses unless going to the supermarket for food in the toughest measures yet to stop the coronavirus. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed the state will have to “go further” unless the spread of the disease slows. The ACT has confirmed it will follow suit. “I just want everyone to be prepared for that, not to be overly concerned or panicked, but just to know that the NSW government will go further if we have to, because it’s in the interests of public safety,” Ms Berejiklian said. From Thursday, NSW supermarkets and pharmacists are allowed to trade 24-7 as political leaders consider asking other retailers to shut down – a move that would force thousands of more workers into unemployment queues. NSW has also released new “heat maps” revealing hotspots for infections across the state. “Just because your community is not on the heat map we’re putting up in terms of the number of cases, please don’t assume that you might not have people walking around in your community who are suspected of having it or should be in isolation,” Ms Berejiklian said. Stricter measures are likely to include closing retailers and hairdressers, who won a reprieve on the Prime Minister’s ’30-minute haircut’ edict on Thursday morning. Hairdressers said the rules were unworkable and the Morrison government lifted them. But the win could be short-lived as states consider tougher lockdowns in the regions hardest hit by the virus. Victoria announced on Thursday that two men in their 70s had died from the coronavirus in Melbourne, taking the national death toll to 11. The number of COVID-19 cases in NSW has reached 1219, but in some good news, the rate of new infections is lower. There are 12 patients in intensive care. Labor’s health spokesman Chris Bowen backed tougher action. “We have to be honest with people – what’s been put in place so far is not working, we need to do more,” Mr Bowen said. “Stronger measures are necessary and we certainly think that they’re urgent, and also clearer measures. Frankly, the measures announced by the Prime Minister … were confusing.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Shut us down': Hairdressing chief's desperate plea on COVID-19","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-haircut-time-limit\/","transcript":"“Shut us down” – that’s the plea from the boss of the country’s largest hairdressing chain, who says it is “bonkers” to scrap a 30-minute time limit on haircuts during the coronavirus outbreak. Just Cuts chief executive Denis McFadden said the lives of customers and staff would be put at risk by the decision – and that haircuts were not an essential service. “We understand that you’re trying to juggle protecting livelihoods and saving lives but this decision puts both at risk for our people and clients,” he said. “Please act now.” Just Cuts has about 2500 staff across Australia. Mr McFadden’s plea came after the 30-minute restriction on haircuts – announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday night – was scrapped on Thursday as the federal government tinkers with measures to slow the spread of deadly virus. The backdown came after repeated complaints that the 30-minute limit was impractical. Mr Morrison said hairdressers and barbers must still strictly follow rules about having four square meters per person, and personal contact during appointments must be minimised. But Mr McFadden said it was physically impossible for stylists to do their job while observing the distancing rule, which will still be strictly enforced. The safety of salon staff and customers must come first, he said. “Hairdressing is not an essential service,” he said. “Of course, I would prefer this weren’t happening at all, and calling for the sector to be shut down might seem counterproductive, but it simply must happen in the interests of people’s health.” Mr McFadden said without hairdressing being on the shutdown list, it was difficult for franchise owners to stand down workers and close their doors. New Zealand and Britain – both of which are in lockdown – have shut down hair salons. “I am touching this client’s hair, and our stylists are doing this every day. We need the government – now – to shut us down,” he said. “When that happens, there will be a safety net for our stylists and also the landlords might be sympathetic to the rents that we’re going to be paying. I plead for the state and federal governments to consider that this is dangerous.” In other changes to coronavirus restrictions announced on Thursday, the states will also be able to allow more than 10 people attend funerals. The relaxation of both sets of rules was agreed to at a national cabinet meeting on Wednesday night. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Dramatic police chases end in officers discharging their guns","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/03\/26\/police-chases-open-fire\/","transcript":"Police officers in Victoria were forced to open fire in two separate incidents of drivers ignoring instructions. About 11pm on Wednesday, six men entered a home in Franklyn Street, Melbourne, allegedly armed with knives and a long-arm firearm. They allegedly assaulted two men in their 20s who were home at the time of the offence, before getting into two vehicles and fleeing the scene. The driver of one of the vehicles which were intercepted after a short police chase caused an officer to discharge his gun. No-one was injured. After refusing to comply with police instructions, the man struggled his way out before fleeing on foot. Police have been unable to find him. The two victims who had their home broken into were taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Earlier that night, police attempted to pull over a man in his 30s, who they believed was connected to an alleged assault about 3pm on Wednesday. The driver, armed with knives, got out of his car and threatened police, which forced an officer to fire his gun, wounding the man in the leg and causing him injuries which required hospital treatment. Police were only trying to speak to the driver of a yellow Hyundai which was spotted in Narre Warren about 8.45pm. The vehicle was then sighted a number of times in surrounding suburbs before police began pursuing the car about 9pm. As the vehicle was chased along Pakenham Road, police threw down stop sticks. The man in question is being treated at hospital with a gunshot wound to his lower body.

Here’s how it works overseas","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-lockdown-australia\/","transcript":"Around the world, more countries are going into lockdown to combat the deadly coronavirus. India is the latest to pull daily freedoms in the name of continuing humanity as we know it, declaring on Wednesday the country would be keeping their 1.3 billion citizens confined to their properties for 21 days. Announcing the lockdown, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: “To save India and every Indian, there will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes.” The world has not seen anything like this since Venice cut itself off to stop the Spanish Influenza getting in. It was a smart move. And it looks like it’s working again. China is reporting self-isolation and social-distancing methods have helped stop the spread of the coronavirus. As well as India, residents in the UK, France, Italy, Denmark, Ireland, Germany and Portugal – just to name a few – are hunkering down. Our mates closer to home in Indonesia have started locking down and across the ditch, we won’t see our New Zealand cousins roaming out of their homes for the next month. A full-wide national lockdown is on the cards for Australia. That’s no secret. And after Victorian Premier Dan Andrews said on Wednesday that stage three was coming for his state, it looks likely some areas will be locked down before others. There is no point speculating about what the shutdown will exactly look like when it is announced either at a state-level or nationwide. But given how we’ve followed other nations’ approaches so far during the first stages of the virus restrictions, it’s worth looking at what did and didn’t work overseas. Until we know more, remember: Even without a full-on lockdown law in place, Aussies should be “staying inside to stay alive”. And wash your hands. Lockdown started: January 23. Death toll at time: 17. Wuhan was the first city to go into lockdown after China made the unprecedented move to seal off 11 million people and shut down services. In the beginning the lockdown was met by scepticism by health officials, including the World Health Organisation. But as the virus took off, so did the trend and has since been adopted, at least in part, by more than 19 countries. In the morning of January 23, residents were told that from 10am the shutdown would begin, and they were barred from leaving the city. This didn’t work well, as it is believed many people fled the city, some of them taking COVID-19 with them. Schools were already shut, but public transport was suspended and private cars were no longer allowed on the road – unless they were on official business. Visits to friends and family in other houses or apartments were banned. The only people allowed into residential blocks who didn’t live there were healthcare workers. Farmers and supermarkets stayed open and people were allowed to leave their homes to go to these – under the condition they wore a mask at all times. Temperature checks were rolled out on the streets. Over two weeks the situation deteriorated quickly and police started to forcibly remove sick people from buildings so they could go into quarantine. The city became a ghost town, but it helped stop the spread. On Wednesday, China announced it will lift the lockdown on April 8, more than two months after the city was sealed off. National lockdown begins: March 9. Death toll at time: 463. After Italy recorded its first two virus deaths in February, several towns in Lombardy were placed into lockdown, affecting about 50,000 people. But many officials and a lot of the public didn’t take it seriously. The virus continued to spread – and fast. On March 8, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to most of northern Italy. But the rollout was chaotic, and many citizens continued their life as normal or raced over the border. The result is reflected in the country’s climbing death toll. By March 9, the whole country was locked down. The government has asked its 60 million citizens to stay however possible and only venture out for necessities. When Italians leave the house now, they need to be carrying a form to justify their need to travel – such as to exercise or go to the supermarket or doctor. Rule-breakers are fined $235. National lockdown begins: March 15. Death toll at time: 288. Spain became the second European country to impose a nationwide lockdown after the government ordered its 47 million residents to stay inside their homes for at least 15 days. Bars, restaurants and hotels are closed across the nation. But people are allowed to leave their homes for work, banking, medical appointments and to buy groceries. Unlike Italy, where people are still allowed to go for a walk, Spain has banned everyone except dog owners from taking a short stroll. One man in Northern Spain tried to fake dog ownership by dragging a stuffed toy through the streets. Police were less than impressed. Those caught leaving their house for anything but essentials, (food, medicine, banking, or looking after the elderly) can face fines of up to $53,000. The Spanish aren’t messing around on the fine front. National lockdown begins: March 16. Death toll at time: 148. France had already closed pubs, restaurants and all non-essential shops before 67 million citizens went into lockdown two weeks ago. People are barred from leaving the house only for essentials and they must carry a paper to state why they are out of home. Residents are allowed to leave their house for walks or runs, but no more than “one-kilometre, two-kilometre max”  officials have said. The fine is about $242. Begins: March 17. Death toll at the time: 6. More than 6.7 million people in San Francisco and five other Bay Area counties in the US state of California have been ordered to stay inside until Tuesday until April 7. Supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants serving takeaway, and petrol stations are all open. Public transport and airports are also open – but only for essential travel. Non-essential travel on foot, by bicycle, scooter, car or public transport are all banned. Residents are allowed to go out and eat food, get some fresh air and run essential errands."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Your coronavirus questions answered: What you can and can’t do in the era of social distancing | The New Daily","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-questions-social-distancing\/","transcript":"As part of our responsibility to get you the information you need to know when you need it, we’ve been taking your coronavirus questions to the experts. Last week, they answered questions about how the virus works, how long this will all last, and how you can stay healthy. This is a constantly changing situation and answers are current as of time of publishing. Please check www.health.gov.au for the latest. Professor Nikolai Petrovsky from the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University is answering your questions about how to stay healthy and virus free. Over to him. How long would the virus last on fruit and vegetables handled by many? How can you wash them properly? Virus can live for several hours and in extreme cases up to several days on surfaces including potentially on fruit and vegetables. Not a lot of research has gone into this, but washing under water for several minutes should be sufficient in most cases. Can I drive five kilometres down the road to go fishing? It’s an isolated spot that I normally go to. If you are required by law to self-isolate it is mandatory to stay at home except for urgent matters, such as to seek medical attention. If you aren’t required to self-isolate you should be adhering to social distancing and avoid physical contact. If no one else is around, it should be OK. Should I cancel the cleaners who clean my house weekly? If you don’t have contact with them, stay in a different room while they are cleaning, and keep a distance of at least two metres from them at all times, it should be OK. Make sure they know to take appropriate precautions afterwards, like hand washing. How can I shop without touching produce? You can wear gloves. Can we hug our parents and kids though we are not quarantined? This may not be safe as you may be shedding virus even if you have no symptoms. Wouldn’t you feel guilty if you infected them? Best where possible to avoid close personal contact till this outbreak is over. Can I go out for a big walk around Albert Park Lake daily for some exercise? Yes, providing you have no symptoms and are not required by law to self-isolate or be in quarantine. Is it still OK to go bike riding and motorcycle riding if it’s only myself and maybe one other? Even if we have social distancing? Yes, providing you have no symptoms and are not required by law to self-isolate or be in quarantine. Should we be social distancing at home and among our family … should we be sleeping in separate rooms? In China, there was an extremely high rate of infections being transmitted within whole families if one became infected. This is most likely via frequently contacting the same surfaces, such as door handles and eating utensils. There is no evidence that sleeping in the same bed increases this risk. That said, if one partner is clearly infected then it may be wise to sleep in different beds until they are recovered. Can children have play dates through this pandemic? Single-person contacts e.g. play dates are a much lower risk than large groups e.g. daycare facilities, but there is still some risk. Certainly, a no-no if either of the children have any symptoms. Should I be working in a bank if I’m pregnant? Unlike swine flu where pregnant women had a much higher risk, this has not been seen with COVID-19. Nevertheless, direct customer-facing positions confer significant risk of exposure and this would need to be borne in mind. Ultimately, it’s a personal decision. Can our children come home for Easter lunch? If you are elderly this is probably not a good idea. Can I visit my parents if I sit in the backyard and talk to them through the screen door of their conservatory? We would be three metres apart. Yes, that should be fine if you are at least two metres away and don’t touch things they are likely to touch afterwards, such as doorknobs."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Childcare centres on brink of collapse as one in three families flee","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-childcare-centres-collapse-gap-fee\/","transcript":"Parents are being forced to pay thousands of dollars in childcare fees during the coronavirus crisis or lose their spots, prompting a mass exodus of one in three families over the past week. Childcare centres have warned they are on the brink of collapse after parents voted with their feet after being forced to pay up to $100 a day or more for childcare they can’t attend or can no longer afford after being laid off. The number of parents not sending their kids to childcare is even higher, but operators say one in three parents have cancelled care to avoid paying fees when they don’t attend. Unions warned centres could be forced to close their doors and force thousands of workers onto the job queues if the exodus of parents continues. “This is a real crisis in the sector and it’s a crisis for parents,” United Workers Union Helen Gibbons said. “Attendance has plummeted. The finances are a mess. “At the moment centres are required to ask parents to pay that gap fee. Centres have asked that they no longer be forced to charge the gap fee.” Ms Gibbons said it was vital that a solution was found to allow staff to be retained to provide care when the crisis is over. “When the economy gets started again, we need those workers ready to go on day dot,” Ms Gibbons said. “You can’t just restart it if all of the workforce has disappeared.” Unions also want temperature checks for children and educators to improve workplace safety and to help stop sick children or workers from spreading COVID-19 to others. Operators insist their hands are tied by the Morrison government under the current rules, because they must charge parents fees for non-attendance or centres are not paid the childcare subsidy by the government. If they lose that rebate, centres they cannot pay their staff. One option is a government bailout to guarantee childcare centres would still receive a portion of the $9 billion in annual childcare rebates from the government during the shutdown to keep on as many staff as possible for when the coronavirus crisis was over. ACTU secretary Sally McManus said it was imperative that a solution was found and childcare centres remained open for nurses and doctors caring for the sick. “We need the government to support childcare centres so healthcare workers can go and face this crisis,” Ms McManus said. “The kids of these workers should take the places.” Labor’s early childhood spokesman Amanda Rishworth urged the government to find a solution where parents were not left out of pocket but did not force childcare operators to sack staff. “The government needs to find a solution that ensures parents are not out of pocket and, at the same time, the sector needs to be properly supported for its long-term viability,” Ms Rishworth said. “Every option should be looked at, including not charging parents a gap fee.” Education Minister Dan Tehan has legislated changes to help the sector with the COVID-19 crisis, including increasing the allowable absences, but those changes don’t stop parents being charged for care they cannot attend."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus is hospitalising young people just as quickly","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/26\/coronavirus-young-people\/","transcript":"As New South Wales recorded its first case of coronavirus in a child aged under 10 on Wednesday, new data from America has show young people are just as likely to be treated in hospital for COVID-19. Tarek Soliman, a young, fit New Yorker has been left coughing blood and struggling to survive after COVID-19 entered his lungs, causing pneumonia. Mr Soliman started to feel weak on March 8. He had chills, a headache and a fever, so assumed it was a bad flu. “After the fifth day I went to urgent care because my symptoms have been getting worse,” Mr Soliman said. “By the time the doctor started running some tests, I fainted and they called the ambulance. “After four days I got my test result back that I am positive. “I still have the same symptoms with no progress, but I started developing pneumonia and can’t breathe normally. “Because there is no cure, it was followed by coughing blood. Now I have no fever but I still can’t breathe normally. “Apparently the virus has spread into my lungs.” He’s now back in hospital fighting for his life. He wants young people across the world to know they need to take coronavirus seriously. And that even if you live, the experience is horrible. “This isn’t something small we are dealing with – be responsible and stay home,’’ he said. “I don’t want anyone to go through what I am going through now.” His call to arms came as new data revealed that becoming infected isn’t just a worry for the elderly. On Wednesday, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in America released data showing 47 per cent of all COVID-19 hospital admissions in the US were from those aged 20 to 54. Younger patients are just as likely to end up in hospital. And they’re also more likely to get it, according to the report. Of the 2449 cases the CDC looked at between February 12 and March 16, those aged 20 to 44 had the highest number of cases, with 705. Of those admitted to intensive care, 36 per cent were aged 45 to 64 years, and 12 per cent were aged 20 to 44 years.  “Clinicians who care for adults should be aware that COVID-19 can result in severe disease among persons of all ages,” read the report, titled Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. “Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus.” It comes as New South Wales on Wednesday recorded its first cases in two children, including a two-month-old boy. “We have got two children that are under the age of 10 years have been confirmed on 24 March (Tuesday),” NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said. “A two-month-old boy who was tested following close contact with a confirmed adult case has had minimal symptoms and he’s isolated at home. “In a separate unrelated case, we have a seven-year-old girl who was tested following close contact with a confirmed adult case and, again, has minimal symptoms and isolated at home.” The World Health Organisation has warned against complacency among younger people after media reports from many countries showed young people ignoring the social distancing instructions. “Although older people are hardest hit, younger people are not spared,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference recently. “I have a message for young people: You are not invincible, this virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you. “Even if you don’t get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Health authorities expand Australia’s restrictive coronavirus testing criteria","date":"03-26-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/26\/how-to-get-coronavirus-test\/","transcript":"As the coronavirus infects more and more Australians, the rules determining who is eligible to get tested for the disease are broadening. Initially, only people who had returned from overseas in the last 14 days or had been in contact with a confirmed case could get tested if they were showing flu-like symptoms. This is because the world is grappling with a short supply of tests, prompting authorities to place strict guidelines on who should be checked for the virus But now, as an increasing number of reports emerge of suspected community transmissions, testing criteria will move away from only those who have recently travelled. If you think you have the coronavirus, you can now quality for a COVID-19 test if you meet the new criteria for a “suspect case”. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus can be curbed in 13 weeks – just stay home, data says","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-control-social-distancing\/","transcript":"Data out this week from the University of Sydney reinforces what Australians have been repeatedly told: Stay the bloody hell home. The coronavirus outbreak could be under control in just over three months if eight out of 10 Australians abide by the social distancing regulations. The university’s Faculty of Engineering released its modelling on Wednesday, which showed if that if the figure slips down to even just seven [out of 10], we drastically negatively affect our chances of flattening that all-important curve. That means every individual’s actions are vital. Eighty per cent of people complying, for four months – that’s the best possible scenario for us, the researchers say. (Note: The results haven’t been strenuously peer-reviewed but they still carry weight.) Professor Mikhail Prokopenko is a pandemic modelling expert and led the study. He said we must practise social distancing if we want to control the disease – rather than have it control us. “There is a clear trade-off – stricter measures imposed earlier would reduce how long our lives are impacted by this disease,” Professor Prokopenko said. “On the contrary, laxer protocols could mean a longer, more drawn-out and ineffective struggle against COVID-19.” The more we delay the peak of the virus, the more time our health systems have time to adequately prepare. And the better chance we have of a treatment or vaccine being developed and distributed. Again: Every decision we make as individuals to stay home makes a difference to how quickly can bring this outbreak under control. “We can do it. We are still in control of our lives and the lives of other people if we do it like that,” ABC reported Professor Prokopenko as saying. You might have seen the below graph circulating the internet. It’s a visual representation of how your choice makes a hell of a difference.  There has been a lot of talk about schools, and why aren’t we shutting them. This research draws a similar conclusion to what we’ve been told – shutting schools won’t significantly reduce new cases in older adults, but it would slightly increase the amount of new cases in children when the pandemic peaks. Its modelling shows school closures would only delay the pandemic peak by two weeks. (The modelling, by the way, has been used to map the spread of influenza in Australia before. It works on a simulation of the Australian population’s locations and movement habits.) The 80 per cent modelling of social distancing being effective at reining in this thing includes social distancing on top of already enforced measures, such as interstate and international travel bans. This 80 per cent is calculated by either one person per household going out once in the space of five days, or one member per family of five could go out every day, providing the other four stay at home. Time to draw straws. The over-arching key to getting social distancing right is staying home. Yeah, it’s boring. Yeah, you’ll go a bit stir-crazy and start talking to animals – or worse, inanimate objects. But the sooner we embrace the toaster as a decent conversationalist, the sooner we can return to life as we know and love it. If you must leave the house (and look, some of us will have to) make sure it’s only for essential reasons. We’ve got a rundown here and another that covers the latest gatherings restrictions, but if you want the bullet points, check below. Shopping: Don’t go if you’re feeling unwell. If you do go, make use of in-store hand sanitiser and stay a trolley-length or more from other shoppers. Don’t fondle stuff, umm-ing and ahh-ing over the different kinds of peanut butter on the shelves. Follow any in-store markings for distance, and abide patiently by any customer number restrictions. And don’t be rude to staff. Or fellow customers. Or anyone. Wash your hands as soon as you get home. Petrol: Wash your hands before and after pumping that gas. Or, wear gloves. Social gatherings: No. Use FaceTime. Wash your hands just for good measure. Medical appointments: Most services are available via Telehealth now. If you’re feeling unwell, call your GP first – don’t just walk in. Here’s a checklist we made to make it even simpler. Above all, folks – stay home where you can. Stay healthy. Stay positive. Stay kind. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Prince Charles tests positive for COVID-19","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-prince-charles\/","transcript":"Prince Charles has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has announced.

Even in the midst of a global pandemic, Aussies can be relied upon to find the funny. From creating our colloquialisms surrounding the crisis to inventing #isolationgames and sharing feelgood yarns, average Aussies are staying true to their ‘she’ll be right mate’ attitude and finding a little bit of light in the dark. Nothing says ‘Aussie’ more than the penchant for shortening words and transforming correct English words into our slang versions. Whether it’s grabbing your sunnies, putting smashed avo on your toast, sucking on a ciggie or throwin’ back a tinnie, articulating full sentences is really just too much work. The coronavirus is sparking its linguistic substrate too, and the classic ones doing the rounds right now include: And to use them all in a sentence: “Me boss tested posi for The ’Rona so now I’m in iso. Popped down to Woollies for some sanny, but it’s been bloody Magpie’d.” And there’s a whole other story in the lyrics of songs that have been appropriated too. Think “My my my my my corona” (My Sharona); “CO-VID-19” (sung to the tune of Come on Eileen) and “And it was COVID-19” (Redgum’s I Was Only 19). Sydney mum of five Irene Strong decided being cheeky was a good way to lift the spirits of her family and friends. Grabbing a bunch of random household items, including a hula-hoop, sunnies, a few balloons and an old tradies mask, she created a fun costume to keep herself clear of The ’Rona while out on a trip to the shops for some groceries. “Just ducking to the shops for a few more supplies,” she wrote on her page on Facebook. “Practising social distancing. Hulahoop for my personal space. Anyone gets too close I pop a balloon.” BEST! #isolationgames #coronavirus #veryinventive #horsey https:\/\/t.co\/y9vPHvkZp5 — Cathy Anderson (@MsCathyAnderson) March 24, 2020 Strong says she did it as a funny surprise for the kids (she didn’t really wear it to the shops), and her family got a kick out of it. “I did it as a joke and they all laughed,” she told The New Daily. “You have to laugh otherwise you will cry. It’s so sad and scary.” Keeping yourself occupied through inventive indoor sports and challenges and then posting about it on social media under the hashtag #isolationgames is the new black. But we’re not just talking about Scrabble, Boggle or teaching old dogs new tricks. This is some next-level creativity, and no one recognises this better than larrikin Aussie comics Hamish and Andy.

Aussies aren’t very good at promoting themselves – the Tall Poppy Syndrome has taken care of that – but we are exceptionally good at sharing stories of good deeds, especially when it comes to yarns of battlers being helped by strangers, people going out of their way to shop for others, and anonymous gifts of toilet paper – cue thousands of awwws and virtual hugs. There are videos of kids writing inspirational words in chalk on the footpath to uplift passersby, personal stories of customers in grocery stores paying for other people’s supplies if they run short of cash, and accounts of warring neighbours burying the hatchet over petty squabbles and sharing food and comfort (at a safe distance of course)."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cruise ship passenger from Qld adds to Australian death toll","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/25\/australia-eleventh-coronavirus-death\/","transcript":"Queenslanders have been warned of stricter lockdown measures in their neighbourhood as the state faces rising COVID-19 diagnoses. It comes as Australia’s death toll from the coronavirus rose to nine after the death of Garry Kirstenfield, 68, from Toowoomba, who had to receive treatment in the intensive care unit. Mr Kirstenfield, whose family described him as “kind and adorable”, is believed to have contracted COVID-19 on board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship that docked in Sydney last week. Queensland Health said the man “had a serious underlying medical condition before contracting the virus”. It reports that Mr Kirstenfield’s wife is in self-isolation, together with the rest of his immediate family. He is the second Queenslander to have died after a 77-year-old woman died on March 15 from the virus in Sydney after a flight from the Sunshine Coast.  Limits on civilian movements will be stepped-up in some parts of the state while others are urged to stay at home. “What we might see in the future is we may see some areas of our state going into more of a lock down than other parts,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk flagged on Wednesday. “I want everyone to please be patient and, as soon as we get that advice, we will give that advice to you, I promise to you.” The latest data shows Australia has 2423 confirmed cases of COVID-19, an increase of 287 cases in 24 hours. Queensland has a total of 443 cases, less than half that of New South Wales’ 1029. Victoria has 466 cases, while Western Australia (205), South Australia (197), the ACT (44), Tasmania (34) Northern Territory (five) account for the remainder. Earlier, Queensland Health confirmed that four staff members at a popular Noosa restaurant and more than a dozen revellers had tested positive for COVID-19 after a birthday party last week. Mr Palaszczuk said the celebration at Sails Restaurant was a prime example of why people must stay at home. “This is how coronavirus can spread,” she said. “It is a very clear signal to everyone that this is now not the time to socialise, it is the time to keep your distance. “I think this is a really clear example for everyone about why we can no longer have parties.” Mr Palaszczuk is making no apologies for shutting the state’s borders from Wednesday night in an effort to stem the spread of the deadly illness. Outsiders are being told not to visit the state and anyone who breaks self-isolation rules faces a $13,000 fine. Police and health authorities have been making random compliance checks on individuals isolating themselves since January. Camping grounds will also be closed from Thursday in a bid to encourage people to stay home during the upcoming school break. All holidays should be cancelled and people are being told to stay inside regardless of whether they are sick. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Calls for coronavirus welfare as international students beg for lifeline","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/25\/international-students-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Rafael Menta has enough money to last him five weeks. If he can’t pay his rent soon, he’ll be kicked out of his share house – and it’s not like he can just crash on a relative’s couch. Mr Menta came from Brazil for his studies, and had been working casual pub shifts to get by. This week he was left jobless after the two pubs he worked at had to close their doors because they were deemed non-essential amid the coronavirus lockdown. The management and leadership student now fears he won’t be able to afford his $130 rent or the tuition for Albright College in Melbourne. “I’m just, like, really scared right now,” Mr Menta said. “If I don’t pay my school, they can tell the government and then I guess they can kick me out [because of student visa requirements].” Because he isn’t a permanent resident or Australian citizen, the 36-year-old from São Paulo in Brazil does not qualify for Centrelink payments. The Council of International Students Australia (CISA) is pushing to change that. CISA national welfare officer Kasun Kalhara told The New Daily the council is hopeful the government will have a change of heart and extend financial help to foreigners. Mr Kalhara said most international students are casual workers and therefore face a higher risk of job insecurity. “We need international students to be equally considered in various support and welfare packages that are being offered by the government,” Mr Kalhara said. “It’s not yet confirmed, but we are very much hopeful that it’s going to be announced soon. “We believe Australia will do their best to look after all citizens and residents.” Before he could migrate to Australia six years ago, Mr Menta had to prove he was financially stable. He referenced his older brother Ricardo that in case of an emergency, he would be able to lend him money. “But right now it’s an emergency everywhere and he (Ricardo) has a son, so I don’t really expect him to help me,” Mr Menta explained. He isn’t holding out hope Brazil’s government will throw him a lifeline either. “My government is really bad. The president is really, really, really bad. I think they [Brazilian public] have worse [conditions] there than I [have] here.” Mr Menta is now on the hunt for a job. But the odds are against him, with “hundreds of thousands, maybe a million people” left without work due to the shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic. That estimated number of unemployed people was made by Government Services Minister Stuart Robert on 2GB radio after Scott Morrison announced stringent lockdown measures on Sunday, forcing thousands of Australians to queue outside Centrelink offices across the country. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is among the chorus of voices calling for foreigners in Australia to be covered by the Morrison government’s bailout measures. Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said on Tuesday that all visa categories were being examined so a decision could be made on whether foreign workers should receive welfare assistance. In the meantime, Mr Menta is trying to save every dollar as he looks for a job – though the search could be hampered if he is restricted to lockdown hours in his student share house."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Stay at home - it's simple': Premiers drive home coronavirus message","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-premiers-2\/","transcript":"Premier Daniel Andrews is begging Victorians to stay home, as the state’s coronavirus tally rises to 466.

On Wednesday, he outlined the “stage two” restrictions, and what they meant. “No parties, no outings, no gatherings. There’s just no, no excuse,” he said. “If you can stay at home, you must stay at home. It is very, very simple. “You should not be having friends over for a dinner party; you should not be going out shopping unless you need to. “Kids on school holidays cannot be having friends over.” The Victorian coronavirus tally grew by 55 overnight to 466 cases. Among the confirmed cases are four healthcare workers from a private hospital in Melbourne’s west. All are in a stable condition. However, there are two Victorians are in intensive care because of the virus. Mr Andrews implored people to realise that overseas, otherwise healthy people have died from COVID-19, which was why isolating was so important to stop the spread. “There’s a lot of talk that this is the greatest risk for those who are frail and aged,” he said. “Yes, it is, but no one should kid themselves that otherwise healthy people in their 40s, perhaps even younger, haven’t died from this.” About 500 police officers will have the daily task of enforcing the closure of non-essential services in Victoria and the mandatory 14-day self-isolation for travellers. Individuals face fines of up to $25,000 and business could be forced to cough up $100,000 for breaching restrictions. An expanded list of businesses will be forced to close their doors at midnight on Wednesday with an emphasis on stopping large gatherings. Weddings will be restricted to the couple, celebrant and two witnesses only, while funerals can only have a maximum of 10 mourners. Open house inspections and auctions are banned as are personal services such as beauty therapy, waxing, tattoo parlours and massage to go with the closure of pubs, clubs, cafes and restaurants announced on Sunday. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian earlier reiterated the need for the public to “step up” to slow the spread of the virus, which has so far killed eight people, including seven in NSW. She also backed the new public restrictions announced on Tuesday night to control the spread of COVID-19. “The decisions we take are not ones we take lightly,” she said. “This is a time that all of us have to step up.

The government has commandeered the defence force to assist police to uphold public safety and enforce the lockdown, which begins at midnight on Wednesday. Police and civil defence personnel have been afforded a range of sweeping powers to close roads, take control of buildings and public spaces, and regulate and control the flow of food, fuel and essential supplies. Ms Ardern said the pandemic required “a significant and coordinated response by and across central and local government” and for each citizen to minimise their contact by self-isolating. “I do not take this moment in our history lightly nor the powers that come with it,” Ms Ardern said. “But every decision that we are taking with the best interests of New Zealanders’ public health in mind. “Unlike so many other gravely inundated countries, we have a window of opportunity to stay home, break the chain of transmission, and save lives. “We must take this period of self-isolation deadly seriously.” The consolidation of power comes with the blessing of the opposition, and with support from Kiwi citizens eager to see the containment of the spiralling pandemic.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said on Wednesday Australia would continue to partner with commercial airlines and local authorities to gain permission for flights to leave the country. “Given the unprecedented scale of the global interruption to travel, the options outlined will not return all Australians travellers home,” he said. But Mr McCormack stressed the flights would not be ‘free’ – as evacuation flights were for Australians trapped in China during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. More than 300 Australians remain trapped in Peru after the country locked down airports and prohibited flights in or out. “Last night, the government also agreed to consider, on a case-by-case basis, supporting our airlines to operate non-scheduled services to less central locations to bring Australians home. These will only be done where it is feasible, where all other commercial options have been exhausted and where local authorities will permit such flights,” Mr McCormack said. “We do not have plans for assisted departures, such as those conducted to the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan in China and Japan.” Mr McCormack’s decision to rule out assisted departures – similar to those provided by the Israeli government and other nations – is a blow to those trapped in Peru. Many of them say they can’t afford $5000 for a commercial flight being organised by a private operator and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Canberran Dale Wirtanen, 54, said he was shocked at the Morrison government’s decision. “Bloody disgraceful. Hang your head in shame Australian government,” he said. “Just leave us out here to dry while other countries repatriate their citizens. It’s un-Australian, Morrison. “I can’t believe the Americans, the Israelis, the Brits, they are all repatriating citizens and we aren’t.” Victorian mother Sandra Skehan said her son, Jack, 26, could not afford a seat on the $5000 flight. “I am seething. I am mother. I’ve got a son and his girlfriend in Cusco,” she said. “The first flight, the cost was out of control. The whole thing has been such a stuff-up. I’ve sent emails to everyone right up to the PM’s office. I’ve got no reply.” Mr McCormack also warned some overseas travellers will be forced to remain trapped behind foreign borders as the virus rages. “It may be necessary for some Australians to stay where they are overseas and, as far as practicable, remain safe and comfortable, including by following the directions of local authorities,” he said. “For those of you who may be overseas in coming weeks, Australia’s diplomatic missions around the globe will do whatever they can to provide you with regular advice and support. This will include information on local restrictions, food and necessities, and other support. Please ensure you sign up to their social media accounts, as well as Smartraveller.” He said the government was in talks with Qantas and Virgin to help. “Limited commercial flights are still operating from some countries and cities but we are aware that in many countries they are no longer an option. We urge Australians who do have access to these opportunities to act quickly,” he said. “The government thanks Qantas and Virgin for their willingness to engage on continued services to key hubs for the purpose of bringing Australians home, where existing commercial flights are exhausted.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Hundreds of Australians aboard cruise ship face quarantine on WA island","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/rottnest-island-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Nearly 1000 Australians aboard a cruise ship that is due to dock in Fremantle will be taken straight to Rottnest Island for two weeks quarantine.

Parents currently appear unsure over who to follow over whether they should send their children to school. Labor has described the situation as a mess. Victoria and the ACT have moved to start their Easter holidays early, with pupil free-days at public schools, but other states have kept schools open. However, leaders including NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian have been telling parents to keep their children at home if possible. Parents appear to have heeded her calls, with almost three-quarters of students absent from state schools on Tuesday. The teachers’ unions remains angry after meeting with Scott Morrison over coronavirus school closures. The NSW Teachers Federation called for a planned transition to online learning across all state schools as attendance numbers continue to fall. “We need to be able to plan and we need to be able to plan on the basis of clear advice, clear statements, and a clear position by our elected leaders,” federation president Angelo Gavrielatos told reporters.

They should be advised to work from home. — Angelo Gavrielatos (@AGavrielatos) March 20, 2020  NSW has recorded its first infections in children aged under 10, with a two-month-old boy and a seven-year-old girl who both had contact with people with coronavirus testing positive. “This is, frankly, a mess,” federal opposition health spokesman Chris Bowen told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday. “We have this game of ‘open-shut-them’ between the Prime Minister and the Premier of NSW, which is sending terribly mixed messages to families and parents who really don’t know whether to listen to the Prime Minister or the Premier.” The Prime Minister expects all schools will reopen after the Easter break, around Anzac Day. Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone says it is time for a UK-style shutdown to most effectively mitigate against the impact of the outbreak. “It is a big call for governments to direct the population to cease work, suspend schools, and only leave home for essential needs, but the AMA will back governments in making this call,” he said on Wednesday. Dr Bartone said too many Australians were already flouting existing rules while mixed messaging from governments had brought about confusion and anxiety. “We need strong consistent messages from all levels of government,” he said. “More people need to be at home to flatten the escalation curve.” When asked why Australia isn’t implementing a total lockdown, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said “I don’t think we should rush to that sort of scenario. I think you could rush to failure in that sort of scenario.” Labor is backing a tighter shutdown. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said the government was creating a tension between the economic and health impacts of the pandemic. “It’s time the politics was put aside. It’s time to deal with this health emergency,” he told reporters in Sydney. Mr Albanese also said the gradually tightening restrictions were confusing people. The Prime Minister has also been vague on what constitute ‘essential services’. While he has encouraged people to work from home if it is feasible, he has also defined an essential worker as “someone who has a job”. This is in stark contrast to New Zealand, where working from home has been deemed mandatory where possible, with only essential workers to leave their house. With Australians being urged to stay close to home and tens of thousands already losing their jobs, the Australian Retailers Association and SDA, the union representing floor staff, have written to Prime Minister Scott Morrison pleading for help. Thousands have already lost their jobs as businesses shut down, either voluntarily or forced, to counter the spread of COVID-19. “The last 48 hours have been an absolutely shocking time for working Australians,” ACTU secretary Sally McManus told ABC radio on Wednesday. Out-of-work people are queuing outside Centrelink offices for a third day in a row as the federal government’s welfare services online portal struggles to keep up with demand. “There would be no lines outside Centrelink if we had a wage subsidy like the UK,” Ms McManus said. She said employers and employees would have certainty that 80 per cent of wages would be covered. Under the government’s plan to temporarily double the Jobseeker allowance – previously known as Newstart – people will have to wait five weeks to get that extra benefit. “People can’t wait five weeks for that extra money, that is something that needs to be addressed urgently,” Ms McManus said.

The retailer said it would cut trading hours at 41 of its supermarkets to 11am-6pm from Thursday. The supermarkets will become “priority delivery hubs”. Staff will use the hours they are closed to shoppers to pick online orders – with a focus on meeting the increased demand from priority customers such as the elderly and those hit by the coronavirus. “We are focused on supporting the most vulnerable in the community during these challenging times,” Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said on Wednesday. “To help support getting basic food and essentials to those that need it most, our teams have been doing everything they can to scale up online and home deliveries to the elderly, people with disabilities or those in mandatory self-isolation.” The company has already introduced dedicated shopping hours for the elderly and vulnerable at its more than 1000 Australian supermarkets. Rival Coles has done the same and, on Tuesday, expanded that to twice-weekly exclusive hours for health and emergency care workers. It said on Tuesday it was also working out a new online priority service for vulnerable customers. Other smaller supermarket chains, such as IGA and Aldi, have introduced similar measures to try to limit widespread panic buying. Aldi is limiting the number of shoppers allowed in its aisles in selected stores, and has abandoned its famed “special buys” to focus on keeping its shelves stocked with staple goods. The moves came after supermarket shelves across Australia were stripped of staples such as pasta, canned goods and toilet paper as consumers prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. Both of the big chains suspended in-store pick-up and slashed home delivery services as the frenzied shopping went on. They have also already reduced their opening hours to allow staff to restock shelves amid buying that has easily surpassed even the busiest pre-Christmas weeks. “We want to slow the panic down,” Woolworths managing director Claire Peters said at the time. On Wednesday, Woolworths said it had also committed additional support to hunger relief charities such as OzHarvest, Foodbank and Fareshare amid the widening economic and health fallout from COVID-19. Coles has also stepped up support for its food relief charities. It will also roll out further in-store health and safety measures for its staff.

Health researchers have warned that more than a million people in India could be infected with the coronavirus by mid-May, prompting the government to shut down all air and train travel, businesses and schools. Mr Modi went further on Tuesday, saying nobody in the world’s biggest democracy will be allowed to leave their homes for the next three weeks from midnight that day. “The only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don’t leave our homes, whatever happens, we stay at home,” he said, in his second address to the nation within a week. “Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,” he said, warning India would be set back decades if it didn’t shut down and fight the virus. The order sparked panic buying in India, with scores of people turning up at shops in Delhi and Mumbai and elsewhere to buy essentials before the ban went into effect. India has found 482 cases of the coronavirus and 10 people have died from the COVID-19 disease it causes. However, alarm is growing across the region about prospects for its spread into impoverished communities and the ability of resource-starved public health sectors to cope.

In a campaign that started on Wednesday, every Australian mobile phone will be sent a text message from the federal government urging them to protect their own health, and their families and the community. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said nearly 36 million messages would be sent in coming days. But there is already confusion about the contents of the text, which urges Australians to stay home if they are sick. That appears to contradict advice from Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who announced tougher restrictions on movement on Tuesday night. “Stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary you go out,” Mr Morrison said of the stricter rules, which will be enforced from midnight on Wednesday. State premiers have also conveyed sterner messages. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has already flagged more stringent controls on movement and business in his state. “I can make all the rules in the world. But if people don’t follow them then Victorians will die,” he said. “If you can stay at home, you must stay at home. It is very, very simple.” But, on Wednesday, the Prime Minister defended the apparent difference between his latest advice and the message going to mobile phones. “The most urgent message that we’re getting for people to stay home is to stay home if you’re sick,” he said. “It is also important that people should stay home when they’re in self-isolation and, as I said last night, our preference and our instruction is more generally stay home unless you’re going out for essentials.” Mr Hunt said the initial message would be followed by others as the government stepped up its communications campaign on the coronavirus outbreak.

Services Australia boss Hank Jongen said those who had lost jobs no longer needed to queue at Centrelink offices. From Wednesday morning, they could start claims through MyGov accounts – which are used to process tax returns, so are held by most Australians. “Once you log in to MyGov, you can simply click on ‘an intent to claim’,” he told ABC radio on Wednesday. “That will give permission for MyGov to give us your personal details and we will then contact you. That locks in your date of eligibility.” Tens of thousands of people are already trying to sign up for unemployment benefits after losing their jobs amid the ever-tighter restrictions introduced to try to halt the spread of the lethal virus. MyGov has had more than three million logins in less than a day. The site crashed on Monday and again on Tuesday, despite a boost in its ability to handle traffic. Centrelink will boost its workforce by 5000 people to deal with the influx of applicants and extend call centre hours. However, Mr Jongen said the organisation was yet to recruit any extra staff. “What we’ve done is mobilised staff internally,” he said. “We’ve embarked on extensive training program, and we are in the process of recruiting.” He said Centrelink had had a couple of days of “terrible scenes” at its offices, but the extra staff and boosted website would help ease demand. Existing Centrelink clients were also urged not to phone the organisation to check on their eligibility for payments. “It’s important for current customers to understand – this process is automatic,” Mr Jongen said. “If you are eligible as at April 13, from March 13 to April 13, you will automatically receive the first $750 stimulus payment. The payments will be made from March 31 through to April 17. You don’t need to contact us.” Various income tests apply for the coronavirus supplement but the Prime Minister said these thresholds could be changed. “When we get the feedback, we will take action and then we’ll get the system in place to support that,” Scott Morrison told 2GB radio. Government Services Minister Stuart Robert admitted the government hadn’t planned for so many people logging on to get unemployment benefits. “I didn’t think I’d have to prepare for 100,000 concurrent users,” he said on Tuesday. “My bad for not realising the sheer scale of the decision on Sunday night by the national leaders that literally saw hundreds and hundreds of thousands, maybe a million people, unemployed overnight.” Mr Robert initially claimed MyGov had been hacked on Monday when it had actually crashed due to overwhelming demand. Mutual obligations for those receiving social security have been suspended until the end of March. That means people already receiving payments do not have to report their income or attend appointments. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Elective surgery on hold as hospitals ready for virus influx","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/surgery-australia-hospitals-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Elective surgery will be suspended across the country, unless it is urgent, as hospitals prepare for an influx of COVID-19 patients.

Cancellation of elective surgery will allow the preservation of resources like personal protective equipment and allow health services to prepare for their role in the COVID-19 outbreak.” The halt was already largely in place for category three surgeries but represents a further scaling back of elective surgeries in category two. Non-urgent (category three) is recommended treatment within 365 days of being added to the outpatient wait list. Category two surgery is defined as a specialist consultation recommended within 90 days of being added to an outpatient wait list.

Mr West will appear in court in May after being charged over the incident at Coffs Harbour police station on Tuesday. “While inquiries were being made regarding the man’s claims, the police station was closed, and the necessary isolation protocols were put in place,” a police spokesperson said on Wednesday. Further inquiries revealed Mr West did not have the COVID-19. He was charged with stalking or intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical harm – which carries a maximum jail term of five years – and resisting arrest. The Coffs Harbour local was granted bail. Meanwhile, an alleged drink driver is accused of coughing in the direction of a police officer and telling them he had COVID-19 to try to avoid a breath test in Muswellbrook. The 42-year-old was charged with high-range drink driving after allegedly recording a blood alcohol level of 0.274 – more than five times the legal limit. He was spoken to after police noticed his Holden Commodore stopped in the middle of the road at Muswellbrook on Tuesday. When he was asked to submit to a breath test “the man claimed he had COVID-19 and intentionally coughed at the police officer”, police said. He will appear in Muswellbrook Local Court on April 6.

The company, which operates casinos in Sydney, Brisbane and on the Gold Coast, said on Wednesday its operations had been severely curtailed following government-imposed bans on gatherings and non-essential services amid the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions meant a temporary stand down of 90 per cent of its staff. “The Star has taken a very difficult, but necessary, decision in relation to its workforce … these stand-downs include senior management,” the company said. The Star has provided two weeks of paid pandemic leave and employees will be able to access accrued annual and long service leave entitlements. Hotel accommodation services remain open in a reduced capacity. The company said it would reveal further details in coming days about cuts to fees and salaries of board members and senior management.

The remaining passengers and crew – believed to be mostly New Zealanders and Britons – will be quarantined on board the Vasco de Gama when it docks on Friday. “All Australians, including the West Australians, will be immediately transferred to Rottnest Island for 14 days of self-isolation,” WA Premier Mark McGowan said on Wednesday. “In the last two days we have cleared the island of visitors and made arrangements for accommodation, catering and security. “We are exercising the Rottnest option now.” There are more than 800 Australians among the passengers and crew on board the Vasco de Gama, and nearly 700 people of other nationalities. No one on the ship is reported to be ill. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, is a tourist hotspot best known for its native quokkas. Cruise & Maritime Voyages managing director Dean Brazier  expressed his disappointment in a media statement on Wednesday afternoon that CMV was not informed of the decision and could notify passengers and their travel agents. “We have followed all protocols to ensure a smooth arrival of Vasco da Gama into Fremantle, and have recorded no health issues with our guests who are on board,” Mr Brazier said. “When they arrive, our guests will have been at sea for 13 days straight without disembarking the ship or being in contact with anyone who was not a guest or crew member of CMV, and we are disappointed that they will now have to wait a further 14 days until they can return home.” It came as Mr McGowan said on Friday another cruise ship anchored off Perth was requesting urgent medical assistance. The West Australian reported that state Health Department officials had boarded the Artania after 25 passengers reported respiratory illnesses. There are 800 passengers and 500 crew onboard. Mr McGowan told the newspaper a passenger no longer onboard later tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, the MSC Magnifica, which left Fremantle on Tuesday for Dubai has turned around to head back after being told it could not dock in the Persian Gulf state. The WA government has ordered it to weigh anchor off the coast. Western Australia reported 30 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, bringing its tally to 205. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has begged people to stay home as that state’s coronavirus tally hit 466. Stage two of national shutdowns were declared on Tuesday night by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. But Mr Andrews signalled Victoria was prepared to go it alone with even tougher measures to fight the spread of the deadly virus. “Lives are absolutely what this is about,” he said. “People won’t just be queuing for Centrelink payments, they will be queuing for heart and lung machines and ventilators and intensive care beds. You cannot queue for intensive care.” Mr Andrews said the list of restrictions announced on Tuesday night was “stage two” of Victoria’s coronavirus response, but warned “there will be a stage three”. “The exact nature of those measures and the timing it occurs, I will stand here and very clearly and directly explain to Victorians what they need to do at that stage,” Mr Andrews said. On Wednesday, he outlined the “stage two” restrictions, and what they meant. “No parties, no outings, no gatherings. There’s just no, no excuse,” he said. “If you can stay at home, you must stay at home. It is very, very simple. “You should not be having friends over for a dinner party; you should not be going out shopping unless you need to. “Kids on school holidays cannot be having friends over.” NSW also reported a spike in coronavirus cases on Wednesday, including its first confirmed infections in young children. Chief health officer Kerry Chant said the number of cases in NSW had increased to 1029 – including a seven-year-old child and a two-month-old baby. Late on Wednesday afternoon, NSW Police announced fines for individuals and corporations found to be breaching new social distancing guidelines. Corporations will be fined $5000 and individuals $1000 on the spot. There will also be extra police on NSW streets to prevent social gatherings."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Virgin cuts domestic flights, stands down thousands of workers","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/virgin-workers-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Virgin Airways is cutting its domestic flight capacity by 90 per cent and grounding 125 planes. The airline’s budget arm TigerAir will also suspend all flights immediately. Virgin, which has already cut all international flights, will also stand down 8000 of its 10000 employees until at least May. The airline said it would try to redeploy workers and encourage them to use leave, but leave without pay was inevitable for many. Virgin Airways chief executive Paul Scurrah said the closure was unprecedented. “There has never been a travel environment in Australia as restricted as the one we see today and the extraordinary steps we’ve taken have been in response to the federal and state government’s latest travel advice,” he said. Virgin’s move comes after most states imposed restrictions on people crossing their borders. The rules aim to further limit movement and control the spread of the coronavirus. People travelling for work and medical reasons will be allowed to cross borders. “We are now facing what will be the biggest grounding of aircraft in this country’s history,” Mr Scurrah said. Virgin’s move follows a decision by rival Qantas last week to stand down two-thirds of its 30,000-strong workforce. Most domestic flights will be suspended from March 27 until June 14. The airline’s previously announced international ban will be in place from March 30 to June 14.

Mr Trump told Fox he “would love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter”. Easter Sunday is April 12. “Wouldn’t it be great to have all of the churches full,” Mr Trump said later. “You’ll have packed churches all over our country.” The US is about halfway through the president’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread” coronavirus plan, under which millions of Americans were urged to stay at home and curb unnecessary travel. On Tuesday, the World Health Organisation warned the US had the potential to become the global epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, citing a “very large acceleration” in infections. The virus has already infected more than 50,000 people in the US and killed at least 660. Mr Trump, who had hoped to build his campaign for the November 3 election on a booming US economy, is now looking at hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths from COVID-19. Economic activity has also ground to a halt in some US states. Late on Sunday, he tweeted: “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” adding that at the end of the 15-day shutdown period, “we will make a decision as to which way we want to go.” One of his senior economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, signalled a possible policy change in an earlier interview with Fox News on Monday: “The president is right. The cure can’t be worse than the disease. We’re going to have to make some difficult trade-offs.” The White House would look at “a number of things”, he said. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has warned that being too hasty to ease limits on travel, socialising and work would cost lives. “If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it’s no contest,” he said on Tuesday. “No American is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,” he said at a convention centre in Manhattan that is being converted into a 1000-bed temporary hospital. New York has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak – its COVID-19 death toll is already 157. The expected need for hospital beds in New York at the peak of the outbreak has jumped to 140,000, Mr Cuomo said. Only 53,000 beds are now available. The worst of the outbreak, known as the apex, could arrive in 14 to 21 days and would put huge pressure on health services, he said. “We’re not slowing it, and it is accelerating on its own,” he said, adding the number of cases was doubling every three days. He predicted similar situations were likely in California, Washington, and Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Mr Trump’s idea and fluctuating response to the COVID-19 crisis. “He’s a notion-monger, just tossing out things that have no relationship to a well co-ordinated, science-based, government-wide response to this,” she said. “Thank god for the governors who are taking the lead in their state. Thank god for some of the people in the administration who speak truth to power.” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, cautioned against prematurely lifting containment rules because of concerns about the economy. “My advice would be to follow medical advice to contain the virus,” he said. “If we can take some pressure off the economy, fine but my primary focus is to make sure the virus is contained and defeated. And we’re just going to have to suffer through the economic consequences.” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Sunday the lockdown affecting large segments of the American public was likely to last 10 to 12 weeks, or until early June. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coles and Woolworths relax fruit, veg specifications as stock tightens","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/coles-and-woolworths-relax-fruit-vegetable-specifications-as-covid-19-and-drought-tightens-stock\/","transcript":"Major supermarkets in Australia have relaxed specifications for fruit and vegetables in an effort to get more fresh produce onto shelves during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coles said it was working with farmers every day to ensure it could get as much of its produce to customers as possible. “We have relaxed specifications around things like cosmetic blemishes, size, and appearance in consultation with our partners,” said a spokesperson from Coles. Woolworths said it was also adapting its specifications for fruit and vegetables. “We are working with all our suppliers to maximise the supply so we can meet this demand,” said Woolworths’ head of produce, Paul Turner. “Our specifications are adaptable so we can respond to the quality, quantity, and availability of produce in the market. “Customers may see some differences in size on some of our fruit and vegetables as we work with our growers to ensure continuity of supply.” Troy Qualischefski from Qualipac Produce in the Lockyer Valley said second-grade vegetables had never been this easy to sell. He said he was currently harvesting broccoli and was having no problems finding a home for it. “The specifications haven’t changed in our business, but what has happened is that the second-grade product — that in an oversupplied market never used to have a home — all of a sudden has a value,” he said. “So we are able to move some out-of-spec products through other avenues. “The weather has been quite kind for harvesting so we haven’t had a lot of second-grade product, but what we do have is quite easy to sell — say, a pumpkin with a growth crack or something like that.” Mr Qualischefski said the shortage of fruit and vegetables was not just due to COVID-19. “A lot of the shortages [of fruit and vegetables] are still from overhang of the drought and it’s come coupled with the coronavirus. That’s where the extremely high prices have come from,” he said. “We know ourselves our production is down about 50 per cent due to the drought for the next six weeks, and then we’ll start to ramp up now we’ve had rain. “COVID-19 has probably helped demand a little bit, but the shortages would still have been there regardless.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus bans explained: Half hour haircut ok, funeral or wedding is not","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-hairdresser-wedding-funerals\/","transcript":"A visibly exhausted PM fumbled over the word barre, spelling out each letter instead and admitting he didn’t know what the ballet-style workout was as he announced it would be banned.

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach agreed to hold the Games by next northern summer at the latest, making it the first such delay in its 124-year modern history. Their decision came a day after the World Health Organisation warned the global pandemic had been “accelerating” and with decisive action its trajectory could be altered. Though a huge blow to Japan, which has invested $US12 billion ($A20 billion) in the run-up, the Olympics’ return in 2021 will serve as a celebration of triumph over the coronavirus, a statement announcing the decision read. The IOC conceded on Wednesday morning (Australian time) the coronavirus not only presented an “unprecedented challenge for mankind” but an unprecedented challenge for the Games. With some athletes and sporting bodies angry that a seemingly inevitable decision had taken so long, others took to social media to express their relief at the announcement. Training would continue for Jamaican Olympian, Michael Gunning, who posted a “home workout” video showing how he will get through “these challenging times”. COVID-19 had presented health risks and disruption to many athletes’ training as gyms, stadia and swimming pools shut down around the world. Check out my ‘home workout’ video I filmed today for the @OlympicChannel 🏡 During these challenging times, it’s important to pull together & remember we are all in the same boat all around the world! ❤️🌏 Let me know what you think @Olympics #staystrong #stayactive #stayhealthy pic.twitter.com\/h1KWlLh9xQ — Michael Gunning (@MichaelGunning1) March 24, 2020 The delay also came 122 days before the planned opening ceremony at Japan’s newly-built National Stadium, which was to usher in the 16-day carnival of sport featuring 11,000 athletes from 206 nations and territories. The Olympic flame, already lit at Olympia in Greece and carried around Japan in a now-cancelled torch relay, would stay in the host nation until then as a symbol of hope. “This Olympic flame will be the light at the end of this tunnel,” IOC president Mr Bach said. Australian double Olympic champion swimmer Cate Campbell said she was reeling but ready for the new challenge. “The goalposts haven’t disappeared – just shifted,” she said, after Australia had said it would not go to Tokyo 2020 if it went ahead. The coronavirus outbreak has raged around the world since early this year, infecting nearly 380,000 people and wrecking sports events from the European soccer championships to Formula One motor racing. Despite their disappointment, not to mention the logistical headaches and financial losses coming, a poll indicated that about 70 per cent of Japanese agreed with a delay. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters the delayed Games would still be branded “Tokyo 2020”. In a crowded sporting calendar, which will be making up for this year’s cancellations, World Athletics said it was willing to move its world championships, scheduled for August 6-15, 2021, in Oregon, to clear a path for the Olympics. The Athletics Association said a poll of more than 4000 track and field competitors had indicated that 78 per cent had wanted the Games to be delayed. It was not yet clear whether the athletes who had already secured spots in Tokyo this summer – more than half of those due to compete – would need to qualify again. Postponing the Olympics is also a heavy blow that is almost certain to push Japan’s persistently weak economy, the world’s third-largest, into recession. Though it was the first Olympics’ postponement, they were cancelled outright three times during the two 20th century World Wars. Major Cold War boycotts also disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"States and territories are closing borders to slow COVID-19, but is it legal?","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-border-close-legal\/","transcript":"As Australian states and territories move to seal off their borders to slow the spread of COVID-19, questions have been raised over whether the extreme action is legal under our Constitution. So far Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have closed borders, meaning anyone who arrives from interstate will need to self-isolate for 14 days with exemptions for essential services and health workers. Queensland’s borders will be closed from midnight on Wednesday, while Victoria, the ACT and New South Wales remain open for now. In some circumstances, yes. Under Section 92 of the Constitution, it states: This means Australians should be “absolutely free” to move across state and territory borders. But Anne Twomey, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney, said the term ‘absolutely free’ could change during a dangerous pandemic. “It has always been subject to an understanding that the states and Commonwealth can enact laws that protect things like public health,” Professor Twomey told The New Daily. Although the prospect of state border closures might appear dramatic, the measure is nothing new. During the devastating Spanish flu pandemic in 1919, the border between Victoria and NSW was closed after a soldier contracted the disease from an infected passenger during a train journey from Melbourne to Sydney. “The Spanish flu is the last time such an incredibly serious type of pandemic happened, so that’s a reasonable comparator,” Professor Twomey said. “It just goes to show that in a crisis, things change. “Most of these crises are defence issues, like in World War II. The way the High Court has interpreted the defence power is that it waxes and wanes and expands during a time of war. And in times of peace, it shrinks.” More recently, before the coronavirus reached Australia, border restrictions and quarantine zones already existed in every state and territory to stop diseases or pests from infecting crops. For example, interstate travellers are banned from bringing certain fruits into Queensland due to fruit fly epidemics. Of all the states and territories that have introduced border closures to manage the spread of COVID-19, Queensland has the toughest rules. In other states like Tasmania, border restrictions mean visitors must spend two weeks in self-isolation. But in Queensland, visitors will be denied entry. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the state’s border would only remain open to freight and essential travel, and some residents who work on either side of the border. Professor Twomey said the move was “a bit more controversial”. “I think Queensland has gone further by saying they’re not going to let certain people in,” Professor Twomey said. “If there is going to be a (legal) challenge, it’s more likely to be the types of laws that prevent people from coming into the state rather than laws that say you can come in, but you need to self-isolate. “I suspect at this stage in the game, people are more concerned about protecting their health than running off to court.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Centrelink success: What to do if coronavirus has impacted your job","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-jobs-centrelink\/","transcript":"When Jael Lorenzon saw a text message appear from her boss, her stomach sank. “We’re starting to cut shifts,” it read. The 22-year-old hospitality worker suddenly found herself among hundreds of thousands of Australians left unemployed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. “I got fired and I thought, ‘Oh my God, what am I going to do?'” Ms Lorenzon, who lives in a Melbourne share house, told The New Daily. “I’m new to being a full adult and paying rent by myself.” As Australia enters lockdown and ‘non-essential’ businesses like restaurants and bars close, employers around the nation have been forced to stand down more than 80,000 workers to try to stay afloat. At least one million people could lose their jobs, the federal government has estimated. The hardest-hit areas will be arts and recreation (40 per cent of jobs), hospitality (29 per cent) and construction (eight per cent).

To ensure it doesn’t crash again, MyGov’s capacity has been increased from 55,000 users to 150,000, Social Services Minister Anne Ruston told reporters on Tuesday. On Tuesday morning, 123,000 people were logged on to the website. If you have lost your job recently, you are not alone. The devastating effect COVID-19 is having on the Australian economy means many will struggle financially. But there are some things you can do to try to soften the blow. If you’re worried about not being able to afford rent, let your landlord know, Ms Lorenzon said. You might be able to negotiate a period of reduced rent. “We pay rent every month and I’m trying to be as prepared as much as possible and keep my landlord informed before that month ends,” Ms Lorenzon said. During a press conference on Tuesday, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said landlords needed to show common sense and compassion during the coronavirus pandemic. “They’re going to lose their tenants if they insist on people paying money that they simply don’t have,” Mr Albanese told reporters in Canberra. “And in the long run, a good tenant, whether it be business or in housing, can provide stability for the landlord as well.” Before you apply for a welfare payment via Centrelink, make sure you know what you are entitled to receive. “It’s good to be as informed as possible so when you go to Centrelink, you know what they have to give you,” Ms Lorenzon said. “If you’re an Australian citizen and you’re in the same situation as I am, the government is there and it’s supposed to be helping you in these situations.” To avoid standing in a long queue all day with potentially infected people, do not attend Centrelink. Start your application over the phone or online instead. “No one (should be lining up) unless you don’t have a phone or you don’t have internet access – you can ring up or you can go online,” Ms Ruston told the ABC.

But be prepared to wait – accessing Centrelink can take a painfully long time. And given the recent surge in demand, it’s likely phone lines will be jammed even more. Ms Lorenzon said she knows it’s hard to stay positive about the future given the circumstances, but it’s important to have hope. “I’d advise people to get help and don’t be discouraged because at the end of the day, you’re going to have to be paying rent,” she said. “It might be a long road for us to get help, but at least we have it.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Modelling coronavirus deaths: What the government didn't tell us","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-deaths-clive-williams\/","transcript":"Perhaps the federal government should have released its COVID-19 modelling to get the attention of those who were ignoring the “safe distance” rule. Although the death rate for under 40s has reportedly been quite low, there is still the possibility of them acquiring long-term lung damage and being a serious threat to the over 70s. The 1919 “Spanish flu” killed about 14,000 people in Australia, mostly aged between 15 and 35. Paradoxically, young and healthy people died because the second wave of mutated Spanish flu effectively used people’s immune systems against them. This meant that it killed mainly young healthy people while those with less effective immune systems – the very young and elderly – survived. People who caught the Spanish flu in its first wave built immunity and were much less likely to be killed by the second wave. COVID-19 is a different type of virus that causes death when the lungs become filled with inflammatory material, which is why a small percentage of those who get it need ventilators to survive. Based on overseas statistics, most of those dying from COVID-19 are aged over 70 and have other health problems. COVID-19 could potentially kill around the same number of Australians as the Spanish flu. Australia’s population is now about 25 million, compared to five million in 1919. If you say half of the population was to catch COVID-19 and one in 1000 died (a low estimate) that would be 12,500 deaths. (Seasonal flu can kill 3500 people in a “normal” year.) COVID-19 is therefore roughly one-fifth as lethal as the Spanish flu and potentially about five times more deadly than seasonal flu. The Spanish flu killed 50 per cent of the Indigenous people who caught it, which suggests they could be far more vulnerable to COVID-19. Data from China’s COVID-19 epidemic compiled by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, based on 44,672 cases as of February 11, showed a steep curve towards older people dying. The fatality rate was insignificant for those aged under 10, 0.2 per cent for those 10 to 39, 0.4 per cent for 40 to 49, 1.3 per cent for 50 to 59, 3.6 per cent for 60 to 69, 8 per cent for 70 to 79, and 14 per cent for those aged over 80. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that, out of more than 2000 deaths in Italy, 99.8 per cent of those who died had at least one pre-existing condition, with the average person having 2.7. Many could not get access to ventilators because the health system was simply overwhelmed by the number of dangerously ill people. The Australian policy is to flatten the infection curve to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and there are enough ventilators for those who need them. In Israel they are trying to develop ventilators for home use to alleviate the burden on ICUs. Perhaps Australia should also be looking at ways to enhance the number of home ventilators in case the disease spikes more quickly here than expected. What younger people need to realise is that while they are not likely to be as badly affected themselves by COVID-19 – or may not even be aware they have the disease (true in 17.9 per cent of cases) – failure to take the disease seriously could inadvertently cause the deaths of their parents or grandparents.

This is what frontline workers need you to know","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/25\/coronavirus-healthcare-australia\/","transcript":"Australia’s healthcare workers are preparing for the biggest fight they’ve ever had. They are not armed with enough medical resources. The enemy is invisible, swift and deadly. In many countries, COVID-19 is already winning. Dr Isabelle Osborne works in the emergency ward of a busy Sydney hospital, which on Monday had its first coronavirus death. “I don’t think I’m a particularly anxious person in life, but for the last few weeks, I have been scared. Really scared,” Dr Osborne told The New Daily. “I’ve read thousands of accounts from doctors in Italy, and I’ve seen the videos of their wards right now. “I don’t want to go to work every day in an environment like that. But I’m probably going to have to soon.” Australia is in a unique position – we know what is coming. In the next week we can limit the curve, and stop the stress on our health system. But it will take every single one of us for it to be successful.  “I know there’s a lot of confusion and differing information coming from the Prime Minister and the premiers at the moment but just keep it as simple as possible – just don’t leave your house,’’ Dr Osborne said. “Just don’t leave it unless you absolutely have to.” The personal protecting equipment (PPE) frontline staff have been given “isn’t good enough’’ but it’s all they’ve got, she said. “Don’t make my colleagues and me go to work in the hell that Italy is in right now. We’re only a few precious weeks behind them. Please.” Many hospitals around the country are preparing for staff treating non-COVID-19 patients to forgo their protective wear so those in the direct line of fire can stay safe. In some hospitals around the country, members of the public have made this harder by stealing PPE. “Hand sanitiser, gloves and masks are being stolen from my hospital,” said Sophie Hadden, who is an emergency nurse who works in Melbourne. “We are having to lock it up, which defeats the purpose of PPE. If healthcare workers cannot perform effective hand hygiene, we risk spreading disease,” Ms Hadden said. The reality is there just isn’t enough to go around, she said. “If we cannot protect ourselves, we cannot protect you,” Ms Hadden said. “Our stock is limited because production cannot keep up with demand, and current predictions estimate that we will run out. “Wash your damn hands. Cough into your elbow. Stay home if you’re sick.” Rachel Wilson, a neonatal intensive care nurse in Melbourne is also concerned there is not enough protective wear to go around if the pandemic gets out of control. “Being a frontline healthcare worker at the moment is scary. We don’t know when or if this is going to explode” Ms Wilson said. “I’m prepared to have to work in areas of the hospital that I’m not used to working in.” Ms Wilson is a single mum and spent 14 days self-isolating before returning to her regular 12-hour shifts. She needs to keep her small family safe – but she needs the public to help. “Nurses are generally people who always put the needs of our patients before our own, and we are prepared to do what it takes when this pandemic takes hold,” Ms Wilson said. Last week, there were widespread reports of panic-buying. And although supermarkets have taken measures to limit purchases, many shelves are still empty. Buying up all the food actually exacerbates the problem, Ms Hadden said. “From a purely pragmatic point of view, if vulnerable people are not able to access basic needs and services, they end up taking up a hospital bed,” she said. “If your hoarding means the homeless person with mental health and addiction issues can’t get a tin of beans, they’ll be presenting to hospital earlier than you, a healthy person, and I will be giving them my care and attention. “That means I may not have a bed for you.” They all have one simple message: Stay at home, wash your hands frequently, don’t touch your face and support each other. Those are the only things that will stop this. “You don’t need that much toilet paper,” said New South Wales operating room nurse, Dan Gamble. “This is serious. People are going to get sick, wash your hands and keep your distance. “Don’t waste your PPE by wearing it in the car when you’re driving around on your own.” He said a handy hint to stop you touching your face is to pretend it is covered in poo. “Basically think of it like this: You are covered in poo – you can’t see the poo but it’s there. “Every time you scratch that itch on your nose, swat that fly away, rub your temples, you are rubbing poo. “Or in this case what could be COVID-19, all over your face, then breathing it in.” Another Perth nurse, who did not want to be named, said patients who did not have COVID-19 symptoms, where possible, should stay away from hospital. And if you are showing COVID-19 symptoms make sure your forewarn the medical staff. “I need you from today to reduce coming to hospitals because I realise that’s another way to reduce community transmission of COVID-19,” she said. “If you are also displaying symptoms of COVID-19, the health care staff need you to be honest about it before paramedics arrive or before you attend the Emergency Department. “So we have a little bit more time to all be wearing personal protective equipment. “We aren’t going to be able to get it perfect all the time. “This is because we are limited in our resources of personal protective equipment and this is something we are currently trying to increase before community transmission cases increase.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Large gatherings cut down to size with tighter coronavirus restrictions","date":"03-25-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/25\/large-gatherings-tighter-coronavirus-restrictions\/","transcript":"Weddings and funerals will be strictly limited in size, and brothels, nail salons, tattoo parlours and open house inspections shut down across Australia under draconian new laws to stop the spread of COVID-19. The new bans, which were unveiled by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday night, are set to throw thousands more Australians onto the long lines of unemployed workers now queuing up outside Centrelink offices. But they will allow hairdressers to stay open for now – if they can cut, colour or blow-dry hair in just 30 minutes before customers are booted out the door. The Prime Minister defended the arrangements as a desperate attempt to balance limiting the spread of the coronavirus with saving jobs. Mr Morrison described the decisions he had been forced to make and the jobs lost as “heartbreaking events in our nation’s history”. Under the new rules, brides and grooms will be forced to marry with just two wedding guests to witness the event. The PM also claimed the ‘four-square-metre rule’ would have to be observed but did not stipulate if he meant between the bride and groom. “Now, weddings can continue to be conducted where it is just the couple, the celebrant and the witnesses,” Mr Morrison said. “No more than five people. And the four-square-metre rule has to be observed within the venue in which that is taking place.” Funerals will also be subject to size limits that could see relatives banned from attending. “No more than 10 persons observing the rules around the four-square-metre rule and the social distancing practices,” Mr Morrison said. “This is not an easy decision. “Some of the events that have been some of the major transmitting events, it has been exactly these types of events, particularly weddings. “And that is why, regretfully, we have to be able to put these arrangements in place …  from midnight tomorrow night.” Social distancing doesn’t mean losing contact with those you love.

Auctions and open house inspections will be banned across the nation. The Prime Minister also confirmed that nail and waxing salons, tattoo parlours and beauty therapists will join cinemas, nightclubs, casinos, gambling and adult entertainment venues in being ordered to be shut down. The Prime Minister’s office confirmed after the press conference that Mr Morrison’s reference to “adult entertainment” was a ban on strip clubs, sex clubs and brothels. Indoor and outdoor play centres will also join community and recreation centres, health clubs, fitness centres, saunas and wellness centres in closing, yet fitness boot camps of up to 10 people will be allowed as long as it’s outside. The laundry list of new regulations was attacked as too complicated by critics including cricketer Shane Warne, who said Australian should simply be in lockdown now as is the case in Britain.

Then it’s essentially not essential I can’t be clearer’,” Warne tweeted. “Plus people can buy a new shirt at a shopping centre? WTF? PM just had a shocker. Surely should be in lockdown now.” Mr Morrison insisted his message wasn’t complicated. “Stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary you go out,” Mr Morrison said. “Going out for the basics, going out for an exercise, perhaps with your partner or family members, provided it’s a small group, that’s fine.” Mr Morrison also flagged more schools would start the April school holidays early with pupil-free days to prepare for distance education and more online learning. “Schools, the medical advice on schools has not changed. It is safe to send your children to school,” he said. “There has been discussions today between the Education Minister Dan Tehan and the education national unions, and I will be meeting with them tomorrow [Wednesday] to discuss a set of arrangements we would like to proceed with, that importantly keep schools open, that also will protect those teachers and other staff who are working in schools. “So we can do this. We can work this out. “Schools, we agree, across the country would need to reopen on the other side of the term break because it won’t be a holiday. “They will reconvene after the term break and there will be a mixture of both distance learning and where parents choose to keep their children at home.” Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said he accepted the new rules were tough. “These measures are really draconian. We know that,” Professor Murphy said. “But if we’re going to control community transmission, we have to stop the capacity of this virus from spreading from person to person. “And I have said many times, it is a long haul and that is why we are keen to keep society functioning but keep society safe.” The new rules also include:"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Real estate auctions, open for inspections banned as restrictions tightened","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/24\/real-estate-auctions-coronavirus-restrictions-tightened\/","transcript":"All real estate auctions and open house inspections will be cancelled and a ban placed on Australians travelling overseas amid tougher restrictions on gatherings of people in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus. In an wide-ranging update on Tuesday night that encompassed weddings, funerals, personal training, hairdressers, schools and overseas travel, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he would not be “cavalier” when considering the effect of business disruptions and closures on people’s lives and livelihoods. “We’re trying to limit the gathering of people in large numbers that can relate to the transmission of that virus,” Mr Morrison said. This included banning Australians from travelling overseas, and introducing a new offence of profiteering that stops people from exporting goods such as medical supplies and masks. Highlighting the need to increase social distancing practices, Mr Morrison warned that people should stay inside unless they have to venture out for essential groceries or medical supplies. The measures to crack down on large gatherings include restricting wedding ceremonies to only five participants [the couple, their celebrant and two witnesses] and limiting funerals to a maximum of 10 mourners. But the measures on schools remain unchanged. This means it is safe to send children to school until the end of the term, but schools will reopen after the term break with a mix of distance learning and in-school learning for all “essential workers”. The national coronavirus cabinet of state and Commonwealth leaders also agreed to a lengthy list of business changes that will be enacted from midnight on Wednesday. They include: Health-related personal services, such as physiotherapy, will be allowed to keep running. State governments will also be policing large social gatherings in public spaces and in people’s houses. “Going out for the basics, going out for exercise, perhaps with your partner or family members provided it’s a small group, that’s fine,” Mr Morrison said. “Barbecues of lots of friends or even … extended family coming together to celebrate one-year-old birthday parties and all these sorts of things – we can’t do those things now. “If you’re gathering together in a group, say 10 people, outside together in a group, that’s not OK.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bored with home isolation?

In idea inspired by the classic children’s book We’re Going on a Bear Hunt, the teddy bears give bored youngsters something to spot while they’re social distancing but out for a well-spaced walk. The idea started in London, but has since spread around the world. It has been embraced in parts of the US, and adopted in New Zealand (which goes into lockdown on Wednesday) and Australia. It has come to a recent stop in Britain, which is about to go into a restrictive lockdown to try to halt the spread of the virus. But the posts still keep coming to Bear Hunt Facebook pages.  Posted by Lesley Newton on Monday, March 23, 2020 Melbourne woman Melissa Kleynhans started her own version of the bear hunt with a Facebook page where keen kids and home owners can record their sightings. “My three-year-old loves to go on a bear hunt and with the whole social distancing, and it’s such a tragic time for our nation, I thought it would be something fun for the community to get involved in,” she told Melbourne’s 3AW radio on Tuesday. Ms Kleynhans said her neighbourhood have embraced the idea, and she wanted people elsewhere to get involved, too. “Heaps of children are coming out at random times with their families, going on their little bear hunt and counting the bears,” she said. “Take the kids on a bear hunt, get them out and enjoying some fresh air, and help us parents out as well to keep our kids a little bit entertained.” For the hunt to work, bears must be visible from the road – children and families also need to be able to see them without interacting with others."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Supermarkets bring in new health measures","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/coronavirus-supermarkets-woolworths-coles\/","transcript":"Supermarkets are increasing precautions with Woolworths going as far as to install protective screens at its checkouts and Coles bringing in a range of health measures. Woolworths announced this week it was “rapidly” introducing a range of measures to ensure the health and safety of staff and customers. The most noticeable of those will be clear plastic screens that will be rolled out at manned checkouts of every Woolworths store in Australia. They’ve already been installed at Woolworths Town Hall and North Kellyville in New South Wales. The measure has also been adopted in the UK by Aldi and Morrisons, as the country goes into lockdown. It follows the rollout over the weekend of security guards for every Woolworths supermarket. “As our team members continue providing for the community, we will do everything necessary to uphold public health and safety in our stores,” Woolworths Supermarkets managing director Claire Peters said. Coles wants shoppers to pack their own groceries to help limit the spread of coronavirus. The supermarket giant has written to customers with a new set of rules aimed at keeping its stores safe for shoppers and staff. People have been told they must not enter stores if they are sick, and should handle their own bags and pack their own groceries to limit the risk of spreading the virus. They have also been asked to wash or sanitise their hands before entering stores and shoppers must stay 1.5 metres away from others at all times. Special directions will be provided at checkouts to make sure people in queues don’t get too close together. The retailer is spending an extra $1 million a week on extra cleaning and security guards, with special attention paid to sanitising high contact surfaces including trolleys, baskets, and checkout areas. And customers are being encouraged to pay via tap-and-go. Masks and gloves are not being recommended for shopping, in line with health department advice. Bakery departments are also making changes, with items including bread baked on site to be pre-wrapped to ensure products are not contaminated. “Finally, we’ll be regularly rotating our teams on checkouts throughout the day to help keep everyone safer,” Coles said in a letter to customers on Friday. “Please respect the guidelines we’re putting in place as your health and safety remains a priority to us.” The moves are being mirrored across the retail industry. Bunnings has announced it is providing its staff with gloves and sanitiser and will increase in-store cleaning for counters, trolleys and baskets. The hardware chain is closing water fountains and employ tap-and-go payment where possible. All supermarkets are encouraging shoppers to practise social distancing – Coles and Woolies are recommending the length of a trolley as a safe guideline. Aldi is limiting the number of shoppers allowed in the aisles at one time in selected stores – if this is a store near you, the supermarket asks to allow those less able or who require assistance to enter ahead of you. The key message continues to be: Keep a safe distance from others, wash your hands, make use of hand sanitiser in store, and don’t go to the shop if you’re feeling unwell. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus workout: Chris Hemsworth launches app free trial","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/03\/24\/coronavirus-workout-chris-hemsworth\/","transcript":"By now, those of us working from home or practising social distancing by staying mostly indoors have realised the threat of constant grazing.

The New Daily spoke to exercise scientist and author Craig Harper at the time about how to do the workout, and who it can benefit. “What’s good about this is it requires almost no skill and it actually involves a lot of muscles, so there’s almost a full body experience in a short amount of time,” Harper told TND in 2018. “It’s very, very practical. No equipment, no resources, no needing 300 square metres of space.” The Hemsworth choice of exercises are also key. “One is upper body, one lower body and so you’re covering all of your muscle groups,” Mr Harper said. “Because you’re doing it non-stop for a couple of minutes there’s a cardiovascular benefit. “On the hour, you’re giving your metabolism a bit of a kick and waking up your nervous and muscular and cardiovascular systems.”  Hi there all, during this period of self isolation and uncertainty, I am offering six weeks of my health and fitness program @Centrfit for FREE!

If you did this every hour for eight hours a day, that’s 16 minutes a day. “So it’s not like it’s a big commitment. You could do it at work.

Although some industries are more susceptible to the direct effects of the coronavirus lockdown, the damage it has caused to consumer confidence means almost every business will feel some pressure. Economists at Westpac bank predict the disruption will claim 814,000 jobs by the end of June. Fortunately, Australia has a number of support and relief agencies ready to provide much-needed relief and help workers stretch their money a little bit further. Australians have access to a range of different support services to assist with their finances. Centrelink Australia’s at-times controversial social security network, Centrelink, will be crucial to many workers whose income is affected by the coronavirus. Workers who lose their jobs during the crisis will have access to the ‘Jobseeker Payment‘ (formerly known as Newstart), in addition to a temporary coronavirus supplement of $550 a fortnight from April 27. The supplement will be paid to new and existing recipients of qualifying Centrelink payments for the next six months. The government has waived the payment’s asset test and waiting period, and expanded its eligibility to include full-time employees and sole traders who have been temporarily stood down or lost significant amounts of income. An income test of $1075 a fortnight will apply – meaning that workers earning below this threshold will be eligible for the full $550 supplement. Australians who are already on income support will automatically receive the new supplement and need not apply for it. But those who don’t already have a Services Australia customer service number will need to call them on 132 850 to get one, before applying for the payment online through their MyGov account. Casual workers over the age of 22 can also apply for the Sickness Allowance. And existing welfare recipients who don’t qualify for the coronavirus supplement will receive a second payment of $750 directly into their bank accounts. Mortgage relief Australia’s major banks have offered to defer home loan repayments for six months in the event of financial hardship. Home owners should contact their banks if they believe they will have trouble meeting their repayments. It’s worth noting, though, that the interest owed on your loan will continue accruing during this repayment holiday – meaning you will have more debt to pay off once the pause is lifted. Households struggling to meet utility costs should also contact their energy providers. Early access to super New measures will allow workers under financial stress to access $20,000 from their superannuation savings. Workers or sole traders who have lost at least 20 per cent of their hours or income will be able to access their super. As will unemployed Australians and those already receiving certain benefits. From mid-April, eligible individuals will be able to apply for early access through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). They will be able to access the first $10,000 before July 1, and the next $10,000 for three months after that date. Fund managers, however, have cautioned members against using the scheme as it involves crystallising losses by selling shares into a crashing market. National Debt Helpline The National Debt Helpline provides financial counselling to Australians. These financial counsellors provide a range of useful services – from budgeting tips to negotiating payment plans with creditors. Kasy Chambers, executive director of Anglicare Australia, added the presence of a counsellor helps workers negotiate payment plans with their banks, phone companies and others. “Banks, landlords, credit agencies and utilities companies are much more open to working with someone who has a financial counsellor around,” she said. “It shows the banks that that person is serious about doing something.” AFCA The Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) is hardly the first point of call for workers facing hard times. But for workers who can’t get their insurance company to honour a claim, or who have been treated unfairly by a bank, the organisation provides mediation and can take legal action if necessary. AFCA has already received several complaints about insurance companies following the coronavirus outbreak, and have provided guidance for customers on their website. For some, the financial support on offer might not be enough. In other cases, affected workers might not qualify for payments large enough to cover their expenses. Food relief networks Australia has a multitude of food relief organisations, including Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite. In addition to these large-scale providers, many local community groups provide similar services. These can be found by searching the Department of Social Services’ website. Ms Chambers told The New Daily this type of support is especially important because it frees up money to spend on other essential services, such as rent. Community Facebook groups It’s not just charities and government services providing help to those who need it. The grand Australian tradition of mateship is alive and well on the internet, Ms Chambers said. Many neighbourhoods have Facebook groups dedicated to lending a helping hand to local residents. These groups are typically named after the neighbourhood to which they belong, and are sometimes called ‘buy nothing’ groups or ‘good karma networks’. Members of the community use them to share excess food with one another, or to ask for small favours without money changing hands."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Crock of you know what': Centrelink chaos continues","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/centrelink-jobless-coronavirus-chaos\/","transcript":"Centrelink has been slammed for offering “a crock of you know what” after Liberal frontbencher Stuart Robert admitted he failed to predict 100,000 new clients would crash its website – before also dishing out incorrect advice about securing benefits. As newly laid-off workers queued in the rain on Tuesday to enlist for welfare benefits, Mr Robert, the Government Services Minister, urged them to stop and “just go online”. But it quickly emerged that Centrelink clients could not apply for benefits unless they had a Customer Reference Number (CRN), which could not be obtained without visiting an office. Social Services Minister Anne Ruston then emerged to urge the newly unemployed to phone Centrelink to get a CRN. Earlier, Mr Robert said Centrelink’s MyGov website usually had about 6000 concurrent users and had prepared for 50,000 after the federal government introduced coronavirus restrictions on businesses. In the days since, demand has quickly outstripped capacity. “I didn’t think I’d have to prepare for 100,000 concurrent users,” he told Alan Jones on Sydney’s 2GB radio. “My bad for not realising the sheer scale of the decision on Sunday night by the national leaders that literally saw hundreds and hundreds of thousands, maybe a million people, unemployed overnight. “Of course we can do better. You don’t need to queue up for Centrelink. Just go online to MyGov.” But just hours later, broadcaster Ray Hadley lashed the Morrison government, revealing he had been “inundated” by callers telling him that applying online was not possible. “Therein lies the problem. No one answers the phone,” he said. “Then you get cut off after 1.5 hours waiting. “The information coming from the Minister is a crock of you know what. It’s an absolute bit of BS because you can’t get a CRN from going to the MyGov website. And if you ring that number you will wait for long time – hours and hours. I am afraid it’s in complete disarray.” Senator Anne Ruston confirmed new clients had previously been required to go to a Centrelink office in person to secure a CRN. They will now be able to provide proof of identity over the phone. Centrelink customers must have a CRN before benefits will be paid. “You can ring up any of our Centrelink call centres, you can say, identify yourself, we will not require you to provide any physical demonstration,” Senator Ruston said. “We will only require you to actually advise us and we’ll take your word for it, understanding these are exceptional circumstances and we don’t want people attending Centrelink sites in person. “Then you can go online and register through MyGov or, equally, if you don’t want to do that, you can remain on the phone and do your application on the phone. Asked whether that meant people would no longer need to queue to sign up for benefits, she said: “I’m assuming so.” “I’ve been speaking to my colleague, Minister Robert, who is responsible for government services, about making sure that we are staying ahead of the demand,” she said. But, several hours later the MyGov website had still not been updated with the new advice. Labor frontbencher Linda Burney described as a “ridiculous performance” Mr Robert’s initial claim on Monday that MyGov had been the subject of a cyberattack. He later admitted the site had crashed under the large volume of new clients. “Ministers need to be absolutely across their portfolio,” she said. She said a dedicated Centrelink hotline was needed for people seeking information. “There are up to 10 numbers you ring for different payments and, whether it’s unemployment, disability, age pension – that has to be a single number in my view. “There needs to be an understanding that people will queue today because they are confused. They are confused as to whether they have to attend Centrelink offices or whether they have to go online, and whether everyone has the capacity to go online.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cruise ship passenger dies of coronavirus in Sydney hospital","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/coronavirus-fatality-cruise-ship\/","transcript":"Australia has its eighth coronavirus fatality, with the death of a woman from the Ruby Princess cruise ship that docked in Sydney last week. The woman, aged in her 70s, died in a NSW hospital on Tuesday morning. “This patient was one of the three initial passengers who were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive following testing of retained specimens from on board the Ruby Princess,” NSW Health said on Tuesday afternoon. There are now confirmed 107 diagnosed COVID-19 cases in NSW from the ship, which docked in Sydney last Thursday. There are a further 26 cases interstate from people who were on board, bringing the total number of infections from the Ruby Princess to 133. NSW is at a “critical” stage as the number of COVID-19 cases soars past 800, with Premier Gladys Berejiklian warning people who ignore social distancing rules will receive harsh penalties. “We don’t want to go down the path that other nations have gone down,” she said. The latest death came as Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein banned non-essential visitors from entering the state via the Spirit of Tasmania ferry in tightened coronavirus measures. “Do not come. We will turn you around and ask you to go back,” he said on Tuesday. In WA, where the MSC Magnifica refuelled at Fremantle early on Tuesday, Australian Border Force and WA Police officers were there to ensure no one disembarked before the ship left for Dubai later in the day. Premier Mark McGowan said at least 250 of the Magnifica’s more than 1700 passengers had upper respiratory problems. Both ships berthed after federal Health Minister Greg Hunt issued an emergency biosecurity order on March 18 preventing cruise vessels from docking in Australia for a month. There were 13 passenger cruise ships still at sea at the time. Of those, the Voyager of the Seas and the Ovation of the Seas docked on March 18, the Ruby Princess on March 19, and the Celebrity Solstice docked on March 20. Passengers from each of those ships have since tested positive for coronavirus. Meanwhile, Mr Hunt said on Tuesday that Australians will be able to bulk-bill phone or video hook-ups with GPs, specialists, mental health and allied health professionals from next week as health authorities work to contain the rapid spread of the coronavirus. “That is an extremely important development,” he said. Currently, only vulnerable Australians – including like older people or those with compromised immune systems – are eligible to bulk-bill Telehealth. “This has been one of the most significant changes we’ve seen in Australian general practice in my working lifetime of 35 years,” Australia’s principal medical adviser Michael Kidd said. The federal government has expanded telehealth services to allow vulnerable GPs to provide services from home. AMA president Tony Bartone welcomed the changes for GPs, saying they would keep both patients and doctors safe. “We’re still going to need to see those patients in a face-to-face environment,” Dr Bartone told Nine News. “We can’t replace everything through a video chat or through a phone call.” Two Victorians being treated for coronavirus are in intensive care, after 64 cases were diagnosed overnight. Six cases are believed to have been acquired through community transmission. Tuesday’s increased tally came as government schools were closed, courts were empty and most of the Victorian hospitality industry was crumbling on the second day of the state’s shutdown. A 500-strong police taskforce has also been set up to manage the shutdown. Premier Daniel Andrews said the measures were tough, but were necessary to curb the spread of the deadly illness. “People have got to step up and take this seriously otherwise we’re going to finish up in a really difficult situation and frankly, if people don’t want to take my word for it, turn your TV on – have a look at Italy, have a look at Spain, have a look at France,” Mr Andrews told Triple M Melbourne on Tuesday. The state will close its borders from midnight Wednesday o people not travelling for work, medical appointments or carrying freight. Details of the closure came as Queensland recorded another 78 cases of coronavirus. Border travel will be policed in an RBT-style with officers to determine who needs to cross. Travelling across the NSW border from Tweed to Coolangatta for work is allowed. Travel to work, the supermarket, the pharmacy and to get petrol is classed as essential. “People should stay in their own state,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Tuesday. A $4 billion package has also been announced to cover the state’s additional health needs and relieve financial pressure on households and businesses. It includes $1.2 billion to immediately double Queensland’s intensive care capacity, triple its emergency department capacity and provide more paramedics. Meanwhile, the US’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention revealed the coronavirus continued to survive for 17 days on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship that quarantined in Japan last month. The virus “was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the Diamond Princess but before disinfection procedures had been conducted,” the researchers wrote, adding that the finding doesn’t necessarily mean the virus spread by surface. As of Tuesday morning, there were 1823 cases of the coronavirus. There have been eight fatalities: Seven in NSW and one in WA.

Both Beenleigh Rum Distillery and Bundaberg Rum Distillery are using existing production lines and staff to make the hard-to-come-by liquid. Queensland Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning Cameron Dick thanked the distilleries for stepping into the breach to supply sanitiser to schools and frontline workers. Australian cricket great Shane Warne halted production of gin at the SevenZeroEight distillery that he co-owns to make medical-grade hand sanitiser for hospitals. “This is a challenging time for Australians and we all need to do what we can to help our healthcare system combat this disease and save lives,” Warne said on his Instagram page. Tasmanian gin distillery, Southern Wild, says it is ready to shift its entire business to a not-for profit producer of hand-sanitiser-for-schools if it gets the go ahead from the state government. Southern Wild owner George Burgess on Friday said the company was well positioned to begin making sanitiser immediately. The Bellarine Brewing Co in Victoria says it is ready and able to start producing hand sanitisers, and is hoping the Australian Taxation Office can fast track the required permit. Brewing Co director Tim Page-Walker told News Corp the move would allow the business to keep afloat, provide work for its local casual staff, and also assist the community so desperate to find hand sanitisers as supermarket shelves are stripped by selfish hoarders. The developments come as US distilleries have also switched to making the alcohol-based disinfectant. Pennsylvania’s Eight Oaks Farm Distillery filled its first 20 bottles on Monday, according to The Associated Press, sending the batch to charitable groups that get hand sanitiser due to the coronavirus pandemic. The family-owned distillery reportedly plans to dramatically boost production as it distributes the bottles to charities, offers them at farmers’ markets where it sells its alcohol, and via its website. “We are in a national emergency,” brewery founder Chad Butters, was quoted as saying by AP. “What’s the right thing to do? The right thing to do is support this community by providing something that is in desperate need. We’ll flood the valley with hand sanitiser and drive that price right down.” Green Mountain Distillers in Vermont is giving away a hand sanitising solution, while North Carolina’s Durham Distillery is donating a solution to hospitality colleagues. Patrons must bring their own containers. “We wanted to do something that would be as positive as possible,” said Harold Faircloth, an owner of Green Mountain Distillers."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coles expands exclusive shopping hour to new group","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/coles-emergency-workers-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Coles will extend dedicated “community hour” shopping at its supermarkets to a new group – emergency and healthcare workers. The twice-weekly exclusive shopping period will be introduced on Thursday and applies to doctors, nurses, paramedics, hospital and ambulance staff, police, firefighters and emergency service workers. It comes as Coles and other supermarkets have struggled to keep up with widespread panic buying during the coronavirus outbreak. Limits have been imposed on staples such as toilet paper, pasta and canned goods, while exclusive shopping was introduced for the elderly and disabled after many found they could not get even basic supplies. Consumer watchdog the ACCC moved on Tuesday to allow the major supermarket rivals amnesty to coordinate supply and logistics so vulnerable consumers aren’t left empty handed amid unprecedented coronavirus panic-buying. Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, IGA supplier Metcash and others would be given temporary permission to cooperate when liaising with manufacturers, suppliers, and transport and logistics providers to keep their shelves adequately stocked during the pandemic. In a statement, Chairman Rod Sims said the new agreement was “essentially due to unnecessary panic buying, and the logistics challenge this presents, rather than an underlying supply problem”. Across Australia, the first hour of Tuesday and Thursday trade at Coles supermarkets from March 26 will be for emergency workers. They will need to show an Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency card, workplace ID or be wearing their work uniform to gain entry. “We know these workers are incredibly busy and hope that providing them with a dedicated hour at the beginning of the day to shop will make their lives a little easier and support the vital work they are doing every day,” Coles chief executive Steven Cain said. Elderly and vulnerable shoppers will still get exclusive access for the first hour of shopping on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. They are required to show government-issued pension or healthcare cards. The supermarket chain has also amended its hours during the coronavirus outbreak. Its shops are open from 7am-8pm daily. The early closure allows to shelves to be restocked and supermarkets cleaned. Coles said it was spending an extra $1 million a week on cleaning since the COVID-19 outbreak worsened. It has also employed extra security guards to maintain order in the aisles. “We are also incredibly proud of our team members in-store who are working hard to get stock on to shelves as fast as possible, create a safe place to shop, and provide our customers with great service,” Mr Cain said. “We ask that our customers continue to show them kindness and patience.” Coles and other major supermarkets have also limited or suspended home delivery and click-and-collect services during the panic buying. The company said on Tuesday it was in the early stages of rolling out a new online priority service for vulnerable customers. Rival Woolworths said on Tuesday it had already introduced a priority help service online for the elderly, people with disabilities and those in self-isolation due to the virus. “We’ve been pleased to see early signs of moderation in shopping behaviour in our supermarkets over the weekend and it’s heartening to see customers respecting product limits in store so more members of their local community have access to the items they need.” A Sydney convenience store with 18,000 Instagram followers has found a novel way of stopping “greedy” coronavirus-panicked toilet paper hoarders. Rather than strictly limiting how many loo rolls customers can buy amid the COVID-19 crisis, Redfern Convenience Store’s owner Hazem Sedda has adopted a different tack. The inner Sydney store is still allowing patrons to purchase a two-pack for $3.50, but a second pack will bring the total price to a whopping $99. “Don’t be greedy,” a sign posted in front of the coveted stock reads. “Think of the other people.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"How to help keep your home free from coronavirus | The New Daily","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/coronavirus-home-cleaning-tips\/","transcript":"As households prepare to bunker down across Australia, attention has turned to the best ways of protecting homes from coronavirus. Supermarkets have introduced limits on cleaning product purchases and concerned citizens are increasingly turning to the internet for the best cleaning advice. With millions of people facing the prospect of being indefinitely housebound, health experts have called for residents to remain vigilant and have recommended a series of practical steps for maintaining good hygiene at home. With infection rates growing exponentially, residents have been warned that keeping outside movements to a minimum is the best strategy for avoiding infection. Those who need to venture outside have been encouraged to take a number of precautions, but there are also techniques that can further minimise the risk of bringing the virus home. UNSW virologist Dr Sacha Stelzer-Braid is confident households can minimise their exposure if the right procedures are followed. “We just need to be really quite vigilant and strict,” she said. Dr Stelzer-Braid said good household hygiene starts before walking in the front door. “Definitely don’t put your shoes anywhere you would touch with your hands like your coffee table.” Non-porous items like takeaway containers can be wiped down with detergent or soapy water and fresh produce should be washed. Once inside, a thorough hand wash with warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds is essential. “While the risk of transmission from anything you buy at the shops is low it’s still a good idea. We can’t hand wash enough right now,” Dr Stelzer-Braid said. Scientists have shown that COVID-19 can survive outside the body on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 hours. Professor Brett Mitchell has been researching ways of protecting the public from outbreaks like coronavirus at the University of Newcastle. He told ABC Radio Sydney that highly sought after products like hand sanitiser and disinfectant sprays were not enough to kill the virus on their own. “They can’t break through dirt and organic material that’s left on surfaces, so you need to clean that first and then use the disinfectant.” Detergents are the key to breaking down the layers of dirt and dust to allow disinfectants to work. As the virus is commonly transferred by hand-to-face touching, experts recommend wiping down all surfaces that are regularly handled. Door knobs, switches, and mobile phones should be wiped down with detergent on a cloth. Dr Stelzer-Braid said those in a healthy household should be wiping down high touch surfaces at least twice a day. Diluted bleach and products with an alcohol content above 70 per cent are also effective products. If a member of the house is feeling unwell, Professor Mitchell said cleaning around areas they frequent needs to be more thorough. “Think about cleaning the area within their room a little more often, using disinfectant after washing hands, and giving the taps a clean,” he said. Should a member of the household show symptoms of COVID-19, Dr Stelzer-Braid said they should be quarantined to one room, preferably with their own bathroom. Contact with others should be at a minimum for a fortnight and cleaning should increase to several times a day. If possible, clothes and bed sheets — handled with gloves and surgical masks — should be washed more frequently to minimise the risk of transmission. The clothing and cutlery used by an infected person can also spread the virus so they should be kept separate. “A dishwasher is great, it will kill the virus. But if you don’t have one use hot water — as hot as you can handle it,” she said. Cleaning techniques can also make a difference to the risk of infection. Wiping in an ‘S’ shaped pattern prevents re-contamination and will ensure the surface area is well-covered. Disposable gloves should also be worn. Dr Stelzer-Braid said the key was not waiting until it is too late to implement good habits. “Getting on top of it early and having a good routine is really important,” she said. “If [infection] does happen, and it probably will happen to someone in the household, then it’s an easier transition.” While these measures might not guarantee freedom from infection, Dr Stelzer-Braid said they help ensure the chances of the virus entering a home are minimised."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Do not come': Premier bans Spirit of Tasmania visitors","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/spirit-of-tasmania-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Tasmania has banned non-essential visitors from entering the state via the Spirit of Tasmania ferry in tightened coronavirus measures. Premier Peter Gutwein said only residents and essential travellers would be able to arrive on the ferry from Melbourne from Tuesday, as he foreshadowed stricter coronavirus measures to come. “Do not come. We will turn you around and ask you to go back,” he said on Tuesday. Mr Gutwein said Tasmania was in stage one of coronavirus measures and a “hard lockdown” was being considered. That would mean only essential services remained open. “I want to say very, very clearly to Tasmanians – if the advice is that we should move to more severe measures, then we will move,” he said.   LIVE UPDATE  l  Coronavirus Posted by Peter Gutwein on Monday, March 23, 2020 Tasmania has 28 coronavirus cases, including six new ones overnight on Monday. None are from local transmission. Three people who contracted the deadly virus have recovered. The state’s Sport and Recreation Minister Jane Howlett is also in self isolation after her chief of staff was in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 in Townsville. Four of Tasmania’s new cases were aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship – which docked in Sydney last Thursday. One was from the Celebrity Solstice, which docked in Sydney on Friday, and the last had recently returned from overseas. There are nearly 50 confirmed coronavirus cases among passengers from the Ruby Princess. More than 2500 people were allowed to leave the ship before COVID-19 test results had come back for ill passengers last week. Meanwhile, a cruise ship thought to be carrying up to 250 passengers with respiratory illness docked in Fremantle on Tuesday. The MSC Magnifica was greeted by Western Australian police and Australian Border Force teams to ensure no passengers or crews disembarked. The ship, which departed Italy in January and is on its way to Dubai, was in WA to refuel. Cruise line MSC has denied there are any sick passengers among the more than 1700 on board. “There is no evidence to suggest anyone onboard may be infected with COVID-19,” the company said. The WA government claims the vessel has given inconsistent reports about the health of its passengers. The Magnifica visited Melbourne and Hobart last week. Passengers were not allowed to disembark in either city. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein tests positive to coronavirus | The New Daily","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/harvey-weinstein-tests-positive-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Fallen movie mogul and convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in an isolation unit in a New York state prison, it’s been confirmed to Variety. Weinstein’s team would not confirm or deny his health status, citing privacy concerns, but Variety has confirmed the positive test results through an anonymous New York state prison official. “The prison is well aware of the situation. They are doing everything they can to make sure he’s safe and being taken care of,” Weinstein’s spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, told Variety. Seven prison employees who were in direct contact with Weinstein were also put into quarantine to avoid spreading the coronavirus, sources told Variety. Weinstein is being housed at the Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison outside Buffalo, New York, after being found guilty on two charges of a criminal sex act and rape in the third degree. Weinstein was reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday evening when a local newspaper said the former movie mogul had the coronavirus. At the time of the newspaper report, Variety spoke to sources in the New York state prison system, who alluded to Weinstein contracting the coronavirus, though the test results were not officially confirmed due to the inmate privacy policy. “We’re pretty confident that he’s probably tested positive, but we haven’t gotten confirmation,” the prison official previously told Variety. “From what we understand, he did receive a test recently. We’re basing it off of solid information that he has contracted the virus.” Weinstein had been transferred from Rikers Island in New York City to Wende Correctional Facility near Buffalo last week. Weinstein also spent time at Bellevue Hospital over the past two weeks where he was being monitored for chest pains, immediately following his 23-year sentencing. Prior to his sentencing, but after he was found guilty by a jury, Weinstein was at Bellevue where he underwent a heart procedure to remove a blockage. New York City hospitals, like Bellevue, have been experiencing an unsustainable surge in patients, as Manhattan is the epicentre of the pandemic. On Monday afternoon, Governor Andrew Cuomo said nearly 21,000 cases have been confirmed in New York state with 12,000 of those cases in New York City. Weinstein turned 68 last week in prison, so given his age and poor health conditions, he is a high-risk individual with the coronavirus. He is serving a 23-year term in New York, and is facing charges in Los Angeles as well. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office began the extradition process late last week, signaling plans to move forward with the LA trial. A spokesperson for the LA District Attorney’s office said on Monday, “As for any concerns given the coronavirus pandemic, our office expects that each agency responsible for processing, transporting and housing defendant Weinstein will follow its protocols and public health guidelines.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bank employee sacked over false coronavirus test","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/nab-worker-false-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A National Australia Bank employee whose apparently fake coronavirus test result led to a mass evacuation at the bank’s Melbourne head office has reportedly been sacked.

After 18 days in intensive care on a respirator, Mattia, 38, told the world he began breathing on his own: “The most simple and beautiful thing, that is, to breathe.” “You can get cured of this illness”. According to The Associated Press, Mattia, a Unilever worker, first went to a Pavia hospital on February 18 complaining of flu-like symptoms. He was sent home but came back the next day after his condition worsened dramatically, and in the meantime infected his wife, several doctors, nurses and patients, “creating what was thought initially to have been Italy’s main cluster”. He tested positive to COVID-19 on February 21 and spent the next three weeks in hospital. He came to be known in Italy as Patient No.1. On March 10, he was moved out of the ICU to a sub-ICU unit and was speaking with doctors. Head of intensive care at the San Matteo hospital in Pavia, Dr Francesco Mojoli told RAI state television:“This disease has a long life. Now we hope that the fact that he was young and in good shape will help him get back to his normal life”. He has now left hospital and is awaiting the birth of his child. In all, Italy, the hardest-hit country of all after China with 63,927 confirmed cases, has declined in both new cases and deaths for a second consecutive day. Italian officials said the coronavirus claimed just over 600 more lives, down from 793 two days earlier. All told, the outbreak has killed 6077 people in Italy, the highest death toll of any country, and pushed the health system to breaking point. Medical teams from as far away as Cuba headed to Italy two days ago to help manage the health crisis. Last week, Italian media reported the death of his father, who lived in one of the first towns in Lombardy that were at the heart of the outbreak’s start. Italian doctors say that even before Mattia’s case, they suspect the virus was circulating in Italy and that some patients who died of pneumonia last autumn might have had coronavirus."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"South Africa ordered to go into coronavirus lockdown","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/south-africa-coronavirus-lockdown\/","transcript":"South Africa, Africa’s most industrialised economy and a nation of 57 million people, will to go into a nationwide lockdown for 21 days starting on Thursday to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the president says. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the measures on Tuesday in response to the increase of COVID-19 cases to 402. South Africa will be the third country in Africa to close down all but essential economic activity, after Rwanda and Tunisia. South Africa’s coronavirus cases jumped by 47 per cent on Monday from the day before with 128 new cases, increasing worries of exponential growth and making it the country with the most cases in Africa, taking over from Egypt. More than half of South Africa’s total cases are in Gauteng province. It includes Johannesburg, the country’s largest city with 5.7 million people, and the capital, Pretoria, with 2.4 million, according to figures released by the Health Ministry. South Africa has not registered a known death from COVID-19. Officials have said the majority of people infected are travellers from Europe and other countries, although the number of cases that are locally transmitted is rising. South Africa’s crowded working class residential areas and packed commuter trains and minivan taxis are expected to contribute to the spread of COVID-19. Mr Ramaphosa said the lockdown would be enforced by police and the military starting at midnight Thursday. “We need to urgently and dramatically escalate our response,” he said in an address to the nation. “This is extremely dangerous for a population like ours, which has a a large number of people with suppressed immunity because of HIV and TB, and high levels of poverty and malnutrition.” All South Africans will be required to stay home, except for those working in essential services, including healthcare providers, workers in the security industry and those involved in producing and distributing food, power and medical products, the president said. Individuals will be allowed to leave home only “under strictly controlled circumstances” to get goods such as medical supplies and food, he said. Banks, supermarkets and petrol stations will be allowed to continue operating. Mr Ramaphosa also said economic aid will be offered to the poorest South Africans and small businesses. Some of the country’s banks have announced three-month loan payment holidays for small businesses and students. The government of the west African nation of Senegal declared a state of emergency due to the virus on Monday night. It has imposed a curfew, restricted travel between regions, closed public spaces and banned gatherings, among other actions. President Macky Sall said the move was needed in the nation of nearly 16 million where 79 people have tested positive for coronavirus and more than 1560 are being monitored. At least 43 of Africa’s 54 countries have reported cases. Zimbabwe and Nigeria reported their first virus-related deaths Monday. Nigeria, which has a population of 100 million people, has 36 cases. Zimbabwe, with 16 million people, has two cases. Africa’s 1.3 billion people might be hard-hit by COVID-19 as health experts warn of the spread in large cities with unsanitary conditions and inadequate health facilities.

He was filming an Elvis biopic with director Baz Luhrmann on the Gold Coast at the time. Wilson performed concerts at the Sydney Opera House and in Brisbane before her diagnosis. During that time, she also met veteran Nine reporter, Richard Wilkins, who also contracted the virus. Hanks and Wilson were quarantined at a Gold Coast hospital for several days before being sent home for the rest of their isolation period. In a social media post on Monday, Hanks said he and Wilson were doing well. But he had some advice for others as the coronavirus pandemic expands across Australia and elsewhere. “Hey, folks. Two weeks after our first symptoms and we feel better,” he wrote. “Sheltering in place works like this: You don’t give it to anyone, you don’t get it from anyone. Common sense, no?” He said recovery was going to take a while but “if we take care of each other, help where we can and give up some comforts, this too shall pass”. Hanks has been an enthusiastic sharer of information from his quarantine.

Deaths from the virus in Britain jumped to 335 on Monday as the government said the military would help ship millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, to healthcare workers who have complained of shortages. “From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home,” Mr Johnson said in a televised address to the nation, replacing his usual daily news conference. Mr Johnson said people would be allowed to leave their homes only to shop for basic necessities, exercise, for a medical need, to provide care or travelling to and from work where absolutely necessary. “That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home,” he said, adding that people should not meet friends or family members who do not live in their home. “If you don’t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.” The new measures would be reviewed in three weeks, and relaxed if possible. The government will close all shops selling non-essential goods, Mr Johnson said, including clothing stores, as well as other premises, including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship. Advice to stay at home and avoid social gatherings went unheeded by millions at the weekend. They took advantage of sunny weather to flock to parks and beauty spots, ignoring instructions to stay two metres apart. Under the new measures, the government will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public who do not live together, and stop all social events, including weddings and baptisms but not funerals. Parks would remain open for exercise but gatherings would be dispersed, Mr Johnson said. Later on Monday (local time), Britain’s lower house of parliament is expected to approve emergency legislation giving authorities sweeping powers to tackle the outbreak, including the right to detain people and put them in isolation to protect public health. “Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,” Mr Johnson said. Earlier, in a letter pleading with him to increase PPE supplies, more than 6000 frontline doctors warned they felt like “cannon fodder” and were being asked to put their lives at risk with out-of-date masks, and low stocks of equipment. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there had been issues but promised action was being taken. He said the army would drive trucks throughout the day and night to get supplies to medical staff. “It’s like a war effort – it is a war against this virus and so the army have been incredibly helpful in getting those logistics so we can get the supplies to protect people on the front line,” he told the BBC, saying the health service now had 12,000 ventilators, 7000 more than at the start of the crisis."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"IMF predicts 2020 global recession from coronavirus outbreak","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/2020\/03\/24\/imf-global-recession-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The coronavirus pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the International Monetary Fund says. However world economic output should recover in 2021, the IMF predicts. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva welcomed extraordinary fiscal actions already taken by many countries to boost health systems and protect affected companies and workers, and steps taken by central banks to ease monetary policy. “Even more will be needed, especially on the fiscal front,” she said on Monday. Ms Georgieva issued the new outlook after a conference call of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 of the world’s largest economies, who she said agreed on the need for solidarity across the globe. “The human costs of the coronavirus pandemic are already immeasurable and all countries need to work together to protect people and limit the economic damage,” Ms Georgieva said. More countries are imposing lockdown measures to contain the rapidly spreading virus, which has infected 337,500 people across the world and killed more than 14,600. Ms Georgieva said the outlook for global growth was negative and the IMF now expected “a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse”. Earlier this month, Ms Georgieva had warned that 2020 world growth would be below the 2.9 per cent rate seen in 2019, but stopped short of predicting a recession. Trade wars pushed global growth last year to the lowest rate since a 0.7 per cent contraction in 2009. On Monday, Ms Georgieva said a recovery was expected in 2021, but to reach it countries would need to prioritise containment and strengthen health systems. “The economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be,” she said. Ms Georgieva said the IMF would massively step up emergency finance, noting that 80 countries have already requested help and the IMF stood ready to deploy all of its $US1 trillion in lending capacity. Advanced economies were generally in better shape to deal with the crisis, but many emerging markets and low-income countries face significant challenges, including outward capital flows. Investors have already removed $US83 billion ($A143 billion) from emerging markets since the start of the crisis, the largest capital outflow ever recorded, Ms Georgieva said. The IMF is particularly concerned about low-income countries in debt distress and was working closely with them to address those concerns, she added. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Health authorities to change Australia's coronavirus testing criteria","date":"03-24-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/24\/coronavirus-testing-criteria\/","transcript":"Australian patients who have symptoms consistent with the coronavirus have been turned away from COVID-19 testing because they have not recently returned from overseas – meaning cases are going undetected. But that could be about to change, with the nation’s deputy chief medical officer revealing on Monday night the restrictions on who will be tested are about to be relaxed. Physician Norman Swan issued the warning about virus patients going undetected after South Australian senator Rex Patrick revealed on ABC’s Q&A program strong suspicions he was infected after being in close proximity to Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg. The need to shift focus to community transmission was further highlighted when it was revealed Senator Bragg had attended a wedding where others were later found to have contracted the coronavirus. Only then did he qualify for a test. His initial flu-like symptoms displayed at a Senate enquiry – where Mr Patrick believes he contracted the virus – did not make him eligible to be tested. This forced Australia’s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly to announce that changes will soon be introduced on who can be tested so that recent travellers are not the only priority, but that others with symptoms can also be checked. The world is grappling with a short supply of tests, prompting authorities to place strict guidelines on who should be checked for the virus. “We’ll be removing the traveller component, but we’re working on that at the moment,” Dr Kelly told Q&A on Monday night, adding that announcements about testing prerequisites will be made “over the coming days”. ABC’s Dr Swan said 60 per cent of infections have come from asymptomatic people “in some environments”, so “it’s not necessarily getting us anywhere” if coronavirus tests have been largely targeting the wrong people. The announcement that changes will be made to Australia’s coronavirus testing criteria comes as the head of the World Health Organisation Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Tuesday morning (Australian time) the global pandemic has been “accelerating”. “It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, and just four days for the third 100,000 cases,” Dr Ghebreyesus told a COVID-19 press briefing.

A series of bills was approved on Monday night, with two packages worth $17.6 billion and $66 billion at the heart of the Morrison government’s response. In separate legislation, the government set aside a further $40 billion for urgent and unforeseen spending associated with the pandemic, likely to cause a recession. Jobseeker, youth allowance, parenting and special benefit payments will be boosted by $550 a fortnight. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann confirmed the coronavirus supplement would be extended to full-time students. The government will no longer need legislation to make changes to welfare settings after passing an amendment to the package, giving the social services minister unprecedented powers. There will also be two $750 payments for welfare recipients. Small lenders will get a $15 billion boost from the government, while businesses will get cash injections to encourage them to keep staff on during the crisis. A range of other measures are included in the packages, including targeted support for the tourism and aviation sectors. Labor supported the government in rushing legislation through Parliament despite raising concerns about some of the measures. The opposition argued the payments would not be in people’s pockets until late April, while also criticising the decision to allow people to access their superannuation early. Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed a scaled-down House of Representatives on Monday, invoking the spirit of the Diggers. “So we summon the spirit of the Anzacs, of our Great Depression generation, of those who built the Snowy [Mountain scheme], of those who won the great peace of World War II and defended Australia,” Mr Morrison said. “For many, young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives.” Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said most Australians only knew stories of war, hunger and financial strife from their grandparents. “This is a time for national leadership, consistent messages, clear directions,” he said. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has hinted at the potential need for a third stimulus package down the track, as Australia faced its biggest challenge outside of war time. “We confront an enemy without a flag or a face and we are deploying every weapon in our arsenal to defeat it,” he told Parliament. “We will bounce back as a nation stronger than ever.” Mr Frydenberg told Parliament superannuation was the “people’s money” and would be freed up by the government. The pandemic has seen tens of billions of dollars wiped off share prices in the past few weeks. Members and senators abided by new rules to ensure there are four square metres for each person, and no more than 100 people in a room at any one time.

The announcements on Sunday night and Monday morning whipped shoppers into a frenzy – with the focus of panic-buying suddenly turning on booze, sports equipment and DIY hardware. But it’s emerged that despite the wave of tough new restrictions designed to stave off the virus, there are some surprising business names on the ‘to remain open’ list – for now. Be warned though: As an expert in the field of infectious diseases argues below, just because you can go to one of these places doesn’t mean you should. Bottle shops will stay open and will continue online deliveries. But Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said it was not an excuse to “have all your mates round to your home and get on the beers”. “That’s not appropriate,” Mr Andrews told reporters on Monday. “It’s not essential, it’s not needed, and all it will do is spread the virus.” #danmurphysrun #Shutdown #coronavirus Madness at Dan Murphy’s. pic.twitter.com\/Mv7SDHLhlc — Tim Stoney (@timstoney) March 22, 2020 He said last week, about a dozen people attended a dinner party – one of whom had the coronavirus – and by the end of the night, almost everyone had contracted it. “This spreads rapidly,” Mr Andrews said. “If people simply behave as normal, if they don’t take this seriously, if they act selfishly, then people will die. I can’t be any clearer than that.” Stop. Put down the scissors – you can still get your hair cut. You can also get your legs waxed or your nails manicured, too. Hairdressing and beauty salons remain open, even though it is impossible for workers to do their jobs without breaching social distancing rules that demand we stand 1.5 metres apart. Allied health workers like physiotherapists, osteopaths, psychologists and dietitians can keep working during the lockdown of non-essential services, Health Minister Greg Hunt confirmed on Monday. Some businesses might close anyway if they decide it is necessary to limit the transmission of COVID-19. With all commercial gyms now closed, this is the queue of fitness fans outside an equipment wholesaler in Cheltenham.

As a safety precaution, Bunnings’ sausages in bread have been taken off the menu. DIY workshops and children’s play areas have also been cancelled to limit the spread of the virus. Bunnings managing director Mike Schneider told The New Daily on Monday shops would remain open and the company had ramped up cleaning, including of equipment such as trolleys. He said stores were implementing social distancing measures and providing materials including hand sanitiser and gloves. “Personally I’d stay away,” Bill Bowtell, a strategic health policy adviser and Adjunct Professor at the University of New South Wales, told The New Daily. “People love to think ‘It’s not going to happen to me’, but the viruses don’t see it that way. They just wait until they can get into your body – and they’re very good at it.” Professor Bowtell said the coronavirus could survive outside the body on moist surfaces and materials like paper and plastic. “Everything in a retail store is picked up and put down, whether it be at Bunnings, a bottle shop or a supermarket,” he said. “You’d have to think the risk of picking up an infected surface, then touching your hands to your nose, face and eyes unconsciously, seems to be a pretty certain way of transmitting the virus. “I’d hate to think how many times a bottle of wine is picked up and put back before you go on and buy it.” Professor Bowtell said ideally there should be nobody on the streets at all. “I think the place should be a ghost town,” he said. “We need to act now, and sort out the rest later.” !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Teachers federation issues strike threat over lack of protection","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-teachers-federation-strike-threat\/","transcript":"Teachers are threatening to walk off the job in New South Wales and Queensland unless greater protections are put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. After a day of confusion over how the school shutdowns will work, most states plan to try and keep schools open for doctors, nurses, police, other “essential services” workers, and vulnerable children at risk of harm. Victoria and the ACT announced on Sunday that extended holidays would begin on Tuesday, with teachers working on distance learning options. But they will remain open for health workers and children will not be turned away. But teachers are warning greater safety protections must be put in place, including allowing at-risk teachers to opt out and stay home. In NSW, where there are 700 COVID-19 cases and rising, the Teachers Federation released a statement on Monday night revealing it is now threatening to walk off the job unless safety demands can be met. #Covid_19australiaTeachers have been thrust onto the frontline of this crisis. The Premier has failed to provide any reassurance for our public school teachers and principals. 👇🏻 — Angelo Gavrielatos (@AGavrielatos) March 22, 2020 “The Prime Minister’s statements on Sunday evening were hypocritical and contradictory, while the Premier [Gladys Berejiklian] failed to provide unequivocal advice this morning. What we have now is a recipe for chaos,’’ the statement said. “We are told children are low-risk agents for the virus at school but suddenly become high-risk agents in shopping centres and playgrounds, while also ignoring the fact that tens of thousands are travelling on trains and buses each morning and afternoon. “We are told there is concern about kids infecting grandparents but not teachers, many of whom are also grandparents.” Ms Berejiklian has asked parents to keep children away from school, but also said schools would remain open for emergency services workers and other essential services. “The health advice has not changed,” Ms Berejiklian said. “However, for practical reasons in NSW we will be encouraging parents to keep their children at home. “Already last week we had up to 30 per cent of parents who chose to keep their [children] at home, and we appreciate and anticipate that number will increase. “I want to stress for parents that are workers and have no option, the school is safe for children to attend schools. “No child will be turned away from school.” Tough new restrictions from midday to keep the community safe. pic.twitter.com\/DW64ejt01Y — Gladys Berejiklian (@GladysB) March 22, 2020 Teachers who are deemed at risk from the coronavirus have on Monday been given the right to work from home in NSW. The NSW Teachers Federation will hold further talks on Tuesday. “We are prepared to work constructively with the government to arrive at a definition of essential services workers and commence a transition process to ensure facilities remain open to provide minimal supervision for children of affected workers,” the statement said. “Systems will be in place to provide complete health protection for all teachers – this would include allowing any teacher who is not confident of health protection at their workplace to work from home. “If … these conditions cannot be demonstrably met, then the executive will be professionally bound to call for the closure of public schools and the provision of ongoing education via distance technologies.” Queensland Teachers Union (QTU) president Kevin Bates said teaching staff were being put at risk. “We don’t accept that you have to have social distancing in terms of closing down parks and beaches and other things, but you can have 3000 students at a school and that is OK,” Mr Bates said. “What we are saying is enough is enough.” In South Australia, Premier Steve Marshall wants schools to remain open. Mr Marshall said he recognised that some parents would want to keep their children at home but urged them to take responsibility. “If parents are going to take their children out of school, they do have a massive responsibility to keep those children safe and supervised,” Mr Marshall said. “And they also need to recognise that if they do this it’s not a two-week requirement, these restrictions are likely to be in place for six months.” In the ACT, schools will remain open for those who “absolutely need to attend”."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus lockdown studies in China highlight risks children could face","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-australia-school-bullying\/","transcript":"Chinese children were at risk of being groomed and faced more cyberbullying after schools shut down, a report on the dangers associated with social isolation during the coronavirus pandemic has found. As an increasing number of Australian parents take their children out of school over COVID-19 fears, children are inevitably going to spend a lot more time at home in front of screens in coming months. Although it’s much safer for children to be contained at home or their backyard rather than be exposed to strangers who might carry the virus, being away from a physical classroom brings with it another set of risks. That includes those that stem from unsupervised access to the internet. And there are valuable lessons we can learn from China, where the virus emerged and about 58 million people have been placed under unprecedented restrictions. During the lockdown in the original virus epicentre, almost 65 per cent of children are spending more than three hours online every day, and 20 per cent spend more than six hours every day, a China Youth Daily study has found. Qiang, a Year 8 student in China, hasn’t been able to leave his home for a month. Forced to stay inside, the 13-year-old spends most of his time doing online study courses, occasionally taking a break to exercise on the top floor of the building in which he lives. “I have gained some weight these days for not being allowed to go out,” he said, adding he misses playing badminton with his friends. “I wish the epidemic could soon be over, so I could go out and go to school. “I felt a bit scared when I heard that the epidemic was quite severe.” Understandably, many children in China are feeling anxious about the coronavirus – and trying to escape their new reality by spending more time on the internet can sometimes make it worse. According to a survey conducted by the Chinese Psychology Society, 42.6 per cent of Chinese people questioned said they were feeling anxious amid the uncertainty of the COVID-19 outbreak. In a study into post-traumatic stress disorder, just over one in every five people of the 5000 participants had obvious symptoms of PTSD. There are concerns children may also absorb the anxiety and develop psychological disorders. World Vision child protection expert Wing Yan Mak said parents needed to understand their children may be affected by the barrage of online news stories about the unfolding pandemic. “It is important for parents to be patient and transparent, and to talk to children about the virus,” Ms Mak said. “Children might be overwhelmed by the massive information on the virus outbreak and are unable to process the information, which can lead to stress and fear.” She said creating a daily routine would help children develop a sense of normalcy amid the chaos. Neglect and injury were also major concerns linked to periods of isolation or lockdown. In China, a disabled boy was left at home for six days and tragically died after his father and brother were quarantined. There are also reports of children who have been injured after misusing disinfectant chemicals when they were left unsupervised. Parents are being urged to limit screen time where possible and keep an eye on what kids are accessing online. Q. What are the biggest concerns for children being isolated at home based on what World Vision staff have seen in China? “Children might be overwhelmed by the massive information on the virus outbreak and are unable to process the information, which can lead to stress and fear. Neglect and injury are also big concerns. A disabled boy was left at home for six days and died after dad and brother were quarantined. Also, three children were hurt as a result of misusing disinfectants.” Q. What are the biggest lessons parents in Australia can learn from the impact of isolation on children in China? “It is important for parents to be patient and transparent to talk to children about the virus. It is important to understand how children’s mental health be affected by the outbreak, and parents are the key supporters to help children cope with those stress. There are difficult ways to deal with the impact of isolation, but agreeing a daily routine with children helps children to gradually develop the sense of normalcy. Parents should also be aware of their own mental health and psychosocial wellbeing as well.” Q. Are there any examples that WV China staff have seen first hand of the impact of too much screen time? “In a study of 1923 caregivers during the recent lockdown in China, 64.4 per cent of their children spent more than three hours on the internet every day and 20 per cent spend more than six hours. Parents might not be aware of what is happening to their children during that time. Apart from learning and playing video games, children engage in different groups (fan groups). There was news that youths got bullied by other fan groups online.” Q. How traumatic is this for children and how can parents help ease children’s concerns? “Be open and positive to talk to children about the risks on internet and how they can protect themselves. Make sure that children understand who, how and where to seek help when they have troubles on the internet.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Besieged PM caught in the coronavirus swamp, up to his neck in alligators","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-scott-morrison-paul-bongiorno\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison’s opening statement to Parliament’s coronavirus crisis sitting was as dramatic as it was heartfelt. “Meeting this challenge is bigger than any Australian,” he said on Monday. “It’s obviously bigger than politics. It is bigger than any of us who are in this chamber, Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition … bigger than all of us.” Few could quibble with Mr Morrison’s depiction of this “once-in a-100-year event” as an economic crisis “the likes of which we have not seen since the Great Depression”. Labor leader Anthony Albanese certainly didn’t. He provided a cast-iron guarantee of an expeditious passage through the Parliament of the health and stimulus measures “sight unseen” and even though in his view “they are not perfect”. Truth is, such is the anxiety gripping the nation no sane opposition could or would dare stand in the way. There was sympathy for the Prime Minister’s predicament. One Liberal said he was “caught in a coronavirus swamp with alligators up to his neck”. But as Labor’s main parliamentary tactician Tony Burke said in the debate, constructive criticism isn’t designed to add to the fear and panic in the community but rather help a democratic parliament do its job. At the end of the day Mr Morrison and his Treasurer Josh Frydenberg chose not to accept any of Labor’s amendments, even though they were aimed at broadening the cover of the safety net measures and applying them immediately. In question time Mr Morrison explained his reluctance in terms of saving some of his fire for when he may need it more. It’s also an insight on how hard it has been for the PM to pivot from “fiscal rectitude” and the holy grail of a “back-in-the-black budget”. But Australians should be grateful that unlike the non-Labor parties at the time of the Great Depression, this conservative PM is prepared to embrace debt to save the nation. Mr Morrison also has no choice but to shut down vast sectors of the economy as he, the premiers and chief ministers – like the boy with his finger in the dyke – tries to stop the flood of the coronavirus swamping the population. So far it’s a losing battle with the number of people infected doubling every three days and, at that rate, heading above one million victims by Anzac Day. The argument is over how much debt and how quickly to go deeper into it. For the hundreds queuing outside Centrelink offices and the 95,000 who crashed the government’s MyGov website on Monday rushing for the just-announced unemployment relief, this hand-wringing is no comfort. Western Sydney MP Jason Clare gave a stark example of what’s happening. The Labor MP said 500 people were stood down by Bankstown Sports Club and another 120 made redundant as the forced closure of pubs and clubs bit. Clare said “that doesn’t count the 300 cleaners and restaurant staff and security workers and contractors there”. Economist Chris Richardson was not alone in his praise of the government’s $84 billion of stimulus measures, nor was he alone in saying “it’s not enough”. The Prime Minister and Treasurer both say they are ready to “do whatever it takes”. But when the billions they have already earmarked is not enough, you know we have a huge problem. Mr Albanese says “anything that feels like an overreaction right now isn’t”. He said the rule should be “if we think we are going to take action next week, we should take that action today”. Probably good advice but no one has all the answers.

In a last-minute turnaround, the Morrison government late on Monday night agreed to extend its coronavirus crisis package to include Australians on youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy. It means about 230,000 full-time students will receive extra cash on top of their study assistance, to get them through what the government is warning will be the toughest year in the lives of many Australians, young and old alike. Recipients of jobseeker, youth allowance, parenting and special benefit payments had already been included in the measures which, from April 27, will effectively double the unemployment benefit. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also hinted on Monday there could be more help on the way for Australians, on top of the two $17.6 billion and $66 billion coronavirus support packages. The supplement is available to anyone receiving the following payments: If you’ve previously applied to receive one of these payments and been knocked back, don’t be disheartened – you might be eligible now. In addition to increasing payments, government will waive asset testing for JobSeeker, Youth Allowance and Parenting payments. This means home owners (among others) are more likely to qualify for financial assistance as Centrelink won’t factor in the value of their home and assets when assessing applications. Income testing will still apply, so if you’re still earning a healthy wage (more than $1075 a fortnight), you might not be entitled to government help.  Eligibility rules have also been expanded to include: The government has waived many of the waiting periods to speed up the payments. If you’re already receiving an eligible Centrelink payment, Services Australia will automatically pay you the coronavirus supplement from April 27. If you’re not already receiving a qualifying payment, you will need to apply through Centrelink. This can typically be done over the phone or online through the myGov portal. But a surge in the number of people trying to access Centrelink on Monday overloaded and crashed the myGov website. Australians who don’t qualify for the supplement aren’t being left to fend for themselves. From July 13, Centrelink will pay a second $750 economic support payment. Initially, the economic support payment was designed to be a one-off sum to help 6.2 million Australians receiving pensions, concessions and tax benefits.  You will only receive one payment even if you have multiple qualifying cards or benefits. The payments will be made automatically but won’t be given to anyone receiving the coronavirus supplement."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Border control: Qld latest state to close borders to slow virus spread","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/queensland-borders-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Queensland has become the latest state to announce it will close its borders – joining South Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia – to try to halt the spread of COVID-19. Queensland’s borders will close at midnight on Wednesday, while Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia announced border control measures on Sunday. However, Victoria’s borders with NSW and SA will remain open. Following Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s announcement on Monday, means anyone entering the state – particularly those returning from holiday or interstate travel – must isolate themselves for 14 days. Officials are working out the finer details of who the bans will apply to and how it will be regulated. That information will be released on Tuesday. Queensland’s closure is made more complex by its southern border running through the middle of the Gold Coast. Ms Palaszczuk’s decision comes after people were banned from hanging out publicly and in large groups to comply with Australia’s strict new social shutdown policies. “I talked yesterday about some tough love and more will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “We know that if we are all playing our part and we’re all working together, we can absolutely get through this.” She said there was light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel, but only if everyone followed orders to stay 1.5 metres away from each other, and the government’s social closure orders. Holidays planned during the school break should also be cancelled. Queensland’s announcement came as Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick confirmed he has become the fourth federal politician to catch the coronavirus. The crossbencher has been in self-isolation at home after coming into contact with Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, who also has the virus. “SA Health has advised me that, despite being asymptomatic, my COVID-19 test has returned positive,” Senator Patrick tweeted on Monday. “I have assisted them with comprehensive contact tracing and they’ll call anyone considered at risk.” Senator Patrick, Senator Bragg, Nationals senator Susan McDonald and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton have all contracted the disease. South Australia has also introduced border measures, which will come into effect on Tuesday afternoon, with 12 control stations to be established. Police will also be on duty at train stations and airports. Anybody entering SA will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self-isolate for 14 days. Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said it was expected the border controls would prompt most people to reconsider travelling to or from SA. There are exemptions for emergency workers and other essential services, as well as those who live close to borders and needed to make regular crossings. Western Australia will introduce similar restrictions from 1.30pm on Tuesday (local time). “These are extreme steps but these are extreme days,” Premier Mark McGowan said on Sunday. Health Minister Steven Miles said 60 additional cases of coronavirus were confirmed overnight, bringing the state’s total to 319. Hospitals are beginning to reschedule less urgent surgeries to make way for those in need of treatment for COVID-19, and Queenslanders are being urged to donate blood. Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed Victoria’s borders with NSW and SA would remain open, despite moves by other states to close theirs. “I’m not interested in closing our borders. I don’t think that makes a lot of sense for us,” he said. Mr Andrews said if people followed the latest restrictions, including on non-essential travel, borders could remain open. “If social distancing is applied, if people use common sense, act in their interest in and the interest of everybody else, instead of acting in a selfish way, then I don’t think we need to get to the point (of shutting borders),” he said. Any Victorian entering SA will be required to self-isolate for 14 days, and the border controls will apply to all road, air, rail and sea access points. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"MyGov website crashes, while desperate Australians overwhelm Centrelink","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/mygov-centrelink-virus\/","transcript":"The website giving Australians access to government services crashed on Monday, overwhelmed by surging demand as people deal with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. There were also problems with the MyGov app and lengthy queues outside Centrelink offices across Australia on Monday. AS of 4.30pm, the MyGov website was still saying it was “unavailable”. However, the MyGov app on mobile phones was working. Government Services Minister Stuart Robert initially said the website’s technical issues were complicated by a denial of service attack (similar to that that brought down the national census in 2016). In Question Time later on Monday, he backtracked on that claim, saying the huge number of people logging on to the site at the same time mirrored such an attack, triggering internal alarms. MyGov website traffic leapt from about 6000 users a day to 55,000 at the weekend. The numbers peaked at more than 95,000. Australians needed to be patient, Mr Robert said. “Try logging on later today or even tomorrow,” he said. Many families, workers and business owners have been forced to seek social security payments as the pandemic throws the national economy into chaos. In Question Time on Monday, it emerged that up to 1.7 million Australians could be on unemployment payments in coming months. On Monday morning, Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed a near empty Parliament. “Life is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change,” he said. “For many, young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives. “We gather today at a time of great challenge for our nation and indeed the world. We are a strong nation and a strong people but in the months ahead this will put us all to the test. At no time like this, since World War II. But together, Australia, we are up to this challenge. “We summon the spirit of the Anzacs, of our great Depression generation, of those who built the Snowy, of those who won the great peace of World War II and defended Australia. That is our legacy that we draw on at this time.” Mr Morrison said queues stretching several city blocks outside Centrelink offices on Monday would have been unthinkable just two weeks ago. “This is the biggest economic shock our nation has faced in generations. Australia, long an open trading nation, is now closed off largely from the world,” he said. “This will be a test of all Australians. It is a test of our nation. Of our spirit. There are some who believe Liberal democracies and free societies cannot cope with these sorts of challenges. We will prove them wrong here in Australia.” Under a stimulus package announced on Sunday, the government will double payments to the unemployed and increasing other family welfare payments as it seeks to cushion the economy from the devastating impact of the pandemic.  IMPORTANT UPDATE:We’re experiencing very high demand across all services. We’re getting lots of questions about… Posted by Services Australia on Sunday, March 22, 2020 Opposition frontbencher Bill Shorten said the unprecedented demand on Centrelink and MyGov was “entirely foreseeable”. Mr Shorten said Australians should not be forced to wait weeks to access welfare. “At this hour of need, Australians are having to grapple with inadequate service, online glitches and a lack of planning to deal with demand at Centrelink shopfronts,” he said. The surge in demand at Centrelink came because first-time welfare recipients had been told they could get a customer reference number only by applying in person. However, Mr Robert said later on Monday that new customers could start their claim online and their identity could be verified over the phone. Mr Robert said Centrelink staff were following medical advice about social distancing, which had also contributed to the delays. “We have less staff in our Centrelink offices,” he said. But additional call centre operators were being recruited, and call centre hours would be extended. “We have been preparing for a large influx of Australians who haven’t used centre services before,” Mr Robert said. Mr Shorten said the minister must do better. “He must ensure Centrelink services – online and in person – are working now when Australians need them most.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Scared and desperate' Australian families plead for help to return","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/peru-family-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A family of four trapped in Peru has pleaded with the Prime Minister to urgently secure affordable rescue flights for hundreds of travellers caught in the coronavirus lockdown who feel abandoned by Australia. The family face a $24,000 bill to get their children home under the only current solution: A $5000 one-way flight that the organisers can’t guarantee will take off. Newcastle mother Mhairi Thompson is trapped in Peru with her husband Jed Thompson and children Caleb and Isla, a plight shared by over 300 Australians. “Our children are 12 years old and eight years old. They are holding up amazingly well under the circumstances. However, they are scared and desperate to get home,” she told The New Daily. “No one is looking for a free ride home, just an affordable one, with more support and communication from the Australian government.” The family have return flights booked but the Peruvian government has closed airports and locked down the country. “My husband and I are in Cusco with our two children. We are not booked on the charter flight and are desperately hoping our flights booked with LATAM for 3rd April are not cancelled,” she said. “We travelled to South America prior to any news of the virus breaking. We have been travelling for three months and have been keeping a close eye on the Smartraveller website throughout our travels. “To book the charter flight home would cost us close to $24,000. As we are going home to a lot of uncertainty, we can’t afford to spend that kind of money. “The only advice we have received from the embassy (via Twitter) is to book ourselves on to a chartered flight home (at over $5000 per person!).” Warning that many travellers cannot afford a $5000 one-way ‘rescue’ flight organised by the government and some are unable to even reach the airport, the family has said time was running out. Australians Trish Jackson and Kevin Dunne had been refused a seat on the rescue flight. “We have contacted Chimu & requested to be booked on the charter flight but as we are in Mancora, 18 hours drive from Lima, they have said they can’t help us at this time,” Ms Jackson said. “We need a government-sanctioned vehicle to get us to the air base. We have seen other countries get their people out of the same hostel we are in and make it home. There are three more Australians like us, in Mancora. “We also aren’t really in a position to pay such a high premium for the charter flights home, but if it is the only option, then we are prepared to do it.” Chimu Adventures, which is organising the $5000 flights, also warned they are not guaranteed to leave. That prompted a new wave of anxiety among the families, many of whom are confined to hotel rooms and subject to a national curfew. In a email obtained by The New Daily, Chimu Adventures admitted it was working around the clock to get Australians out but there were “no guarantees”. “You are receiving this email because you have a tentative seat or seats booked on one of our repatriation flights from Cusco, Lima or Buenos Aires,” it states. “I’d note that we are still hoping to proceed to the timeframes suggested on Friday last week. We would stress that there are many factors in play at the moment and we can’t give any degree of certainty on the departure date currently.” Despite reports on Alan Jones 2GB program on Monday, that the Australians could be put on British rescue flights, there are not enough seats for the 300-plus Australians. Exasperated and frightened Australians have been scathing of the performance on the Australian embassy and the lack of information. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra has now devoted additional resources to their plight. In an email to trapped Australians on Monday, DFAT said it was working around the clock to get them home. “Despite the closure of Lima’s civilian airport on Saturday, I want to reassure you that there are still options for aircraft to depart,” it states. “We are working around the clock on options for return to Australia. Please bear with us as we coordinate with the Peruvian government, Australia and tour companies and airlines. “For the time being, you should not attempt to travel. There is a process in place with the Peruvian government to allow confirmed passengers on flights to be transported to airports. It is not done individually.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cruise ship with 250 ill patients wants to dock in WA","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-mcs-magnifica\/","transcript":"A cruise ship with 250 sick passengers has asked permission to dock at Fremantle, possibly as soon as Monday night.

Six of the new confirmed cases are former passengers from the Ruby Princess, which docked in Sydney on Thursday. WA Health Minister Roger Cook said 12 of the cases were in hospital, two in a critical condition. A total of 48 passengers from the Ruby Princess have now tested positive to COVID-19. The bulk of them were diagnosed in NSW but some were diagnosed interstate. Mr McGowan had earlier lashed the NSW government for allowing Ruby Princess passengers to leave before all coronavirus test results were in. “NSW had people coming off ships yesterday and that may have changed matters. We managed the cruise ship very, very well yesterday – so quite different to what happened in NSW,” he said. A NSW Health spokesman said earlier that, from midnight on Sunday, all cruise ships would be held in port until any patients with respiratory issues had been tested for COVID-19. “NSW Health will go even further beyond the national protocol and its current own state protocols,” the statement said on Sunday. The Ruby Princess had 1148 crew and 2647 passengers on board when it travelled to New Zealand before returning to Sydney on Thursday. All cases from the cruise ship are in isolation at home or in hospital. All passengers and crew have been notified and asked to self-isolate for 14 days as investigations continue. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"New coronavirus shutdown measures are in force now. This is what they mean for your routine | The New Daily","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-lockdown-measures-explained\/","transcript":"From midday on Monday, Australia entered a new era in its history. Widespread closure of businesses will be enforced, and people have been told to stay at home to slow the spread of coronavirus. With constantly evolving information and advice, some people may be confused about what exactly they can and cannot do. We’ve got some answers for you. This article is based on the latest information provided by state and federal leaders as of Monday, March 23. Most businesses, including major retailers and department stores, can continue to run if they comply with social-distancing guidelines. Under the new measures, cafes and restaurants will be able to operate, but only to offer takeaway and delivery services. Hotels will be allowed to offer accommodation. And the following businesses have been dubbed essential to society and will remain open: All businesses operating must meet social-distancing guidelines –keeping people 1.5 metres apart, and ensuring 4 square metres per person – and not have gatherings of more than 100 people indoors. Businesses are encouraged to adjust work practices around these guidelines in order to keep operating, such as arrange for staff to work from home. The Prime Minister announced on Sunday that some businesses would have to close by midday on Monday because people were gathering in some of them against social-distancing guidelines. These include: Leaders have recognised the balance between keeping businesses operating and reducing the spread of the virus is difficult. At this stage, businesses such as hairdressers and beauticians can stay open if they comply with social-distancing guidelines – as challenging as that may be. Restaurants and cafes can continue cooking if they offer takeaway, and other businesses will need to adjust. For example, Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said shopping centres would remain open, but said people should not sit in food courts. Prime Minister Scott Morrison flagged on Sunday that more draconian restrictions may be forthcoming under “stage two”. Schools and childcare centres remain open until the school holidays, though some jurisdictions have brought forward the end of the term. Today, Monday March 23, will be the final day of the term for kids in Victoria. In NSW, schools are open but parents are being told to keep their children home unless they have no other option. Other states and territories are not as restrictive and encourage parents to keep children in school. Governments are working on online materials to continue the curriculum if schools are shut. Parents should seek specific information from their state or territory government. The Prime Minister has said people can leave their homes, but only if their travel is essential. That might be to go to the shops, go to work or go to the pharmacy. People may exercise, but only in isolation. Government leaders have insisted reducing social interaction every day is imperative and it is up to Australians to make sensible decisions. “If people simply behave as normal, if they don’t take this seriously, if they act selfishly, then people will die,” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrew said. “I can’t be any clearer than that.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Open, shut or online? Confusion for parents, students on school status","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/schools-coronavirus-open-shut\/","transcript":"Confusion reigns over the status of Australian schools during the coronavirus pandemic, with Victoria and the ACT breaking away and shutting campuses while schools in other states remain open. Victoria has brought its Easter school holidays forward to allow it to close schools on Tuesday. The ACT will move to online teaching, although face-to-face learning will be available for students who need it. But other states and territories intend to keep campuses open until the Easter break. It’s a view that is causing anger in some quarters. Queensland Teachers’ Union president Kevin Bates called on the state government to close schools by mid-week, saying he cannot rule out strike action if negotiations fail. Mr Bates said the safety of teaching staff was being endangered. On Monday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged parents to keep their children at home. “However, no child will be turned away, schools remain open,” she said. “The choice is yours.” In the ongoing debate over the status of schools, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said parents who want to keep their children out of class can do so until the end of term one. He has insisted schools need to remain open during the pandemic, and that campuses will reopen for term two, subject to medical advice at that time. Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan said he and his state and territory counterparts did not want children to lose a year’s education as a result of the pandemic, if they could avoid it. “We want our children to continue to get an education for as long as they possibly can during this COVID-19 outbreak,” he told the ABC. Mr Tehan also said it was critical schools remained open to accommodate vulnerable kids and the children of essential services workers. Here’s a breakdown of the situation in each state: NSW schools remain open, although parents are encouraged to keep kids at home. “There will be a single unit of teaching for all teachers – online learning takes place until the school holidays commence in three weeks,” Ms Berejiklian said. She said almost a third of NSW children had already been taken out of school and “we appreciate and anticipate that number will increase”. Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the state was well-prepared to tackle the challenges posed to schools by the COVID-19 outbreak. “We have been preparing for this since the beginning of the year,” she said. Teachers, including those with health concerns, will be given more flexibility to work from home. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has defied Mr Morrison’s insistence that schools stay open, bringing forward holidays in the state. Mr Andrews said Victoria was in a unique position to shut schools from Tuesday because holidays were to start as soon as Friday. “I’m very comfortable with the decision that I’ve made,” he said. Mr Andrews said usual school holiday activities like going to the movies or having sleepovers were no longer appropriate. The early closure would give teachers the opportunity to prepare for distance learning when school resumed on April 14, Mr Andrews said. There would also be help for essential service employees such as health workers who will have children home from school. “There will be some people who can’t be home looking after their kids because they’ve got patients to treat, critical functions to perform, we’ll put in place arrangements,” he said. Queensland is following the PM’s instructions, and has kept schools open. However, parents can choose to keep their children at home. The decision has upset teachers, who say no one is talking about what might happen to them if they’re infected by students. They report public schools don’t have enough hand sanitiser and soap, and that it is not possible to enforce the four-square-metres per person rule in classrooms. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said holidays planned during the upcoming holidays should be cancelled. “We want to send a clear message to people to stay in your state and stay in your suburb,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “There is no school holidays.” South Australian schools also remain open and Premier Steven Marshall said the message from health experts was clear. “Send your children to school. If we do this we will slow the spread of the disease,” Mr Marshall told radio 5AA on Monday. “But having said that, there are some parents who would like to have their children out of school.” Mr Marshall said schools would also need to provide more flexible learning options for parents who believed they could supervise their children and look after them at home. ACT schools will go pupil-free from Tuesday, with online classes available. Face-to-face learning will still be available for children who need it, and childcare centres will also stay open. The ACT’s rules closely mirror what’s occurring in NSW as it is a region within the state. Public schools remain open “for the time being”, but parents will be able to keep children home from Wednesday. However, Premier Peter Gutwein said parents had a responsibility to keep tabs on their kids should they remove them from school. “If you decide to take them out of school, look after them, be responsible for them,” he said. Mr Gutwein said school remained the “safest place” for kids, in line with national medical advice. Schools remain open although the state Education Department is preparing for potential closures. Premier Mark McGowan said the government was looking at how to offer lessons online and the possibility of bringing school holidays forward. “Whatever happens with schools, we have to make sure that essential services workers can continue to work and we have to protect grandparents and the elderly,” he told the Nine newspapers. Schools will be open until the Easter break begins on April 9. Essington International School principal Brian Kennelly told the NT News that while his school would shut only if directed by the government, he had been preparing for online learning. “We’re conscious that there’s a lot of rumours and talk about what will happen in Australia but if you look overseas and see what’s happening over there and the preventive action that most westernised countries are following is that schools are closing,” he said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"New Zealand to enter lockdown to fight the coronavirus | The New Daily","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/new-zealand-lockdown-coronavirus\/","transcript":"New Zealand is moving to a near-complete societal lockdown within 48 hours as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern aims to seize on a “window of opportunity” to contain the new coronavirus. Ms Ardern told reporters at Parliament in Wellington on Monday afternoon that now was the time “to put our plans into action,” she said. New Zealand has moved to “alert level 3” and soon to level 4  which means people will be instructed to stay at home, educational facilities close and all businesses will close except for essential services like supermarkets, pharmacies and clinics. “We need to act now, or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere … we currently have 102 cases, but so did Italy once. “We are preparing as a nation to go into self-isolation,” she said. In a move which is being seen as a step further than other countries including Australia, New Zealand has also ordered cafes and restaurants to cease offering a takeaway option within 48 hours. “Non-essential businesses in New Zealand now close. All bars, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, pools, museums, libraries, playgrounds, any other place where the public congregate, must close their face-to-face function. “Over the next 48 hours, those who provide, for instance, takeaway services, must move to close their operations also. All indoors and outdoor events cannot proceed. “In short, we are all now preparing as a nation to go into self-isolation in the same way that we have seen many other countries do. Earlier on Monday, the Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield announced 36 new confirmed cases, including two community transmissions, taking the overall number of positive tests to 102. “While the majority of these cases continue to be linked to overseas travel in some way, I can also confirm, as did the Director-General of Health, that we have two cases where public health officials have been unable to find how they came in contact with COVID-19. “On that basis, we now consider there is transmission within our communities.” “We are fortunate to still be some way behind the majority of overseas countries in terms of cases, but the trajectory is very clear. Act now or risk the virus taking hold. We currently have 102 cases, but so did Italy once. Now the virus has overwhelmed their health system and hundreds of people are dying every day. “The situation here is moving at pace and so must we. We have always said we would act early, decisively, and go hard, and we will,” Ms Ardern said. “There is no easy way to say that, but it is the reality that we have seen overseas and the possibility that we may face here. “Together, we must stop that from happening, and we can. Right now, we have a window of opportunity to break the chain of community transmission. To contain the virus, to stop it multiplying and to protect New Zealanders from the worst. “Our plan is simple, we can stop the spread by staying at home and reducing contact. Now is the time to act. “Staying at home is essential.

As long queues spilled out of Centrelink offices around the country and the Australian sharemarket plunged more than 8 per cent in early trade on Monday, the Prime Minister addressed a near empty Parliament. “Life is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change,” he said. “For many, young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives. “We gather today at a time of great challenge for our nation and indeed the world. We are a strong nation and a strong people but in the months ahead this will put us all to the test. At no time like this, since World War II. But together, Australia, we are up to this challenge. “We summon the spirit of the Anzacs, of our great Depression generation, of those who built the Snowy, of those who won the great peace of World War II and defended Australia. That is our legacy that we draw on at this time.” Mr Morrison said the decision to double payments for the unemployed (announced on Sunday in the government’s second coronavirus stimulus package) was designed to help families who face a desperate year. The MyGov website also crashed under enormous demand on Monday. “Across Australia today, many thousands of Australians will lose their jobs,” he said. “They are lining up at Centrelink offices as we speak – something unimaginable on this scale only weeks ago. They have lost their jobs, and we know many more will. This is the biggest economic shock our nation has faced in generations. Australia, long an open trading nation, is now closed off largely from the world.” “This will be a test of all Australians. It is a test of our nation. Of our spirit. There are some who believe Liberal democracies and free societies cannot cope with these sorts of challenges. We will prove them wrong here in Australia.” Mr Morrison said the challenge ahead was bigger than politics, prime ministers, captains of industry and leaders of union movements. “I want to thank all of those who have come to this great challenge with such a unity of spirit,” he said. “It requires every single Australian to do their duty as public citizens,” he said. The Prime Minister warned Monday’s shutdowns of pubs, restaurants, churches and other businesses deemed non-essential could be extended and could be lengthy. “Australians will be living with this virus for at least the next six months. It could be longer,” he said. “There is no short-term solution to this. We have to steel ourselves for the next six months and work together to slow the spread.” Mr Morrison said it was not business as usual and Australians needed to adjust to the new reality. “No more going to the pub after work. No more going to the gym in the morning,” he said. “No more sitting down at a cafe for lunch. These changes are vital to slow the spread of this virus. As the virus spreads – and it will – governments around Australia will not be complacent and may need, and are likely to need, to impose further restrictions on our daily lives.” The Prime Minister said he was praying and urged other Australians to do the same. “While you may not be able to go to church, the synagogue, the temple or the mosque, I most certainly call on all people of faith in our nation to pray,” he said. “I can assure you, my prayer knees are getting a good work out.

The former federal MP says he’s happy to lose his money, but he believes Hydroxychloroquine could help prevent infections, or reduce the severity of illness in those who do get the virus. Mr Palmer has promised to fund the manufacture or acquisition of the courses, and has appointed Brisbane pharmacist Jeremey Sheridan to “lead the effort to oversee the large-scale manufacturing of the drug in Australia”. News Corp reported a small number of Australian coronavirus patients have been successfully medicated with drugs including hydroxychloroquine and the HIV medication Kaletra. The World Health Organisation last week said it would study the drug’s effectiveness, and US President Donald Trump has been touting its possible benefits, with studies underway in America and in Europe. Mr Sheridan said Australia needed to act fast to ensure it has enough of the drug. “While the clinical trials in Australia in 50 hospitals may take four to five months to complete, it is important that arrangements for the large-scale manufacture or acquisition of Hydroxychloroquine proceed quickly,” he said. “We cannot wait. To delay now could cost Australian lives in the coming months. We cannot wait to start the process of large-scale acquisition of the drug.” Mr Palmer says he wants to ensure all Australians have access to the drug as soon as possible.

More than $100 billion was wiped off the value of shares as some states closed their borders and a coronavirus stimulus bill stalled in the US Congress. At 12.30pm AEDT, the ASX 200 index had lost 8.3 per cent, or 399 points, to 4418. The All Ordinaries index was down 8.5 per cent, or 407 points, to 4409. It later came off those lows in a very volatile day of trade. The Reserve Bank said it planned to buy another $4 billion in government bonds. That follows a $5 billion purchase of bonds on Friday in its biggest intervention in Australia’s financial system in history. The banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, will soon announce plans to reduce the regulatory burden faced by financial institutions in the wake of the coronavirus. The news comes a little over a year since the final report of the banking royal commission was released, which clamped down on bad behaviour by financial institutions. The Council for Financial Regulators said it had discussed the need for continued “close engagement” and contingency plans with international regulators. CMC Markets chief markets strategist for Asia Pacific, Michael McCarthy, said investors were increasingly pessimistic about the economic outlook and were expecting a recession globally and in Australia, especially as the US Senate failed to advance a coronavirus stimulus bill. “The lack of political will in a crisis is really disappointing investors,” he said. However, negotiations are ongoing, and US President Donald Trump said Congress was close to reaching an agreement. On the local market, banks and industrial stocks led the falls. The big banks plunged to multi-year lows, with National Australia Bank back at levels not seen since 1996 at one point this morning. Financial company Challenger dropped by nearly one fifth to $3.08 after the Federal Government said people in financial difficulty because of the coronavirus could access their superannuation early. And retail firms like Premier Investments also took a hit. Its shares lost one quarter of their value to $9.01. Flight Centre brought forward plans to close 100 underperforming stores and its senior executives will take a 50 per cent pay cut. US stocks futures fell by nearly 4 per cent in opening trade in Asia, suggesting another fall on Wall Street tonight. In early trade, the Nikkei 225 in Japan rose 0.8 per cent to 16,683. In China, the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.3 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 4.4 per cent. In New Zealand, the benchmark NZ50 index lost 10.2 per cent to 8258 after the country’s government announced a shutdown to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus. It has been the index’s biggest single-day percentage fall on record. Global credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) estimated total and permanent losses in Asia because of the coronavirus stood at $US620 billion ($1.08 trillion) for governments, companies, banks and households. Last week it said the global economy was already in recession. S&P predicted Australia’s economy would expand by just 0.4 per cent in 2020 after growth of 2.2 per cent last year seasonally adjusted according to the Bureau of Statistics. It said China’s growth rate could halve this year to 2.9 per cent.

It’s not the Spanish flu that killed 15 million people just after the First World War … I’m 80, I should be really scared. Guess what? I’m not really scared.” Mr Harvey also said the virus had brought a boost to his chain of electronics and home appliance shops. “You know, this is an opportunity,” he said. “Our sales are up in Harvey Norman in Australia by 9 per cent on last year. Our sales in freezers are up 300 per cent. And what about air purifiers? Up 100 per cent.” The comments drew scathing criticism on social media, along with widespread calls for a boycott of Harvey Norman stores. Mr Harvey appeared in a special episode of the Nine Network show, along with health experts, business leaders and Prime Minister Scott Morrison. It aired within hours of Mr Morrison announcing non-essential services – including pubs, restaurants and churches – would close across Australia from midday on Monday. It also followed weeks of panic buying in supermarkets across the country as Australians prepared for tougher restrictions on movement to help slow the spread of COVID-19. As the frenzied shopping showed no signs of slowing, and amid outbreaks of violence in the aisles, supermarkets have restricted purchases of staples such as pasta, canned tomatoes, rice, milk and toilet paper. Mr Harvey, who reportedly has a net worth of $1.9 billion and is at No.40 on the Australian Financial Review‘s rich list, said earlier in March he had lost more than $1 million as Australian shares plunged. He told the Nine newspapers that he had spent $15 million on various stocks – including Woodside, BHP, Rio Tinto, the big four banks, Computershare and his own Harvey Norman – as they plunged to 12-month lows on fears for the fallout from the virus pandemic. The shares have since fallen further. Mr Harvey said he had likely lost $1.5 million on the purchases – but he remained unfazed. “In 10 years I’ll probably still have most of them,” he said. “I just look at the long term and go ‘oh well’.

Virgin said on Monday it expected its domestic schedule to be hit by travel bans introduced by the states and the federal government at the weekend. The airline last week reduced domestic capacity across Virgin and Tigerair brands by 50 per cent and ceased its international operations in response to tightening quarantine measures. Virgin said more information would be provided in coming days. Regional airline Rex entered a trading halt on Monday pending an announcement to the ASX that it will cease passengers services in all states except Queensland. Last week Regional Express announced a 45 per cent reduction in capacity, including suspending its Armidale, Newcastle and Port Augusta routes. Elsewhere, Dubai carrier Emirates has slashed its passenger flight destinations to 13, down from 145. The state-owned carrier said it would still fly to Australia, the US, Britain, Japan and Canada. The company had just hours earlier announced a suspension of all passenger flights, but reversed that decision after receiving requests from governments and customers to support repatriation of travellers. The United Arab Emirates, which is home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has all but closed its borders to travellers. There are exceptions for those transiting through or returning. The airline said it would continue to operate cargo flights to transport essential goods, including medical supplies across the world. It also said the company would reduce salaries for the majority of its employees for three months. It will not cut jobs. Airlines around the world are struggling to cover their costs and pay salaries with their fleets grounded and countries shutting their borders to travellers. In a statement released on Sunday, Emirates said it had tried to maintain passenger flights “for as long as feasible” to help travellers return home amid expanding travel bans, restrictions, and lockdowns. Emirates Group chief executive and chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum described the situation as “an unprecedented crisis” and said “the world has literally gone into quarantine” due to the virus. Air and travel companies have been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic as demand plummets amid government-imposed bans and calls for increased social isolation measures. Virgin’s larger rival Qantas last week stood down 20,000 – or two-thirds – of its workforce and slashed international travel to help it absorb the virus blow. Qantas has also reduced its domestic capacity. Sydney Airport on Monday said it was working through scheduling impacts with airline but it anticipated, and was planning for, a “significant but temporary reduction in international and domestic traffic”. Travel firm Webjet has suspended trading on the ASX as it works on a proposed capital raising. Flight Centre is in a voluntary trading suspension until at least March 30 as it works through the impact on its business. More and more businesses are preparing to close their doors to comply with the latest travel and trading restrictions. Licensed clubs, pubs, gyms, cinemas, casinos and places of worship are expected to close their doors from midday on Monday in their state. South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory are imposing two-week quarantine periods on people seeking to enter these states. Police will monitor travellers at checkpoints. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Panic buying triggers supermarket price hikes as retailers plead for calm","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-fruit-vegetable-prices\/","transcript":"Supermarket prices are on the rise as cases of coronavirus continue to increase around the country. South Australian disability pensioner Lynette Holmes can no longer afford several items on her shopping list due to the skyrocketing cost of fresh food. The 64-year-old said she had seen supermarket prices soar in the past week just as new social distancing protocols came into effect. “Seven dollars for lettuce is ridiculous and $15 for five kilos of potatoes is ridiculous,” Ms Holmes said. “I managed to get a four-kilo bag [of potatoes] today for $5.80 at Woolworths. “That was the cheapest I’ve seen around at the moment.” Master Grocers Australia CEO Jos De Bruin said Ms Holmes’ shopping experience had become a familiar story. “We have seen the tripling in prices, and with items like lettuces up around the $10 mark at some [stores],” Mr De Bruin said. “We’ve seen celery increase by three times, we’ve seen cauliflower increase in price.” At time of publication, prices for sugar snap peas at one supermarket were set at $6.99 each, a kilogram of roma tomatoes was $9.99 and one cauliflower cost $14.99. Mr De Bruin said the food retail market has been rocked by panic buyers and people stocking up before self-isolating. “[Australia’s food retail market] was a market that’s quite controlled, it’s a market that’s quite predictable,” he said. “Now we’ve gone into a market that’s completely uncontrolled and unpredictable. “The philosophy around economics is that prices go up, so scarcity drives prices up, and that’s what’s happening with our fruit and vegetables.” With demand outstripping supply, the food transport industry is under pressure and businesses are becoming strained. “We [independent grocers] are doing a lot more online ordering, we’re picking and packing orders, we’re delivering for free,” Mr De Bruin said. “The cost to do business has gone through the roof, exponentially. “People might see a huge spike in sales, but what people are not seeing is the huge added cost to do business.” In a statement, Woolworths said price increases had been driven by a range of factors. “We’ve seen an extraordinary level of demand for groceries across the country over the past week, including on fresh fruit and vegetables,” a spokesperson said. “This elevated demand has impacted the availability of a few vegetable lines that are typically in shorter supply at this time of year across the whole market. “We’re working closely with our fresh food suppliers to manage the impact of this increased demand, alongside the environmental impact of drought and unseasonal weather in different parts of the country. “We understand the pressures facing Australian households right now and remain focused on offering quality fresh food to our customers at competitive prices.” Independent Retailers Association chairman Colin Shearing said it was time shoppers returned to their normal buying behaviour. “What is happening at the moment is this ridiculous and absurd panic buying, thinking the world is going to end,” Mr Shearing said. “Just relax, go back to your normal buying habits. “If everyone did that in Australia right now, this would be resolved.” Mr De Bruin said prices would come back down eventually. “When normality comes back, we will see all these prices come back to where they need to be,” he said. In a statement, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it “cannot prevent or take action to stop excessive pricing”. “[The ACCC] has no role in setting prices,” a spokesperson said. “If a business makes misleading claims about the reason for price increases, it will be breaching the Australian consumer law.” ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Victoria's lockdown to be enforced by special police taskforce | The New Daily","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/victoria-lockdown-police-taskforce\/","transcript":"A specialist coronavirus enforcement police taskforce will begin operating across Victoria to enforce the self-isolation mandate and social distancing as pubs, clubs, cinemas and sporting venues closed on Monday. In a clear and direct warning, Premier Daniel Andrews said Victoria police have allocated 500 police members to a special task force “that is all about enforcing the coronavirus rules that have been put in place”. A Victoria Police spokesperson said on Monday afternoon further details on the “coronavirus enforcement squad” including its operating model would be provided shortly. “The taskforce will cover the entire state,” he said, adding that there would be no details on the breakdown by suburb or region of where police will operate. Mr Andrews said it was “painful but it is absolutely appropriate” with the shutdown, effective from 12pm, and will include pubs, clubs, nightclubs, Crown Casino, licensed venues in hotels, gyms, indoor sporting venues, places of worship, cinemas, entertainment venues, and the holding of weddings and funerals. Restaurants and cafes will only be allowed to provide home delivery or takeaway services, he said but hairdressers and beauticians can continue to operate. “This list is comprehensive,” he said, urging people to go to the state government’s coronavirus website for a full list. He confirmed the Victorian school holidays would start on Monday afternoon. Victoria recorded 59 new cases overnight, taking the state’s total to 355 cases. The number is expected to rise on Monday with the tally finalised at 9.30am, Mr Andrews said. In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the same venues in that state will not be able to operate in the normal way from 12pm. As of 8am on Monday, NSW has 669 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, up by 136 overnight. There are 10 people in ICUs and six people have died. “I want to stress that schools in NSW from tomorrow will remain open,” she told reporters on Monday morning. “The health advice has not changed however, for practical reasons, in NSW we will be encouraging parents to keep their children at home.” Ms Berejiklian said no child would be turned away from a public school in NSW. “Already last week we had up to 30 per cent of parents who chose to keep students or their children at home and we appreciate and anticipate that number will increase. “Schools will remain open and for those children who have no option, whose parents have no option, no child will be turned away from school.” Victoria now has 355 cases. Mr Andrews said it was “disappointing”, “but we have seen people on beaches in Sydney, we could just as easily have seen people in bars and cafes and restaurants and nightclubs here in Melbourne and right across Victoria”. “It is unacceptable. It will cost lives. So no matter what you call it, no matter what motivates you, do the right thing for everybody. “That’s what’s at stake here. If we have a situation where this virus fundamentally gets away from us we will have thousands of people who will only survive if they can breathe with the assistance of a machine and we will not have enough machines, nurses and doctors to provide that care “I’m not sure whether I could make it any clearer than that. If you need further evidence, turn on your TV, have a look at what’s going on in Italy, have a look at what’s going on in many other parts of the world. “This is the only way that we can keep people safe by flattening that surf and suppressing the number of people who finish up with coronavirus and ultimately reducing the number of people who will die. That is what’s at stake. “It is easy to do the right thing for your family and for people that you have never met. “I just want to make this point, whether you call it mateship, whether you call it being Australian, being Victorian, whether you call it decent behaviour, civic duty, I don’t care what you call it, just do it,” he said in a passionate press conference on Monday morning.

Prime minister Andrej Plenkovic said the 5.3 magnitude quake was the largest to hit Zagreb in 140 years. The shakes damaged the city’s iconic cathedral and littered the streets with debris including falling slabs of concrete which crushed cars. A 15-year-old teen remains in a critical condition after being found by an emergency services team under a collapsed building, according to Zarko Rasic, the head of the Zagreb Emergency Medicine Institute. Another minor had been admitted with head injuries from a falling roof when the quake struck 6km north of the city. “It lasted over 10 seconds. By far the strongest I have ever felt,” one witness told Al Jazeera, adding that it was followed by several aftershocks. Soldiers wearing masks had been called in to help clean up debris as citizens were advised to remain outside their homes while continuing to practise social distancing amid potential aftershocks. “Earthquakes are dangerous but coronavirus is even more so,” health minister Vili Beroš said. So far, Croatia has reported at least 254 cases of the virus and one death. “We will do our utmost to make the best estimate of what to do at the moment. There are protocols when it comes to an earthquake. But when it comes to an earthquake combined with the global pandemic, then it is a much more complicated situation,” Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said. The city’s cathedral, which was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake, had one of its two spines collapse in the quake. Some buildings fell down as people fled apartments and took to the streets. The Zagreb Fire Department said firefighting and rescue operations were ongoing at several locations. GFZ downgraded the magnitude of the quake from an initial reading of 6.0. The US Geological Survey said the quake measured 5.4 while the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre also reported 5.3 magnitude, followed by another 5.1 magnitude earthquake. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus pandemic: What do you want to know?","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-australia-questions\/","transcript":"Last week we kicked off a series asking TND readers what you wanted to know about the coronavirus pandemic.

And in the US, Senator Rand Paul has contracted the illness and is also now in isolation. The news broke as US Congress was meeting for a rare weekend sitting to negotiate an emergency stimulus bill to deal with the fallout of the virus. Senator Paul had not been there for those debates, working remotely that day, but he had been on the floor just days earlier and had mingled with colleagues and reporters. Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for COVID-19. He is feeling fine and is in quarantine. He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 22, 2020 The Republican is the third member of Congress to have contracted COVID-19 as the virus spreads throughout the US. Staffers have also tested positive and others have been told to self-isolate as a precaution. Worldwide, there are concerns political leaders may have contracted the coronavirus and in turn spread it to others (many have travelled extensively and attended crowded events). Meanwhile, new figures out of Europe on Monday morning show doctors and nurses are increasingly risking their own lives as they work on the frontline of the virus. Almost 4000 British medical workers have signed a letter to the Sunday Times warning that doctors and nurses in the National Health Service would die if they did not receive better protective equipment. In Italy, healthcare workers now account for nearly one in 10 of the country’s Covid-19 cases. Italy’s National Health Institute found more than 4800 health professionals have contracted the coronavirus. The death toll had climbed by 651 to 5476 by Monday morning (Australian time), a day after Italy recorded 793 new deaths. Since March 11, at least 18 doctors treating coronavirus patients have died, 15 of whom had been working in the hardest-hit Lombardy region. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte went on live TV to announce he is tightening the country’s lockdown and shutting down all production facilities except those providing essential goods and services. “We are facing the most serious crisis that the country has experienced since World War II,” Mr Conte told Italians during a broadcast at midnight local time. As bodies piled up in Italian hospitals, morgues and churches, and as medical workers pleaded for more help, there was no sign that Italy was yet taming its arc of contagion. In Spain, COVID-19 has claimed 394 lives over the past 24 hours, taking its total number of confirmed fatalities to 1720. About 12 per cent (or about 3500) of the 28,600 infected people are doctors and other health workers. The acceleration of the country’s death toll forced Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to extend its state of emergency for another 15 days. In the United States, there have been 49 new coronavirus fatalities recorded in the past 24 hours. At one New York hospital, half of the more 500 people who tested for the coronavirus received a positive result. The facility already had 558 coronavirus patients, one in five of whom were in intensive care. Of nearly 30,000 cases in the United States, more than 15,000 are in New York state, including more than 9000 in New York City. Nationwide, there were at least 26,747 cases and 374 deaths as the US overtook Germany as the country with the fourth-highest number of cases. New York City mayor Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city was in desperate need of ventilators and other medical supplies and staff, and lambasted the White House as non-responsive. Meanwhile, Iran’s supreme leader refused US assistance to fight the virus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the illness could be made by America. Iran says it has 1685 deaths and 21,638 confirmed cases of the virus – a toll that experts from the World Health Organisation say is almost certainly under-reported. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus state lockdowns: Can I get my coffee or go to the gym?","date":"03-23-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/23\/coronavirus-lockdown-cafes-gyms\/","transcript":"Our everyday life is set to change dramatically over the next 48 hours, as governments move to shut down non-essential activities to slow down the spread of the coronavirus.

Travel on compassionate grounds or for emergencies is also permitted. We can still go out of our homes (as of Monday morning there are no lockdowns announced) but everyone is urged to stay 1.5 metres away from each other.

Just 16 years old at the time, the young star reportedly refused to sign up for the last two instalments – Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows parts one and two – despite being offered more than $4 million per film. Watson said she was sick of playing Harry Potter’s know-it-all friend and wanted to expand her acting repertoire. Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter, and Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley, had both signed up to see out the rest of the globally popular series, which follows the life of an 11-year-old orphan who discovers he is a wizard. Watson finally signed the dotted line on March 23 amid rumours entertainment company Warner Bros upped its offer. And their persuasion paid off; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, was the highest-grossing Harry Potter film, generating an enormous $2.2 billion worldwide. Since appearing in all seven Harry Potter films, Watson, an activist and a model, has taken steps to branch out beyond her role as Hermione Granger. She is a United Nations goodwill ambassador fighting for gender equality. In 2014, she launched her HeForShe campaign with the UN, which reportedly inspired Pakistani activist for female education Malala Yousafzai to identify as a feminist.

Despite schools in ACT and Victoria announcing extended school holidays on Sunday, Scott Morrison said there was an agreement in the national coronavirus cabinet from state premiers that schools will reopen – subject to medical advice – after the holidays. But it was the PM’s comments on schools that caused confusion on Sunday night, with Facebook groups of worried parents around the country debating and trying to decipher the new rules. “There has been no change to the advice, the health advice, in relation to schools,” Mr Morrison said. “Children should go to school tomorrow.

If you are a four-year-old child at preschool, you do not get your whole year back. You only get it once. “In addition, schools will seek to provide learning at home in a distance learning framework, but you cannot be assured that that will come in place immediately. “But what is important here is if you are a parent and you want your child to go to school up until the end of this term, and the schools should remain open and must remain open is the instruction, until the end of that term.” Statement on Victoria's response to Coronavirus: pic.twitter.com\/YF4yFsE4Si — Dan Andrews (@DanielAndrewsMP) March 22, 2020 On Sunday, Victoria, and the ACT announced they would prematurely end term one and have pupil-free days from Tuesday to allow schools to prepare for distance learning. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian flagged that she would have more to say on the status on schools in her state by Monday morning. The PM’s claim that schools should remain open until the end of the term appeared at odds with the announcements from states. “What we will be doing though is allowing parents … to be able to keep their children at home where they choose to,” Mr Morrison said. “But for all of those parents who wish to send their children to school, for education at the school, those schools will remain open.” The comments prompted a rebuke from the ACT Education Minister Yvette Berry, who said the decision to close the ACT schools early on Tuesday for extended holidays won’t change. “I don’t know why the PM suggested otherwise. Education will continue to be phased in for online\/ distance learning,” Ms Berry said. The decision the ACT Government has made is consistent with NSW and Vic and won’t change.

There will not be congregating up at the trampoline venue or whatever it happens to be.” The Prime Minister implied he had been left with little choice to close pubs and clubs after images emerged of hundreds of beachgoers at Sydney’s Bondi Beach defying the public health advice to practise social distancing. “The social distancing practices are not being observed as well as they should be,” he said. “They are Stage I and they will be reviewed on a monthly basis but … once you start putting these sorts of arrangements in place we should have the expectation that they will remain in place for at least six months. “If the health situation changes and enables us to reconsider those arrangements, then that can be reconsidered.” Cinemas, casinos and nightclubs will close. Gyms and indoor sporting venues will also close their doors from noon. But bottleshops can remain open and pub restaurants could continue to trade if offering takeaway and delivery food. Hairdressers can also continue to trade. “I am deeply regretful that those workers and those business owners who will be impacted by this decision will suffer the economic hardship that undoubtedly they will now have to face. That is a very, very regretful decision,” the PM said. CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN Q&A Can I take the kids interstate for the school holidays? No. Some states including South Australia have shut their borders. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the medical advice is clear: Don’t do it. “If you were planning to go interstate, if you were going to far-flung places within the state. But even more closer to home.” Can my kids go to school on Monday? Yes. The PM said they should go to school. You can choose to keep them home, but the PM insists they must be supervised and not “roaming” around shopping centres. NSW, Victoria and the ACT have brought forward the school holidays but the PM wants schools to reopen after the break. Schools are looking at distance education options, but the plan is to keep them open for essential services workers. Can I go to the shops? Yes. Supermarkets, shopping centres and even hairdressers will remain open for business. “You can go to the shops and do all of those sorts of things, provided the arrangements are in place where those places are open for business,” the Prime Minister said. Can I go for a walk? Yes. “If you’re not ill and if you’re not in self-isolation, then you can obviously get about your life in that way. But when it comes to piling all the kids in the car and taking them four hours away, or getting on a plane and flying to the other side of the country, then no – we’re saying that should not be done,” Mr Morrison said. Can I go to the pub or the gym? Not from noon on Monday.

Like many of us, Mr Bergomi continued his routine and headed out every morning for a coffee with friends. Three of his cafe companions are now dead. On the other side of the world, in the Victorian coastal town of Torquay, his nephew Luca Rossi anxiously awaits calls and texts from his family. Mr Bergomi, and other relatives, have begun showing flu symptoms – along with thousands of others in Bergamo, in Italy’s Lombardy region where hundreds of people have already died from COVID-19. “My grandparents have been locked in their house for a month and even my own parents don’t visit, to protect them,” Mr Rossi told The New Daily. The hospital in his home town is so overwhelmed “they’re not doing funerals any more – just burning bodies”, he said. But it’s not just the status of his family’s health that has Mr Rossi on edge. Looking around the streets of the Surf Coast, which he calls home after moving to Australia seven years ago, the university academic fears the same patterns of complacency are continuing here. In a message to friends on Sunday he pleaded for them to stay home: “[Italy had] pretty much the same trend…we are just one month behind,” he wrote. His fears have been echoed nationwide – and across the globe, with photographs of beachgoers packing NSW’s Bondi Beach (in defiance of social distancing pleas) going viral at the weekend. “What happened at Bondi Beach yesterday was not OK, and served as a message to federal and state leaders that too many Australians are not taking these issues seriously enough,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday. Mr Morrison described the situation as “deadly serious” as he urged people to heed the social-distancing advice. Hours later, state governments started announcing major bans on ‘non-essential’ activity. It’s the closest thing to lockdown in Australia so far. People can still move about town. Just make sure to stay 1.5 metres apart from each other and avoid touching, including handshakes and hugs. For other advice on coronavirus social etiquette, read this. Bill Bowtell, a strategic health policy adviser and Adjunct Professor at the University of New South Wales, said Australians should not leave their homes unless they absolutely have to go out (such as for food or medicine). “Our caseload is rising exponentially – we are where Italy was on the 6th of March,” Professor Bowtell, who helped lead Australia’s response to the AIDS crisis, told The New Daily on Sunday. “The gravity of the situation is really serious, as serious as anything anybody has ever had to face in the history of this country and the world. We have to take dramatic action.” Professor Bowtell’s key message to all Australians is: “Stay in, stay alive”. Mr Rossi agreed, adding it was “crucial that everybody takes social distancing really seriously to try to avoid what happened in Italy”. “Don’t panic. Just accept the situation, which is temporary, and don’t try to go around the system and think you’re smarter than other people because that’s when problems happen. “This has to be tackled as a community.

Her preferred brand had been stripped from the shelves. Did she need a “serving suggestion”? Did it lack the warning that cigarettes come with and a picture of the worst-case scenario? Isn’t it all just paper? The Northern Territory News should be applauded for an edition with watermarked blank pages delineating toilet paper. A good joke is a laugh and a lesson. Fortuitously, my phone rang just as I was taking this in. It was my intimate companion who, when I told her where I was, immediately asked me to get some toilet paper. With clarity and forthrightness, I said a single word. No. I wandered to the delicatessen section and chatted to the man behind the counter about the absurdity of it all. We discussed hoarding and bacalla, a dried and salted cod dredged from the North Atlantic. It doesn’t need to be refrigerated, just soaked for a few days. I used to see buckets of them propped like walking sticks or umbrellas or kindling in this same supermarket. We agreed that it was a more sustainable thing to hoard in preparation for the twilight of civilisation. I didn’t realise there was one hanging just above his head. He pointed to it and observed, “That’s been there for five years.” Rehydrating them can be onerous. You have to immerse them for a couple of days and regularly refresh the water to wash away the salt. I have been advised that the cistern of a toilet can provide this regular replenishment. Maybe you turn your nose up at this but you can be just as picky about brands of toilet paper. Welcome to the pandemic, an interesting word comprising Pan-Ic – fear of everything – and including Demos, the people. I am indebted to my son for the following observation. If a group of three or more stand still and look upwards, then passersby coalesce around them looking upwards to see what they are looking at. We are herd animals racing from the pursuing predator in the general direction of the cliff. Americans are panic-buying guns, which is understandable in a culture where the only safety net is money. Halley’s Comet was pointed out to me by a friend some years ago. It was an indistinguishable dot. There was a total eclipse that I observed in my lifetime. I went outside, the birds went quiet, it got dark. Ossie Ostrich told me that his parents sent he and his sister away to the country to elude the then untreatable polio. (Spoiler alert: He wasn’t a real ostrich, just a guy making a moveable neck and animated mouth with his right arm.) Now I, too, can say that I’ve lived in a time of pandemic. My ancestors survived the bubonic plague, cholera, dysentery and smallpox. My psychological stance is that I am part of Darwin’s plan and I expect to emerge at the other end. I am more interested in what the herd is not scrambling for at the supermarket, what they are not buying in a panic. Booze, the cheap bottled water and the expensive pasta are being overlooked. Cup-a-soup – simply add water for the impression of nourishment – is lying fallow on the shelves. I was tempted by the metal cylinder of halal chicken luncheon meat that no one seemed to want. Woman’s Day and New Idea seem to have lost their appeal. Doesn’t anyone care about Brad and Meghan and Jennifer and Harry and Bieber any more? The aisle with the Easter eggs and bunnies is almost untouched. We have abandoned the pagan fertility ritual. Will hot cross buns and Mithras, the Ox God, be abandoned too? I am hoarding kippers. I sought out the denuded frozen fish cabinets and, sure enough, the only thing disdained and left was the oily smoked fish. In bulk. Can I suggest that you imagine yourself in lockdown on an 18th century sailing ship circumnavigating the globe. They dealt with scurvy by eating barrels of fermented cabbage – sauerkraut.

In what is confirmation Australians must prepare to face the country’s most extreme virus safety measures to date, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has declared non-essential services will shut down within 48 hours. Victoria also confirmed just before 3pm Sunday (local time) that schools would shut on Tuesday and there will be progressive closures of businesses such as pubs and restaurants. Schools in NSW will remain open on Monday, but the premier is likely to make further announcements on education in the days to come. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr announced that the territory would follow the lead of NSW as it was “impossible” to have different arrangements from the surrounding region. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Sunday night that pubs, clubs, cinemas, places of worship, casinos, nightclubs and indoor sporting venues – principal places of social gatherings – will be required to close across the nation from noon on Monday. Restaurants and cafes are permitted to remain open but only to offer takeaway or delivery services. Mr Morrison said the Stage One measures recommended by the national coronavirus cabinet could last up to six months. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews made a similar announcement to the NSW premier, confirming “non-essential” services will be forced to close. “This is not something that we do lightly,” Mr Andrews said. “But it’s clear that if we don’t take this step, more Victorians will contract coronavirus, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and more Victorians will die.” Supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies, convenience stores, and freight service – including home delivery of food – will remain open across Victoria and NSW. Political leaders are meeting on Sunday night to consider urgent powers that would see citizens banned from travelling between suburbs and in between so-called COVID-19 “red zones”. “Tonight I will be informing the National Cabinet that NSW will proceed to a more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services,” Ms Berejiklian said in a statement. “This will take place over the next 48 hours.” NSW Health on Sunday confirmed 97 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the state’s tally to 533. Authorities have still not been able to work out the source of infection for 46 of those cases, but they do know those people became infected within Australia. Victorian cases jumped by 67 overnight and the government confirmed there had been outbreaks in regional areas including Warrnambool and the Surf Coast. The call to shut down schools goes against the advice from the federal government. Prime Minister Scott Morrison persisted with the message for the past week that the health advice was that it was best to keep children at school. The advice from the PM caused widespread confusion among teachers and parents, with many questioning why Australians were told to ‘social distance’ yet send kids to class. The call by Mr Andrews makes Victoria the first state to officially close classroom doors to stop the spread of coronavirus. Children in other nations have already stopped going to school. The Victorian government said it was bringing forward the school holidays. It remains to be seen whether the ban on physical class attendance will extend into term two. Meanwhile, South Australia has confirmed it will effectively close its borders in a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19 following an outbreak within a group of tourists travelling around the Barossa Valley. Premier Steven Marshall announced on Sunday that anyone entering the state would be subject to a mandatory 14-day isolation period. The measures will take effect from 4pm on Tuesday. “The health of South Australians is unquestionably our No.1 priority and that is why we are acting swiftly and decisively to protect them from the impact of this disease,” he said. “We do not make this decision lightly but we have no choice”. South Australia’s borders will be monitored 24 hours a day and anyone entering the state will be forced to sign a declaration agreeing to self-isolate. State authorities moved to declare a “major emergency” on Sunday, triggering the shutdown. But Police Commissioner Grant Stevens admitted authorities were limited in their ability to enforce the isolation orders. SA Police have been checking on those who have already been ordered to self-isolate after disembarking international flights. He said authorities were “relying on people’s community and sense of goodwill to do the right thing”, and that overwhelmingly people had been complying with orders. Similar restrictions have been put in place in Tasmania and the Northern Territory.

Mr Morrison announced the new measures today in a $66 billion boost to previously announced stimulus measures in a desperate attempt to avoid a prolonged recession. But the Treasurer warned Australians that the economic hit was expected to be massive and deeper than had been originally forecast as the government is forced to effectively shutdown many pubs and restaurants and universities to stop the spread of the virus. People who lose their jobs as a result of the coronavirus shutdowns can expect a big boost to welfare benefits, which will increase by an extra $550 a fortnight. Newstart recipients, Youth Allowance and parenting payments will also secure an increased supplement for a period of six months. “It will be available to sole traders, casual workers who meet the income test,” the Treasurer said. “This means, anyone eligible for the maximum jobseeker payment will now receive more than $1100 a fortnight, effectively doubling the jobseeker allowance.” The national cabinet will meet on Sunday night amid reports that some state governments are calling for schools to be shut down and even mulling limits on public transport. Mr Morrison said he was disappointed to see the crowds at Bondi Beach, which has since been closed on public health grounds, but called it a wake-up call for the nation. “What happened at Bondi Beach was not OK,” he said, adding that it “served as a message to federal and state leaders that too many Australians are not taking these issues seriously enough. “So the measures that we will be considering tonight mean that state premiers and chief ministers may have to take far more draconian measures to enforce social distancing, particularly in areas of outbreaks than might otherwise be the case. The Prime Minister confirmed that people will be able to apply to access their super accounts through MyGov before July 1, 2020. “So, if you are a sole trader or a casual and you have seen your income or your hours of work fall by 20 per cent or more as a result of the coronavirus, you will be able to get early access to your superannuation,” the Treasurer said. “This initiative builds on provisions (to access super) on compassion grounds or hardship and up to $27 billion of superannuation can be put back into the pockets of hard-working Australians. The Prime Minister also confirmed it “may not be physically possible to convene the Parliament over the next six months”. “We are working through issues that would enable the Parliament to be reconvened on an emergency basis, to deal with any essential legislation that was required, particularly to address the coronavirus pandemic that is going around the world. So that is the priority for Parliament.” The Prime Minister also confirmed that the cabinet had agreed on a ban on travel unless it was on compassionate grounds or work-related. “All non-essential travel should be cancelled,” Mr Morrison said. Labor’s treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said the Morrison Government’s consultation with Labor on the package had been minimal. Mr Chalmers called on the Prime Minister to put Anthony Albanese in the national cabinet. “We want to make a constructive, responsible and supportive contribution here. That’s been our approach all along,” he said. “It’s not business as usual in the economy or in the community, and nor should it be business as usual in politics. This is an extraordinary time. It requires us all to work together.” Mr Chalmers said he was concerned about the move to allow people to dip into their superannuation. “If it was left up to us solely, we wouldn’t go down that path. We think that there are other ways to support people who are doing it tough. We think early access to superannuation should be a last resort, not a first port of call,” he said. “We also think that there are real issues with encouraging people to divest from super when the market’s in the condition that it is now. “It’s not good for them, it’s not good for the system more broadly, and we don’t want to create problems for people’s retirement down the track. “We wouldn’t go down that path, but let’s see what they propose later on and we’ll make our views known.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus lockdowns: Victoria, NSW to push for closure of pubs, schools","date":"03-22-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/22\/coronavirus-lockdown-schools-pubs-victoria-new-south-wales\/","transcript":"Governments are on the verge of approving dramatic lockdowns of the worst coronavirus-hit Australian communities in a desperate attempt to slow the exponential growth of the deadly disease before tens of thousands die from it.

Victoria will also push for schools to be shut from Tuesday. If it cannot reach a wider agreement with the Federal Government, the state will go it alone. Political leaders on Sunday night will consider urgent and draconian powers allowing authorities to shut down so-called COVID-19 “red zones”, meaning state police officers would prevent residents from travelling to less infected suburbs or areas. At the national cabinet meeting the Prime Minister, premiers and chief ministers will discuss how to best implement emergency restrictions like those adopted in parts of Europe and in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “We had scheduled our next meeting to focus on the issue of further and stronger measures to deal with local outbreaks within state jurisdictions,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. “We are bringing forward consideration of those matters to a meeting this evening”. The dramatic national approach would likely be assisted by the federal departments of Health and Home Affairs, and was flagged earlier this month by Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter, who warned the Commonwealth may need to use unprecedented quarantine laws to restrict the movement of people. Over the weekend health authorities were dismayed by numerous examples of crowds ignoring guidelines on social distancing, instead people cramming into popular locations such as Bondi Beach. “What happened at Bondi Beach yesterday was not OK and served as a message to federal and state leaders that too many Australians are not taking these issues seriously enough,” Mr Morrison said. The country’s rate of new confirmed coronavirus cases is now growing at 20-25 per cent a day, with some projections showing as many as two million Australians could be infected by the end of April.

In Asia, Singapore wioll prohibit all short-term visitors to transit or enter the city-state in its latest measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus and to conserve healthcare resources for its own citizens. The ban takes effect at midnight on Monday, local time. The city-state reported its first fatalities from the virus on Saturday and has confirmed 432 cases of the infection. Almost 80 per cent of its new cases over the past three days were imported. In Jordan, more than 220 people were arrested for violating a country-wide curfew, an offence punishable by a year in prison and an unspecified fine without a trial. Closures of pubs, eateries and cinemas in the UK came after people ignored pleas to stay at home and continued to congregate at their favourite haunts. As health experts stress the importance of social distancing to halt the spread of the virus, restrictions are being tightened globally to prevent people defiantly flocking to popular landmarks and gathering points. A spokesman for Jordan’s General Security Department vowed zero tolerance in enforcing the curfew which came into effect Saturday and urged people to stay at home and await specific times and procedures to buy basic necessities. In case of medical emergencies, Jordanian people are asked to call the civil defence authorities rather than head to a hospital. The armed forces have been deployed at entrances and exits of cities, public and private institutions have been shut down and all flights to and from Jordan have been halted. Jordan, which has reported 69 confirmed coronavirus cases, declared a state of emergency on Tuesday as part of a series of measures aimed at preventing further spread of the virus. In France, restrictions on leaving the house are about to get tougher as the country responds to residents’ continued outside movement. The Mediterranean city of Nice will lay down a complete ban on outside movement during night-time following similar moves by Vallauris and Menton. Movement restrictions have also been tightened in Paris, where there will be more checks at train stations and the banks of the Seine River will be put off limits.

Several NSW beaches will remain closed on Sunday after images of hundreds of people sunbaking at Bondi attracted world headlines and forced the temporary closure of the iconic beach. The closed beaches include those in Bondi, Tamarama, Maroubra and Coogee. Lake Macquarie City Council, south of Newcastle, has also announced the Sunday closure of its patrolled beaches. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt on Saturday hit out at beachgoers for ignoring new rules on social distancing measures aimed to stop the virus spreading. “If you are breaking these rules you are putting, not just yourself, but you are putting other Australians at risk,” he said. Lifesavers have been given unprecedented move-on powers amid the coronavirus pandemic. Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said further new measures may have to be invoked as it also emerged infected people were flouting quarantine rules. Dr Sutton said he had heard of people leaving home isolation during their 14-day quarantine, and from newly-confirmed cases that they’d had close contact with people while they’re unwell. “Everyone who has been told they’re in quarantine, must do so,” he said. “If the trajectory continues regardless of the new travel restrictions, we will have to consider new measures.” Dr Sutton wouldn’t speculate on what those restrictions might be, but said there are further steps available to authorities. “We want to be able to take them when we can change the trajectory rather than at a point where we’re in the midst of a crisis, like Italy or the US,” “If you care about the people around you, if you think about protecting your family, your parents, your grandparents … then you have to think about making that distance between you and other people in all settings at all times,” he said.

The scheme will including cash payments of up to $100,000 for small businesses, unsecured loans, wage subsidies and welfare payments for the unemployed. Prime Minister Scott Morrison will announce on Sunday the massive shot in the arm for the economy aimed at helping employers retain staff with an  injection of cash ten times the value of his original $17 billion stimulus package. It includes a second stimulus injection of $66 billion on top of the first round, plus the measures announced by the Reserve Bank this week, bringing the total package to $189 billion. The latest cash splash is likely to keep the budget in deficit for years to come but is necessary to protect the nation from being plunged into a prolonged recession. It will include a wage subsidy to save small business jobs, plus a guarantee on loans to small businesses intended to help them weather the storm of expected shutdowns. Some businesses will be eligible for a cash payment of up to $100,000. The Prime Minister is also foreshadowing a third phase to the stimulus package that will be announced over the next six months. He conceded, however, that not all small businesses will survive the coronavirus. “We want to help businesses keep going as best they can or to pause instead of falling apart,” he said. “We want to ensure that when this crisis has passed Australia can bounce back. “There is a lot of pain coming but we’re going to cushion the blow as best we can. “We’re already seeing the devastating economic impact coronavirus is having for Australia’s local businesses. Unfortunately, it is going to get worse before it gets better – but it will get better.” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Australia should be reassured the government was doing whatever it could to cushion the economic impact. “These are extraordinary times requiring extraordinary measures, but Australians can be reassured that their government is working day and night to protect their health, wellbeing and livelihoods,” he said. Yes the whole ‘flatten the curve’ approach, while better than ‘it’s just a flu’, still implies many die and the economy and many smaller businesses get buried too… …Remembering that small business employs 44% of Australia’s workforce should underline where we need to focus. — Simon Stahn (@SimonStahn) March 21, 2020 The tax-free cash payment of up to $100,000 will be worth 100 per cent of the tax those small businesses are withholding from their employee’s salary and wages. But to be eligible, employers must be running a small or medium business with a turnover under $50 million. It will also be available to eligible not-for-profit charities. That measure is worth $25.2 billion. “Australia’s small and medium businesses are the engine room of our economy. When they hurt, we all hurt,” the Prime Minister said. “The plan we’re rolling out is focused on building a bridge for as many of those businesses and their workers as we can to get them over this crisis. “That means supporting wages for small businesses so they don’t need to let go of their staff, and ensuring that during the crisis small businesses know we have their backs on their bank loans. “Many of our restaurants and bars, our hotels and tourism operators, our hairdressers and beauty salons and our events companies are already feeling the brunt of the economic impact of coronavirus. This is about finding a way for them and their workers to build a bridge to the other side of this crisis. “The next few months are going to be a difficult journey but we all have a role to play to adapt to the changes we’re facing, to cushion the impact of what is happening, and to pull together so we can bounce back when we get to the other side. “This is all about getting through the next six months or longer as the virus takes its course. Our support is all about building an economic bridge to get us to the other side so, together, we get through this.” The new package includes the first $17.6bn tranche of the stimulus package and the $105 billion worth of measures the Reserve Bank of Australia has announced to help banks give small business owners a six months pause on some loans. The stimulus is twice the size of the comparative stimulus packages in Canada and Hong Kong (both 4.5 per cent of GDP) and South Korea (4 per cent of GDP). The Morrison Government will also announce the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme will be able to be accessed by eligible banks and non-bank lenders The Commonwealth will guarantee 50 per cent through the participating banks of an eligible loan to small and medium enterprise customers that have been impacted by the coronavirus. The scheme will assist new or existing customers of banks and non-bank lenders. The maximum loan value will be $250,000 for a term up to three years but it will not apply to re-financing of existing customers."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus reading list: The books Aussie authors have by their beds Coronavirus reading list: The books Aussie authors have by their beds","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/books\/2020\/03\/21\/coronavirus-reading-list-australia\/","transcript":"Benjamin Law should be on top of the world.

It takes me somewhere else, which is very necessary when you’re in self-isolation, social distancing, or for the poor people in actual quarantine.” As such, he took to Instagram to share his stack of must-reads in a time of crisis and encourage fellow Australians to buy locally, with many Aussie indie stores delivering to their patch for free or slipping puchases intoi the mail, including Readings in Melbourne, the Avid Reader in Brisbane and the Bookshop Darlinghurst in Sydney.  So as we all necessarily practise social distancing and remember to wash our hands for 20 seconds and sneeze\/cough into tissues, armpits, elbows BUT NOT IN HANDS BECAUSE WE’RE NOT ANIMALS, what’s on your #CoronavirusReadingStack? • Here’s mine. Use the hashtag so we can all look at yours like perverts. • P.S. Support your local independent booksellers who will be happy to pop your purchases in the post.

He noted that everyone from authors to publishers to retailers are impacted by the, “hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars that have been wiped out from the writers’ festivals industry”. “It’s devastating.” “I’m reading Shuggie Bain by Scottish writer and debut novelist Douglas Stuart. He published a short story Found Wanting in The New Yorker that completely knocked the wind out of me. I’m about a quarter of the way through the novel and it’s just brilliant.” Noting he’s always behind on reading prize-winning books, next up is Booker Prize co-winner Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other. “I have not encountered a single person who read that book who hasn’t loved it.” He’s also eyeing Garth Greenwell’s Cleanness as well as a couple of Aussie picks in good friend Heather Rose’s Bruny and Vivian Pham’s The Coconut Children. “I’m on the board of Story Factory, which is a creative writing and literacy not-for-profit in Parramatta, and Vivian was one of our one of our students who signed up for the novella-writing workshop,” Law said. “By the time she finished, she’d started a bidding war and now has a book out, which I can’t wait to read, and she’s only 19.” Inspired by Law’s stack, we asked a hypothetical library-full of prominent Australian authors what books they’d add to his pile. Here are their answers. First up, my new favourite writer Joan Silber’s novel Improvement, a thrilling discovery. Then I’m into Tara June Winch’s The Yield, which I’ve been dying to get to for some time. Right now it’s Eat Like The Animals, a mind-blowing look at the ground-breaking research of two Charles Perkins Centre biologists, Stephen Simpson and David Raubenheimer, on what animals can teach us about human diet and health. It’s made me love scientists even more than I thought possible. And I’m thinking Sebastian Smee’s Quarterly Essay, Net Loss: The Inner Life in the Digital Age could be a soul-saver right now. For readers looking to lose themselves entirely in another world for a very long time, they might want to consider The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil, over 1000 pages in several paperback volumes. Set in the twilight of what was once the capital of a great empire, the Vienna of 1913, this is a broad sweeping saga, a vast canvass that depicts a whole society in decline but also reveals the intimate thoughts and philosophical musings of its many and varied characters… Musil spent over twenty years writing the book. It ruined him financially and then pretty much killed him just a few years after he and his Jewish wife fled the Nazis for Switzerland. But what he’s left for us is a feast that will never stop nourishing. The launch party of my new book, The Long Shadow, has been delayed, but this shutdown is toughest for debutante authors. It’s hard to promote a book in the best of times. I love to read books with a crime bent, because fictional impending doom puts your own into perspective after all. I would recommend Sheerwater by Leah Swann, who I was going to interview at the cancelled Clunes Booktown Festival, Serpent’s Skin by Erina Reddan and The Truants by Kate Weinberg, because this one-liner captured me: The Secret History meets Agatha Christie. I live in a state of social isolation, so my reading habits haven’t changed. I started the lockdown reading Tasmanian Robbie Arnott’s new novel The Rain Heron. If, as a basic grading system, there’s books you didn’t mind, books you positively enjoyed, and books you just want to sing from the goddamn rooftops about, this one falls into the latter category. Some of the images in it will stay with me for years. And it’s topical: it’s a book about an emptied land, about the terrible things we do to the natural world and to each other, and about our better angels occasionally rising out of the muck. There’s really only one book for this white-noise blur of a time: Severance by Ling Ma. Ma’s writing is the understated kind of poetic that I love best – muscular, modern, observant and, often, just that little bit too close to home. Set in New York during a global pandemic it’s a sharp commentary on the dull repetition of modern city life, loneliness and capitalism, all laced with a little horror. The book is a warning, a worry and a hope. With everything going on I’ll also be picking up Paul Collis’s Dancing Home. His writing has a unique grit and gold, while being somehow brutal and gentle all at the same time. I’ve also been thinking about Steinbeck lately—about the dusty hope and loss extreme times bring. I was late to Grapes of Wrath, but it changed me deeply as a human, for the better. In times of trouble and uncertainty, I always take refuge in a book. There is no greater comfort than curling up with a cup of tea and a story that will sweep me away. And we have so many wonderful writers in this country, retreating from the world gives me a chance to catch up on their work. Books on my reading pile this month include The Love That I Have by James Moloney, The Paris Secret by Natasha Lester, A Universe of Sufficient Size by Miriam Sved, The Daughter of Victory Lights by Kerri Turner, and The River Home by Hannah Richell. I’m also reading my way through the entire list of Golden Age murder mysteries by British author Dorothy L. Sayers. Set in 1930s England, they feature the clever aristocrat-turned-amateur-sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. Perfect comfort reading. I did my panic-buying at the New International Bookshop under Trades Hall in Carlton and treated it like a holiday reading stack. You want a mix of daring and comfort. I bought Look Who’s Morphing by Tom Cho, which is a classic pop queer Australian short story collection; a story collection by Elizabeth Taylor who writes very sharp novels; Stamboul Train by Graham Greene who is always fun, Stone Arabia by Dana Spiotta because so many writers I like really admire her; and On the Move by Oliver Sacks, the memoir that is famous for the hot photo on the cover but is probably really great writing too. I wish I had more nonfiction, but that’s wartime for ya. These five books were about $15. The hometown launch of my novel Sweetness and Light coincided with a national shutdown of events. So, with a cancelled tour and some time to kill, it’s a chance to build a fort out the roughly 12,000 unsold books I suddenly have on my hands. Which, heck, if people keep stabbing each other for toilet paper in the supermarket carpark, might be the best investment I ever made. Otherwise, a re-read of Gabriel García Márquez’ Love in the Time of Cholera, a lovely, escapist fantasy about an era of quarantine, and a title which makes me feel for all the poor young lovers on Tinder who are going to have to actually talk for a few weeks before meeting.  I’m part-way through Ashley Kalagian Blunt’s How to be Australian and loving it. I’m always searching for books that put me in mind of Bill Bryson and this one’s just like that. I heard Kirsten Alexander talk about Half Moon Lake at an event and she blew me away. I’ve thought it about for months and finally got a copy last week. Her new book, Riptides, is also out, so I can read that next. I like reading people’s work in order. This will sound super specific, but I get excited about historical books that feature an unwanted pregnancy. It’s women’s stories, but also they’re often about empowerment, just a different form to what we normally think of, so I’m looking forward to Christine Bell’s No Small Shame."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Your coronavirus questions answered: How long will this all last","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/21\/coronavirus-questions-lifespan\/","transcript":"At the start of the week we asked you to send us your coronavirus questions. And you responded, en masse. On Thursday, we looked at travel and socialising, Friday we covered how the virus works and on Saturday we explored how to do social distancing properly. Now we’re answering everything you wanted to know about how long this whole thing will last. This is a rapidly changing situation and answers are current as of time of publishing. Monash University Professor of Medicine Paul Komesaroff, who directs the Centre for Ethics in Medicine and Society, is answering your questions. Over to him. When we get the virus, for how long are we ill? How long should we remain isolated afterward to ensure the safety of others? For a large majority of affected individuals the illness is a minor one and recovery occurs in a couple of weeks. If you test positive and have no or only mild symptoms then you remain infective for some days. At present we ask people to assume that they are infective for seven days after becoming unwell, including at least two days without a fever, or after having two negative tests 24 hours apart. If you are more seriously ill your doctor will advise you how long to assume you are infectious. The Australian Government publishes detailed information about COVID-19, including advice about what steps people who do become infected should take (see here). As the virus is susceptible to heat will heavy, sweaty exercise daily help avoid it getting hold in the body? No. When will it be controlled? Running low on necessary items as people go into panic. Will it get worse? It is likely to get worse. In Australia we expect the epidemic to peak in about June, following which the number of new cases should fall. It is quite likely that at least some of the recommended restrictions will remain for a few months after that. As government and health officials have emphasised, hoarding necessary items is harmful to everyone. What is needed is for members of the community to work together to support each other – including especially elderly, disabled and other vulnerable people. How can you protect a new born baby from COVID-19? Children and young people seem to be affected much less than older people but are not immune. Babies are most likely to be infected by their parents or carers, so the way to protect them is for these people to avoid infection by taking the usual precautions. Why are we so concerned? Most people have mild symptoms. The yearly flu kills thousands and this has no effect on travel or large groups of people. Why is COVID–19 causing such a panic? SARS-CoV2 is as infectious as the flu but ten times as dangerous. It has already killed more than 10,000 people and in many countries the epidemic is only just getting underway. It is an extremely serious health emergency but if we work together we should be able to limit its harmful consequences so that the most vulnerable members of our society can stay safe. If we have reached the point where the virus is transmitting from person to person here in Australia, why does the government still refuse to test everyone who has flu-like symptoms? Not only are the tests expensive and in short supply but testing everyone has limited benefit. The main purpose of testing is to identify people who need to continue safe contact with others (for example, health professionals) or else to be able to trace contacts to reduce spread to others. Outside these circumstances, a negative test is of limited use (because the person could still become infected at a later time) and a positive test gives little guidance regarding treatment. Some people are saying that if you catch the coronavirus before it reaches the lungs, it remains in the throat for four days. At this time a person begins to cough and have throat pains. If at this stage the person drink a lot of warm water and does gargles with salt or vinegar, it eliminates the virus. Is that true? There is no evidence that this is true. Do we have enough medical supplies if it gets bad? There is no current drug treatment for COVID-19 so if someone gets very sick our main approach is to support them with whatever methods they need, including, in very serious cases, with mechanical assistance with breathing in a hospital. Obviously, the availability of ventilation machines is very limited so if the numbers of very sick patients increase rapidly we will not be able to treat everyone. We have not yet reached this point in Australia. Why did it spread so quickly in Italy? There are many theories about this but it seems likely that specific features in Italy that increased the vulnerability of its population included its ageing population, high smoking rates and close habitual physical contact, in greetings etc. Population movement patterns and a delayed early response led to the medical system being overwhelmed, as a result of which death rates rapidly increased. We put used tissues in the compost bin. Is this a safe practice? It is probably safe in all cases. However, where there is a proven case health authorities recommend that such waste be secured in plastic bags and disposed of in household rubbish in order to reduce environmental contamination. Some people say COVID-19 can affect pets, can you please confirm? It is theoretically possible but so far there is no evidence of pet animals contracting the disease or humans being infected from their pets. This is, therefore, not something you have to worry about. What is the reason behind not being able to ‘touch your own face?’ Is the virus already on our own body surfaces? The virus is spread via droplets into people’s noses and mouths so if you pick up the virus on your hand and transfer it to your face you risk becoming infected. In normal circumstances the virus is not present on body surfaces or in the general environment. What about countries suspected of under reporting? Testing is quite expensive and many countries, especially less developed ones, do not have the capacity to test large numbers of people. This means that in these countries it is difficult to know how many people are infected or to trace the contacts of those who are. As the disease continues to spread this may become a major issue, both for those countries and for people considering traveling to them. How did it start and what caused it? It is thought that the SARS-CoV2 virus is a mutated version of an animal virus that turned out to be highly infective to humans. The first cases were recorded in Wuhan in China but at present this is all we know about where, when or how it first came into existence. Why can’t we close our schools, airport and shopping centres for a month to limit the spread? It’s a very serious case. It is likely that the lock-down will extend, but we still need people to produce and distribute food and other commodities, and to provide services, care, and support of all kinds to the whole society. Shutting everything down for a month will not make the epidemic go away but only delay its spread somewhat. If we can achieve a delay sufficient to allow us to treat serious cases by less drastic measures that will be better. If this is not possible a full shutdown may be inevitable."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus outbreak: Let’s spare a thought for the permanently lonely | The New Daily Coronavirus outbreak: Let’s spare a thought for the permanently lonely","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/21\/coronavirus-lonely-red-cross\/","transcript":"I am two days into solo self-isolation, and I am going out of my tiny little brain. I discovered last year I am an extrovert. My best friend – a psychologist – snorted when I told her I’d only just worked this out. I thrive on having a calendar chock full of social engagements where I can swill wine with my friends, throw my arms around them and speak utter dross for hours on end. I always, always feel connected. The pub is my spiritual home. So solo isolation is not working out well. I’m cooking meals for myself and I’ve discovered it’s hair-tearingly boring. Cooking is only fun when it’s shared: if you cook a good meal and another soul doesn’t get to appreciate it, did it actually happen? I guess that’s the question Instagram has been answering since it began. Even though it hasn’t been long since I started flying solo I’ve been oddly emotional. Obviously the constant stream of doomsday news isn’t helping. The internet – that singular tool for telling ourselves we’re connected – is only serving to add to the turmoil. Waves of sadness and emptiness and disconnection roll and crash throughout the interminably long days. But I pull myself out by reminding myself that this is (hopefully) temporary, and maybe this spell will be good for me. I might finally do some of the chores that have been on my to-do list for the past decade. Like get on that ancestry website and see if I have some wildly fascinating heritage. Or go online and do that thing where you try and find your missing superannuation. The only time I’m really allowing myself out of the house is taking walks around the park. Yesterday I saw a man in his 80s doing a slow shuffling jog and I instantly burst into tears. Standing next to the empty football fields I was overcome by the realisation that this sense of loneliness I’ve felt for all of five minutes is something so many in our ageing community experience on a daily basis. And it’s not just the elderly. There are young widows and bullied teens and people with crippling anxiety and folks working remotely who battle loneliness on a daily basis. Hell, you don’t have to be part of a certain subgroup. There was this guy who lived by himself in the building where I used to live in Sydney. Coming and going, he was always there, determined to grab me for a chat. And, of course, I’d avoid him – duck out a different way, keep my head down, sneak away – because I thought he was odd (and I was usually rushing off to hang with my gang). But now I think about how obviously lonely he was, how little he was asking for, and I feel absolutely gutted. Social isolation and loneliness are a huge problem in Australia. The impact it has on both mental and physical health is well documented. In fact, it’s been identified as a “significant public health and wellbeing” issue. Me @ the Group FaceTime party during quarantine  pic.twitter.com\/g8v2j47qEK — Z THE DOM⚡️ (@zharayasime) March 14, 2020 So a silver lining? Thankfully, in this unusual time, people are stepping up their game to check on one another. Group Skype calls are being organised. My mate organised a virtual disco where people could dance “together” in their loungerooms. People are baking banana muffins to drop on neighbour’s doorsteps (in this oddly resourceful time people are finally using those brown bananas in the back of the freezer … aren’t *they* having a moment?) lots of grim stuff out there but there's never been a better time to be a black banana in a freezer. black bananas in freezers are actually going to get USED in BAKING this month instead of thrown out in a year and it's their TIME to SHINE — Caitlin Welsh (@Caitlin_Welsh) March 17, 2020 All this is a beautiful thing. How heartening that when there’s a crisis, we step up. But what about when social isolation is no longer a hot topic? What about the people for whom loneliness is their everyday reality? My fear is we’ll just go back to business as usual. That period where we nearly gave ourselves an aneurism stifling a sneeze on a packed train and genuinely washed our hands (instead of just turning on the tap so people didn’t think we’re gross) will just become the stuff of nostalgic anecdotes. So I am making this deal with whichever deity is currently drunk at the wheel: on the other side of this whole thing, when physical distancing is a lonely memory, I’ll do regular volunteer work with The Red Cross companionship and social support program. “What’s that?” Glad you asked. Basically they pair you with someone in the community who is lonely and socially isolated. You visit for a cup of tea, go on an outing, chat on the phone, or go for a walk. It’s for older people who have few social connections, people with a disability, or people recovering from mental illness. I mean, look at the photo they use to illustrate the program. The stuffed toys in the cabinet. The joy on the face of the lady with the nice beaded necklace. Stick a fork in me, I’m done. I am not announcing this to make myself look like a top sort. I’m writing it here because it’s the kind of promise I’ll make in my head, and when the pub is open again I’ll dance off gaily into the sunshine and forget the deal I made. Writing it in public makes me accountable. I’ve had but the tiniest taste of loneliness, and the impact leaves me breathless. How lucky that when we come out the other side, most of us will have people to reconnect with. Not everybody is that lucky. And now, more than ever, that breaks my heart."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus cruise ship MS Costa Luminosa stuck at sea with Australians","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/21\/coronavirus-ms-costa-luminosa\/","transcript":"There are 36 cruise ships around the world with Australians on board – some with cases of COVID-19 – struggling to find a port that will let them disembark. Some of them have already turned into Petri dishes, and are struggling to contain the viruses spread on board. Victorian man Colin told The New Daily his 82-year-old mother is one of 39 Australians on board the MS Costa Luminosa cruise liner, which is desperately searching for a port to offload passengers. The ships logs, which were obtained by the Miami Herald show 24 crew members and 50 passengers are now either sick or sharing a cabin with someone else who is unwell. Colin, who only wanted his first name known, spoke to his mum on Friday morning and said she was distressed. “I can only speak to her for a few minutes, she was sounding out of it and distressed, and I didn’t want to prolong that,” he told The New Daily. “She’s been seasick for three weeks without any attention on board and has been confined to her cabin since Sunday. “My understanding is, in Marseille, they were told they would disembark, which was the last scheduled port of call. “The Americans and Canadians were disembarked, but Australians and other nationalities were not allowed.” Because of an agreement between the French and US governments, 200 Americans were allowed to disembark in the country, which closed its borders last week. They all got on a flight home. The Australians were not so lucky and are now en route to Italy, the only country that seems set to accept the Italian-flagged vessel. The cruise company has been slow to contain the spread on board. It was three days after the first case was recorded that the staff started wearing gloves – and put napkins over their mouths when delivering meals. A week passed before people were isolated in their rooms and they started regularly taking everyone’s temperature. The liner is owned by Carnival Cruises, the same company that had high-profile outbreaks on both the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess. Colin has called both the Australian embassy and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) but says he was given no information about how his mother will get home safely. “What is the point of having DFAT if they don’t come to the assistance of Australians when they’ve paid taxes all their lives,” he asked. “I don’t want to be critical (of DFAT). It’s easy to be critical, and there is a lot they’re needing to deal with – everyone’s hotlines and emergency lines are clogged up right now. “It’s not easy. But one would hope a coordinated approach would get a lot of people around the world home where they need to be.” There are rumours on the ship that the cruise company, which had not responded to The New Daily at time of publishing, is believed to be organising travel out of Italy, but no one is certain. Cruise liners with no cases have also been caught up in the chaotic scene on the high seas, as countries rapidly shut their borders and leave hopeful passengers bouncing from one port to the next. New South Wales woman Bec Smith is calling on the Australian government to bring everyone stuck on cruises home, after her mother, aunt, uncle and a close family friend have been stuck  aboard the MS Norwegian Jewel. There are 280 Australians on the liner, which has bounced from Tahiti, to New Zealand, to Fiji, and are now sits off the coast of Honolulu. The cruise was meant to end a week ago, and while the passengers are allowed to roam around the ship freely, there are restrictions on phone calls and internet use. “It’s costing them $120 to get 100 minutes of WiFi,” Ms Smith said. “When she rung us she had been in a line for four hours. You have to line up and use the phones, so everyone on the boat is trying to ring home or ring to get flights. “They’re not giving them much communication on board. Until that call I hadn’t spoken to her in six days.” Each time they’ve gone to a new port, they’ve expected to get off the ship, and have been forced by the cruise company to buy flights home – Ms Smith and her family have forked out over $6000 already on unused return airfares. “It would be over $6000 in flights. You have to give the captain all your flight details, so they could disembark,” she said. Ms Smith rang DFAT to see if they could provide her with any information or assistance, but says she got a lacklustre response. “It sounded like they were reading off a script. They couldn’t tell me any information on how these Australians will get home,” she said. Many passengers on board and concerned about having to disembark in a country that closes it borders and getting stuck there, she said. “I know policies are changing hourly because of the situation, but apparently there are people on the ship who are older and unwell. “They’re all worried about how they’ll get home.” In response to The New Daily‘s questions, DFAT said it was working with both companies to get all Australians home. “The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work closely with the cruise industry and cruise lines to provide advice to Australian passengers on cruise ships with itineraries impacted by COVID-19,” it said. “The Department, through our diplomatic missions in Washington and Australian Consulate-General in Honolulu, is working closely with local authorities to ensure Australians can return home.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Tributes for country music legend Kenny Rogers, 81 | The New Daily Music world mourns Kenny Rogers, dead at 81","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/03\/21\/country-music-legend-kenny-rogers-dies-at-81\/","transcript":"Country legend Dolly Parton said her heart was broken as she paid tribute to Kenny Rogers who died has aged 81. Rogers dominated the pop and country charts in the 1970s and 1980s with a string of sleekly tailored hits. The three-time Grammy winner “passed away peacefully at home from natural causes under hospice care and surrounded by his family,” a family representative said in a statement. Due to the national COVID-19 emergency, the family is planning a small private service  with a public memorial planned for a later date. In a tearful tribute on Twitter, Rogers’ duet partner clutched a photo of the pair and said she had loved Kenny with all her heart. “We all know that Kenny is in a better place than we are today, but I’m sure he’s going to be talking to God sometime today,” said 74-year-old Parton. “He’s going to be asking Him to spread some light on the darkness that’s going on here. I loved Kenny with all my heart. My heart is broken, a big old chunk of it has gone with him today.”  You never know how much you love somebody until they’re gone.

Thank you for your friendship and your love. We are going to miss you but we are so happy you’re singing with the Angels in heaven. Can’t wait to see you again one of these days. Rest in peace my friend.”  Kenny Rogers’ appealing, sometimes gritty voice propelled 20 solo 45s to No. 1 on the country charts from 1977-87. Two of them, his 1980 reading of Lionel Richie’s “Lady” and his 1983 collaboration with Dolly Parton “Islands in the Stream” (penned by the Bee Gees), also topped the pop lists. He worked profitably with a number of other female vocalists, including Dottie West, Sheena Easton, Kim Carnes and Anne Murray. Rogers parlayed his music success into a successful side career as an actor. His 1978 country chart-topper “The Gambler” spawned five popular TV movies, while some of his other hits also inspired small-screen features.  Rogers was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2013 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Country Music Assn. the same year. Born and raised in Houston, he was the fourth of eight children in a poor family. He took to the guitar as an adolescent, and would sometimes perform with another aspiring local musician and future star, Mickey Gilley. His early professional career was stylistically eclectic. While in high school, he formed a rockabilly group, the Scholars, who recorded for Carlton Records, a local label. After a brief stint at the University of Houston, he played bass with the jazz groups of Bobby Doyle and Kirby Stone. After moving to Los Angeles in 1966, he joined the folk-pop unit the New Christy Minstrels, a group that also numbered such performers as Carnes, the Byrds’ Gene Clark, “Eve of Destruction” vocalist Barry McGuire and the Lovin’ Spoonful’s Jerry Yester among its members at one time or another. He notched five more No. 1 solo country singles by the end of the 1970s. The biggest of these were the Grammy-winning “The Gambler” (also No. 16 pop in 1978) and Rogers’ biggest hit, the backwoods narrative “Coward of the County” (also No. 3 pop in 1979). They pushed the albums “The Gambler” and “Kenny” to No. 12 and No. 5, respectively, on the pop album charts. Each inspired a popular TV movie; Rogers would portray Brady Hawkes, protagonist of “The Gambler,” in a series of telepics that ran through 1994. On the heels of a No. 1 greatest hits set in 1980, Rogers’ hits of the decade for Liberty and RCA found him moving increasingly into pop terrain and focusing on romantic balladry. “Lady” and “Islands in the Stream” (the latter one of many duets with frequent partner Parton) solidified his standing as country’s biggest crossover attraction; his rendering of Bob Seger’s “We’ve Got Tonight” with Sheena Easton ruled the country chart and rose to No. 6 on the pop chart. In all, he recorded 23 top-10 country hits during the decade, five of which crossed to the pop side. He issued a memoir, “Luck or Something Like It,” in 2012, and a novel, “What Are the Chances,” in 2013. That same year, he was the recipient of the CMA Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award. He received a similar honour from CMT with its Artist of a Lifetime Award in 2015.  Always active on the road, Rogers announced his retirement in September 2015, not long after a widely aired commercial for an insurance company saw him reprising “The Gambler” for comedic effect. Married five times, Rogers is survived by his last wife Wanda and five children. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Young Aussies are not understanding coronavirus risk","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/21\/young-aussies-not-understanding-coronavirus-risk\/","transcript":"Young Australians are failing to grasp the importance of isolating and experts warn it could result in deaths. Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton says the message around the importance of isolation and quarantining isn’t penetrating, and young people in particular aren’t understanding what coronavirus means for the entire population. While younger people don’t get such severe infections there have been cases of people in their 20s dying, and cases of those in their 30s and 40s ending up in intensive care. The warning comes as Sydney’s Bondi Beach is closed over concerns beachgoers have not been adhering to social distancing rules. Similarly, the UN’s health chief is warning young people they are “not invincible” and disregard for best practice is not only putting themselves at risk but posing a threat to there communities at large. Young people also risk passing on the infection to those in vulnerable categories, including older Australians or people with compromised immune systems. “If you care about the people around you, if you think about protecting your family, your parents, your grandparents … then you have to think about making that distance between you and other people in all settings at all times,” he said. There are also concerns about people of all ages not taking quarantine seriously enough. Dr Sutton said he had heard of people leaving home isolation during their 14 day quarantine, and from newly-confirmed cases that they’d had close contact with people while they’re unwell. “Everyone who has been told they’re in quarantine, must do so,” he said. “If the trajectory continues regardless of the new travel restrictions, we will have to consider new measures.” Dr Sutton wouldn’t speculate on what those restrictions might be, but said there are further steps available to authorities. “We want to be able to take them when we can change the trajectory rather than at a point where we’re in the midst of a crisis, like Italy or the US,” he said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Victoria announces $1.7bn package to help businesses survive coronavirus","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/21\/victoria-1-7-billion-package-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Victorian government will refund and waive payroll tax payments refunded for the rest of this financial year to help businesses survive coronavirus under a $1.7 billion support package. Businesses with payrolls up to $3 million can expect the refunds within days, Premier Daniel Andrews announced on Saturday. “This has never happened before; it is unprecedented, it is unique, it is exactly what Victorian businesses have asked for,” he said. Payroll tax for the first quarter of the next financial year will also be deferred as part of a support package for businesses. About 24,000 businesses are included in the package. The package also includes a $500 million fund to support industries hardest hit by the virus and self-isolation.

He said another $600 million will be spent on a range of measures including waiving liquor licence payments – worth $30 million – due at the end of this month. “That is $30 million well spent to send confidence and cash in effect back to those businesses,” Mr Andrews said. It will also be spent re-employing people who have lost their jobs into virus-related work, including delivering packages, cleaning trains and trams. “It just makes common sense to re-employ people who find themselves out of work in order to give them the prospects that they need, the support they need and for us to get the tasks that are so important done,” he said. Further support for households hasn’t been ruled out, Mr Andrews said. The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Paul Guerra said the “cash in the pocket, straight away” approach to the small business payroll tax refund was the right thing to do. “It’s exactly what business needed: some certainty to enable them to get through the next period. We hope business then applies this back to their employees, to give them some certainty as well.” Meanwhile Victorian public school holidays will be extended by two days to allow teachers to make plans for flexible learning arrangements, including remote learning. The days off will bookend holidays, with the final day of term one now Thursday March 26. Students will come back for term two from Wednesday April 15. Mr Andrews said Victorian schools would remain open until expert advice said otherwise. “My kids are at school, the chief health officer’s kids are at school,” he said. “That’s the medical advice, that’s the advice of experts. That could change – if it does, you will be the first to know.” He also called on people to continue to follow other health advice including washing hands, isolating if they exhibit symptoms and social distancing. While frustrating, those measures would save lives, he said. “There is no joking about this. If we don’t flatten the curve and suppress the number of people testing positive and the spread of the virus, hospitals will be overwhelmed and that means people will die,” he said. The number of confirmed case in Victoria increased by 51 overnight to 229. They include a police officer in Suburban Melbourne and a second Melbourne University staff member who returned from overseas before the government’s mandatory quarantine period for travellers.

More than 370 legal experts have signed a letter coordinated by the Australian National University and the University of Technology Sydney, calling on the government to make urgent reforms to protect the prison population from the global health pandemic. “Australian prisons and detention centres will become epicentres for the transmission of COVID-19 if governments don’t act now,” leader of the ANU criminology program Professor Lorana Bartels said in a statement. The experts are urging the early release of vulnerable prisoners and detainees who are at high risk of harm from COVID-19, such as those with pre-existing conditions, the elderly and the young. The group also believes those detained for offences such as unlawful driving, property crimes and those who are likely to be released in the next six months should also be freed. In jurisdictions such as Ireland, the United States, Iran and the United Kingdom authorities have either released prisoners or raised it as a possibility in response to the pandemic.

She said Australian governments must provide a coherent approach to protect prison populations. “It is only a matter of time before COVID-19 breaks out in prisons and youth detentions centres. This will then have a substantial flow-on effect to the community,” she said. Professor Bartels said most people who enter prison are un-sentenced and nearly a third are expected to serve less than 12 months. “Tens of thousands of people are likely to be released into the community by the end of the year, making them potential carriers of the coronavirus back into communities,” she said. Justice Action coordinator Brett Collins told AAP earlier this week riots seen in Italy’s prisons would be replicated in Australia if authorities couldn’t prevent COVID-19 outbreaks.

The messages, forwarded or copy-pasted on the Facebook-owned WhatsApp platform or in text messages, claim to be health advice from the Stanford Hospital Board or from an anonymous doctor who has a cure for COVID-19, if only anyone would listen. As we retreat into our homes, these family text groups have become a lifeline and a hotbed for pseudoscience that risks undermining the efforts of government and public health officials. And because these groups are typically encrypted, we know very little about what’s going on inside. Doug MacFarlane has been doing battle in his family WhatsApp group. A relative recently shared a video in which a man suggested blowing a hair dryer up your nose could kill any virus, including the one that causes the common cold. (Not true, and not advisable.) “It sounds crazy when I’m explaining it to you, but you watch the video and he’s got this over simplistic diagram,” Mr MacFarlane said. “There’s a bunch of different things going on in the video to make it compelling.” Mr MacFarlane, who researches the psychology of health misinformation at the University of Western Australia, did some digging on the video and its creator, and was able to explain to his family how it manipulated their attention with scientific jargon and exaggeration. But as the pandemic continues and fears grow, his debunking work is far from done. Much like the chain emails of past decades, coronavirus “cures” like gargling vinegar, drinking warm water or eating bananas are constantly rewritten and reconstituted, aided by technology platforms that make sharing just a quick tap. Ben Bravery, a junior doctor at a hospital in Sydney, has also been on the offensive in his family group chats. He’s seen graphics with “oversimplified” symptom descriptions of the disease, comparing it to the common cold or flu. They have been shared multiple times in his WhatsApp groups, despite his attempts to warn people. “There is a lot of this content, and people aren’t actually evaluating it, and even when someone that they do trust points out that it’s wrong, it’s still not registering that it’s wrong,” he said. Dr Bravery is worried that this bad advice could be a distraction: People may not take the right steps to protect themselves. Or if relatives don’t have all the symptoms on the viral graphic, they won’t get tested. “I think they are frightened, and they want to help,” he said of the groups’ members. “I think the love and care they have for other people means they want to share something that might work.” Many of these fake COVID-19 protections are also so-called “natural remedies”, like drinking warm water or vinegar. In general, we associate things in the natural world with harmlessness, Mr MacFarlane said, even though that’s not always the case. If the solution sounds plausible, could help protect the family, and it’s “organic”, that makes it even easier to share on the group chat, because we may rationalise, what damage could it do? Yet during a pandemic, when health officials fight with social media for our attention, no information is benign. While the people who create bad health advice may be after money and clicks, when it’s shared by family and friends, the motivations are more complex. This is a stressful time, and a lot of us are focused on how to protect ourselves and our family. That makes sense, but it also makes us vulnerable to cons due to what Mr MacFarlane calls “visceral influence”, when strong emotional or psychological responses guide our actions. It effectively narrows our attention and could make us more impulsive. “Which is fine when it’s something that you need like food or water, but you become very vulnerable to people who are willing to provide reassurance,” he said. It’s a classic way almost anyone can get scammed. If you know what someone wants — wealth, beauty, a cure — and offer to give it to them, they may not think laterally about whether the advice is good or bad. This becomes especially acute when the messaging from government or public health authorities is missing, isn’t transparent and clear, or isn’t cutting through. Because the virus is new and evolving, there is also confusion among health professionals about the COVID-19 outbreak, Dr Bravery said, so it’s hardly surprising those outside the medical profession would also be unsure what do. “We’re really trying to teach people a whole bunch of epidemiology very quickly,” he said — a complex topic that not even all health professionals are across. “And in that vacuum, this stuff is just going to go nuts.” Unlike the Facebook newsfeed or Twitter, private groups and chats on WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or other platforms are closed spaces, difficult for outsiders to scrutinise. Such platforms are a vital tool of connection, according to Dr Ariadna Matamoros-Fernández, who researches WhatsApp and misinformation at the Queensland University of Technology. But she is concerned that fake audio that purports to be from doctors or officials about the coronavirus is also being forwarded and shared in these groups, which is particularly difficult for people to verify. “There is more misinformation because we can’t moderate content,” she said. “It’s a really human problem.” WhatsApp has made some changes to prevent the spread of viral information in recent years, such as limiting the number of times a message can be forwarded to five chats at once, and adding a ‘forwarded’ and ‘highly forwarded’ label. The company has also partnered with the World Health Organization, UNICEF and other organisations to launch a WhatsApp Coronavirus Information Hub. “We encourage all users to check the facts online before sharing messages that have been forwarded to them, and we encourage users to engage directly with trusted and official sources for important information,” said Antonia Sanda, Facebook Australia’s head of communications. Mr MacFarlane believes informed voices within these closed communities also make a difference, especially if they know how to spot scammers and can use science-based debunking techniques. For now, he has offered to scrutinise health information and remedies for his family members on WhatsApp. “Together, we can fact check this thing,” he said. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"New South Wales brothers charged over right-wing terror plot","date":"03-21-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/03\/21\/nsw-brothers-charged-over-right-wing-terror-plot\/","transcript":"A South Coast man has been charged with terrorism offences a week after his brother was arrested over the alleged right-wing plot.

It has now recorded more than 4,000 deaths — surpassing China — and 47,000 infections. The jump in the toll is by far the world’s largest daily rise in absolute terms since the contagion emerged a month ago. The latest crackdown effectively bans jogging and bicycle rides, the only types of outdoor exercise that were allowed. “We already have many hundreds of dead. What more is needed before people understand the tragedy we are facing?” said Sergio Venturi, head of the coronavirus response team in Emilia-Romagna. Italy overtook China on Thursday as the country to register the most deaths from the respiratory disease. “Maybe the peak won’t come next week, but the week after,” the agency’s chief, Angelo Borrelli, told Rai radio. The mayor of the most badly affected city, Bergamo in the affluent northern region of Lombardy, said the true number of fatalities from the pandemic in his area was four times higher than official reports were indicating. “Many of the elderly are dying in their houses or in old people’s homes, without anyone testing them either before or after they die,” Giorgio Gori told the Huffington Post. He added that a dozen mayors of other cities had confirmed the same thing to him. The government has now agreed that the military can be used to help enforce the lockdown, the president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, told a news conference on Friday. Responding to requests by the governors of the worst-hit regions, the national government in Rome said that from Saturday all parks would be closed and people could only take exercise around their homes. “We have to do even more to contain the infections. Correct behaviour from everyone is essential to win this battle,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza said. Authorities have become frustrated in recent days to see people still out and about despite their appeals to stay indoors for all but absolutely essential needs. Lombardy, at the epicentre of the epidemic, said that about 100 soldiers would soon be deployed to help local police enforce the lockdown, and called on the national government to impose new measures to make sure Italians stay at home. Officials are especially worried by the situation in Milan, Lombardy’s capital and Italy’s second city. The country’s largest cities had so far been relatively lightly hit by the outbreak, but there are now 3,804 people infected in Milan, its financial hub, and the surrounding hinterland. The number of new cases in and around Milan rose by 526, or 16 per cent, the largest daily increase for any region within Lombardy.

Spain’s worst single-day death toll yet brought the country’s total fatalities above 1000 on Friday (local time). Spain has swiftly followed Italy to become the second European country where hundreds of people are being killed by the coronavirus daily. The death toll shows little sign of slowing. Some 5500 hospital beds, including intensive care units, will be set up inside the 240,000 square metre IFEMA conference centre on the capital’s outskirts to cope with surging demand expected in the coming days, the Madrid region said in a tweet. “The most difficult days are coming now,” health emergencies chief Fernando Simon told a news conference.

UN secretary general Antonio Guterres issued the warning as major financial cities such as New York went into lockdown, international borders closed and the UK ordered the closure of cafes, pubs and restaurants. On Saturday morning (Australian time), British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would cover workers’ wages for the first time in history to alleviate the financial consequences of the drastic shutdown. After initially being criticised for reacting too slowly to the virus outbreak, Mr Johnson told cafes, pubs, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and gyms to close indefinitely to help slow the spread. “We are telling cafes, bars and restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can and not to open tomorrow,” said Mr Johnson. “Though to be clear, they can continue to provide take-out services. “Some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight, and I say to those people, please don’t. “We’re also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale. “The sad thing is today, for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart.” Mr Johnson said it was difficult forcing people to discontinue the great British tradition of going to the pub but it was necessary. “I do accept that what we’re doing is extraordinary: we’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub, and I can understand how people feel about that,” he said. “It’s a huge wrench to do that, everybody understands that. “It’s heartbreaking to think of the businesses that will face difficulties as a result of the measures this country has had to take.” British finance minister Rishi Sunak said for the first time in history the government would step in to cover wages of businesses hit by coronavirus as part of a stimulus package. Mr Sunak said the government would give grants to cover 80 per cent of workers’ salaries – up to the value of STG2500 ($5010) a month each – if businesses kept them on staff. “The economic intervention that I am announcing today is unprecedented in the history of the British state,” he said. Mr Sunak also said businesses would be allowed to hold on to STG30 billion ($60 billion) of value-added tax, which they would normally pass on to tax authorities over the next three months, in order to help their cash flow. In the USA, New York authorities have told all non-essential workers to stay home after the state of California invoked the same direction for its 40 million residents. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged by 70,000 in a week as economies around the world take a big hit from coronavirus. Meanwhile a top International Monetary Fund official warned the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic would be “quite severe”. But a long expansionary period and high employment rates meant the global economy should weather the current shock. Martin Muehleisen, who heads the IMF’s strategy policy and review department, said in an IMF podcast the main goal for governments should be to limit the spread of the virus in a way that provides confidence that the economic shock will be temporary. He said banks and governments had already taken unprecedented measures to provide liquidity to markets and keep them functioning, “maybe more than we needed”, but such steps should be co-ordinated internationally to amplify their effect. “The better organised and the more co-ordinated the health responses to this crisis, the more quickly it may be possible that confidence returns,” he said. Globally, the death toll from Covid-19 passed 10,000 and infections exceeded 244,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. More than 86,000 people have recovered, mostly in China, but the pace is much slower than the spread of the virus. Italian soldiers have been drafted to help control the situation in the country’s northern region a sharp rise in deaths from coronavirus. The death count leapt by 627 in a day – by far the largest daily rise in absolute terms since the contagion emerged a month ago, taking the national toll to 4032. The hardest-hit northern region of Lombardy remains in a critical situation, with 2549 deaths and 22,264 cases. On Thursday, Italy overtook China as the country to register most deaths from the highly contagious virus. There are 2655 people in intensive care against a previous 2498. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus politicis: Morrison must reach out to Albanese","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/australian-politics\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-paula-matthewson-war-cabinet\/","transcript":"It only takes one look around the local supermarket to confirm that Australians no longer trust many of the things we once did. People have lost trust in their neighbours to buy only the groceries they need. In response, they’ve started to buy more than they need to avoid being left without. Exacerbated by profiteers, this downward spiral of distrust will be hard to break, despite the best efforts of the government to get it into voters’ heads that there is no risk of an actual food shortage given Australia produces three times the food it needs. Trust in the government, or more precisely, distrust of the government, is what’s making that communication task so hard. It’s also affecting the Prime Minister’s broader efforts to keep citizens, businesses and the stock market from succumbing to a succession of full-blown panic attacks over the COVID-19 virus. That level of distrust is indicated in a recent opinion poll, admittedly taken before the world completely changed – namely two weeks ago – that asked which party was better at handling a selection of ‘major events’. More respondents chose ‘neither’ than either the Coalition or Labor when it came to handling a global economic crisis (Coalition 35 per cent, Labor 30, Neither 36) or a major health risk (Coalition 34, Labor 29, Neither 37). Just like the profiteers exploiting the FOMO spiral in our supermarkets for personal gain, political partisans are whipping up distrust of the government on social media to achieve their own objectives. According to these players, nothing the Prime Minister or his team does or says should be accepted on merit. The government apparently can’t be trusted, partly because it’s not the preferred choice of those who voted against it, and partly because of the Coalition’s numerous failings, such as robodebt and the malfeasance of various ministers. But as we saw with the Howard government’s gun ban after the Port Arthur massacre, governments that do bad things are also capable of doing good things when it is in the national interest. Inserting petty partisan politics into the mix is simply destructive when the times demand constructive collaboration. The government’s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, (who is soon to become the new Secretary for the Department of Health) has been caught up in this wave of antipathy. Accusations have been flying on social media that his advice (particularly on school closures) cannot be trusted and should be disregarded. Coronavirus Update: \"We've now stopped foreign nationals coming into the country but there are still a lot of Australians coming home\" – Brendan Murphy – Chief Medical Officer. #7NEWS https:\/\/t.co\/8UlvKiLmS2 — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) March 20, 2020 This is dangerous territory, when the top health officer in the land is being discredited purely because of the government he works for. Indeed it’s dangerous enough for the peak bodies of Australia’s medical and public health practitioners to go public in the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday, to defend Professor Murphy. Terry Slevin, the chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia, warned that in times of a public health emergency we should not be second-guessing the chief medical officer. “Whether it’s extreme versions of misinformation, people pursuing their own commercial interest, or others offering opinions based on what they heard – these kinds of things are driving the panics we’re seeing,” Mr Slevin said. So it’s in the national interest to avoid or at least reduce COVID-19 being used as a political football. Our diligence in social distancing, social isolating, hand washing, and just being considerate of others is going to help us to reduce the spread and keep more of our loved ones alive. #coronavirusau pic.twitter.com\/betQMRGAKM — 💧🔥🐨😷 💛Bethany Williams (@BethanyinCBR) March 19, 2020 The easiest way to do so is staring the Prime Minister in the face. Or at least it will be the next time he meets with state and territory leaders in the new national cabinet established to coordinate and deliver a consistent national response to the pandemic. Unlike the entity that created it, the Council of Australian Governments (or COAG), the national cabinet is not the place for petty politics. It riffs off the old concept of a ‘war’ cabinet, where cabinet members are drawn from both the government and the opposition to theoretically neutralise political advantage and act in the national interest during times of war. Counting himself as well as all the state premiers and territory chief ministers, Scott Morrison’s war cabinet has five Labor members and four Liberals. According to the PM “it doesn’t matter what party you’re in, in that national cabinet … we are working together as one united team to deal with the issues that we have been sworn in to deal with.” If this is true, there’s one more political leader Mr Morrison could invite to join the national cabinet, in the spirit of bi-partisan collaboration, that could help to bring down the political heat currently simmering on social media. By bringing his opposition counterpart, Anthony Albanese, into the tent, the PM would demonstrate that he truly was prepared to work above politics. And by involving the Labor leader in all national cabinet discussions (which he would hear about anyway from the Labor leaders) the PM might regain some of the voter trust that he’s lost in recent times. An added benefit would be that Mr Albanese would be able to add the Opposition’s proposals to the mix, to be considered on their merit by all leaders in the national cabinet. This would leave little room for complaint by Labor’s supporters if Labor’s proposals were not taken up. The idea is not as outlandish and unprecedented at it seems. Yet it might be exactly what we need in these unprecedented times to restore trust and stability."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"The modelling is horrific, but a hospital bed shortage isn't inevitable","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-australia-hospital-beds\/","transcript":"Health experts are calming fears that Australian hospitals are on track to buckle under the weight of coronavirus patients and run out of intensive care beds within weeks. A viral article published on blogging site Medium by Australian academics Dr Megan Higgie, of James Cook University, and Australian National University PhD student Andrew Kahn has revealed that if Australia failed to implement strict measures it would run out of ICU beds between April 7 and 9. But both the authors and independent experts stress that this is a worst-case scenario, and social distancing and adherence to bans on public gatherings can curb the virus before it overwhelms our health system. The mapping used data that showed that out of 700,000 cases in China, 5 per cent of people became critical, therefore requiring an ICU bed with a ventilator. From there, it plotted the known number of ICU beds across Australia to come to its alarming conclusion. Repeat: an alarming conclusion that’s preventable if we abide by the public health safety measures recommended. The article, which has been shared thousands of times, was written before the government began implementing social distancing responses to the growing number of cases within the country. “The number of ICU beds is … critical in determining the number of people who unnecessarily die from COVID-19,” the articles states. “What do we need to do to prevent unnecessary deaths from 7–9 April onwards (both individually and as leaders)?” it asks. “The only effective measure is that we go into lock-down and practice extremely strong social distancing within the next 5 – 9 days.” It is scary stuff. And has concerned readers across the country. But while accurate, it is an avoidable, worst-case scenario. “The purpose of our analysis is to show that, with the worst-case scenario where we do not change some key facts about how we are responding to COVID-19, we will continue to experience exponential growth of COVID-19 here in Australia,” Dr Higgie told The New Daily. “The purpose of sharing our analysis publicly was to help people understand that the actions we take today will not have an effect for one to two weeks and, with our current trajectory, we are on track to rapidly run out of ICU beds,” she said. “Not in two-three months, as I thought before we did this analysis, but potentially within less than a month if we do not change how COVID-19 is being spread in Australia. “We very much hope that we are incorrect in our estimate and Australia manages to stop its exponential growth of cases in the next week or so. “We don’t have much longer than that.” Ian Seppelt. senior specialist in intensive care medicine at Nepean Hospital said although the calculations were correct, the truth is we just “don’t know” what will happen. “Superficially and mathematically it is correct, though it is obviously a worst-case scenario and all public health effort to date has been directed toward making this not come to pass,” Dr Seppelt said. He stressed that hospitals around the country have had the benefit of being forewarned and have had several weeks to prepare. “There has been a large effort to plan surge capacity in both intensive care units and wards. For example, in my own hospital moving from our normal 24 commissioned ICU beds to at least double that,” Dr Seppelt said. “So while what is predicted in the article might come to pass, it would be a huge public health failure if it does, and this is what hundreds of people are working hard to try to mitigate. “Reality is it’s still going to be bad, but we all hope not as bad as portrayed in the article, and everybody at present is trying to maintain calm rather than whip up hysteria.” A spokesman for Department of Health echoed the sentiment, saying every state and territory in the country was in the process of expanding their ICU capabilities. Our best bet to beat this, and make sure patients who are critical can access the beds they need, is to practice strict public health measures – wash your hands, don’t touch your face and limit your contact with people. “People should use common sense when practising social distancing and maintaining social interactions,” the department of health spokesman said. “Social distancing should be adopted across the entire population, avoiding unnecessary contact and moving 1.5 metres from other people. “People will have to make their own decisions about what social distancing they are able to undertake. These precautions are most important for people over 60, particularly if they have a chronic disease. “It is important that Australians, even those in self-isolation, maintain their social connection and should stay in touch by phone and online with family and friends.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Health workers helped by growing public support","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-health-workers\/","transcript":"Across Australia an army of regular people is growing to provide much-needed support to our front line health workers, performing small acts of kindness as they prepare for the biggest public health war since Spanish Influenza. In the last week, Facebook groups ‘Adopt A health Care Worker’ have sprung up around the country. In the days, the main one, which started in Perth turned from a few hundred to 25,000 members. Thousands of doctors, nurses, and other frontline workers are paired with regular members of the community who can help them out by bringing them coffee, or collecting something from the store, as they handle the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. Lisa Cooke, an emergency nurse from Perth and one of the moderators said it the level of community support had been ‘overwhelming’. “We’ve had some of the amazing things happen, from our community, and right around Australia. We’ve seen the delivery of chocolates and coffees, there was a pizza delivery to the staff at the in ICU who are fundamental to what we’re about to face,” Ms Cooke told The New Daily. “I saw a lovely lady, Kaleish, her children who were worried abut wanted to do something, they got some chocolates and wrote a poem, and are trying to get it to Fiona Stanley Hospital. “She said, ‘Oh it’s just small,’ but to us it’s not small to us. “We need to shift perception into positivity, that this is not forever, we’ll have a tough time but we’ll get through it unified.” “We’re anxious too, and it’s as if the community is collectively giving us a big hug at the moment.” At the best of times, Australia’s frontline health workers have to put up with demanding conditions; a lack of beds, long hours, and occasionally, abuse.  Sophie Hadden, 37, is an emergency nurse who works in Melbourne. She said they have been forced to lock up their masks and hand sanitiser because the public keep stealing them. In the past 24 hours among a myriad of other patients, she saw a 40-year-old man with acquired brain damage who was being abused by his family, then an ‘old chap’ who suffered from schizophrenia and hadn’t eaten in three days. That was before noon. On top of this, people have been stealing protective wear. “We’ve been dealing with people stealing gloves, and masks and hand sanitiser. That in itself is awful, there’s already a shortage. So we’ve got to lock up and count the masks as we do with opioids,” Ms Haddon. “The crisis we’re seeing is not that people have care, it’s this greed. It’s a stress on our system, it’s resources we can’t afford to be using. That’s the fight we have in emergencies.” She said it was the little things like a quick text from a friend, that kept her going. “It’s lovely and empowering in a lot of ways. I’ve had this lovely outreach of support just as I am coming into a moment of crisis,” she said. In the coming weeks, it may just be that behind every great health worker, is a bunch of strangers willing to help – in any way they can. Erin Cotter-Smith is an emergency services responder with the Australian Red Cross and trained in Psychological First Aid. She put herself up to help after speaking to health care workers who are concerned about what is to come. “Some are worried about their children, others, their older parents,” Ms Cotter-Smith said. “This group is a fantastic way for health care workers to put their hand up in a safe space and say I need some help at the moment. “Maybe it’s something like walking their dog while they do extra shifts. Helping out with some household tasks. Just being a caring voice over the phone or online.” Kay Drayton is a 22-year-old nursing student from Melbourne. She’s been getting groceries and having coffee with health workers. “I’ve helped out one doctor through the page, finding her some groceries and veggies that she needed, and she actually helped me out too and found me something I couldn’t find in any of my local stores,” she said. “I went out to a family I know on the other side of Melbourne to take them especially lactose-free milk and gluten-free pasta and cereal for their 10-year-old daughter who was going to have to eat ‘normal’ foods and make her sick.” Coming from a long line of nurses – her foster mum and grandma both worked in the profession, she says she knows first-hand just how much work goes in. “And in situations like this, everything is almost tripled, so I have some time available, and I wanted to offer my help where I could,” Ms Drayton said. “We all need to stick together and look after our communities.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Your coronavirus questions answered: How to stay healthy and virus free","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-questions-health\/","transcript":"Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. And there is no doubt you’ve also heard some incorrect information about the coronavirus. To counter this, The New Daily is running a series based on audience questions, so you’re armed with the information you need. On Thursday, we looked at travel and socialising and Friday we covered how the virus works. This is a rapidly changing situation and answers are current as of time of publishing. Professor Nikolai Petrovsk from the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University is answering your questions about how to stay healthy and virus free. Over to him. No it is not OK. Chinese studies showed very high rate of transmission within family members if one is affected. So to send the children to school when they are living with you would invalidate the effect of the isolation. Unlike influenza, where there is an extra high risk to pregnant women, this has not been reported for COVID-19. Similarly, young children have not shown much serious illness even when they are infected. But it is still early days so it is wise for pregnant women and those with young babies to exercise caution and avoid exposing themselves to anyone who might be infected. Current guidelines indicate that after 14 days, if you are symptom-free then you can resume work, without any further testing or review. However, guidelines are constantly changing and are variable from place to place, so you will need to review this regularly. If you have no symptoms during the whole 14 days then you don’t need to do anything as it is unlikely you were infected. If you have symptoms and get tested and are positive then you should disinfect the house. If you have mild symptoms then you can choose to ride it out. If your symptoms worsen and\/or you have breathing difficulties then you should seek medical attention. If symptoms are not severe you should ring the medical centre for advice rather than go there in person. You should not leave the unit except to attend to critical matters. No, masks are used in hospital surgeries to stop the doctor infecting the patient not the other way around. So only people who are infected should wear masks to stop them coughing on others and infecting them. Wearing a mask doesn’t help. Try and shop when it is not crowded, and be careful not to touch your face and to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. Yes, it causes a fever, aches and pains, headaches and shortness of breath and cough just like the flu. Drink sufficient water, avoid alcohol, go to bed and if it worsens seek medical attention."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Home loan customers granted coronavirus repayment reprieve","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/finance-news\/banking\/2020\/03\/20\/loan-coronavirus-help\/","transcript":"Australia’s major banks have thrown homeowners a much-needed lifeline, offering loan repayment deferrals for up to six months as coronavirus fears weigh on the economy. Most banks have also lowered rates following the Reserve Bank’s emergency rate cut (from 0.5 per cent to a record low 0.25 per cent), further easing customers’ burden. The unprecedented action follows Australian Banking Association chief executive Anna Bligh’s announcement small businesses will be eligible for similar deferrals on business loans. “This package delivers across $100 billion worth of small business loans. It delivers up to $8 billion back into the pockets of small businesses as they battle with this virus and its impacts,” Ms Bligh said. Ms Bligh would not confirm at the time whether home loan customers would receive the same treatment, but the big four banks were quick to follow with their own relief offers. Speaking to The New Daily, RateCity director of research Sally Tindall welcomed the banks efforts to reduce mortgage stress. “Giving home loan customers the ability to hit pause on their mortgage repayments for up to six months will make a real difference to people who have been severely impacted by the coronavirus,” she said. “The mortgage is typically the biggest single expense in the family budget. This will give families some much needed breathing space at a time when they are likely to need it most.” In addition to deferring repayments, each of the banks have made a number of changes to rates and term deposit conditions. These vary between the banks, and customers will need to contact their bank  “Banks are making assessments on a case by case basis,” MS Lamont said. “They will be able to look your accounts immediately to see what’s going on with your finances – they may also ask for extra documents proving you’re in strife.” Westpac is also offering an 8 month term deposit with a 2 per cent rate to customers over 65. Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank has lowered the eligibility criteria for personal overdrafts and reduced repayments to the minimum level to free up cash for those paying more. Many smaller lenders are “yet to declare their hand” Ms Tindall said, but most are expected to follow suit. “Now three of the four big banks are offering fixed rates as low as 2.19 per cent, we’re likely to see other lenders chase after them, potentially cutting fixed rates even further,” she said. Although a six month pause on repayments will be immensely helpful to countless Australian families, it might not be enough to see everyone through. “We still don’t know how big or for how long the coronavirus will impact our economy,” Ms Tindall said. “At this stage, the big banks have said they will review people’s home loan repayment pause at the three month mark.” Kirsty Lamont, director at consumer comparison site Mozo, similarly told The New Daily banks may need to find more ways to support customers as the pandemic unfolds. “It’s a significant first step and should alleviate some of the pain customers are experiencing,” she said. “But banks may need to consider extending it, as some customers may still struggle to find jobs after the six months is up.” Ms Lamont said home loan customers with genuine concerns about their ability to repay their mortgages need to reach out to their banks as soon as possible to discuss alternative options. The banks changes come following the announcement of government’s $30 million plus stimulus package and a range of policy changes from the RBA. The government then announced a second stimulus package on March 22."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"The Ferguson Report: Banks lead by example in age of hand-washing The Ferguson Report: Tom Hanks' threat to national happiness","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/20\/tim-ferguson-banks-hanks\/","transcript":"US actor, Tom Hanks was harshly criticised by outraged Australians after he posted a photo of toast he’d thickly smothered in Vegemite. The good news is Australians have nothing else to worry about. “I was scrolling past tweets about some beer-based virus in search of something important,” said an extremely ordinary Australian. “When I saw Tom Hanks had smothered Vegemite onto a piece of toast, I panicked. I ran and bought 1000 jars of Vegemite to hide behind my wall of Ultra absorbent three-ply.” A Tom Hanks fan hiding in a milk crate said, “Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna catch.” PM Scott ‘Flushable Wipe’ Morrison has called the millions of Aussies hoarding toilet paper “un-Australian”. Their passports will be revoked. He called for people to selfishly hoard calmly. But Australians are easily scared, especially the ‘plucky larrikins’ and ‘true-blue Aussies’ who have raided supermarket shelves. The PM said, “Hoarding is not who we are as a people,” when clearly it is. He added, “I can’t be more blunt about it,” when clearly he can. The Reserve Bank has cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent. The Commonwealth Bank has matched it exactly with a cut of 0.7 per cent. “I saw what you did there,” said a customer. “No, you didn’t,” said a banker. A banking CEO who will remain priceless said, “We wash our hands of any wrongdoing, then we leave our customers high and dry.” “These are unprecedented times, and they call for unprecedented measures,” said Commonwealth Bank CEO Matt Comyn, between chuckles and snorts. The other banks have not cut their interest rates. This is not unprecedented. Governments of the world are trusting scientists to invent a cure for the coronavirus, but not a cure for climate change. A government spokesman said, “Scientists are evildoers bent on linking climate change to the things that cause climate change. But we’ll listen to them just this once.” A UN spokesman said, “Scientists are very un-UN.” A Sky News denial-denier pulled his head out of another Sky denier. “We need scientists to stop dishonestly claiming they have a plan to save the world, and get to work on a plan to save the world.” DESPITE HIS BEST EFFORTS, TRUMP FAILS TO DOMINATE HEADLINES CHEM-TRAIL THEORIST CLAIMS “CHEM-TRAILS MADE ME STUPID!” NEWSREADER APOLOGISES FOR BEING RATIONAL & CALM CITY OF ADELAIDE CLASSIFIED AS A NON-ESSENTIAL GATHERING ANTI-VAXXERS GO VERY, VERY QUIET"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Housing prices could plunge by 20 per cent in a coronavirus recession Virus could leave housing market sick and reeling","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/property\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-housing-market\/","transcript":"Economists believe it could take longer than the Coalition’s six-month coronavirus timeframe for the housing market to return to “business as usual”, as one grim prediction forecasts the potential for double -digit drops in property prices. The claims come after Scott Morrison announced states and territories are working to limit the fallout of a coronavirus-fuelled recession in the rental market, with thousands of tenants in casual jobs expected to be laid off. Meanwhile, the major banks have extended an olive branch to home loan customers who may struggle to maintain pace with their repayments. The big four banks announced impacted customers could apply for a six-month ‘loan holiday’ on their mortgage. AMP chief economist Dr Shane Oliver declared the government’s increasingly draconian social distancing policies would intensify plummeting transaction numbers. But of greater concern is the threat of a recession lasting more than six months, which could see unemployment rise from the current 5.1 per cent to above 10 per cent. “A deeper recession … risks tripping up the underlying vulnerability of the housing market around high prices and high debt levels. This could see a 20 per cent fall in prices,” Dr Oliver said. “[This] risks resulting in a spike in debt servicing problems, forced sales and sharply falling prices. This could then feedback to weaken the broader economy as falling home prices lead to less spending.” Property data analysis service CoreLogic said the Australian housing market has historically fared well in times of crisis, but warns the once-in-a-generation pandemic has quelled optimism around the Reserve Bank’s decision to slash interest rates to a record low 0.25 per cent.  Research principal Eliza Owen said the share market’s catastrophic month-long volatility would likely not be replicated in the housing market, given property’s illiquidity. But Ms Owen believes there will be a downward shift in the number of transactions, if the government announces Italian-style quarantine measures. “This may lead to postponed dwelling purchases, as housing is an expensive, high commitment purchase decision,” Ms Owen said. “In the long term, housing market values and activity will be linked to the extent that quarantine measures affect income, employment, borrowing capacity and credit availability.” Independent economist Saul Eslake echoed CoreLogic’s research, believing record-low interest rates would have negligible influence on the Australian property market’s fortunes. But Mr Eslake tempered the forecasts made by Dr Oliver, suggesting lenders’ willingness to show forbearance for struggling customers signals their preparedness for a short-term pause. In turn, this means less forced sales, which are a driving factor in placing downward pressure on property prices in a recession. “Banks could find if we have a lot of forced sales at bargain basement prices, it could mean that they don’t recover enough from the sales to cover the outstanding debts – and the banks themselves could be taking significant losses,” Mr Eslake said. “Clearly, we’re not going to have big cuts in interest rates, so there’s unlikely going to be a big surge in house prices. We will see a gradual return to business as usual in terms of the volume of transactions.” University of Tasmania economics lecturer Dr Maria Yanotti said the lack of clarity over the outbreak’s severity is prompting prospective buyers and sellers to shy away from the market. The fears of a rise in unemployment could compel some at-risk workers to consider downsizing, but existing affordable housing shortages in major cities may give them little room to move. “When there’s uncertainty, what we tend to do is postpone big expenses,” Dr Yanotti said. “Sellers would be more cautious and therefore may take longer to put their property on the market or it may take them longer to sell – in worst-case scenarios, there would be adjustments in terms of price.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: How cyber soirees will keep you in touch ... and dancing, drinking and debating Isolated and lonely?

Businesses are using online meeting platforms to keep the country running, so why not use these to pump up your social life? Here ares our top tech hacks to inspire your next virtual group gathering. Re-creating a cinema experience with your friends is a tough one, but here’s where Netflix is stepping in. Netflix Party is a Google Chrome extension you add for free to your laptop or desktop computer. It allows you to choose a movie and watch it in sync with friends remotely. You can add a group chat so there’s plenty of opportunity to swoon over Ryan Reynolds in 6 Underground, laugh and cry with Taylor Swift doco Miss Americana or get old retro belly laughs with Ghostbusters. Cinemas are still open, but many film companies are starting to send new releases straight to streaming services, which means you can host your own ‘premieres’. There’s no better way to shake off global doom and gloom than by shaking your booty! First up, create a collaborative playlist with your friends using music streaming service Spotify. Share the playlist with your mates via a web link and everyone can add their own tunes. It’s a mixtape, baby! Next up, set the time and date and then hook up your dance buddies via Skype. It’s been around since the Spanish flu (OK, maybe not that long) but Skype never lets you down — unless you have relatives who say ‘I can hear you but I can’t see you’ a lot. Make sure everyone has an account, add them to the call and then hit the dial button. One of you can have the collaborative list playing through their laptop and everyone else can pump up the volume. Let’s get literary, people. Gather your read-a-holic friends and support small book retailers by ordering the same book online. Give yourselves time to read it, then gather around your devices for the Great Discussion. Zoom is a super-popular cloud-based meeting platform for corporate meetings, webinars and training — and it’s being appropriated for social gatherings too. You can join in a chat via desktop, laptop or smartphone (or big screen if you can airplay it to your telly) and have online chats with the group as well or private chats with some people on the call. The only limitation is a 40-minute window for free use, so make your meeting quick or schedule one after the other. The free version of the app allows unlimited meetings. What better time to be sampling the great wines on offer from around Australia (and delivered straight to your door) via well-established companies including Vino Mofo, Tipple, Jimmy Bring, Naked Wines and, of course, your local wine store.

Simply open the app and add up to 31 contacts, then start your call. However, the FaceTime app is only available for Apple cult members, so if your crew includes an Android user or two, switch to Facebook Messenger, which can now handle up to 50 guests at one time. Simply create a group of winos, er, friends who appreciate a good drop, then hit the video button. Messenger’s filters can add a whole new level of hilarity. If you have wifi it’s free, otherwise the vid chat may eat into your phone’s data. If your company has directed you to work from home, the ol’ 5pm pub gatherings on a Friday are a bit trickier to coordinate. Many corporations use Slack, the darling of communications apps on the market. Slack introduced video chats for its paid plans which means 15 or more people can jump in on a call once work is done and take turns in sharing their screens. The feature allows team members to draw on each other’s screens too — we’re thinking you could get pretty creative with party games!"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Former union boss Greg Combet lands virus workforce role","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/greg-combet-virus-workforce\/","transcript":"Former union boss and Labor industry minister Greg Combet has been appointed to advise the Morrison government on the fallout of coronavirus for the Australian workforce.

Mr Combet will provide strategic and policy advice to the minister and engage directly with union and business leaders. The government has already announced some measures to help workers and business owners affected by the pandemic. More changes are on the way as the situation rapidly escalates. “Mr Combet’s background, insight and expertise will be invaluable,” Mr Porter said. “Not only to the government but to all those directly affected, including employee and employer representatives and, most importantly, workers who are directly affected.” Some businesses such as Telstra, Woolworths and the Commonwealth Bank have already promised to support casual workers who lose shifts because of the virus. Qantas and Woolworths are working together to find temporary positions for airline staff who have been stood down. “This is new territory for us all,” Mr Porter said. “The willingness to work together augurs well for all parties to continue working closely and cooperatively as we move through this unprecedented situation.” Mr Combet and the minister attended a meeting of workers and bosses in Sydney on Friday morning, which was video-linked to Melbourne and Canberra. Before serving as a minister in the Gillard and Rudd Labor governments, Mr Combet rose to prominence as a union leader. He was secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, a high-profile figure in the waterfront dispute and helped secure entitlements for workers after the collapse of airline Ansett. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Government announces new measures to step up coronavirus fight","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-budget-delayed-as-small-businesses-thrown-a-lifeline\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has revealed a new social distancing measure as all non-Australian citizens or residents are banned from entering the country. The announcements come after a meeting of the national cabinet and state leaders. The federal government is requesting those in offices, restaurants or other spaces ensure there is four square metres per person. In practical terms, this means a room of 100 square metres should only have 25 people in it. “We are now moving to an arrangement for gatherings of less than 100 and that there would be four square metres provided per person in an enclosed space, in a room,” he said “So that’s two metres by two metres. “So, for example, if you’ve got a room, if you’ve got a premises, if you’ve got a meeting room or something like that, that’s 100 square metres, then you can have 25 people in that room,” Mr Morrison said. Schools, universities, airports, public transport, medical and emergency services facilities, aged care homes, jails, courts, parliaments, supermarkets and many workplaces are exempt from the indoor gathering restrictions. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy reiterated the advice, saying the situation was “critical”. “We have to slow the curve … there is a risk if we don’t do what everyone of us has to do as our civic duty to control this spread it will grow significantly greater,” Dr Murphy said. This advice comes with its own implications for Parliament. Government and opposition whips will minimise the number of members and senators from remote areas or who have the longest travel requirements. If a Parliamentarian is sick or self-isolating or consideration needs to be given to the welfare of their communities, pairs will be made. During question time at 2pm, only the required ministers, members and senators attend the chambers to reduce the number of members and senators in each chamber. Some variations will be made to procedure to enable members and senators to observe “social distancing”. For example, ordinarily they must be in their own seat to speak, but the rules will be bent to allow speaking from another seat. Members and senators can only bring a limited number of staff, while the public gallery will be closed and visitors to Parliament House limited. Restrictions on movement are set to be extended, with all non-Australian citizens or residents banned from entering the country from 9pm AEDT Friday. Direct family members will still be permitted. National cabinet will consider on Tuesday further travel restrictions which will apply in the Easter school holidays. But people planning holidays should “reconsider any unnecessary travel”. Concern has been expressed about Indigenous communities, deemed more susceptible to the virus’ effects. States and territories will nominate specific areas which will be subject to entry restrictions, to help minimise the spread into vulnerable communities. Some travel exemptions will apply, including for medical treatment, food and medical supplies, mental health and domestic violence support and emergency services. Similarly, all workers in the aged-care sector will be test and all health care workers exhibiting cold-like symptoms will be tested. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Student tests positive for COVID-19 after contact with infected teacher","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/unley-high-school-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A year eight student at Adelaide’s Unley High School has tested positive for COVID-19. In a letter to parents, the school said the student had been identified as a close contact of a staff member who tested positive for the virus last week. The school reopened its doors this morning, after closing for cleaning once the staff member’s infection was confirmed. But the letter states the school will not be closing again in light of the student’s positive test, because the child was not at school during the infectious period. “It is important that you know that SA Health have confirmed there is no further risk at Unley High School due to this child,” principal Greg Rolton wrote. “All other close contacts of the staff member are currently in quarantine and are being monitored for symptoms.” The ABC understands the student attended school-based events and visited a number of businesses while suffering from symptoms last weekend. After confirmation of the staff member’s positive test, the school was initially due to reopen on Thursday, however, the closure was extended for a further 24 hours. Mr Rolton said while the second positive case was not ideal, the school was confident the isolation process had been effective. “We will continue to monitor the situation via SA Health. I will keep our school community informed,” he wrote. A letter distributed to parents by SA Education Minister John Gardner on Wednesday stated that the protocol was to close a site straight away if a case was confirmed. “The government’s current COVID-19 protocol is to close a site immediately for a minimum of 24 hours if a confirmed case is identified for someone at that site,” he said. “If that happens parents and carers will be contacted to come and collect their child and\/or agree how they can leave safely.” Unley High is among several Adelaide schools to close because of coronavirus cases. A student from Sacred Heart College and a Scotch College student have also tested positive. Both schools were temporarily closed to allow for cleaning to occur. Earlier this week, acting chief medical officer Michael Cusack said SA Health supported schools staying open and “advocating for parents to send their children to school”. “The information we have from the largest review of COVID-19, which has taken place in China, was that although children undoubtedly will get the infection, they did not find evidence of that infection occurring inside the schools,” Dr Cusack said on Tuesday. “It wasn’t the case that children were infecting each other at school. It was much more the case they were getting the infection in their own families.” SA Health said there were concerns that, if schools closed, students would be left in the care of grandparents and older relatives. “If children have the disease, we’re exposing perhaps the more vulnerable members of our population to COVID-19,” he said. Yesterday, SA Health announced the number of cases of coronavirus in the state had climbed above 40. The government also revealed two hospitals were set to be reopened in Adelaide, to boost bed capacity by almost 200 to deal with an anticipated spike in cases."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Deploying every resource': 40 million Californians ordered into lockdown","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/california-lockdown-coronavirus\/","transcript":"California’s 40 million residents have been ordered to stay at home as the coronavirus pandemic worsens across the United States. State governor Gavin Newsom made the unprecedented order on Friday (Australian time), just hours after Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti ordered residents of the US’s second largest city into lockdown and for “non-essential” businesses to shut. Effective immediately, Mr Newsom’s order is the largest and most sweeping government clampdown yet in the worsening public health crisis brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak. He said modelling had shown that 56 per cent of Californians – more than 25 million people – were expected to contract COVID-19 in the next eight weeks, requiring nearly 20,000 more hospital beds than the state can provide. California, which is among the hardest hit US states in the COVID-19 outbreak, already has more than 1000 confirmed cases and nearly 20 deaths. “We are confident the people of California will abide by it, they will meet this moment,” Mr Newsom said. “They’ll step up as they have over the last number of weeks to protect themselves, to protect their families and to protect the broader community in this great state and the world we reside in.” Mr Newsom said exceptions to the stay-at-home ordered would be granted for residents to make necessary trips to supermarkets, pharmacies, doctors and, for some, work. The order has no end date, but he has suggested it will last at least eight weeks. He had also asked US President Donald Trump to send a US Navy hospital ship to Los Angeles immediately as California braces for the expected surge in coronavirus cases. A spokesman for Mr Newsom, Nathan Click, said the governor had intended to make the threat of the virus clear to Californians. “Governor Newsom has been honest about the threat of the virus and its impact on the health and welfare of Californians,” he told the Los Angeles Times. “This projection shows why it’s so critical that Californians take action to slow the spread of the disease – and those mitigation efforts aren’t taken into account in those numbers. “The state is deploying every resource at its disposal to meet this challenge, and we continue to ask for the federal government’s assistance in this fight.” In a separate letter to US congressional leaders, Mr Newsom also asked for additional federal funding for unemployment insurance and social safety net programs and aid to small businesses, schools and universities. Earlier, LA mayor Eric Garcetti said the lockdown orders would mean all indoor shopping malls, playgrounds and other gathering places would be shut at least until the end of March. “We’re taking this urgent action to limit the spread of COVID-19 and save lives,” he said. Similar so-called “shelter in place” directives have also been given in more than a dozen northern California counties. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Welcome to Coping With COVID-19 | The New Daily","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/20\/welcome-to-coping-with-covid-19\/","transcript":"We at The New Daily have always been mindful of our responsibility  to offer readers a balanced of news and analysis that is not only informative or entertaining, but useful.

Education ministers decided on Friday to bin the annual NAPLAN tests, which were scheduled for May 12-22. The ministers said cancelling the exams would help teachers and principals “focus on the wellbeing of students and continuity of education, including potential online and remote learning”. “Further, the impact of responses to the COVID-19 virus may affect the delivery of NAPLAN testing, including the operation of centralised marking centres and the implications for nationally comparable data if an insufficient number of students are available to do the test,” they said in a statement. But they reiterated the strong medical advice that schools should remain open for now. “Education departments and systems will continue to closely monitor health advice and work with schools to ensure appropriate support for students and staff as the response to COVID-19 develops,” they said. NSW Principals Council acting president Craig Petersen welcomed the decision. “It removes a lot of doubt and anxiety,” he said. “Given the current situation with coronavirus, it would be almost impossible to predict when schools would be in a position to be able to adequately run the test and administer them, so cancelling it for this year is a really sound decision.” The Queensland Catholic Education Commission agreed. “Given the uncertainty around the impacts of COVID-19, schools need to be able to plan for a range of contingencies and to keep their focus on teaching and learning,” executive director Dr Lee-Anne Perry said. The cancellation also means testing of the expanded online NAPLAN platform, which was supposed to start next week, won’t go ahead. In 2019, the first widespread trial of NAPLAN online was plagued by technical issues, with many students unable to complete their tests first go. Some states have questioned the usefulness of NAPLAN, with NSW, Queensland and Victoria reviewing whether the standardised testing gives parents and teachers diagnostic information in the most efficient way. But federal Education Minister Dan Tehan has previously defended it, saying the tests did provide valuable information. The announcement comes amid reports of a student at Adelaide’s Unley High School testing positive for COVID-19 after close contact with an infected teacher. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Culprits executed over Delhi bus rape, murder | The New Daily","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/20\/culprits-executed-over-delhi-bus-rape-murder\/","transcript":"India has hanged four men who were convicted for the rape and murder of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi in 2012, in a case that shocked the world and shamed the country over its appalling record for crimes against women. The men were executed at dawn on Friday in Tihar jail, on the outskirts of the capital, four television news channels reported. Hundreds of police were deployed outside the jail to control a crowd that waited to celebrate the execution of the men for the attack that shone a spotlight on women’s safety across India. Some held placards that read “Justice for women” and “Hang the culprits”. The crime, which happened on the night of 16 December, 2012, sparked massive protests and global outrage. The victim was dubbed Nirbhaya – the fearless one – by the Indian media, as she could not be named under Indian law. “Today, justice has been done after seven years,” the victim’s mother told reporters outside the prison. “I salute Indian judiciary and thank god for hearing our prayers … my daughter’s soul can now rest in peace.” Six men were arrested for the brutal attack. One suspect, Ram Singh, was found dead in his jail cell in March 2013, having apparently taken his own life. Another, who was aged 17 at the time, was released in 2015 after serving three years in a reform facility – the maximum term possible for a juvenile in India.

In 2017, the Supreme Court upheld death sentences against four men, with judges ruling the crime met the “rarest of the rare” standard required to justify capital punishment in India. India’s president rejected pleas for clemency from the condemned men, after the Supreme Court dismissed their pleas for a review of the death sentences. Attacked on a moving bus and left for dead on roadside, the victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, clung to life for two weeks before succumbing to her injuries. She died in a hospital in Singapore, where she had been transferred in a desperate attempt to save her. Outrage over her death led to India passing tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases. -agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Playboy scraps US magazine amid coronavirus pandemic","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/playboy-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Men’s magazine Playboy is putting the shutters up on its US print edition after nearly seven decades as it reels from disruption caused by the coronavirus crisis. The iconic magazine has struggled in the digital age, with the coronavirus outbreak sounding the death knell for the magazine’s print division. The upcoming spring edition will be the last for the magazine, which was renowned not only for its nudity but also interviews, in-depth political coverage and fiction. Playboy was launched in 1953 by 27-year-old Hugh Hefner, who reportedly left his job as a copywriter at Esquire after he was denied a raise. The magazine had already been losing money as sales petered out to just a fraction of their peak in the 1970s, when each quarterly edition sold millions of copies. Coronavirus was the final straw. “Last week, as the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic to content production and the supply chain became clearer and clearer, we were forced to accelerate a conversation we’ve been having internally,” the magazine said in a blog post published late on Wednesday. “We have decided that our Spring 2020 Issue, which arrives on US newsstands and as a digital download this week, will be our final printed publication for the year in the US,” the post said. Playboy’s online output will continue as will a number of its international print editions. “Over the past 66 years, we’ve become far more than a magazine. And sometimes you have to let go of the past to make room for the future,” the magazine said. Playboy now is primarily a global brand, with the bow-tied bunny ears logo plastered on a range of products from clothes to perfumes. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Normal rules no longer apply: UN chief","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-warning-un-chief\/","transcript":"As the coronavirus epicentre shifts to Europe, the world’s richest nations are taking unprecedented steps to stem the effects of the outbreak on the global economy. Aid is being poured into a number of industries, with tourism and airlines hard hit, as the world’s citizens hunker down to minimise contact and curb the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness. But few sectors have been spared by a crisis threatening a prolonged global recession. The moves come as the number of deaths in Italy surpass those in mainland China, where the virus originated. With more than 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War II, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu. UN chief Antonio Guterres warned a global recession, “perhaps of record dimensions”, was a near certainty. “This is a moment that demands co-ordinated, decisive and innovative policy action from the world’s leading economies,” Mr Guterres told reporters via a video conference on Thursday (local time). “We are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.” The United States is urging Americans not to travel abroad at all and could announce restrictions at the US-Mexican border today. They would be similar to the closure of the US-Canada border to non-essential traffic. “If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite time frame,” the US State Department said on Thursday (local time). Markets have suffered routs unseen since the 2008 financial debacle, with investors rushing to the US dollar as a safe haven. Wall Street tried to bounce back on Thursday (local time). The benchmark S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent, still about 30 per cent off highs reached last month. US oil prices posted their largest one-day gain ever, rising 25 per cent. Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Asia have slashed interest rates and opened liquidity taps to try to stabilise economies hit by quarantined consumers, broken supply chains, disrupted transport and paralysed businesses. The virus, thought to have originated from wildlife in mainland China late last year, has jumped to 172 other nations and territories with more than 20,000 new cases reported in the past 24 hours – a daily record. Cases in Germany, Iran and Spain rose to more than 12,000 each. An official in Tehran tweeted that the coronavirus was killing one person every 10 minutes. Britain, which has reported 144 deaths, was closing dozens of underground stations in London and ordering schools shut from Friday (local time). About 20,000 soldiers were on standby, Queen Elizabeth headed for sanctuary at Windsor Castle and the Tower of London was to close along with other historic buildings. With heavy hearts, we’re raising the drawbridge 🏰 In light of recent govt advice the Tower will close from Friday evening.

Germany’s military was also preparing to help. Supermarkets in many countries were besieged with shoppers stocking up on food staples and hygiene products. Russia reported its first coronavirus death on Thursday (local time). China provided a ray of hope as it reported zero new local transmissions of the virus. Imported cases accounted for all 34 new infections in China. In the United States, where President Donald Trump had initially played down the coronavirus threat, infections surged with more than 11,500 known cases and at least 186 deaths. Mr Trump has angered Beijing by rebuking it for not acting faster and drawn accusations of racism by referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus”. In a bewildering raft of financial measures around the world, the European Central Bank launched new bond purchases worth 750 billion euros ($1.4 trillion), the US Federal Reserve rolled out its third emergency credit program in two days, and the Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.1 per cent, its second emergency rate cut in just more than a week. China was to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus and South Korea pledged 50 trillion won ($A69.5 billion). The desperate state of industry was writ large in Detroit, where the big three auto makers – Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV – were shutting US plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico. Some automakers have pledged to help manufacture much needed medical supplies. In Britain, small gin distilleries have started producing hand sanitiser amid a national shortage, a trend mirrored across the globe from Australia to the United States. Monaco has cancelled its Formula One Grand Prix in another high-profile sporting casualty of the epidemic. So proud of all the team @708gin as this is awesome !

The decision comes as nations around the world seal their borders and ban travel to stop the virus’s spread. Mr Trump held a videoconference with the leaders of the world’s major industrialised countries earlier this week and plans to repeat that in April, May and June, when the physical meeting at the presidential retreat in Maryland was scheduled to take place. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who also serves as Mr Trump’s G7 “sherpa”, has informed his counterparts about the move. The White House views the change as part of mitigation efforts to fight the virus. Countries usually send large delegations with their leaders to G7 summits and journalists from around the world convene to cover their meeting as well. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Banks offer six-month home, small business loan holidays","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/banks-coronavirus-loans\/","transcript":"Small businesses will be able to defer payments on up to $100 million in loans for six months under COVID-19 measures announced by the Australian Banking Association on Friday. And, just an hour later, one of the country’s biggest banks said it would extend the same offer to home loan customers who were experiencing financial hardship. ABA chief executive Anna Bligh said the loan holiday would apply to any small business affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “This package is not restricted to any sector or any industry,” she said. “We want to get it out to as many businesses as quickly as possible so they can keep their doors open and keep employing Australians.” The banks’ announcement followed the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates to a record low 0.25 per cent on Thursday. The RBA also announced extraordinary measures to help prevent a coronavirus-driven recession. It will buy Australian government bonds as part of its first-ever quantitative easing program, and provide a three-year funding facility to provide cheap loans for Australian banks. Ms Bligh said banks were yet to see households going into mortgage stress because of COVID-19 but would monitor the situation. “If we start to see any other critical need … that’s something that [the banks] know they’ll need to look at,” she said. Despite that, just an hour later, NAB – one of the country’s four big lenders – said eligible home loan customers could seek six-month holidays on mortgage payments. “This is an extremely difficult time but we will get through this together,” chief executive Ross McEwan said. “We are well-capitalised and stand ready to play our critical role in this global crisis.” For a customer with a typical home loan of $400,000, NAB’s move will mean access to an additional $11,006 over six months, or $1834 a month. NAB, like the Commonwealth Bank, will not pass on Thursday’s rate cut to variable home loan customers. CBA was the first to act after the Reserve Bank’s emergency cut, cutting rates by 0.7 per cent for some borrowers with fixed loans. Westpac copied CBA on Friday, reducing one, two and three-year fixed home loan rates to 2.29 per cent, and raising rates on 12-month term deposits to 1.7 per cent. “This is a once in a lifetime event and a unified response by government, regulators and corporate Australia is exactly what we need,” acting chief executive Peter King said. ANZ said it would reduce rates on variable interest small business loans and pass on 15 basis points of the RBA’s rate cut to its variable interest rate home loan customers. It will also let home loan customers request a deferral of home loan repayments for up to six months, with interest capitalised. Ms Bligh said banks would work with small business customers to help them survive the economic fallout from the coronavirus. The ABA expected its aid package to put up to $8 billion back into the pockets of affected companies. She said Australia’s banks were in a strong position to weather the pandemic. “The size of this commitment to small businesses demonstrates that banks – regardless of their size – are well able to lean in and lean in hard when it’s needed,” she said. The Morrison government is also plotting a fresh round of stimulus measures after announcing a $17.6 billion package last week. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the next package would extend support for small business and assist sacked workers. “This second package we are working on right now is about cushioning the blow for so many of those Australians who may lose their job,” he told Sky News on Friday. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Telstra halts job cuts, suspends late fees amid virus pain","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/telstra-job-cuts-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Telstra has frozen its job-cutting program for six months, suspended late-payment fees and disconnections, and will hire 1000 temporary contractors to help counter the economic toll of the COVID-19 outbreak. On Friday, the telco giant also said it would bring forward $500 million capital expenditure from the next financial year to increase its network capacity during the coronavirus pandemic and help it accelerate the rollout of its 5G network. Chief executive Andy Penn said the virus would likely have an impact on the company’s future balance sheet, but said it was important for big business to “show leadership and contribute to the national response”. “Like many businesses it is expected to be material and will depend on how the situation and its impact on the economy and our customers evolves,” Mr Penn said. “While it is critical we maintain a strong position, we also believe there are a range of additional initiatives we can undertake now to help support the broader economy.” Telstra said small businesses and consumers unable to pay their bills would not be charged late fees or disconnected until at least the end of April. The policy would be reviewed then. These measures are in addition to unlimited data allowances on fixed broadband and extra mobile data for Telstra’s consumer and small business customers, as well as extra paid leave for Telstra employees and casuals. The 1000 temporary staff hires will help the company handle a spike in call centre volumes. Telstra committed to continuing its productivity program to reduce underlying fixed costs by $2.5 billion annually by the end of FY22 but will not cut jobs for the next six months. At its first-half results last month, Telstra said it had completed 6900 of the 8000 net job cuts it flagged in June 2018. Telstra’s current outlook remains within the range of its FY20 guidance, which it changed in September to reflect the costs of the National Broadband Network rollout.

NSW Health authorities said the woman, who had had close contact with a confirmed coronavirus case linked to Ryde Hospital, died late on Thursday. Her death brought the NSW toll to six. The other fatality is a man who died in Western Australia early in March – he was Australia’s first COVID-19 death. Meanwhile, an Australian tourist in his 30s who died in hospital in Iceland had also tested positive to the virus. The man, whose name has not been released, reportedly died shortly after arriving at a hospital in northern Iceland. The country’s chief epidemiologist, Porolfur Guonason, said despite the positive test, COVID-19 was not thought to have caused the tourist’s death. The man’s wife, who was travelling with him, has also tested positive for coronavirus and is in isolation. Australia has more than 700 confirmed coronavirus cases. On Friday, NSW’s confirmed cases jumped to 382. That is up 75 on Thursday – in the biggest increase yet seen in the outbreak. Six people are in intensive care. “It’s obviously quite a substantial increase,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said. “Again, it’s indicative of the growing issue that faces the entire world.” It came as three people on a cruise ship that returned to Sydney from New Zealand on Thursday tested positive to coronavirus – prompting pleas for all 3800 people on board to go into self-isolation for a fortnight. An additional passenger from the Princess Cruises-operated Ruby Princess is also very unwell in Tasmania and is reported to have been confirmed with COVID-19. The ship was carrying 1100 crew and 2700 passengers. Doctors tested 13 unwell patients for COVID-19. Three, including a crew member, were found to have the virus. “One of those passengers was not at all well, and was taken off the ship and has been taken to a hospital here in Sydney, and is being cared for,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said on Friday. “That particular passenger, now patient, is not particularly well.” Mr Hazzard said it was possible that other people on board also had coronavirus, and all people on board now needed to self-isolate for 14 days. “Self-isolate in your home or your normal place of residence, or whenever you may be, and start taking very serious note of your own health,” he said. “If you start to show any of the symptoms … we want you to make sure you report that in, and take due medical advice.” There was a similar situation in Melbourne on Thursday, where passengers and crew were barred from leaving the Golden Princess after it docked early in the morning. Family and friends waited hours for clean bills of health to be given before more than 2000 passengers were allowed to disembark late in the afternoon. Elsewhere, St Columba Anglican School in Port Macquarie, on the NSW mid-north coast, was closed on Friday after a member of its community tested positive for the virus. More than 40,000 people in NSW have been tested for COVID-19. In Adelaide, a year eight student at Unley High School has tested positive for COVID-19. The school told parents in a letter the student had been identified as a close contact of a staff member confirmed to have the virus last week. Also on Friday, the Northern Territory confirmed its second case of COVID-19. Health authorities said a a Territorian in his mid-30s, who had returned home from Europe on March 19, had been tested at the pandemic clinic in Darwin after experiencing flu-like symptoms. His positive result was confirmed early on Friday. In Western Australia, a woman in her 60s is in a critical but stable condition in St John of God Hospital after contracting coronavirus. A spokesperson for the hospital said her condition became critical late yesterday. WA has had 52 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far. Victoria had 178 as of Friday afternoon. The ACT has six confirmed patients. Two were confirmed on Friday afternoon, including in a person who contracted the virus in the US and had since returned home. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has urged Australians to keep following social distancing and hygiene rules to try to slow the outbreak. “If we control the spread and keep the numbers very low as to who is actually needing to go into intensive care – and at the moment it’s only a handful of people who are in hospital because of this illness – that’s where we want to keep it,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian told the Nine Network on Friday. “We are not on top of it – and nobody is – but we are still at a stage where we’re managing it and we don’t want to lose control and that’s why it’s important to socially distance.” -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Essential' farmers' markets escape coronavirus crowd bans","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/farmers-markets-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Farmers’ markets around Australia have official clearance to go ahead this weekend – and are preparing for a potential onslaught after unprecedented panic buying and hoarding at supermarkets. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said strict new bans on large gatherings to slow the spread of COVID-19 did not apply to supermarkets, food markets, grocery shops, retail outlets and shopping centres. The term “farmers’ markets” was not specified, leading to confusion and concern. But the federal Health Department has confirmed to the ABC that farmers’ markets are an essential service. “Farmers’ markets are currently not banned in the same way as other outdoor gatherings with more than 500 people, as they are providing people with access to a range of food in the same way as a supermarket,” the spokesperson said. “People visiting markets should use common sense when practising social distancing and maintaining social interactions, avoiding unnecessary contact and moving 1.5 metres from other people where possible.” Shane Stanley is proprietor of the popular Noosa and Kawana Waters farmers’ markets and his phone has been running hot with calls from people confused about whether the markets would proceed. He urged people to “keep calm and go to the markets” and said cleaning would increase, with hand sanitisers at most stalls. “I honestly couldn’t see us getting shut down. We are an essential service and we want to get the fresh food out to everybody. It’s an open space, it’s in the sunlight,” Mr Stanley said. “We have 100 stallholders who attend our markets. Those stallholders, from our data, employ around six to eight people and then you have contractors on top of that as well.” Stallholders have been advised that staff members’ duties must be separated so that they are not handling both money and produce. Good Harvest Organics runs stalls at both markets. Their founder, farmer Mick Dan, expressed his relief at the Health Department’s clarification after Sunshine Coast Mayor Mark Jamieson encouraged people to consider attendance at markets “in terms of the numbers that would attend”. “There are so many people that rely on us to turn up a week in, week out with quality product,” Mr Dan said. “Those people don’t shop at supermarkets for fruit and vegetables, they shop at farmers’ markets for fruit and vegetables – and the reason for that is because there’s so many less hands in the process. “Supermarket distribution lines are so long and so complex whereas [at] the farmers’ market, you can pick up food that’s direct from a farmer.” Mr Dan said the number of customers ordering home deliveries online had jumped by 50 per cent. It was a similar story at Shambhala Farm, Doonan, about 20 kilometres inland from Noosa, where Craig and wife Chrissy had extra team members working around the clock to keep up with delivery demands. They wore gloves and masks as they packed boxes for 60 new home-delivery customers. Mr Hubbard said it was “absolutely essential” Shambhala Farm maintained its presence at the Noosa and Kawana farmers’ markets “to provide a real service of staple foods for our customers who are rightly experiencing anxiety right now.” “What I’d like to say is, don’t panic. I’ve talked to a lot of our farm contacts – the farms still have food, they need the customer support as much as you need their food. “It’s times like this that really highlight how important farmers’ markets are to support locals getting their food from local farms as close to their homes as possible.” The spokesperson for the Australian Farmers’ Markets Association, Jane Adams, said she was aware of just one market, in Launceston, Tasmania, that wouldn’t go ahead this weekend. “Farmers’ markets are obviously vitally important as a link in Australia’s food chain and more so now than ever before, considering the shortages at supermarkets,” Ms Adams said. “Shoppers can buy fresh food in the fresh air and I can’t think of a better way to try and shop than like that at the moment. “Especially in regional communities [where] they add considerably to that local economy.” The association has published a free online fact sheet on the homepage of its website with recommendations for minimising risk at markets. “More than ever at the moment, I think it’s vitally important that farmers’ markets trade within the guidelines that are being prescribed to maintain our public health system,” Ms Adams said. She operators of markets with indoor areas should “think about moving [them] outside or spacing stalls out further”. “From a shopper’s perspective, it’s a matter of going to the market, being efficient about your shop not actually expecting to sit down for leisurely coffee,” she said. “Bring your own trolley and if you are experiencing any symptoms of illness, stay away in consideration for others.” She stressed the importance of social distancing. “If you have to stand in a queue at the farmers’ market, maintain that 1.5 metres distance while waiting to be served and then move along.” Ms Adams said market managers would review crowd management next week. Ideas being considered for larger farmers’ markets include clicker-counting customers on and off the market grounds and differently coloured wrist bands for hour-long shopping periods."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Soldier who shot an unarmed Afghan man suspended from duty by ADF","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/20\/soldier-who-shot-an-unarmed-afghan-man-suspended-from-duty-by-australian-army\/","transcript":"An Australian Army soldier seen shooting an unarmed Afghan man in footage aired by Four Corners has been suspended from duty, with the Defence Minister referring the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner. The Four Corners footage showed an Afghan man named Dad Mohammad being shot and killed at close range by an Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) soldier in the Uruzgan province of Afghanistan. A Defence investigation of the 2012 incident found the SAS soldier, called Soldier C in reporting, acted in self-defence. The Department of Defence has issued a statement saying the revelations are “serious and disturbing”. The statement says the Australian Defence Force conducts its operations under “strict rules of engagement and promotes a culture of ethical and lawful behaviour”. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds also issued a statement. “I have today made a formal referral to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police regarding the incident involving the alleged serious criminal conduct of so-called Soldier C,” Senator Reynolds said. The special forces deployments in Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. Retired Admiral Chris Barrie, who served as chief of the Defence Force from 1998 to 2002, told the ABC he was “shocked” watching the footage on Four Corners. Mr Barrie was not familiar with the incident and said he could only comment on what he saw on the program. “The man was not armed, the man was in a docile situation, and he was shot,” Mr Barrie said. “Which, if this was to happen on the streets in Australia, would be a simple case of murder.” Afghanistan’s embassy issued a statement earlier in the week saying they were “deeply saddened” by incidents on the Four Corners program. “The Embassy calls for a complete, impartial and timely investigation of these allegations and trusts the Australian judicial system in this regard,” the embassy said. “The assassination of civilians and non-combatants, including innocent women and children, is totally unjustifiable in accordance with international law, the domestic laws of both these countries who share a friendly relationship, as well as the laws and regulations of any other peace-loving nations. “Hence, if proven, the Embassy calls for the unconditional prosecution of the perpetrators.” The Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force has been investigating the conduct of the special forces in Afghanistan in a wide-ranging inquiry. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister described the vision as “shocking and alarming”. “This issue is rightly under investigation by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force who is examining the conduct of Australia’s Special Forces in Afghanistan over the period 2005 to 2016. “I understand that the findings of this inquiry will soon be provided to the Chief of the Defence Force. I expect that these findings will be acted on fully and promptly.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Melbourne firefighters rescue thief who stole one of their jackets","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/03\/20\/melbourne-firefighters-rescue-thief-who-helped-himself-to-one-of-their-jackets\/","transcript":"A man who stole a jacket from firefighters soon needed their assistance after getting stuck between two walls in Melbourne.

His hopes of a clean getaway were soon extinguished. Police and emergency services were called soon after following reports a man could be heard moaning and groaning. The MFB helped free the 39-year-old from the crevice, where it is believed he had fallen from a roof. The ungrateful thief immediately ran off and probably thought he was home and hosed – only to turn a corner and run straight into the waiting arms of police.

Mr Joyce defended his decision to stand down two-thirds of the national carrier’s workers in the face of the escalating crisis. The airline is standing down 20,000 workers after suspending all international flights and reducing domestic flights until the worst of the crisis passes. But Qantas will allow workers to access long service leave early, and those who have exhausted their annual leave will be able to take up to four weeks in advance. “This is the worst crisis the aviation industry has gone through. I know for the economy it’s probably going to be a lot worse than the GFC,” Mr Joyce said. “We’re not making people redundant and we’re trying this mechanism to make sure we can get through and survive and they have a job at the end of the day.” Mr Joyce, who’s Australia’s highest-paid chief executive, himself is also prepared to take no salary beyond the end of this financial year. He’s currently taking no pay. “None of us are getting paid while this is going on,” he told ABC radio on Friday. Mr Joyce thinks Qantas may be able to get through the crisis without any redundancies. But his also warned the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak would likely result in a “significant recession”, globally and domestically. The airline made an $891 million profit in 2018\/19 but, like its competitors, has been decimated by the spread of the virus and escalating lockdown measures. Mr Joyce is in discussions with supermarket giant Woolworths to redeploy some Qantas workers. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"You'll Never Walk Alone: Vocal show of unity amid pandemic","date":"03-20-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/20\/never-walk-alone-radio-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Radio stations in Britain and across Europe will unite on Friday in simultaneously playing the song You’ll Never Walk Alone as a show of unity amid the coronavirus pandemic. BBC Radio 1’s Greg James, BBC Radio 2’s Zoe Ball and BBC Radio 6 Music’s Lauren Laverne will all play the Gerry And The Pacemakers track at 7.45am on Friday (6.45pm ADST). The BBC wanted to show “solidarity” with its fellow European broadcasters by playing the Liverpudlian band’s song, according to a spokeswoman for the corporation. The initiative came from Dutch radio presenter Sander Hoogendoorn of station 3FM. He said he was “very proud” that so many stations were going to take part, adding: “We all have to do what we can to beat this crisis. “Things like this just go beyond the boundaries of radio channels.” Hoogendoorn said the song – the anthem of Liverpool Football Club – “could speak to those doing an incredible job working in healthcare right now, those who are ill or those who can’t leave their house for a while”. The idea comes as the coronavirus devastates day-to-day activity across Europe. Italy, now the epicentre of the pandemic in the continent, has been in extreme lockdown for weeks. On Thursday, its skyrocketing death toll passed China’s, to make Italy the country worst hit by COVID-19. In Britain, all schools will close by the end of the week and London’s public transport network is being restricted. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is considering a partial lockdown of the capital, which has nearly 1000 confirmed cases of the virus,and up to 10,000 military personnel have been placed on standby across Britain.

The office also added that Prince Albert is in constant contact with members of his cabinet, the government and his closest staff. The European Union’s chief negotiator for Brexit, Michel Barnier, also said on Thursday he had tested positive for coronavirus. Meanwhile Monaco cancelled its showcase Formula One Grand Prix, the most famous and glamorous race on the calendar, in another high-profile sporting casualty of the coronavirus epidemic on Thursday. F1 had earlier announced the race was postponed, along with the Dutch and Spanish races also scheduled for May, and also pushed back a major technical rules revamp from 2021 to 2022. But The Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM) said uncertainty about the teams’ participation and border controls, with neighbouring Italy in lockdown, made the situation ‘untenable’ and postponement was impossible. A popular race for historic race cars, which uses the same tight and twisty fenced streets and was scheduled for earlier in May, was also called off. “Under no circumstances will it be possible to organise these events later this year,” said the ACM. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was born in Monaco while Mercedes’ six-times world champion Lewis Hamilton and other drivers also live there. The announcement about Monaco, a highlight of the motorsport season scheduled for May 24, came as the Mediterranean principality revealed its ruler Prince Albert had tested positive for the virus.

It also asked Americans to have a travel plan that does not rely on the US government. “If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite time frame,” the advisory said. The move comes a day after the State Department said it was suspending all routine visa services as of Wednesday in most countries worldwide due to the virus, a move that will potentially impact hundreds of thousands of people. The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has now infected over 236,000 people and killed more than 9700, an epidemic that has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War II, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu. Normal life has come to a standstill pretty much across the globe with schools shut down, flights and industries halted, sports and arts events postponed and people are advised or at times forced by their governments to remain indoors to prevent the spread.

The milestone comes a day after Wuhan — the epicentre of the pandemic – recorded no new infections, illustrating how the outbreak has moved toward Europe and the United States. It’s also been less than a week since the Hubei province first reported no new cases of domestic coronavirus. China’s national health commission announced that the country had 34 new cases but all of them had recently come from overseas. The situation has eased to such an extent that some medical teams decided it was time to leave China because the outbreak had been subdued. The first medical assistance team, the Shaanxi National Emergency Medical Assistance Team, departed Wuhan for Shaanxi Province on Tuesday, with more following suit. More than 1000 medical and epidemic prevention workers have left Hubei to return home. An epidemiologist was quoted in the state-run paper China Daily as saying: “If no new case of the coronavirus has been reported for 14 consecutive days in Wuhan following the last reported case, we believe it will be the time when the lockdown can be gradually lifted.” “After the lockdown is loosened, we still need to strictly carry out routine measures to prevent and control the virus to prevent a possible rebound of the outbreak.” Italy also hit a milestone, but a rather grim one, becoming the world’s deadliest centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The Italian Civil Protection Agency announced the death toll from the virus has reached 3405, surpassing China for the largest number of COVID-19 deaths. Italy’s deaths increased by 427 on Thursday (local time), according to the World Health Organisation, representing a slight improvement on the day before when Italy recorded 475 deaths. Meanwhile, China has refocused its efforts on preventing the spread of infection by people returning from overseas. All travellers entering China from overseas – excluding pregnant woman and people aged under 14 and over 70 – will have to be placed under mandatory quarantine for two weeks, authorities recently announced. The fact the country is down to zero reported new locally transmitted cases highlights its success in controlling the spread of the virus despite persistent allegations that the initial outbreak was mishandled. That includes the coronavirus death of Dr Li Wenlian who was reprimanded by police for “spreading rumours” when he tried to raise the alarm about the disease. A new report issued by China’s top anti-corruption agency, the National Supervisory Commission, said a team sent to Wuhan looked into how he found out about the virus, how he had been summoned to a police station and how he was treated when ill. Their key recommendation, according to the report published by state broadcaster CCTV, was to say that Wuhan authorities needed to find the police who had reprimanded Mr Li and hold them responsible for not following correct procedures. It said the reprimand of Mr Li by police should be withdrawn. “Is that it?” said one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, where news of the report was the top-read topic, with more than 160 million views on Thursday evening. “It’s like they might as well have not said anything,” said another. Mr Li’s treatment by police prompted public calls for the Wuhan government to apologise, especially as the city’s authorities were accused of covering up the outbreak in its early days. Wuhan, a city of 11 million and the capital of central Hubei province, has been locked down since the Lunar New Year festival in mid-January, and remains the only city still designated as “high-risk” in the province and subject to strict travel bans. Prince Albert of Monaco has tested positive for coronavirus but his health is not a cause for concern, his office says. “Prince Albert is continuing to work from the office in his private apartments,” it said in a statement. The office also added that Prince Albert is in constant contact with members of his cabinet, the government and his closest staff. Queen Elizabeth later issued a statement acknowledging that “individuals and families across the United Kingdom, and around the world, are entering a period of great concern and uncertainty”. “We are all being advised to change our normal routines and regular patterns of life for the greater good of the communities we live in and, in particular, to protect the most vulnerable within them,” she said. “Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe.

Passengers aboard Costa Victoria have been told they will have to disembark in Venice on March 28 after many frustrating weeks “sailing aimlessly” at sea. Horrified relatives back home fear their loved ones have been issued a “death sentence” by being deposited in Italy and are begging for help to get them out as more countries close their borders. Family members say up to 240 Australians are on the vessel, with most of them aged over 65 and a number in frail condition in wheelchairs and needing oxygen respirators. They fear being stuck in Italy without access to medical treatment and unable to return to Australia with flights cancelled and many nations blocking flights from Italy. Italy has been in extreme lockdown in a bid to curb its skyrocketing death rate which claimed 427 more lives on Thursday (local time), the day after recording its highest single-day death toll of 475 on Wednesday. Italy has lost 3405 people to coronavirus, overtaking the death toll in China which is at 3249. Italy’s elderly population, high smoking rate and affectionate greetings on the cheek are among the reasons attributed to its alarming fatalities. Gold Coast passengers Joanne Martin-Blakey and husband Iain said frustrated cruise guests were floating in limbo with no-one offering assistance. “H.E.L.P. We are now stuck on this ship (Costa Victoria) until we reach Italy. What country is going to accept us after being in Italy?” Mrs Martin-Blakey posted online. “Emirates have cancelled our return flight back from Venice and offered no alternative. Australia is about to close its borders and we can’t get home and we have no knowledge of what will happen to us when we get to Italy. “We are being forced into the epicentre of covid-19, and we are all healthy on this ship but are now being put at risk.” Sydney woman Lauren Petrovic said she feared for her mother-in-law  Susan Morgan and sister in law Jackie Morgan on the ship. “This obviously is a death sentence if they are to be let off here (Italy) without assistance or any avenue to safely come home to Australia,” she wrote on Facebook in a plea for help. “They will be potentially left to die. “People are revolting and frustrated, fighting amongst each other and just want to go home but no one is helping and it seems like the Australian government have no idea they are even on the ship.

But less than five days into the trip, things went pear-shaped as countries started closing their borders due to coronavirus and the ship was turned away from several ports in Israel, Jordan, Greece, the UAE, Croatia and the Maldives, she said. Unable to dock and take day cruises, the passengers were offered credit to spend on board but have been becoming increasingly agitated at the enforced isolation. They are due to arrive in Venice on March 28 for disembarkation, the captain told guests on Tuesday. “Please consider that the current situation we are all facing is something totally unexpected we cannot control and was not foreseeable in advance,” a letter from Costa Cruises states. “Given the delicate situation worldwide the health of our guests and crew is something we cannot compromise and trade.”  Ms Martin-Blakey called on people in authority to help get the Australians home. “I want to ensure that Mum and Dad are going to be able to get home within the timeframe.” Meanwhile an unprecedented ban on all foreign travellers entering Australia will come into effect on Friday night. All non-citizens and non-residents will not be allowed into the country from 9pm on Friday. Australians and their direct family members will still be allowed in but must self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering the country. Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong says there are more than one million Australians overseas who need more information. “The government needs a plan to help Australians stranded overseas amid flight cancellations, changing travel advice and closing borders,” she said. The Morrison government will on Friday discuss a second stimulus package to cushion the economic blow caused by the pandemic and finalise further advice for the ban on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. This guidance will give more clarity to cinemas, theatres, hospitality venues and those organising weddings and funerals. Social distancing guidelines for public transport will also be discussed, as will additional support for vulnerable Australians including indigenous communities and disability support recipients. Australia’s energy ministers will hold a teleconference on Friday to discuss stopping late fees for people unable to pay their bills because of the virus. The Reserve Bank on Thursday cut interest rates to a historic low of 0.25 per cent, while also providing extra support for banks to keep businesses alive.

Since COVID-19 hit Europe, France and Italy have closed all schools, and this week it was announced UK schools will close indefinitely on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile every weekday in Australia, about 3.9 million children – many of whom won’t know they are carrying the virus – gather at primary and secondary schools around the nation. Adding to the threat is a shortage of hand sanitiser and soap in schools due to panic-buying. At some schools, kids are being told to bring their own bar of soap. Despite the risk of children unwittingly infecting parents and teachers, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has insisted schools stay open, primarily due to the effect school closures will have on the medical workforce. Teachers, fearful for their safety, are now speaking up. Brendan Ricci, a teacher at Ringwood Secondary College in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, said teachers have been completely left out of the discussion about whether to close schools down. “Teachers are understandably very concerned for their health and nobody seems to want to talk about it,” Mr Ricci told The New Daily. “It makes us feel like we’re expendable, like we’re only there to babysit the children. “If you want us to be quarantine officers, at least have the decency to tell us what the plan is.” Mr Ricci added many teachers were frustrated by the federal government’s conflicting health advice, which has banned Australians from attending public gatherings of more than 100 people and ordered a standing distance of 1.5 metres apart to stop the virus’ spread. “Here we are with more contact with people than any [other] profession and we’re being told that’s OK, but it’s not OK for us to go to a function with 100 people for an hour,” he said. “I’ve got elderly parents and so does my wife. “When you keep reading about how many people are working from home now, you think, are we being put in the firing line? “It makes state school teachers feel like sacrificial lambs.” Mr Ricci said teachers were working hard to move classes online now so students wouldn’t be left too far behind when schools eventually close. Already, it’s getting harder for educators, especially in Victoria, to limit the spread of the virus in schools – even if they haven’t confirmed any student cases yet. That’s because the frenzy of shoppers hoarding essentials like toilet paper, soap, hand sanitiser and cleaning products has forced many Victorian schools to miss out. To combat this issue, the Victorian Education Department has arranged for more than 10,000 units of hand sanitiser to arrive this week. But education consultant Dr Catherine Scott said supplying hygiene products to children wouldn’t stop the virus from spreading. “Schools are aggregating devices for germs and children are disease vectors,” Dr Scott told The New Daily. “There is no way you can get them to wash their hands properly and not swap licks of their Paddle Pops. “If you’ve got one or two kids in your class with the virus, you can wash your hands until they bleed but there is nothing you can do to avoid catching it short of wearing a hazmat suit.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Your coronavirus questions answered: Everything you need to know","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/coronavirus-how-it-spreads\/","transcript":"Coronavirus is spreading – and so, too, the confusion. So The New Daily is running a series based on audience questions – to find the answers to everything you don’t know and everything you need to. On Thursday, we looked at travel and socialising. This is a rapidly changing situation and answers are current as of time of publishing on Friday morning. Associate professor Ian Mackay from the University of Queensland, who worked on diagnostics for the COVID-19 coronavirus, is answering your questions about how the virus works. Over to him. The latest research shows that after we’ve been infected, we develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2, just as we do for other viruses. We don’t know how long that will last, but we expect it to be for years as it is usual. Immunity means that even if we are immune and do get reinfected by that same virus, we aren’t likely to develop the same level of disease. We don’t exactly know but probably by droplets during spitting while we talk. Some viruses can be carried in exhaled breath; we just don’t yet know if that’s possible with SARS-CoV-2. We recently learned that SARS-CoV-2 could remain infectious in lab-generated aerosols for at least three hours, slowly decaying over time. That means the possibility exists for infection via an airborne route, but we are still missing some useful and essential bits of information. How much infectious virus comes from an infected human (not a lab)?  When, if at all, is an infected person most likely to spread virus this way? If we can be infected this way, how long would a susceptible person have to be breathing in an infectious aerosol to get a big enough dose for infection to result? It makes sense that if this happens at all, it’s more likely to be from a person with symptoms. COVID-19 is the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus which causes the signs and symptoms we lump together under the name COVID-19. Nothing suggests that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by temperature changes. We know that at room temperature (21C to 23C and 40 per cent relative humidity), out of the sun on hard, shiny surfaces, the virus can remain infectious for 48-72 hours. If we lived and spent lots of time outdoors, it might make sense that we would transmit less virus. The reality is that we often live and gather indoors, often in climate-controlled spaces with lots of shiny and shared surfaces, regardless of where we are in the world. We have also seen in past influenza pandemics that if a virus looks different enough to our immune system, it can overcome the usual seasonal constraints and transmit well among a population with no immunity during any season. We don’t know for this virus in particular, but other coronaviruses can remain infectious in wastewater and tap water for days to weeks depending on temperature and content. However, the virus should be inactivated by normal water treatment processes before it comes out of the tap. Yes. A swab can still be used to detect the presence of virus genetic material, before the person shows any symptoms of COVID-19, or even if they don’t show symptoms. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 (“live virus”) has also been isolated in rare instances from such cases. We don’t know for sure, but we do know that other respiratory viruses don’t seem to remain infectious for as long on cloth as they do on hard, shiny surfaces. The risk of infection would be higher if someone coughed up a glob of mucous onto someone else’s clothing. We don’t know for sure. We think the most likely routes are close contact with infectious fluids; touching our respiratory mucous membranes (mouth, eye, nose) after touching droplet – or fluid-contaminated surfaces; perhaps after inhaling short-range aerosols of suitable dose produced by coughing, sneezing or spitting. There is no evidence of any difference among the viruses in terms of more or less severity of better or worse transmission. There are some genetic groupings among the variants detected from all over the world – think of this as the subtle differences among human populations in different parts of the world; accents, clothing, home, favourite foods, but we still have arms, we walk and we eat. At this stage, there is nothing more to these genetic groupings that ongoing but geographically distinct virus evolutionary fine-tuning. This might happen. As people get infected, they become immune, and this starts to create transmission holes, a bit like firebreaks, in which the virus will be trapped and unable to move on. If there’s enough immunity, the transmission may stop in places and continue in others. This is may happen in different ways and to varying extents in different regions of the world. Because of the nature of the virus and how widespread it is, it’s not likely to completely disappear. It will keep spreading as other viruses do but perhaps at lower numbers, as immune people increase and susceptible (non-immune) people decrease in number. But if we can break transmission by increasing the physical distance between each other, we can create more firebreaks and slow the spread. We are too interconnected to stop the spread permanently. Sunlight can degrade any virus. Generally, respiratory viruses in those with milder illnesses stop shedding more quickly than those from people who had more severe disease – less than two weeks versus four to five weeks. It can take days up to six weeks for COVID-19 to run its course. Virus genetic material (which may or may not represent infectious virus) can be detected up until death in those who don’t survive. Long-term detection of virus genetic material is mostly from swabs from the respiratory tract and faeces samples. The infectious period is an area that needs more work."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus myths and half-truths: Ibuprofen and blood types","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/03\/19\/coronavirus-ibuprofen-blood-types\/","transcript":"There are two confusing health claims that have entered the coronavirus fray in the past 72 hours. One surrounds ibuprofen, with some articles, studies and medical bodies advising people who have tested positive to COVID-19 to not take the drug – instead opt for paracetamol – because the former could worsen the effects of the virus. The World Health Organisation added more confusion on Thursday, posting via social media that it “does not recommend against” the use of ibuprofen, and that it was not aware of any negative effects beyond those already acknowledged. That’s the latest advice, but it’s vastly at odds with the information that was making headlines just 24 hours prior. Here’s how it played out: Some doctors in France observed that patients who were being admitted to intensive care units, diagnosed with COVID-19 and had been taking medication like ibuprofen were displaying heightened symptoms. The country’s health minister then went on to publicly recommend people take paracetamol for fever, rather than ibuprofen. The advice is because of the data that links the latter drug and respiratory problems, said Professor Paul Little, Professor of Primary Care Research of the University of Southampton in the UK. “The finding in two randomised trials that advise to use ibuprofen results in more severe illness or complications helps confirm that the association seen in the observational studies is indeed likely to be causal,” Professor Little said. “Advice to use paracetamol is also less likely to result in complications.” Q: Could #ibuprofen worsen disease for people with #COVID19? A: Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of of ibuprofen. pic.twitter.com\/n39DFt2amF — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 18, 2020 The WHO on Thursday, in its social posts, said it was consulting with physicians to try and discern the risks – if any – of people with the coronavirus taking ibuprofen. This was backed up by the European Medicines Agency, which released a statement, saying, “There is currently no scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19”. Confusing, right? So what do you do if you have (or suspect you have) the coronavirus? Consider both paracetamol and ibuprofen medication, and make a judgment based on their individual benefits and risks, the European association says. If in doubt, consult a health professional. What’s the claim? A study out of China says its results showed people sporting blood type A could be more vulnerable to the coronavirus than others. Researchers studied more than 2000 COVID-19 patients and found that there was a higher representation of that blood group who had contracted the virus, versus the country’s overall population of type A residents. So that’s 41 per cent of patients with type A blood in Wuhan and Shenzhen, versus 32 per cent of the population with the blood group. Type As were also more likely to experience more severe symptoms. On the other end of the scale, the type O blood group, which makes up 34 per cent of the country’s population, only represented a quarter of those confirmed cases that were studied. What does this all mean? At this stage, it’s just an interesting observation and shouldn’t be taken (by the general public) any more seriously than that. It is research in its absolute infancy, and needs to be peer-reviewed, then tested several more times against several more populations. Don’t believe everything you read on the internet, and definitely don’t adjust your behaviours even if you do think, Hey that kind of rings true. The best way to protect yourself and others during this pandemic is what we’re repeatedly told. Practise social distancing, self-isolating if you have to, wash your hands, and look after each other."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: How Australians can support local businesses","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/03\/19\/coronavirus-small-business-support\/","transcript":"The coronavirus outbreak has placed Australia’s vital small business sector under immense strain, but customers can still support their local businesses even through isolation. Small businesses employ 44 per cent of Australia’s workforce and contribute just over a third of the nation’s GDP. But small business owners typically earn much less than the average wage, according to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO), with more than half earning less than $25,000 a year. And as Australians increasingly choose to self-isolate to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, these businesses have been hit hard and could face closure.  “Small businesses, and businesses generally, are feeling incredibly worried,” ASBFEO ombudsman Kate Carnell told The New Daily. “Remember these small businesses rely on the income from their business to feed their families and pay their mortgages.” What they need most is customers. Here are some of the ways Australians can throw a lifeline to their favourite businesses. The popularity of online shopping has exploded in recent years, but buying from online stores headquartered overseas will do little to help Australia’s brick-and-mortar stores. Peter Strong, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, told The New Daily customers should instead try to buy goods from local retailers. Although this might be more expensive in some cases, Mr Strong noted most customers have the skills to spot a ripoff and avoid it in favour of more reasonable prices at other local businesses. “Plus you shouldn’t buy from Amazon because it will be stuck overseas on a plane somewhere anyway,” he added. One of the biggest challenges facing small businesses is the decline in foot traffic as Australians self-isolate to preserve their health. But in the age of the internet, being cooped up in the house doesn’t mean you can’t have a restaurant-quality meal. Mr Strong said consumers should consider ordering online the things they normally buy from their local shops to be dropped off at their door. Already, he said, businesses that previously didn’t offer delivery are rushing to do so to make sure customers don’t miss out. “I’ve even heard of a bookstore that’s launched a book-mobile,” he said. “You order the book you want on their website and they come and deliver it to you.” Traditionally seen as a last minute or impersonal present, the humble gift card can also play a big role in keeping small businesses afloat. Ms Carnell said these are a “great” way to support businesses that consumers can’t visit during the coming months. “They give the businesses the money now,” she said. “And when the business is back up and running, you or whoever you bought it for will be able to get the stock.” Buying gift cards will help businesses maintain their cash flow if customer numbers fall. Gift cards and product deliveries are great, but Ms Carnell said the best thing customers can do for businesses right now is to keep frequenting them. “Don’t put it off. Think about the restaurants, the cafes, art galleries and all the little things that improve our quality of life and make our local area a great place to live,” she said. “If we want those businesses to be there once we come through the other side, the only way they will be there is if we use them.” Naturally consumers can’t shoulder the burden of supporting small businesses alone, and federal government has outlined a range of initiatives to help. These include increasing instant asset write-off thresholds and speeding up depreciation deduction processes. Businesses that were affected by the bushfires before the coronavirus pandemic can also access free financial counselling. And the Reserve Bank has announced new measures to help banks offer low-cost loans to small and medium-sized businesses."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Venice canals run clear as coronavirus lockdown leaves city free of tourists","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/19\/venice-canals-clear-coronavirus-tourists\/","transcript":"Residents of Venice say the abrupt reduction in the number of tourists coming to the city because of the coronavirus lockdown is seeing a positive impact, with the famous canals cleaner than they have been for years. Last year, the canals were swarming with tourists and revellers for the famous Carnival, but on February 23, authorities cancelled the festival amid coronavirus concerns. Italy is the world’s worst-hit country after China, with 35,713 cases and a death toll of 2978 due to the global pandemic. Since the Italian government announced a lockdown earlier this month banning all non-essential travel, silence and clean air replaced the loud noise of tourists overcrowding the narrow alleys of the lagoon city and the pollution caused by powerful engines of motorboats used by residents and workers. Venice has been struggling with a high volume of tourism in recent years and recently banned large cruise ships from docking in the canals, in an attempt to preserve the city’s infrastructure. But since the drastic reduction of water traffic and tourism, residents have observed the usually muddy canals run with bright, clearer water with swarms of fishes and the canal bottom clearly visible. “There are no boats, there is no traffic. Definitely, it is cleaner,” Venice resident Serguei Michtchenko said. However, while it may look nicer, the city’s mayor’s office told CNN that the improved water visibility does not mean the water quality improved. “It’s because there is less boat traffic, [which] usually brings sediment to the top of the water’s surface,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CNN air quality in the city has improved due to the lockdown. Several decades have passed since Venetians were used to swimming in the lagoon water, due to the intensified ferryboats and motorboats traffic in the canals and the increasing volume of commercial and tourist ships stopping at the Venice Passenger Terminal. The coronavirus shutdown is the latest problem the unique lagoon city had to deal with after it was hit by its worst flooding in 50 years in November. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Treasurer, PM ponder safety net for coronavirus job losses","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/19\/recession-treasurer-pm-ponder-safety-net-coronavirus-job-losses\/","transcript":"Australia’s borders could remain closed to non-citizens for six months or longer as the Morrison government prepares to unveil an unemployment payment for victims of a COVID-19 recession. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is preparing to announce the new welfare measures to provide a safety net for thousands of job losses that are now expected in the tourism industry. After announcing the nation was taking the unprecedented step of closing the nation’s borders to non-citizens on Thursday, effectively banning tourism, the government is bracing for big job losses. But it is preparing to announce new welfare payments for the thousands of families who will soon be forced to rely on welfare to survive. “Our plan is to ensure that over the next six months, or as long as it then takes, that we can effectively build a bridge to ensure that Australians, Australian businesses, those that are impacted, we can bring them across that bridge and get them to the other side,” Mr Morrison said. “Which is where on that side the economy is rebounding, Australians health has been rebounding and Australian life can go back to what it was. “As a result, there are a range of measures that we continue to put in place – Measures that address both the health issues, matters in our aged care, as I addressed earlier this week. “And importantly, there are measures that we have to put in place in relation to our economy.” Mr Morrison said he would shortly have more to say about how the government will “cushion the impact” for as many as possible. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg conceded that a recession would be “difficult to avoid”. “This is a massive hit to the Australian economy,” Mr Frydenberg said. “This is an external event, beyond our control. “The work that we have done to be able to get the budget back in shape to make these major announcements … that is what’s going to matter in the end, that is what is going to lead us to recovery.” He conceded the borders could remain closed and Qantas international flights grounded for months, after the airline stood down 20,000 staff on Thursday. “Again, we need to listen to the best possible medical advice,” Mr Frydenberg said. “The Prime Minister said this will go for six months or more and they won’t be lifted until it is safe to do so, until we are on the other side of this very, very challenging period. “The travel ban will last as long as the medical experts tell us that we need to prevent the spread of the virus, and one way to do that is through the steps we have announced today.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Keeping children safe from the coronavirus when they're going to school","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/03\/19\/coronavirus-school-safety\/","transcript":"Parents, take note. From now on (at least until the coronavirus pandemic is over), your child’s new best friend will sadly have to be the hand sanitiser. But it’s not them that need the ultimate protection against COVID-19. It’s their grandparents that they may be running up to hug after school or the chronically sick family friend you take them to see every so often. Their weakened immune system has made them a coronavirus target. Children can be carriers of the virus without them or their parents even knowing – and they may pass it on simply by them touching another human or standing in close proximity to them. Most vulnerable are the elderly and people with medical conditions. There’s a lot of parents upset about why kids should even be going to school and teachers are frustrated, too, telling The New Daily they’re being treated like expendable babysitters. But for now, it looks like classroom doors are staying open. The government is taking advice from medical professionals. General practitioner Muhammad Mohsin explained: “The only concern we have right now is that children can be spreaders of the disease if we don’t take proper precautions … because they can still host the virus within them without getting the illness, and that virus can be spread to everybody.” Most schools have been changing their practices (splitting up lunch time to have fewer kids mingling, for example). But there’s only so much a teacher can do, so parents would be wise to take matters into their own hands. Literally. Hand sanitiser should be in the school backpack every day. It can significantly reduce the risk of your child contracting the coronavirus and infecting another person. A bar of soap will do the trick, too. Teach your kids to rub it on before and after class so that their hands aren’t rife with contaminants that can cause or carry the coronavirus. That will stop them from potentially putting harmful contaminants on desks, chairs, pencil cases or just about anything they come into contact with. For all they know, it could be a poster stuck to a whiteboard that ends up infecting a teacher who was just taking it down but a student unknowingly carrying the virus touched it. After a child is done from class, it’s best they reapply the sanitiser to their hands because – like the example of the teacher – they may have touched something that was carrying the coronavirus. The virus can linger on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces for up to three days, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It’s even better if your child can apply sanitiser before and after switching between surfaces, such as from one desk to another because while their desk may be free from contaminants, the one they’re moving to may not be. Repeat that process if they’re borrowing something from another person, such as a pencil or book because it could also be a carrier of the coronavirus. And, much like the rest of us, they too should also sneeze or cough into their elbows, wash their hands for 20 seconds, and avoid shaking hands. Most importantly, teach your child to avoid touching their face, particularly their eyes, nose and mouth as – if they fail to heed the above advice – that can give the coronavirus an entry point. “If we take those precautions as much as we can, we can delay the process of transmission and … our hospitals and the health care system will be able to cope with the number of patients,” said Dr Mohsin, director of online doctor service, Prime Medic, and CEO of home doctor service, 13 CURE. If your child takes the bus to and from school, make sure they sanitise their hands before they hop on and after they hop off. Even if you drive them to school, they should do the same as there is a risk someone carrying the virus touched your vehicle while you had it parked in a public area. Also, try and have them avoid – where possible – being among large groups of students. Even if they’re just chatting to one other person, have them keep their distance – 1.5 metres where possible."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Chinese star Yunxiang Gao found not guilty of Sydney rape","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/03\/19\/yunxiang-gao-not-guilty-rape\/","transcript":"A Chinese movie star and producer can finally head home after being found not guilty of raping a woman inside a Sydney hotel room, ending their near two-year legal saga. There were emotional scenes and tears flowed inside the Downing Centre District Court after actor Yunxiang Gao and producer Jing Wang were cleared of all charges on Thursday. Mr Gao, who was once described as the “Chinese Hugh Jackman”, was acquitted of five counts of sexual assault and two counts of indecent assault related to the alleged attack in the early hours of March 27, 2018. Mr Wang was found not guilty of sexual intercourse without consent, five counts of sexual assault, two counts of indecent assault and two counts of attempted sexual assault. The pair are now free to travel home after two trials and having had their lives put on hold since they were arrested shortly after they were accused of assaulting the woman following the wrap party for a TV series. Mr Gao’s defence lawyer Warwick Korn said there was a sense of overwhelming relief and justice had been served after a two-year legal battle. “It was a very emotional courtroom. There were tears all around at the bar table and the jury,” Mr Korn said. “It was a very emotional ending to a very difficult two years.” Last December, a jury failed to reach a verdict on 10 counts, but found Mr Wang not guilty of one count of rape. But upon retrial, the jury accepted their version of events that all sexual acts were consensual. Mr Wang spent 22 months in custody but was released on bail after the first trial ended in a hung jury. “(Mr Gao) will head back to China when he can. We’re not sure when that will be,” Mr Korn said. “The DPP cancelled his criminal justice visa relatively quickly, so he’ll be making arrangements to get home as soon as he can. “It’s had a massive impact on his career and his future prospects. We’ll see what happens. It’s really difficult to predict this.” On the night of the alleged incident, Mr Gao, Mr Wang and the complainant were among a group of 30 people partying and drinking following the conclusion of filming of Love in Aranya, a series which starred Mr Gao. CCTV showed Mr Wang and the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, hugging and kissing inside a Sydney CBD karaoke bar. After a bus dropped a small group of people outside the luxury Shangri-La Hotel in The Rocks, the woman accompanied Mr Wang to his hotel room. The prosecution argued that when Mr Gao entered the room, the pair undressed her and sexually assaulted her despite her repeatedly saying “no”. It was alleged that after Mr Gao left the room, Mr Wang continued to sexually assault her. However, the jury took just over one day to deliberate and find them not guilty of all charges. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Queensland’s coronavirus cases rise 50 in one day, taking total to 144","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/19\/queensland-coronavirus-cases-rise-50\/","transcript":"Queensland has confirmed 50 new coronavirus cases across the state on Thursday, including patients in Townsville and Cairns, taking the state’s total to 144.

Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly announced the new measures on Thursday, warning they were designed purely to slow down the panic buying that is leaving chemists’ shelves empty of basic medicines. Customers will be restricted to buying a single box of paracetamol and a single Ventolin inhaler at a time. Pharmacists will also be required to limit dispensing of some prescription products to one month’s supply at the prescribed dose, while sales of certain over-the-counter medicines will be rationed to a maximum of one unit per purchase. Children’s Panadol will also be put behind counters to assist with compliance with the new rules. “Please do not buy more than you need for anything, whether that’s food and particularly medicines,” Dr Kelly said. “We have a very good system of knowing about medicine shortages in Australia, and in fact it is incumbent on all medicine suppliers that they must tell us if there is a shortage now or shortly into the future. “We have not had that from any suppliers. “It seems local supply shortages have happened in particular pharmacies. “For that reason we’ve been working closely today with the Pharmaceutical Guild and the PSA to make sure that that matter is dealt with. “So we have today worked through with pharmacists that they will be required to limit dispensing of certain prescription products,” Children’s Panadol has been flying off the shelves since the coronavirus outbreak. Some mothers have been left in tears after being unable to find medicine for children with fevers. “Pharmacists, in addition, will be required to place children’s paracetamol formulations, the syrup and the like, behind the counter to assist in allocating supply,” Dr Kelly said. In a statement, the Therapeutic Goods Administration said there was no shortage of medicines. The problem was families hoarding over-the-counter medicines, including Panadol. As a result, the items were being purchased faster than chemists could replace them. Earlier, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said police were now investigating whether criminal gangs were raiding supermarkets to profiteer from the crisis. “We will come down like a ton of bricks on those individuals because I think they’re the ones that have created this pattern of behaviour of hoarding and clearing out shelves,” he told 2GB radio on Thursday. “I’m going to come after those people and I’ll give them a fair warning now – it won’t be a pretty experience when we deal with them,” he said. Mr Dutton said hoarders were leaving the shelves bare when seniors wanted to buy basics. “You force us into a position where you need to ration the purchasing arrangements or ration store hours, which I don’t want to do because I think it sends a bad message,” Mr Dutton said. “But we need to get under control the actions of some people at the moment that remain completely unacceptable.” Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said there was a stupidity problem rather than a lack of supermarket items. “They need to take a deep breath, have a cold shower and understand that if they shop normally, then the shelves will be stocked normally,” Mr Littleproud said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"CommBank first to move after RBA's emergency interest rate cut","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/reserve-bank-emergency-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Commonwealth Bank has moved quickly following the Reserve Bank’s emergency interest rate cut on Thursday, cutting rates on some of its home loans by 0.7 per cent. The country’s biggest mortgage lender followed – and bettered – the RBA’s cut within an hour of its announcement. “These are unprecedented times, and they call for unprecedented measures,” Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn said. The Reserve Bank slashed interest rates to a new record low of 0.25 per cent and said it would start quantitative easing (QE) for the first time in history. The historic rate cut marked the first time the central bank has cut rates outside its ordinary monthly meeting since 1997. At the same time as the RBA made its 2.30pm announcement, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the federal government would pour $15 billion into smaller lenders. “The government’s actions will enable customers of smaller lenders to continue to access affordable credit as the world deals with the significant challenges presented by the spread of coronavirus,” he said. “Small lenders are critical to Australia’s lending markets, often driving innovation and providing competition for larger lenders.” The spread of the coronavirus in Australia and across the world has cemented the likelihood the national economy will fall into recession this year, as consumer spending and productivity slumps. Dr Lowe said the RBA had chosen to cut rates and purchase government bonds to support jobs and incomes “so that when the health crisis recedes, the country is well placed to recover strongly”. He said while the coronavirus was, first and foremost, a public health issue, it was having a “very major impact” on the economy and financial system. “As the virus has spread, countries have restricted the movement of people across borders and have implemented social distancing measures, including restricting movements within countries and within cities,” Dr Lowe said. “The result has been major disruptions to economic activity across the world. “This is likely to remain the case for some time yet as efforts continue to contain the virus.” The central bank will buy as many government bonds as necessary to bring down the yield on three-year government bonds to 0.25 per cent – driving down borrowing costs for business and government. And Dr Lowe said the central bank wouldn’t increase interest rates until progress had been made towards an unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent and inflation had risen to its target band of 2 to 3 per cent a year. In addition to maintaining low interest rates and starting QE on Friday, the central bank said it would increase its repo operations and set up a funding facility for banks to supply $90 billion worth of cheap credit to affected small and medium-sized businesses. The RBA’s move came after central banks around the world unveiled huge stimulus packages to stabilise financial markets and limit the economic impacts of the coronavirus. The European Central Bank has said it will buy $1.46 trillion worth of government and company debt across the eurozone, and the US Federal Reserve announced a similar package worth $1.25 trillion on Sunday. By starting QE, the RBA hopes to stabilise the financial system and encourage banks to keep lending to businesses and home buyers as the country enters a major economic downturn. Ratings agency S&P Global has said the world is already in recession, and ANZ is tipping Australia’s unemployment rate to reach 7.8 per cent by the end of the year."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Australia braces for sharp rise in unemployment","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/coronavirus-unemployment\/","transcript":"Australia is heading for a sharp rise in coronavirus-induced unemployment despite the rate dropping 0.2 per cent last month.

She encouraged people who will lose their jobs to find alternative employment as quickly as possible. Senator Cash said Qantas, which is temporarily standing down 20,000 employees because of coronavirus, had worked closely with the government about their plans. She said other employees should consider the possibility of being stood down. “As an employee – if you face losing your job versus being able to be stood down, utilise your leave requirements, bring forward your long service leave if you’re able to,” the minister said. “And maintain that connectivity with your employer, knowing that you will have a job at the end of this.” The Reserve Bank is attempting to soften the expected downturn by cutting rates to a record low of 0.25 per cent. It is also buying government bonds, in an effort to bring down their yield to 0.25 per cent. A NAB market research note said unemployment should start to rise sharply from March. “With how far it rises shaped by the economic cost of necessary health measures to mitigate the impact of the virus on the health system,” NAB’s economy watch note said. “More recent anecdotes suggest most firms have implemented hiring freezes and job losses are being reported in the hospitality and tourism industries.” Labor’s employment spokesman Brendan O’Connor says the government’s next stimulus package should include help for casual employees, labour hire workers, gig workers and sole traders. “It seems absolutely critical that the government gets this right because whilst as I say we welcome the unemployment figures today, there is no doubt we’re going to see many, many potential job losses over the course of the next weeks, months, and possibly beyond that,” he told reporters in Melbourne. Mr O’Connor has written to Senator Cash calling for a halt to physical meetings between jobseekers and Centrelink staff as well as job service providers, which must occur in order to receive some payments. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Australia closes its borders to all non-residents","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/australia-borders-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Australia will close its borders to all non-citizens from 9pm on Friday in an unprecedented move to protect the nation from the deadly coronavirus. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the decision shortly before 4pm on Thursday. Mr Morrison said the majority of new coronavirus cases in Australia were still coming from travellers returning from overseas. Closing the borders was designed to stop potential coronavirus sufferers from entering Australia. “We will be resolving to move to a position where a travel ban will be placed on all non-residents, non-Australian citizens coming to Australia, and that will be in place from 9pm tomorrow evening,” Mr Morrison said. “We have already seen a significant reduction in the travel to Australia by non-citizens in residence. “It is about one-third of what it would normally be at this time of the year.” That number had reduced even in the past week, following the requirement for 14 days self-isolation on arrival in Australia. “We believe it is essential to take a further step to ensure we are now no longer allowing anyone, unless they are a citizen or resident or direct family member, as is applied to all the other travel bans put in place previously,” Mr Morrison said. The dramatic action came as Tasmania also announced it would force anyone who arrived in the island state to undergo mandatory self-isolation for 14 days. Mr Morrison said he had spoken to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern about the move. New Zealand made a similar announcement on Thursday. “These arrangements will enable, over the next 24 hours or so, for people to make other arrangements if they were intending to come to Australia,” he said. Australians returning home from overseas will still be able to enter the country. “They will be subject to 14 days of isolation upon arrival back in Australia,” he said. He said Qantas had offered to help assist Australians get home. “We will be working closely with them, and those Australians who are overseas, we have been encouraging them to return to Australia,” Mr Morrison said. The federal government’s announcement came as the number of coronavirus cases in NSW jumped above 300, with close to 50 cases believed to be locally transmitted. Among the new cases is a six-year-old, the youngest person to be diagnosed in NSW so far with the deadly virus. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said on Thursday there were 307 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, up from 267 on Wednesday. Of those, almost 130 were acquired overseas, including recent returnees from virus-hit areas in Europe, Britain and the US. A further 70 cases remain under investigation. The total number of cases nationwide on Thursday afternoon was 636. Of those, there have been six deaths and at least 43 have recovered. Dr Chant said the initial precautionary approach of hospitalising all confirmed COVID-19 cases in NSW had been abandoned as numbers rose. “It’s reassuring that many of our cases continue to be mild, with currently six patients in intensive care units. Many of our patients are being managed in the community and being managed at home and we are only admitting patients now that require hospital care,” she said. Meanwhile, in Victoria, 28 new coronavirus cases were confirmed overnight on Wednesday. That took the state’s tally to 149. The Victorian government said old hospital wards would be recommissioned to help handle patients stricken with the coronavirus. The measure is part of a $437 million funding boost announced by the Victorian government on Thursday. It will be used to open 129 new hospital beds in Victoria in the next 12 weeks and buy extra hospital equipment. Victoria expects an extra 45,000 emergency department presentations, 5000 more hospitals admissions and a further 2000 intensive care unit admissions when the COVID-19 pandemic hits its peak. Across the border in South Australia, two new hospitals will be set up in Adelaide to treat coronavirus patients. Premier Steven Marshall said the move will provide an extra 188 beds to manage the anticipated increase in the number of people needing hospitalisation. South Australia has had 37 coronavirus cases. That figure is expected to rise. Most of its cases have also been linked to overseas travel. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Decision to go ahead with AFL season was government's call: McGuire","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/afl-coronavirus-hunt\/","transcript":"Collingwood president Eddie McGuire says the AFL was talked out of delaying the start of its season by federal Health Minister Greg Hunt.

McGuire revealed AFL boss Gillon McLachlan and the commission had to be convinced during extended meetings on Wednesday. “It was maybe 12 hours of discussion throughout the course of the day and the competition was off for about 11-and-a-half of them,” McGuire told Triple M’s Hot Breakfast. “Greg Hunt and the head medical officer Brendan Murphy, they won the day for footy; they convinced the commission. “Gill, to his credit, was prosecuting the case not to play.

LISTEN HERE https:\/\/t.co\/AAPiA0ajTq@mmmhotbreakfast #afl #footy #AFL2020 — Seb Costello (@SebCostello9) March 18, 2020  The federal government has implemented a range of new measures to combat the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on all non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. Those measures could last up to six months, or more, which could lock fans out of attending games for the entire AFL season. But Mr Hunt said there were “no legal or health barriers” for the AFL to proceed in playing behind closed doors during the pandemic. “So long as you comply with the 500 mass gathering rule for public events and keep it under 100 in any individual room … then there was no barrier on the legal side,” he told Triple M. “Professor Murphy took them through the health side of it and they concluded there were no legal or health barriers.” “We knew the AFL was wrestling with the issue so myself offered to give the legal position and Professor Brendan Murphy to give the medical position and essentially Gill took it up”. “It’s now like community sport because the audiences aren’t there in person, but it will provide a huge boost to community morale. “My view is that this (going ahead with the AFL season) is an important step for the community. “At this stage, if we can have as much normality as possible – this is what the Prime Minister is seeking to do.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Brisbane detention centre worker tests positive for COVID-19","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/contractor-working-at-brisbane-detention-centre-tests-positive-for-covid-19\/","transcript":"A contractor working at a makeshift detention centre in Brisbane has tested positive to COVID-19, potentially exposing detainees to infection..

The airline will also delay its $201 million interim payout and freeze payments to its senior management and board will not be paid for the remainder of the financial year. The airline made the dramatic announcement early on Thursday morning – just two days after it had said it would slash 90 per cent of international seat capacity. “The efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus have led to a huge drop in travel demand, the likes of which we have never seen before. This is having a devastating impact on all airlines,” chief executive Alan Joyce said. He said the airline was in a strong financial position, but had a wages bill of more than $4 billion a year. “With the huge drop in revenue we’re facing, we have to make difficult decisions to guarantee the future of the national carrier,” he said. “The reality is we’ll have 150 aircraft on the ground and sadly there’s no work for most of our people. Rather than lose these highly skilled employees who we’ll need when this crisis passes, we are instead standing down two-thirds of our 30,000 employees until at least the end of May.” But the Transport Workers’ Union said the move was particularly galling given the federal government’s $715 million support package for the industry, announced on this week. TWU national secretary Michael Cain said the announcement was “remarkable”. “It is only 48 hours since the federal government, after having closed-door meetings with the CEOs of airlines, announced a $750 million relief package,” he said. “Where is the evidence of that relief package when what Qantas has done is effectively asked workers to give up their hard-earned leave and future leave to bail out this company?” Qantas workers will be asked to use annual and long-service leave during the stand down – during which 150 planes will be grounded. Grounded planes include all of the airline’s A380s, 747s and B787-9s and Jetstar’s B787-8s. The decision also applies to Jetstar and its international arms, which will halt all flights. The decision follows Wednesday’s announcement by the federal government recommending against all overseas travel from Australia. Qantas said staff will be allowed to access leave early or take it at half-pay. However, some workers would inevitably end up on unpaid leave. “We’re also talking to our partners like Woolworths about temporary job opportunities for our people,” Mr Joyce said. “This is a very hard set of circumstances for our people, as it is for lots of parts of the community right now.” As part of Thursday’s announcement, Qantas’s senior management and board will not be paid for the remainder of the financial year. Mr Joyce and board chairman Richard Goyder have already had their pay frozen. Qantas said its call centres were overloaded with people trying to change travel plans amid the COVID-19 outbreak. It said passengers should call only if they were due to travel in the next 48 hours. All other bookings will be converted to travel credits. Affected customers will be contacted directly from Monday."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"AOC mull extreme measures for Tokyo 2020 in face of pandemic","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/aoc-tokyo-olympics-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Australian Olympic Committee is looking at a range of extreme isolation options to protect athletes if the Tokyo Games go ahead in July. There is growing doubt whether Tokyo 2020 should, or will, start in four months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The AOC has put a range of questions to the International Olympic Committee after the global body attempted to provide fresh assurances overnight on Wednesday in a teleconference. But, on Thursday, the message from Australian team chef de mission Ian Chesterman to athletes was clear: Prepare for the Olympics to start as scheduled. It is easier said than done amid the current health crisis, which has prompted governments around the world to introduce life-changing measures to help curb the spread of the potentially deadly coronavirus. Mr Chesterman, who was part of the IOC teleconference, said Australia’s athletes wanted to compete at Tokyo and “if everyone’s planning for the Games then we must as well” “That’s our obligation to the athletes,” he said. Mr Chesterman said the AOC was talking with Australian sporting organisations about possible plans for the logistical nightmare of trying to ensure that every athlete arrived and departed Japan without catching the virus. “[That means] more base camps, longer base camps here in Australia before they depart for the Games,” Mr Chesterman said. “With a recognition they will be coronavirus free. “We’ll also look at longer base camp options in Japan … there won’t be one giant base camp in Australia before the Games. “Special charter flight arrangement potentially to take athletes into Tokyo and ensure the isolation period they’ve been taking is protected on the way to the Games. “We’ll continue to work with the best minds in Australian sport … some sports have well-established plans and it’ll just be a matter of extending those plans.” Australia’s chef de mission at London 2012, Nick Green, and many other athletes and officials around the world have questioned how the Games can go ahead in the current climate. Mr Chesterman and AOC chief executive Matt Carroll were pressed about this throughout Thursday’s announcement in Sydney, repeatedly insisting the IOC was taking advice from the World Health Organisation and would protect the health of everyone involved. “Think back to where this virus was a month ago,” Mr Carroll said. “Things have changed. Nobody is quite sure how things will pan out in four to six months. “They’re taking a measured approach. They’re getting the best possible advice they can possibly get. “At times it will shift … if things change then the IOC’s decisions will change.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Desperate Australians trapped in S America plead for emergency flight","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/australians-peru-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Hundreds of Australians trapped overseas have pleaded with the Prime Minister to get Qantas to evacuate tourists stranded in countries – including Peru and Chile – where international flights have been cancelled and travellers are confined to hotel rooms. A group of 100 Australians trapped in Peru and Chile have formed a WhatsApp group to share information as stories emerge of tourists being stopped from leaving some towns by military checkpoints and police. One traveller, who asked to be called Tom, revealed he and a group of trapped Australians had been stopped from leaving the country by military and police, despite official government advice for tourists to leave. “They wouldn’t let us get out. Every police checkpoint, it would take hours to get through,” he said. “It was pretty devastating to get all the way there and still be denied clearance to leave.” The Australian Embassy in Peru appeared to be struggling to deal with the demand for assistance. “It’s a very small team in Peru and they lack the capacity to deal with the onslaught of inquiries,” Tom told The New Daily. “A lot of the advice from DFAT officials is to stay put where you are. Now the reality is we are in a very isolated small town. But we have to think about where we are going to get extracted from – and that’s Lima. We have to find a strategy to get to Lima. “The Peruvian government have moved as fast as they can to close the borders. It hasn’t allowed time for anyone who is a foreign traveller to get out.” “We’re currently situated in Tacna, Peru, near the Chilean border.” Travellers said the Australian ambassador to Chile, Todd Mercer, had personally intervened, pleading with authorities to let Australians at the border out of the country. “I rang Todd probably with 10 minutes left before Chile closed borders. I said ‘I am calling the Australian ambassador’. I think they thought we were joking,” Tom said. “He was on the phone for 30 minutes trying to get us out, negotiate some sort of amnesty. “They wouldn’t let us leave the country. It’s just military officials following orders.” There are fears for tourists travelling by themselves and those in smaller groups. “There have been people kicked out of hostels. In some cases in Peru, people have been scared of selling foreigners food,” Tom said. “They are terrified of this virus … These are tiny towns, maybe 20,000 people, and there are police details stopping people travelling anywhere.” The stranded tourists want Prime Minister Scott Morrison to organise rescue flights out after Qantas moved on Thursday to ground international flights in the midst of a $700 million taxpayer-funded bailout. “If there’s going to be a bailout … we need a worldwide effort to bring Australians home,” Tom said. Another traveller, Dr Amy Neilsen, said Australians who wanted to go home could not get out. “The only updates I have at the moment are to stay. In Peru the president today (Wednesday) – as best I understand – expressed concern that too many people were on the streets yesterday and so today more people stopped by police to check they need to move about,” she said. Earlier this week, Mr Morrison urged all Australians overseas to return home as quickly as possible. He has also urged Australians not to travel overseas, announcing unprecedented restrictions on international flights to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “The travel advice to every Australian is ‘do not travel abroad’,” he said on Wednesday. “Do not go overseas – that is very clear, that instruction. For those who are thinking of going overseas in the school holidays: Don’t. Don’t go overseas.” Mr Morrison said Australia’s biggest risk from COVID-19, and the biggest incidences of cases, was from citizens and residents returning from overseas. “From many countries that you wouldn’t have expected to be a source – and so it is very important that Australians do not travel abroad at this time,” he said. “That is an indefinite ban but, as you are seeing from other countries around the world, they are putting similar restrictions on entry, just as Australia has on others coming into Australia. “You would expect that to be in place now and that is the stage we have reached. “"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Parents increasingly reject virus 'schools open' policy","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/schools-coronavirus\/","transcript":"There is growing anger among Australian parents about the official push to keep children at school during the widening coronavirus pandemic. Social media is heaving with comments from concerned parents angered by the insistence that, as a growing number of people self-isolate and work remotely, children must still attend classes. In Queensland, parents have accused the education department of heavy-handed threats to force kids to go to school. One regional primary school student who has serious, long-standing health problems was told he must provide proof of illness for being absent during the crisis. A second Queensland mum was told that fear of COVID-19 infection was not a valid excuse for her healthy child’s absence. She was also told her child would fail a missed exam unless proof of illness was produced. In a third case, a mum who told her Brisbane school that her kids were away because she was scared they would catch the coronavirus on the bus was told that position was unjustified. “Please be aware that as the school has not been closed the students will require a medical certificate if absent for more than three days,” the school said in a text. “Or absences will be classed as unjustified as per Dept of Education directions.” It’s similar in Western Australia, where Secondary School Executives Association president Armando Giglia said the absentee rate at the state’s high schools was about 15 to 20 per cent, double the usual rate. “The advice from the chief health officer is to stay at school but some people are not doing that,” Mr Giglia said. “It’s unprecedented stuff.” He said parents were confused by mixed messages. Part of that confusion is a growing community disquiet that the business-as-usual approach doesn’t reflect reality on the ground. There have been claims that some state schools do not have adequate soap supplies for dispensers in toilets. In addition, private schools are rapidly gearing up for mass online learning or have closed for the holidays, while universities are also moving to online lessons. Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller has repeatedly called for a staged reduction in attendance, saying schools will close anyway if students fall ill. But the governments across Australia insist schools should continue for as long as possible, arguing parents – including healthcare workers – need to remain at their jobs. Mr Giglia said that commentary had upset some teachers, who felt they were being treated as babysitters. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison cautioned against closing government schools, warning it might be some time before they could re-open. “What you do, you’ve got to keep doing for the next six months,” Mr Morrison told Sky News. “Shut them down, they won’t open again. And that means your children will miss what is effectively a whole year of their education. “Now if there’s not a good health reason to do that and risk the child’s education or cause them rather significant economic cost … you should keep the schools open.” This week, Mr Morrison and Education Minister Dan Tehan wrote to Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fischer, asking him to ensure Catholic schools remained open. But many parents are defying the official advice and keeping their kids at home. The mother of the ill Queensland student said her school’s principal seemed “embarrassed” when he handed her education department advice demanding she produce medical evidence to explain her son’s absence after the coronavirus surfaced in their area. “He was actually quite sheepish, embarrassed,” she said. “Every family that’s making decisions about what is right for their children is now going to be asked for medical evidence, or they’ll be marked as an unauthorised absence.” “It’s just heavy handed, that’s what it is. Bring it on Education Queensland, if you want to query me about why my kid’s not at school.” On the NSW Central Coast, mother of two Sunshine Wood has kept her two children home since Monday. There have been two unrelated cases of COVID-19 in her area. For her family, the stakes are higher than most. Mrs Wood’s son Israel has heart disease, an intellectual disability and Down Syndrome, which makes him more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. On Wednesday, Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy tried to explain why shutting down schools – and society – was not on the cards. “A short-term, two- to four-week shut down of society is not recommended by any of our experts. It does not achieve anything. We have to be in this for the long haul,” he said. He said some localised school closures might be necessary in areas with big coronavirus outbreaks, and schools were taking measures to reduce “potential transmissions”. That has included cancelling whole-of-school assemblies, camps and sports events, and imposing social distancing. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"New Zealand passes historic law to decriminalise abortion","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/19\/new-zealand-decriminalise-abortion\/","transcript":"New Zealand has passed a landmark bill that treats abortion as a health issue rather than a crime, a major reform in laws that have been unchanged for more than four decades. The reform passed through parliament late on Wednesday by a vote of 68 to 51. The legislation modernises abortion laws in place since 1977 and proposes that a woman should have access to abortion until 20 weeks of pregnancy, with advice from her doctor. After 20 weeks, a pregnant woman would require a test and two doctors will have to agree an abortion is the right decision. These conditions for post-20 week pregnancy were tougher than the government’s original proposal. Under the old law abortion was an offence in New Zealand, and a woman could only legally get an abortion if two doctors certified that continuing the pregnancy would result in danger to her mental or physical health. “For over forty years abortion has been the only medical procedure considered a crime in New Zealand. But from now abortions will be rightly treated as a health issue,” Minister of Justice Andrew Little said in a statement after the law was passed. The passing of the bill is seen as a win for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s centre-left coalition party, ahead of a general election in September. Decriminalising abortion was one of Ms Ardern’s campaign promises when she was elected in 2017 but plans to change the laws were delayed as lawmakers argued over the bill. New Zealand is the latest country to liberalise abortion laws. South Korea’s high court overturned a ban on abortion in April, while Ireland legalised abortion in a referendum. However, in the United States some conservative-leaning states have taken action to curb abortion rights. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cruise ship docks in Melbourne after being turned away from NZ","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/golden-princess-melbourne-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A cruise ship has docked at Melbourne and passengers are being kept on board the same week a ban was put in place to battle coronavirus. The Golden Princess arrived at Port Melbourne on Thursday morning after earlier being turned away from New Zealand. Passengers have told media they are not allowed to leave the ship. While in New Zealand, the ship had one suspected coronavirus case and three other passengers in quarantine. The tests for all came back negative, but the ship was still refused docking at New Zealand ports. By mid-afternoon (Melbourne time), passengers had still not been allowed to disembark the ship. Victorian health officials were conducting on-boarding screenings after reports several passengers felt unwell. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a ban on cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving in Australia after an initial 30 days “and that will go forward on a voluntary basis”. All Australians arriving from overseas must also self isolate for 14 days. Princess Cruises and the Victorian Department of Health have been contacted for comment. Overnight Victoria confirmed 28 new coronavirus cases, taking the state’s tally to 149, Premier Daniel Andrews said. Mr Andrews has been under pressure from the state opposition to roll out an economic stimulus package since the federal government and other states announced their own. But he said it was moving beyond time for payments and other measures aimed at encouraging people to spend and keep the economy moving. Instead, the Victorian government was working on a package that would help people and businesses “fundamentally survive”. However, on Thursday the Andrews government announced a $437 million health funding boost to fight the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s exactly what’s needed – more staff, more beds, more equipment – so we can do more for those who are sick,” Mr Andrews said. He said new medical spaces would be opened to deal with the number of anticipated coronavirus cases anticipated. Baxter House at Geelong, which used to be a private hospital, will open as a COVID-19 clinic and the old Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre will open 84 beds for high-care patients. Mr Andrews said an additional 45 beds would be opened at Bendigo Hospital. Thursday’s package is on top of the extra $100 million announced earlier this week to free up the elective surgery list. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Tasmania to enforce 'toughest border measures in the country'","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/tasmania-coronavirus-borders\/","transcript":"All non-essential travellers arriving in Tasmania will have to go into a fortnight’s quarantine under coronavirus border measures dubbed the toughest in the country. Premier Peter Gutwein announced the changes on Thursday morning, declaring a state of emergency in the island state. They will apply from midnight on Friday to all “non-essential” travellers into the state. Health care workers, emergency workers, defence personnel, air and ship crew, specialists, and essential freight personnel will be excluded from the quarantine measures. “We know that for some it will create disruption, but our aim is to ensure that we protect the health, wellbeing and safety of Tasmanians,” Mr Gutwein said. All passengers will be screened on arrival and must demonstrate they meet the essential traveller criteria. Everyone arriving in the state is already being asked to fill out a special card so the government can keep track of them. People in quarantine will be monitored to ensure they comply. Anyone who breaches the new laws faces a fine of up to $16,800. The measure includes Tasmanians who are returning home. “We expect people to abide by the law. There can be no excuse for not self-quarantining, for not abiding by the rules,” Mr Gutwein said. “Tasmanians expect their government to take the necessary steps … Today we take that next step to ensure that we provide the toughest border measures in the country.” Mr Gutwein said he “made no apologies” for the new restrictions. “I want to be clear to all Tasmanians, we are not going to shut the borders to those supplies that we need,” he said. “Our ships will continue to run, the TT Line [operator of the Spirit of Tasmania between Melbourne and Devonport], will have, I expect, more opportunity to carry more freight into the state as a result of the fact that there will be, I expect, less people travelling.” He said the restriction might not automatically apply for people travelling for medical treatment. Three new virus cases were confirmed in Tasmania on Wednesday night. The state has 10 COVID-19 cases, but – as yet – no evidence of local transmission. Mr Gutwein also flagged moves to treat Tasmanian coronavirus patients in hotels. “Obviously, there are a lot of vacant hotel rooms at the moment,” he said. “We are engaged with the hotel section to ensure that we have adequate accommodation should we require it.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg working from home","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/zuckerberg-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is housebound just like many of the tech giant’s other employees.

The multi-billionaire said that he expects Facebook worker productivity to decline while they work remotely. Mr Zuckerberg made the comments during a call in which he announced that Facebook is launching the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center, a new module that will be featured at the top of users’ News Feeds with authoritative information from organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC. “We certainly want it to be global in the next 24 hours,” he said. The first countries the informational feature is scheduled to appear in are the US, the UK, Italy, France, Germany and Spain. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center will include real-time updates from national health authorities and global organisations, as well as articles, videos and posts about social distancing and preventing the spread of the virus, according to Facebook. Mr Zuckerberg told reporters he was “personally worried that isolation” resulting from the COVID-19 lockdowns in the US and many countries “could potentially lead to more depression and mental-health issues”.

Mr Littleproud is the latest politician to try to re-assure shoppers, as supermarket shelves continue to be stripped of basic products and outbursts of violence increase. On Tuesday, NSW Police arrested a 63-year-old man after a fracas over flour in a Lismore supermarket. They said the man rammed his trolley into two women in their 70s after realising his local Coles had run out of flour. A 45-year-old female store attendant was pinned against a shelf and punched in the face during the uproar. The store manager and a security guard were also allegedly attacked. It is the latest in a series of violent incidents in supermarkets across Australia since the coronavirus outbreak began to escalate – including a stabbing at Rosebud in Victoria and a man being tasered after a violent argument in Tamworth in NSW. On Thursday, NSW Police said they would increase patrols to try to quell the hysteria. “Police are making a concerted effort to ensure the security of shoppers and retail staff across the state amid concerns of panic buying due to COVID-19,” NSW police deputy commissioner Jeff Loy said. Supermarkets have restricted online deliveries, put on dedicated shopping hours for the elderly and disabled and imposed limits on a host of pantry staples. But to no avail. Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said the retail giant had “been asked to feed 50 million Australians and not 24.5 million Australians” in the past week – “and that is the big issue”. “It’s unequivocally true that it’s a demand surge,” Mr Banducci told ABC’s 7.30 on Wednesday night. “If everyone just bought what they needed, we would rapidly see a full shop again in ourselves and in all of our competitors.” Coles chief operating officer Matt Swindells said shops were geared up to put products on the shelf as quickly as possible. The company has employed more than 5000 extra casual staff. “There is lots and lots of stock in the system,” he told Nine’s Today Show on Thursday. “The suppliers are producing more than ever, faster than ever and  … we’re moving record volumes into our stores.” Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said supermarket staff had been abused by people looking to strip shelves of essential items or frustrated because items weren’t available. “It’s unfair and it’s unnecessary. There’s no supply problem here. There’s a selfishness problem,” she told ABC radio. Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued his own blunt message to people hoarding food on Wednesday. “Stop it. It’s not sensible, it’s not helpful and I’ve got to say it’s been one of the most disappointing things I’ve seen in Australian behaviour in response to this crisis,” he said. “That is not who we are as a people.” He was backed up by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and WA Premier Mark McGowan – Mr McGowan said the state’s police had increased patrols to put a stop to “jerks, drongos and bloody idiots”. On Thursday, the South Australian government said it would allow the state’s supermarkets to extend their opening hours to try to alleviate the panic shopping. The temporary trading times – 24 hours on weekdays and extended hours on weekends – will begin on March 21 and run until April 19. SA Treasurer Rob Lucas said the move provided much-needed flexibility for consumers and retailers. “While we don’t expect all supermarkets to take up the option of 24-hour trading, extended hours will also assist with supply of grocery stock,” Mr Lucas said. “We expect this exemption will also support local jobs, with the potential for more shifts for those employees who’d like to work additional hours over the next few weeks.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Qantas stands down 20,000 workers, grounds international flights","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/qantas-workers-international-flights\/","transcript":"Qantas is to stand down 20,000 workers and ground all of its international flights from the end of March as it struggles with the devastating fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The airline made the dramatic announcement early on Thursday morning – just two days after it had said it would slash 90 per cent of international seat capacity. “The efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus have led to a huge drop in travel demand, the likes of which we have never seen before. This is having a devastating impact on all airlines,” chief executive Alan Joyce said. He said the airline was in a strong financial position, but had a wages bill of more than $4 billion a year. “With the huge drop in revenue we’re facing, we have to make difficult decisions to guarantee the future of the national carrier,” he said. “The reality is we’ll have 150 aircraft on the ground and sadly there’s no work for most of our people. Rather than lose these highly skilled employees who we’ll need when this crisis passes, we are instead standing down two-thirds of our 30,000 employees until at least the end of May.” The move means the airline will ground 150 planes, including all of its A380s, 747s and B787-9s and Jetstar’s B787-8s. The decision also applies to Jetstar and its international arms, which will ground all flights. The decision follows Wednesday’s announcement by the federal government recommending against all overseas travel from Australia. Qantas workers will be able to use annual and long-service leave during the stand down, as well as leave at half pay. Staff who have little leave owing will be able to access up to four weeks’ leave in advance of earning it – although some staff will end up on leave without pay. “We’re also talking to our partners like Woolworths about temporary job opportunities for our people,” Mr Joyce said. “This is a very hard set of circumstances for our people, as it is for lots of parts of the community right now.” As part of Thursday’s announcement, Qantas’s senior management and board will not be paid for the remainder of the financial year. Mr Joyce and board chairman Richard Goyder have already had their pay frozen. Qantas said its call centres were overloaded with people trying to change travel plans amid the COVID-19 outbreak. It said passengers should call only if they were due to travel in the next 48 hours. All other bookings will be converted to travel credits. Affected customers will be contacted directly from Monday."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Volvo issues a worldwide recall due to automatic braking malfunction","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/19\/volvo-recall-braking-malfunction\/","transcript":"Volvo is recalling more than 736,000 vehicles worldwide because the automatic emergency braking system may not detect obstacles and stop the vehicles as designed.

The unprecedented measure comes as Donald Trump confirms the US-Canada border is closed to all non-essential traffic as part of the fight against COVID-19 which has now infected all 50 states. By Thursday morning (Australian time) nations overseas had confirmed they were making rules normally not seen outside wartime while in Australia a sixth death from the virus was confirmed. Among the latest strategies is a ban on children attending school in the UK. In the US, the president is deploying hospital ships to be docked near coronavirus hotspots. Mr Trump also announced that unnecessary travel to Canada is now banned as he reached an agreement with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Under the terms of the proposed deal, the flow of goods between the two countries – which share one of the world’s largest bilateral trading relationships – would continue. “We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected,” Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. At a White House press briefing on Thursday morning (Australian time), the US president – calling himself a “wartime” leader – further announced the introduction of a Korean War-era law which can force private American factories into making more medical supplies. For now, Mr Trump said, the Defense Production Act is aimed at getting companies to manufacture “millions” of face masks and “certain pieces of equipment” including ventilators. The EU’s ban on travellers from outside the bloc has left it scrambling to help the 80,000 citizens stuck outside Europe get home amid huge challenges, including finding flights. Many frontiers remain open to cross-border workers and trucks carrying critical goods like food and medicine but that has led to monumental traffic jams. To alleviate some of the pressure from eastern Europeans stuck in Austria and trying to return home, Hungary opened its borders in phases. Bulgarian citizens were first allowed to cross in carefully controlled convoys, then Romanians had a turn. Serbs were also allowed to pass through. But at one point early on the Austrian side, trucks were backed up for 28km and cars for 14km. Italy is the European country most affected by the coronavirus, but with 60 million people locked down, it still managed to record its largest single-day jump in cases. The Civil Protection Agency, responsible for tracking cases and deaths, revealed the number of infections rose by 4207 in just 24 hours. As of Friday, schools across Britain will close their doors, affecting almost nine million British children and forcing parents to stay home from work to look after them. Nurseries and colleges are also set to close until further notice after criticism that the government was being too slow to react to the spread of coronavirus. “I know the situation has become increasingly challenging. I said before that if the science and the advice changed such that keeping schools open would no longer be in the best interests of children and teachers that we would act,” Education minister Gavin Williamson told parliament. “We are now at that stage. The spike of the virus is increasing at a faster pace than anticipated.” The decision came after head-teachers were increasingly having to turn away pupils anyway because of staff shortages. All exams will be cancelled but the government will find a way to ensure students get their qualifications, Mr Williamson said. The Eurovision Song Contest, which was set to take place in the Netherlands in May, has been cancelled. The European Broadcasting Union’s decision to call off performances came as the total number of infected people around the world surpassed 207,000 with over 8200 deaths. The countries with the most confirmed cases were China, Italy, Iran, Spain and Germany. The Swiss-based EBU could not find ways around the restrictions put in place by participating broadcasters, leaving organisers “deeply disappointed” to take the decision which they expressed was the last resort. Still, they remained “very proud” of the contest which for 64 years has united people across Europe and were already in talks with its Dutch hosts to see whether the event can be staged in the Netherland city of Rotterdam next year. Last year alone, 182 million people tuned in to watch the song contest in Tel Aviv, Israel, according to the EBU. “We regret this situation very much, but I can promise you: the Eurovision Song Contest will come back stronger than ever,” the show’s executive supervisor, Jon Ola Sand, said in a statement. Mr Trump came under the fire by the World Health Organisation for repeatedly using the phrase “Chinese virus” to describe the coronavirus, most recently at the White House coronavirus press briefing on Thursday. Mr Trump said it was ‘not racist at all’, considering it “comes from China” and “I want to be accurate”. Executive director Mike Ryan said WHO has been clear since the beginning of the outbreak, “Viruses know no borders and they don’t care your ethnicity or the colour of your skin or how much money you have in the bank.” “The pandemic of influenza in 2009 originated in North America and we don’t call it the ‘North American flu,’ so it’s very important that we have the same approach when it comes to other viruses,” Dr Ryan said at a WHO press briefing on Thursday. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Your coronavirus questions answered: Everything you need to know","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/19\/coronavirus-rules-australia\/","transcript":"We asked you to send us your coronavirus questions. And you responded, en masse. In an indication of how much confusion and uncertainty is going around about the pandemic, in less than 24 hours, we were swamped with almost 1000 (very good) questions about COVID-19. Although we can’t answer every one, we looked at the trends to figure out where the most confusion lies and put them to the people at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic. This is a rapidly changing situation and answers are current as of time of publishing. To kick off the series, Monash University Professor of Medicine Paul Komesaroff, who directs the Centre for Ethics in Medicine and Society, is answering your questions about social distancing and travel. Over to him. If you only have a small number of employees it may be safe for them to continue to come to work, although to get there they may need to use public transport, walk through crowded streets etc, thereby incurring risk. If there is a possibility for them to spend at least some of their time working from home, this is definitely a safer and more desirable option and would probably benefit you in the long run. There is no reason why you should be at risk driving from Queensland or in Tasmania in your car. If you were taking your car on the ferry you would need to spend some hours in proximity with a large number of other people and this would inevitably incur some risk, although there have been no cases reported from exposure in such circumstances. During your holiday in Tasmania you would naturally take the usual precautions regarding hygiene and social distancing. Strictly, gatherings of 80 people are not actively discouraged in Australia yet. However, overseas much lower limits have been set. The events you describe undoubtedly would incur risk. If they are not absolutely essential it would be prudent to avoid them. There is no reason why you should not meet. But if you do so, you should observe some precautions. If someone is sick they should not attend. You should not shake hands or hug. You should wash your hands before lunch. You should try to maintain a one-metre distance. If someone coughs, they should cover their mouths. These procedures should not limit your enjoyment of the lunch, or of each other’s company. There will be more guidance on this coming out in the next few days and you should discuss the subject with OH&S or your employer. However,  frequent use of hand sanitiser is warranted. Your employer should provide you with a supply, which you can keep near you. If you can avoid travelling, you should do so. If you have to take a taxi it is recommended that you sit in the back seat and ask the driver to set the air-conditioning on ‘fresh’, instead of ‘recirculate’. Heat does kill the virus. It is spread primarily via droplets which are breathed in, rather than ingested, so there is little chance of infection via food. Having said that, usual hygiene precautions should be exercised in relation to food and utensils, especially if there are people with an infection in close proximity. It could be reasonably assumed that the production will not go ahead if the epidemic continues to develop and the restrictions associated with it continue to be expanded. While technically, meetings of 50 people are not yet banned, it would be reasonable to reconsider whether it is a good idea for your son to continue to attend these rehearsals. Singing and dancing in close contact is inadvisable. It would probably be best for you to approach the musical society and suggest that the event and the preparations for it be postponed until later in the year. If you can, avoid travelling to Japan. Perhaps consider delaying your trip for another time and taking your holiday within Australia. Closing down everything for a month will not stop the pandemic – and in any case, society still needs to function. We need to produce and distribute food, look after children and elderly people, and provide for all the goods and services on which we depend. Our objective at this time is to slow the rate of spread of the virus to a level where our health services can cope. It has been judged by health authorities that the prevalence of the virus in the community has not yet reached the stage where there is a need for schools to close, but we are fast reaching that point."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"As world fights coronavirus, Trump and China are waging war of words","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/19\/coronavirus-donald-trump-china\/","transcript":"An increasingly rancorous rivalry between the United States and China entered a new phase Wednesday as Beijing accused the Trump administration of starting a diplomatic clash that led it to expel almost all U.S. journalists from three newspapers. The Chinese government cast its expulsion of the journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post as necessary to defend Beijing against what it perceived as an ideological campaign by the United States to impose its values on China. Around a dozen reporters could be required to leave, in a move that Beijing said was reciprocation for the United States’ forcing out of about 60 Chinese reporters this month. “The United States cannot proceed from ideological prejudice, use its own standards and likes and dislikes to judge the media of other countries, let alone suppress the Chinese media unreasonably,” Geng Shuang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday. The expulsions, not seen to such an extent in recent history, point to the governing Communist Party’s growing resolve to strike back in all aspects of what is quickly becoming a bare-knuckled competition with the United States. Over the past year, tensions have escalated over issues ranging from trade deficits to technological capacity and military dominance, with bruising effect on U.S. and Chinese companies, business executives, and even university students and academics. The dispute over media access underlines how this new era of great power rivalry has extended into the marketplace of ideas. It not only signals a more muscular approach to foreign policy in China but also accords with the party’s tightening grip over information under Xi Jinping, the country’s authoritarian leader. The expulsions “will definitely have a big influence” on relations between the two countries, said Zhan Jiang, a retired journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University. “We’ve never really seen anything like this in the past 40 years. This shows the relations between the two sides have fallen into a deadlock, with neither side retreating.” Under Xi, the news media has come under an increasingly tight grip, and foreign reporters who displease the authorities have been punished with visa denials. In recent weeks, as the coronavirus spread through China, the government has cracked down on domestic and foreign reporting, muzzling medical professionals and censoring and removing reports and commentaries online that have challenged the official narrative. LIVE: Press Briefing with Coronavirus Task Force https:\/\/t.co\/3WQV4egsWc — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 18, 2020 On Tuesday, China went even further, requiring all U.S. journalists for the three newspapers whose credentials expire by the end of the year to turn in their press cards within 10 days. It said they would not be allowed to continue working as journalists in China. In an unusual move, it said the Americans were also forbidden from working as journalists in Macao or Hong Kong, two semiautonomous Chinese territories that have traditionally had greater protections for press freedom than the mainland. Beijing has said that the expulsions were a response to the Trump administration’s decision to limit the number of Chinese citizens from five state-controlled media outlets who could work in the United States to 100, which forced the expulsion of about 60. On Wednesday, the Chinese government indicated it was prepared to take more measures if needed. “We urge the United States to immediately change its course, correct mistakes, and stop political suppression and unreasonable restrictions on Chinese media,” said Geng, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. “If the United States insists on taking its own course, compounding mistakes, China will be forced to take further countermeasures,” he added. The U.S. news outlets criticised the Chinese government’s decision. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the expulsions “unfortunate” and said he hoped China would reconsider. Pompeo maintained there was a fundamental difference between the expelled U.S. reporters, who are employed by independent media outlets, and the expelled Chinese journalists, who work for a state propaganda machine. In its official rhetoric, the government has cast its decision as a matter of diplomacy. But its own comments and reports in state-run news outlets indicated that Beijing, which often accuses the Western media of bias, also takes issue with the three U.S. news outlets’ reporting on China. “We reject ideological bias against China, reject fake news made in the name of press freedom, reject breaches of ethics in journalism,” tweeted Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman. An article from The Global Times, a stridently nationalistic tabloid controlled by the party, criticised the The New York Times’ coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, the months-long anti-government protests in Hong Kong, and the Chinese authorities’ internment of ethnic-minority Muslims in far western Xinjiang. The paper’s coverage of the epidemic, the article said, was “aiming to attack China’s political system and smear China’s efforts” to contain the virus. It said reports by The Times and other outlets about the government’s policies in the Xinjiang region had “smeared and attacked China without basis.” China also said it was requiring the three outlets as well as Time magazine and Voice of America to disclose details of their staff, assets and operations in China. The action would affect at least 13 U.S. journalists but the number could be higher, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said in a statement Wednesday. The organisation said the expulsion “diminishes us in number and in spirit, though not in our commitment to vigorously cover China. There are no winners in the use of journalists as diplomatic pawns by the world’s two pre-eminent economic powers.” The Global Times echoed this in an editorial Wednesday that accused Washington of starting the tit-for-tat. “As a Chinese media, we regret that the conflict between China and the United States has escalated due to political differences,” it said. Both Chinese and U.S. journalists, it added, were “implicated by political frictions between China and the United States.” The latest developments follow the expulsion of three Journal reporters over a headline last month, “China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia,” on an op-ed column about the country’s coronavirus response efforts. In recent days, The People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, and China Daily, a state-run newspaper, posted messages that circulated widely on China’s Twitter-like forum Weibo targeting The Times for what they called “double standards” in its tweets about the lockdown imposed in China and in Italy to curb the spread of the virus. Some questions remained unanswered, including how and whether the Hong Kong government would take further steps to enforce Beijing’s expulsion. Hong Kong operates under a political formula known as “one country, two systems,” which promises the Chinese territory a high degree of autonomy, including independent courts, a free news media and extensive protections of civil liberties. Many global news organisations use Hong Kong as headquarters for the Asia region. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the region has jurisdiction over immigration matters. If Hong Kong refused to allow the journalists to work in the city, it would be seen by some critics as the latest sign of eroding freedoms in the territory. On Wednesday, Geng said the action taken by Beijing was diplomatic in nature, and thus fell under the central government’s authority, not that of Hong Kong. But some of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy lawmakers rejected the argument and threatened to request a judicial review if any of the U.S. reporters were turned away at Hong Kong’s border. “Carrie Lam doesn’t have to follow exactly what Beijing says,” said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents Hong Kong’s legal sector, referring to Hong Kong’s leader. “If she has any integrity left, she can say this is Hong Kong and we have freedom of the press.” Claudia Mo, another lawmaker, said Beijing was using the situation as an opportunity to “shut down the free flow of information.” “Rule of law is quite dead in Hong Kong, we knew,” Mo said in a news conference in Hong Kong. “Free flow of information, they’re telling us, forget about it.” -The New York Times"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Here's what you can do to help the elderly during the coronavirus pandemic","date":"03-19-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/19\/how-to-help-elderly-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The scale of the coronavirus pandemic is hard for all of us to comprehend and there is still a lot of information that we don’t know. But amid the confusion this fact is clear: Among those most at risk of dying from the virus are the elderly, especially people who are already unwell. Although there is no evidence yet that shows older people are more likely to contract the virus than younger people, it is possible their naturally weaker immune systems due to ageing makes them more likely to suffer the worst symptoms. Given the threat that COVID-19 poses to our elders, it’s natural to worry about our grandparents, friends and neighbours. It’s well worth remembering that younger people have an important role to play in helping older Australians get through this tough time – whether that be by giving them a helping hand or by washing our hands. Here’s what we can do. One way to help is to drive your grandparents to the supermarkets during the exclusive shopping hour for the elderly and people with disabilities. The dedicated daily shopping hour was created to make sure vulnerable people no longer miss out on groceries and essential items amid coronavirus-induced hoarding. Woolworths and Coles will open from 7am to 8am exclusively for the elderly and those with a disability. Some IGA shops are also opening early. Eligible customers will have to produce a relevant government-issued concession card. The measures are in place until at least Friday. If you have elderly neighbours, let them know you can help out with grocery shopping. They might not know who to ask. Why not drop a note in the letterbox? It’s a scary time for our grandparents and it’s important to let them know you are there to support them. Pick up the phone and call them regularly to ask how they are going and what they need. Drop off books, puzzles and games. But be sure to keep them entertained while keeping a distance of 1.5 metres apart – that’s a requirement of the ‘social distancing’ strategies in place to limit the virus’s spread. Tell them about your day and share some funny stories (it might be a good idea to take everyone’s mind off the health scares). If your grandparents live in an aged-care facility and you want to visit them, it is vital you follow the rules announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday. Do not underestimate the danger of accidentally infecting aged-care residents. Some facilities like Villa Maria Catholic Homes are already in total lockdown to prevent infection. The new rules: In times of tragedy, there are always people caring for others. Stories have already emerged on social media of people lending a hand to those who need it. Talk to your friends and brainstorm some ideas of how you can reach out to people who might not have any close family nearby.

The technology could be a sign of measures to come after the World Health Organisation urged countries to ramp up coronavirus testing. “We have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. “We have a simple message for countries: Test, test, test.” The WHO’s message has been heard in Australia, where almost 100,000 coronavirus testing kits are being delivered this week to boost dwindling stock levels. But we have a long way to go to catch up to Singapore. In the Asian city-state, anyone entering a public building, including offices or shopping centres, must first have their temperatures scanned at the doors. Melbourne lawyer Henry Carlson, who is living in Singapore, said the devices looked like a remote control. “They point it at your forehead, like a laser, then they click it and it shows your temperature,” Mr Carlson told The New Daily. If a person’s temperature is normal, they are given a sticker to wear that indicates they are healthy, he said. If not, they must sit on an ‘isolation chair’ while they cool down. If they fail again, they are refused entry and must go home. And it’s not just happening in public buildings – waiters have been spotted with scan guns, too. “I went for a burger and beers on Friday with some mates when one of the waiters came around with a temperature scanner,” Mr Carlson said. “They scanned my forehead just as I was about to order.” The technology is one of the impressive ways Singapore has been limiting and tracking the spread of COVID-19. Despite being one of the earliest countries hit by what was then dubbed ‘Wuhan flu’, Singapore has not had one fatality and its number of confirmed cases has stayed relatively low at 243. That’s partly because the tech-savvy government, experienced from handling the SARS epidemic of 2002 and 2003, was quick to test and track people. Within days of detecting a new case, health authorities were able to trace a chain of transmission from one person to another using a database with the public’s contact information. Hospital staff were able to track down and interview patients about their whereabouts and, in some instances, CCTV footage and travel records were used to fill in the blanks. Singapore’s disease monitoring and tracking procedures has allowed the city-state to detect three times the number of COVID-19 cases as other countries, a recent study by Harvard University researchers estimated. And its success is being felt in the streets. “You feel like it’s a lot more under control here than anywhere else,” Mr Carlson said. “People are very disciplined and the government has been really good at communicating everything to us.” In Singapore, members of the public can sign up to a government-run WhatsApp account to receive daily updates about COVID-19. People can also access a live interactive map that shows the whereabouts of confirmed cases. Smart technology is also being used to monitor people who have been ordered to stay home in self-isolation for 14 days. At-risk or infected people who are meant to be staying at home receive a text message or phone call at various times during the day asking for a photo or GPS update of their location. In Australia, there is no formal federal procedure for tracking and monitoring confirmed cases of COVID-19. That job is left up to the states and territories. Over the past few weeks, hospitals and medical centres around the nation have been opening drive-through COVID-19 testing facilities to help fast-track testing of those who think they are infected. But even though we are ramping up our testing, we are a long way behind Singapore’s capabilities. And we need to catch up quickly. Right now in Victoria, there is a significant shortage of swabs and reagent kits. As a result, medical practitioners have been told to limit testing only to patients who report coronavirus symptoms and have either been travelling overseas in the past 14 days or have come into contact with a known case. The federal government is trying to fix this problem by importing 97,000 testing kits this week. Health Minister Greg Hunt said the government was also working on expanding the use of alternative tests being developed in Australian laboratories so we wouldn’t have to rely on international manufacturers. “The aim is to have more tests and more types so we can avoid any disruption in the large-scale testing regime we have in place in Australia,” Mr Hunt said.

The Prime Minister also warned on Wednesday night that any closures now might have to be kept in place until Christmas. “What you do you’ve got to keep doing for the next six months,” Mr Morrison told Sky News. “You shut them down, they won’t open again, and that means your children will miss what is effectively a whole year of their education.” Mr Morrison again warned it was also a medical workforce issue, with one in three nurses and doctors and hospital workers to be affected if schools shut. “If there’s not a good health reason to do that and risk the child’s education or cause the rather significant economic cost of tens of thousands of jobs, if not more … we need to protect the most vulnerable, then you should keep the schools open.” Earlier, Mr Morrison said he understood the fears of anxious parents but urged them to keep children in school. “The health advice is that schools should remain open,” Mr Morrison said. “Interestingly, this is also what Singapore has done. “In Singapore, they’ve been quite effective in managing and limiting the transmission of this virus in that country. The health advice here, supported by all the Premiers, all the Chief Ministers and my government is that schools should remain open.” But Singapore requires daily temperature checks of students, which is not currently proposed in Australia. The Prime Minister said his daughters remained enrolled in school. “The health advice that I’m happy to follow for my kids, for Jenny and my kids, is the same health advice I am asking all other parents around the country to follow,” he said. “There’s only one reason your kids shouldn’t be going to school and that is if they are unwell. “As parents you are in the best position to know if your children are unwell. “Don’t leave it to the teacher to work that out when they arrive, or the school administrator, or whoever is on drop off. “Make sure if your child is unwell, that you are taking action to keep your child out of school. That’s your responsibility.” You will only be tested for #COVID19 if you develop a respiratory illness and:– returned from overseas, or have been in close contact with a confirmed case, in the past 14 days – are a healthcare worker, with a fever, who works directly with patients.https:\/\/t.co\/JD5gXxL1X5 pic.twitter.com\/zZBcEy4X27 — Australian Government Department of Health (@healthgovau) March 18, 2020 Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the health benefits of shutting down schools was contested. “In China, only 2.4 per cent of the cases reported in Hubei province were in people under 19,” Professor Murphy said. “Children have very, very few instances of clinical disease and even if they do, of even more severe disease. “We believe very strongly that it’s in the best interest of our children and the nation at this time to keep schools open. “There may be occasions when there’s a big outbreak in a community that some local school closures might be necessary, but at this time across the community our view is that schools should stay open.” Professor Murphy said there were measures to reduce potential transmission in schools. “We need to make sure that no sick child goes to school. We need to make sure that no sick teacher goes to school,” he said. “We need to try and avoid large assemblies and other gatherings at schools. “We know also that it’s not really possible for children in a classroom to keep 1.5 metres apart from each other and we know that we’ve got to be practical about that. “But schools should practise very good hand hygiene too. “Very hard to do in the school, but we can trust our teachers to do it. “Children should be washing their hands regularly, particularly when they’re eating, and particularly when they’re touching common areas.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: How social distancing and self-isolating differs","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-social-distancing-versus-self-isolating\/","transcript":"There’s a lot of talk about self-isolating and social distancing, and there’s a marked difference between the two. Here’s how they differ. Social distancing is what we should all be practising, regardless of whether you’ve come into contact with a person with the coronavirus or if you feel crook. From what we know about COVID-19, it’s most likely transmitted commonly through person-to-person contact. So social distancing is imperative to flattening the all-important curve, and putting Australia in the best position to slow the spread of the virus. It’s one of the simplest but most effective things we can do as individuals. That, and washing your hands regularly. Please view the latest advice on how you can help stop the spread of coronavirus.

It’s not being rude, in fact the opposite. We’re also encouraged to make shopping transactions with tap-and-go card payments over cash, regularly use hand sanitiser, and if you’re using public transport, travel at quieter times where possible. As per the latest government advice, gatherings of 500 people or more have been banned, and public venues (churches, pubs, eateries) have been told to keep their occupancy at 100 max. If you’re still physically attending your place at work, the 1.5-metre rule still stands. There’s no handshakes. If a meeting can be a phone call, video call or even an email – do it. If there’s not, avoid a large face-to-face meeting and try to hold it outdoors. And just keep washing your hands.  Social distancing doesn’t stop at home – keep up the hand washing and disinfect ‘high-touch’ areas (i.e. kitchen, door knobs, TV remote) more than you normally would. Open windows and doors to keep fresh air circulating. Keep your pantry and fridge reasonably stocked with two weeks’ of supplies. Seriously only two weeks – we should all be mature and aware enough by now to know that panic-buying more than you need only harms others.  Maybe you’ve just come back from overseas. Or you’ve been in contact with someone who’s tested positive for COVID-19. Maybe you’re feeling unwell yourself, or you’ve indeed been diagnosed as having the virus.  Welcome to self-isolation. The idea of self-isolating is to limit your interactions – therefore potential to infect – others as much as possible. So, spoiler alert: That’s a lot of time to yourself. (Here’s some of our favourite binge-able TV shows to take up a fraction of the time.) Speaking of time, the current recommended period for self-isolating is 14 days.  So what does it look like? Firstly you’ll need to make your own space. If you live by yourself, tick that box. If you live with others – family, house mates – you’ll need to confine yourself to one room. If you’ve got a partner, bad news for them – they’re going to have to sleep on the couch. It goes without saying there’s no hanky panky for you for two weeks. You’ve gotta eat and use the bathroom.  (This advice applies especially to people who are feeling unwell or have a confirmed case.) If the people in your home like you enough to make you food and deliver it to your isolation space, lucky you. Just make sure you’ve got your own set of plates, cutlery, cups and mugs. No one else in your household should use these while you’re in isolation. Also consider getting food delivered – all the services offer a ‘contact-free’ delivery service. A house with two bathrooms would be ideal – but we’re not all that fortunate. Disinfect the bathroom to the nth degree after using it, and wear a face mask in transit to the bathroom. No baths, people. Laundry is also a thing – your dirties should not mix with others’ in the same wash.  Keep abreast of your physical health. Do you have a fever, cough, sore throat or any of the other symptoms? If these arise, call your GP. They’ll talk you through what’s next. (If you do test positive, or if you’re sent for a test and awaiting your results, anyone who lives with you should start self-isolating, too.) When does self-isolation end? If you get through the allotted period with no symptoms, you’re free to go – just remember to implement those social distancing practices we ran through earlier.  Above all – it’s common sense and good manners. When you’re out in public, sneeze or cough into your elbow, keep your hands clean and away from your face. Be mindful of not just the elderly, but everyone – many people appear healthy but can carry the risk factors that means they could suffer a lot worse from the virus should they contract it."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus good deeds: Kindness acts and heartwarming scenes","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-good-deeds-italy\/","transcript":"It’s easy to get swept up in the panic and fear being fuelled by the coronavirus outbreak, but there’s a wave of good deeds and positivity that’s keeping the sickness at bay.

Alongside uplifting actions are tales of downright human compassion. Gone are the stories of shoppers brawling over diminishing groceries in supermarkets. Instead they’re being replaced with acts of kindness. People with surplus goods are actively seeking out those who haven’t been so fortunate, seeking to share their stock so others won’t go without. In one Melbourne neighbourhood, residents have begun waking to gifts left on their doorsteps. Alice Mitchell, whose work has ordered her to stay home, has begun trying to keep the strength of community spirit alive. As she and her family were staring down the barrel of potential self-isolation, Ms Mitchell was turning away from the anxiety-inducing media saturation and towards more traditional forms of entertainment. “I noticed I was gravitating toward board games and the like, to keep my mind occupied from the media overexposure,” Ms Mitchell told The New Daily. “I figured most others could benefit from a similar thing. “So I bought a bunch of puzzles which were inexpensive but might mean the difference between sanity or not.” Together with her two sons, they’ve begun leaving puzzles on their neighbours’ doorsteps at night – with a little note about “keeping sane during lockdown”. “When the climate seems to be every man for himself out in public, I just wanted to give a gesture to my immediate neighbourhood so that they know we’ve got their backs if they need it,” Ms Mitchell said. The reaction has been heartwarming. Neighbours have come a-knocking to chat and say thanks, with a renewed sense of optimism. On Wednesday morning, they woke to their own porch surprise: a thank you note, some chocolate and a “cheeky” roll of toilet paper. “Hopefully they’ll think to pass things down the line to help strengthen our communities – because we need each other more than ever now,” she said. “That human-to-human interaction builds each other up.” Have you seen a kind act during the coronavirus outbreak?

Prime Minister Scott Morrison outlined the grim reality on Wednesday, after a marathon meeting of national cabinet. It came NSW recorded its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus cases and a fifth death from the infection. The national toll is now six. But Mr Morrison urged parents to keep their children in school, revealing his two daughters were not staying at home – because the expert advice was to leave schools open for now. “Life is changing in Australia, as it is changing all around the world,” he said. “Life is going to continue to change, as we deal with the global coronavirus. This is a once-in-100-year-type event. “We haven’t seen this sort of thing in Australia since the end of the First World War. But together, we are up to this challenge.” Shopping centres, airports, universities and child-care facilities are exempt from the new rules, as are schools and public transport, which will remain open. Correctional facilities, youth justice centres or other places of custody, courts or tribunal will also remain open. But the Prime Minister cautioned that the effects of the coronavirus were likely to be felt in the community for six months of longer. Shutting down for a fortnight would not stop the virus, he said. “We are going to keep Australia running. We are going to keep Australia functioning,” he said. “There is no short-term, quick fix to how this is dealt with in Australia. The idea that you can just turn everything off for two weeks and then turn it all back on again and it all goes away, that … is not our way through this.” Mr Morrison urged all Australians to remain a 1.5 metre distance from fellow citizens and practice common sense. “If you’re getting in an Uber, sit in the back seat and not the front seat,” he said. However, he urged parents to send their children to school. “The health advice is that schools should remain open,” he said. “As a father, I am happy for my kids to go to school. “Whatever we have to do, we have to do for six months.” Australia also upgraded its travel advice to to level four (do not travel) for every country in the world. It is the first time that level has been used. “Do not go overseas – that is a very clear instruction,” the Prime Minister said. “For those who are thinking of going overseas in the school holidays, don’t. Don’t go overseas.” Mr Morrison announced that about 20,000 international student nurses who are already in Australia will be called on to help."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Aged-care visits limited to contain coronavirus spread","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/aged-care-visits-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The federal government is limiting visits to aged-care facilities to short, two-person visits once a day, per resident, to protect people from coronavirus. But anyone who has been overseas in the past two weeks, been in contact with someone who has coronavirus or has respiratory infection symptoms will be barred completely. The changes are part of a range of measures announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Australia’s chief health officer on Wednesday. These include warning Australians against all overseas travel and banning all non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. Scott Morrison said visits to dying relatives would have to be arranged with individual aged-care facilities. “We all know how distressing that can be and so the aged-care facilities will be asked to put in place sensible arrangements,” he said. Large groups, including school groups, will also be banned from aged-care homes, as well as social or entertainment events. Visitors will be restricted to residents’ rooms or outdoor spaces, with no meetings to be held in communal areas. Mr Morrison stressed visitors should practice good hygiene and social distancing measures. Aged Care and Community Services Australia chief executive Patricia Sparrow said such strong measures were necessary. “At the top of our minds is the need to balance prevention with emotional care and compassion,” Ms Sparrow said. “We wouldn’t be taking these measures unless they were absolutely necessary, and providers will be doing everything they can to enforce them.” Australian Services Union assistant secretary Linda White said the government was forgetting the disability sector as it rolled out measures for aged care. “People with disability, their families and the workers who support them are incredibly worried about what will happen,” Ms White said. She called on the government to implement coronavirus measures for the disability sector."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Sixth Australian death as NSW cases spike","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/nsw-cases-spike\/","transcript":"A sixth Australian has now died from coronavirus. “NSW Health can confirm a fifth death in NSW from COVID-19,” NSW Health said in a statement just before 2pm. “An 86-year-old man previously notified with COVID-19 died last night in a Sydney hospital. Our condolences are with his family and friends at this time.” There have now been five deaths in NSW and one in Western Australia. The news comes as cases in NSW have jumped to almost 270 – the state’s largest increase in cases over a single day – as it implements a series of unprecedented measures to contain the rapidly spreading disease. Health authorities on Wednesday admitted the number of COVID-19 cases with no known source of transmission was increasing. NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant told reporters there were 269 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state up from 210 on Tuesday. More than 25,000 tests have been conducted. The increase has brought the national total to more than 530. #COVID19 update for Wednesday 18 March 2020. https:\/\/t.co\/xbcjnfGgIX — NSW Health (@NSWHealth) March 18, 2020  Dr Chant attributes the rise to an influx of Australians returning from overseas as citizens around the world are implored to return to their home countries. Prominent sporting fixtures, Anzac Day services and music festivals are among the major events either cancelled or postponed due to Australia’s coronavirus outbreak, with Bunnings’ sausage sizzle the latest to fall foul of the global pandemic. The number of Victorians infected has now hit 121, with 27 cases diagnosed overnight. The increase – the state’s biggest jump since the crisis began – has prompted a call to ban children from aged-care facilities and calls for more extreme social distancing. Premier Daniel Andrews has reiterated his support for for the ban on non-essential public events involving over 500 people and is looking to introduce a new set of measures for indoor gatherings. “To ignore that ban means you face the very real prospect, if you’re a company of $100,000 fine, if you’re an individual, a $20,000 fine. That is how serious this issue is,” Mr Andrews said. Public schools would not be closed for the time being, although Mr Andrews acknowledged “there will be a time when schools will be significantly disrupted, some already have been where there has been individual cases.” Premier Steven Marshall says incorrect information about the situation in South Australia was starting to undermine crucial public health messaging. “There is no state lockdown, there is no CBD lockdown, this is wrong and it’s unhelpful and it’s completely and utterly ludicrous,” Mr Marshall said. The Premier said the continuing focus was on limiting the spread of the virus across the state where 32 cases had been confirmed so far. But he said tougher restrictions on travel and gatherings in large groups were likely to remain in place for six months or more. Tasmania won’t be closing its borders amid the coronavirus crisis, the Premier Peter Gutwein says. There have been calls for the island state, which has recorded seven cases of infection, to implement tougher measures surrounding incoming travellers, including completely shutting its borders. “We will not be stopping trade, we will not be closing our borders,” Mr Gutwein told reporters on Wednesday. “The clothes we are wearing today, the food we ate for breakfast. These things come across our borders, they must continue to come across our borders.” Mr Gutwein said he was taking further advice on whether to implement a 14-day self-isolation period for interstate travellers. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has echoed the words of the Prime Minister in calling for a halt to overseas travel. Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles confirmed the state’s number of confirmed coronavirus cases has reached 94, a jump of 16 from Tuesday. Ms Palaszczuk told Parliament on Wednesday she has never seen more co-operation between state, territory and federal governments than she has during the COVID-19 crisis. “I repeat the words of the Prime Minister, do not go overseas,” Ms Palaszczuk said. Schools will remain open despite the Premier telling Parliament this crisis was going to last for at least six months. “The advice tells us this virus operates differently in children. We cannot disrupt schools for what would be six months,” she said. Premier Mark McGowan has urged West Australians to cancel non-essential interstate travel, but has stopped short of arguing for borders to close. “Please don’t engage in non-essential travel,” he said. “If you don’t need to go interstate, please don’t,” he said. Health Minister Roger Cook has said there have been four new confirmed COVID-19 cases overnight, bringing the total up to 35. “We’re still experiencing low numbers of confirmed cases, which is pleasing,” Mr Cook said. Senior doctors yesterday advocated for the extension of travel restrictions for all personal interstate travel. The ACT Government has confirmed a third case of coronavirus, as Canberrans drive up to an hour-and-a-half away to buy groceries. The woman who tested positive to COVID-19 is aged in her 70s, and was admitted to Canberra Hospital last night. It is believed she was infectious while on a Garuda Indonesia flight GA712 from Jakarta to Sydney, which landed on Saturday morning, March 14. ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said she was working with the airline and coach service to find other people who might have been exposed. Canberra remained in an “excellent position” generally to contain the disease, especially given the challenges facing other cities. “We certainly don’t have community transition in the ACT at the moment,” she said. The Northern Territory, which has recorded just one infection to date, has set aside a $60 million stimulus package to insulate against the economic impacts of the pandemic. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Schools to stay open for 'foreseeable future', despite parents' fears","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/schools-scott-morrison-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison insists schools will remain open – for now – as governments across the country face increasing heat from parents opposed to the decision. The ABC understands absenteeism – particularly in affluent areas – is as high as 30 per cent as parents struggle to understand why schools should stay open when social distancing is being encouraged elsewhere. Mr Morrison said on Wednesday he was following the advice of the government’s health experts and young people were a low-risk group. Closing schools would put pressure on health workers to stay at home to look after children, and hurt the economy more broadly, he said. “The disruption that would occur from closures [of schools] around this country would be severe. “Let’s keep our heads as parents. “What do I mean by severe? Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more,” he said. “The impact on the availability of health workers – a 30 per cent impact on the availability of health workers.” The pressure on governments from angry and concerned parents demanding school closures has been immense. The federal and state governments have been discussing starting the Easter holidays a week early. This would provide time to better prepare schools for an epidemic that could last six months. The ABC understands plans were well advanced but have been delayed after Tuesday night’s national cabinet meeting. A sharp rise in infections could mean it is back on the table. Governments believe it is a sensible compromise that will avoid a more drastic shutdown. The government has made clear that if schools closed now, it would likely be for six months. In practice, that could mean many students needing to repeat their entire year of schooling. Mr Morrison cited Singapore as a country that had successfully controlled the virus while keeping schools open. A report from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention examined the impact of school closures overseas and found short-term closures did not affect the spread of the virus. “Available modelling data indicate that early, short to medium closures do not impact the epi curve of COVID-19 or available health care measures,” the report said. “In other countries, those places who closed school (e.g. Hong Kong) have not had more success in reducing spread than those that did not (e.g. Singapore).” The report said longer closures of eight to 20 weeks may have some impact on community spread, but other measures such as hand-washing and home isolation had a greater effect. The same report also mentioned the danger of closing schools, saying it could lead to young people having greater contact with at-risk groups. Australia’s chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, said there had also been few cases of coronavirus diagnosed in children in the Chinese province first affected by the outbreak. “Only 2.4 per cent of the cases reported in Hubei province were in people under 19,” he said. “Children have very, very few instances of clinical disease and, if they do, of even more severe disease.” Teachers who fall into higher-risk categories are having to make tough decisions about isolating from their families. Others have criticised a lack of hygiene products on school grounds, which makes department guidance on social distancing difficult to carry out. “Schools have been told to implement a range of social distancing measures, which include keeping a distance of 1.5 metres between persons and minimising physical contact where possible,” NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said. “However, the design of many of our schools and the size of our classrooms make this impossible. “The overcrowding of some schools also makes this impossible beyond the classroom. “This is further amplified on wet days when children and their teachers have to remain indoors.” Aside from a relatively small number of independent schools, the Catholic, independent and public school sectors had all been in support of keeping schools open. That changed on Tuesday, when Catholic Schools Sydney – which represents 150 schools – broke ranks and called for school closures. The ABC understands the Catholic sector has behind closed doors been pushing strongly for its schools to be shut. The Prime Minister stressed all the states were unified. “The health advice here, supported by all the premiers, all the chief ministers and my government, is that schools should remain open,” he said. Professor Murphy said the virus affected children quite differently to influenza and other respiratory diseases, which could be quite severe in children. He said, however, that it was not known whether children could spread the illness without showing symptoms, so schools needed to be made as safe as possible. Sick children and teachers should not attend, large assemblies and other gatherings should be limited, and good hand hygiene should be enforced, he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Food shortage fears prompt shoppers to target seeds","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-food-shortage-fears\/","transcript":"While panicked shoppers have so far targeted supermarket shelves amid coronavirus fears, it seems they have now expanded their nets to include other sources of food. An Adelaide nursery is reporting a significant increase in vegetable seed sales in the past fortnight. There are also reports of city shoppers descending on country shops because of shelves being stripped bare in metropolitan areas. In recent weeks, major supermarkets around the country have been running low on items including rice, pasta and toilet paper because of widespread stockpiling of goods in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Golden Grove nursery manager Steve Neale said people had shown an interest in growing their own fruit and vegetables as a precautionary measure. “We’ve been selling a lot more seeds than normal … it’s intensified over the last few weeks, there’s no doubt about that,” he said. “Certainly things like lettuces — and things like that that are quite quick growing, [such as] radishes — there’s quite a lot of things you can grow that you can harvest in a few weeks, and herbs that may not be readily available. “Broccoli, cauliflowers, cabbages and silverbeet, things like that. Baby spinach as well … we’ve been selling quite a lot of mint and parsley and thyme.” Other garden centres have reported the same trend. “We’re ridiculously busy … veggie seedlings and seeds have been one of the big, big increases,” said Barossa nursery owner Erica Bartsch. Ms Bartsch said some of the interest was also being driven by people looking for something to do should they be required to self-isolate. “To stay at home for two weeks or longer, you really would want to do a few things,” she said. The phenomenon is not confined to Australia, with reports of similar purchasing patterns in the United Kingdom. In a recent article for The Guardian, celebrity chef Adam Liaw recommended vegetable patches as a way of becoming more self-sufficient, suggesting that home gardeners could be “knee deep in homegrown fresh produce within a month or two”. “If things really get bad, the garden growers will be better prepared for the future than the bunker-stockers,” Liaw wrote. “Even if you don’t have a green thumb — or any actual space for a garden — it’s absurd that we are right now walking straight past overflowing baskets of fresh produce so that if the shops close we can live off cans of tuna.” Coronavirus update: Follow all the latest news in our daily wrap Mr Neale said a backyard was not necessarily essential to growing food at home. “There’s a huge selection of raised garden beds these days,” he said. “You can get different sizes of them, they come with a winter cover that keeps them warm in the winter, so we’ve found those little portable veg gardens are quite popular.” Despite the trend, the food industry has offered repeated reassurances to customers that the nation is not running low on supplies. “We’re going through unprecedented times right now,” AusVeg SA chief executive officer Jordan Brooke-Barnett said. “We don’t project any major food shortages moving forward, especially fresh produce.” The shift towards seeds is happening as city shoppers swoop on country towns — in some cases chartering buses — to stock up in rural supermarkets. “I live in a small town of 1,500 people 100 kilometres from Melbourne,” one person wrote on Twitter. “Yesterday four tour buses arrived from Melbourne and 200 people descended on our supermarket and stripped the shelves of everything. Not one foodstuff left.” Another said such behaviour was also occurring in areas of South Australia. “I live 115 kilometres from the Adelaide CBD,” the user wrote. “Three buses Tuesday, same over the weekend. We can’t even get bread and milk.” The SA Government has announced fines of up to $20,000 for people who fly into Adelaide Airport but flout self-isolation orders. Police now have the power to check in on people at their listed homes. “Orders like this are fundamentally reliant on people complying, and the vast majority do,” Health Minister Stephen Wade said. “But there will be people who ignore, and spot checks are there for people who ignoring their obligations.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Donald Trump wants cash sent to US public","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/18\/trump-cash-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Trump administration is looking to send cheques to US citizens in the next two weeks to try to curb the economic cost of the coronavirus outbreak, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says. “The President has instructed me we have to do this now,” he said at a White House briefing on Wednesday (US time). Mr Mnuchin didn’t give details except to say the amount should be significant and millionaires would not get it. Since then, Reuters has reported the cheques will be for $US1000 ($A1670) – and part of a $US1 trillion stimulus package. “We want to make sure Americans get money in their pockets quickly,” Mr Mnuchin said. The US stock market rose during the briefing after a savage drop on Monday. The White House on Tuesday (local time) was asking Congress to approve a massive emergency rescue package to help businesses as well as taxpayers cope with the economic crisis that is paired with the pandemic. It came as New York, the United States’ most populous, considered ordering people to stay at home except for emergencies or shopping for essentials. A similar order has already been imposed in San Francisco. The number of reported COVID-19 cases in the US has surged past 5800 and deaths are approaching 100. Meanwhile, millions of Americans have hunkered down in their homes as major cities escalated “social distancing” policies by closing schools, bars, restaurants and theatres. Mr Mnuchin planned to outline the proposed stimulus package to Senate Republicans on Tuesday. Officials hope to have Congress approve it this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who opened the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action. “The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,” Mr McConnell said.

Thank you, Illinois! https:\/\/t.co\/CzdD7EuPTE — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) March 18, 2020  But Tuesday’s primaries (local time) demonstrated the tremendous uncertainty confronting the Democratic contest as it collides with efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Polls were shuttered in Ohio even as voting moved forward in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, where some voters and elections officials reported problems. It marked the third week in a row Biden piled up wins after his victory in South Carolina last month revived his once-flagging campaign. Since then, most of his party’s establishment have lined up behind him as the best option to unseat President Donald Trump in November. Mr Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday after a primary victory in Illinois, an expected development considering he had no major competition. Mr Sanders’ pathway to the nomination has dramatically narrowed, but he isn’t expected to leave the race. Mr Sanders has staged virtual rallies that his campaign says have been watched by millions, and he used the coronavirus outbreak to promote the need for universal, government-funded health care under “Medicare for All,” his signature issue. Mr Biden’s campaign is also taking nothing for granted, even though the former vice president has declared that he would select a woman as his running mate. Officials in Ohio took the unprecedented step of closing polls on Monday, just hours before they were set to open, pushing back the state’s primary until June. But Illinois, Florida and Arizona, which went ahead with voting even as federal authorities urged people to stay home whenever possible and not to gather in groups of larger than 10. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez blasted Ohio for breeding “more chaos and confusion.” He sought to head off more states taking similar actions, urging those with upcoming primaries to expand vote-by-mail and absentee balloting, as well as polling station hours, so that efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus don’t further derail his party’s nomination contest. Four other states – Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Maryland – have already moved to push back their primaries, and others could follow suit. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Red Cross makes urgent plea for blood donations | The New Daily","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-blood-donations\/","transcript":"Australians are being urged to continue donating blood amid the coronavirus emergency, with the Red Cross Lifeblood group saying there is no evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted by blood transfusion. Lifeblood says 14,000 new and existing donors are needed in coming weeks to bolster supplies ahead of the Easter period and the annual cold and flu season. Chief executive Shelly Park said at the start of 2020 the organisation had a “phenomenal” response from donors following the nation’s bushfire emergency. “However, those generous donors now have to wait 12 weeks before they are able to donate again,” she said on Tuesday. Lifeblood needs to collect about 29,000 blood and plasma donations every week across Australia. Ms Park said, as well as fewer people able to donate in coming weeks, last-minute cancellations were putting a dent in blood stocks “at a time when donors are in urgent need”. “As we all know, there is no substitute for blood,” she said. “It is a critical resource, and right now, we need more people booking appointments to donate.” Ms Park reassured the community that there was “no evidence coronavirus is transmittable by blood transfusion”. “The organisation has robust processes in place to ensure the safety of the blood supply and our donors, and we don’t allow people who are unwell to donate blood,” she said. “Our donor centres are safe places to visit and we will take all necessary steps to ensure that stays the case.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Scott Morrison undergoes check-up – but no coronavirus test","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/scott-morrison-health-check\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison has been given the thumbs-up following a routine health check-up, but was not tested for coronavirus.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has been recovering in self-isolation at home after being diagnosed with coronavirus following a trip to the US. Last week, Mr Dutton attended a Liberal Party fundraiser with a Sydney businessman who was later diagnosed with the virus. Mr Morrison attended a cabinet meeting with Mr Dutton on the same day. The Prime Minister said contact tracing from the fundraiser had led to tests for people exhibiting symptoms. He said anyone who needed to be contacted after being close to Mr Dutton while he was infectious was being kept informed. “The contact tracing on that event has already been undertaken, and so, where that has led to the need for tests to be undertaken, where people are exhibiting symptoms and had contact, then people will undertake the tests,” he said. “There will be a number of cabinet members who had tests. Not in relation to that specifically, but where they have satisfied the case definition, which has been set out by the chief medical officer.” “I can assure you in all of these cases, where there has been a question arise as to whether that should be done, we’ll consult with either the chief medical officer or the deputy chief medical officer. “I’d encourage all Australians to do that.” Government senators Andrew Bragg and Susan McDonald have been diagnosed with coronavirus.

Football Federation Australia yesterday advised that all sanctioned grassroots football activity in Australia will be suspended until April 14. After careful consideration and having regard to the feedback received from the grassroots community, @FFA advises that effective from 12:00am on 18 March 2020, all sanctioned grassroots football activity in Australia will be suspended until 14 April 2020. https:\/\/t.co\/AqRmBzmsUv — Football Federation Australia (@FFA) March 17, 2020  However, the A-League, with its financial commitments to rights broadcasters, is still looking to complete the season. Wellington Phoenix general manager David Dome gave an insight into the overhauled nature of the league caused by the need to isolate teams and reduce travel because of coronavirus. Dome revealed Australia’s two biggest cities will be hubs for the remainder of the regular season, which will be completed by mid-April at empty stadiums. The finals format is still be confirmed but is likely to remain on the east coast of Australia. Dome let slip the fundamental change hours before the Phoenix players and staff were scheduled to fly to Sydney on Wednesday, where they will undergo two weeks of mandatory isolation. Under the draw he’s seen, which is not yet confirmed, five of Wellington’s six subsequent regular season games will be in Sydney, with the exception being a drive to Newcastle to face the Jets. The Sydney venues are still to be confirmed. “It’s not my place to release the draw but there are certain plans in place to have the A-League based out of two hubs, being Melbourne and Sydney,” Dome said. Once out of quarantine, Wellington will play their first game three days later, on April 4, squeezing their six games into less than three weeks. Despite the strain placed on his players by the schedule, Dome said Wellington had given a cautious nod to A-League bosses. “We are relatively comfortable with that, given the circumstances,” he said. “Under normal circumstances that would not be an acceptable solution but all the clubs realise that we have to complete the season as soon as possible.” Dome believed locating to two cities made sense as it reduced the travel component considerably, aiding safety measures and helping players recover from the taxing schedule. He said all clubs were undergoing their own form of isolation to give the league the best chance of being completed, as it would be severely compromised if any player contracted COVID-19. “It’s almost like every club has gone into an isolation window within the club itself,” he said. Wellington’s confirmation of their travel came as a relief to FFA chief executive James Johnson after the club had raised concerns on Tuesday and delayed their arrival. Phoenix bosses only agreed to go ahead with the plan after being given assurances their players would be able to train together during their quarantine period. Johnson said his organisation is prepared to do what it can to ensure both Phoenix and Melbourne Victory players – who are also in isolation after playing in Wellington on Sunday – can maintain their focus and condition before returning to action. “Knowing they’ve got to come out of that 14 day period and play a football match, it is very challenging for them,” he said. “So yes, we’re relieved but on the other hand we’re really just trying to help them both mentally and also physically and we’re also working very closely with the PFA to do this.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Stop hoarding': Scott Morrison's blunt message to panicked shoppers","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/hoarding-pm-supermarkets\/","transcript":"Stop hoarding. That’s the blunt message from the Prime Minister to Australians as panic buying sparked by the spread of the coronavirus shows no sign of easing. “It is not sensible, it is not helpful and it has been one of the most disappointing things I have seen in Australian behaviour in response to this crisis,” Scott Morrison said on Wednesday. “It’s ridiculous, it’s un-Australian, and it must stop.” Bad behaviour – including brawls and other violence – and people emptying supermarket shelves were diverting important resources to keeping shopping centre supply lines open, he said. Mr Morrison also announced a host of broader restrictions for Australians on Wednesday, including bans on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. His blunt message came as Woolworths introduced two-per-person limits on all packaged items across its supermarkets. “This means that you’ll only be able to buy two products from any single category or section (such as coffee), regardless of the brand or variety,” the company said in a statement. “These are in addition to any other limits already in place.” Only a handful of items – including milk, wet pet food and fresh fruit and vegetables – are not now subject to purchase limits. Coles followed with its own updated limits by late Wednesday afternoon. Mr Morrison was backed up by two state premiers on Wednesday. A clearly frustrated Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said “the Prime Minister was 100 per cent correct”. “It is of no benefit to anyone. It is causing distress, it is not right. We will get a care package to you with the basics if you find yourself unable to leave home and you don’t have what you need,” he said. “There are ample supplies of food, there are ample supplies of the basics … A bit of consideration, thinking about others, being calm, using common sense, that is how we will get through this together.” In Western Australia, Premier Mark McGown said police had increased their presence at shopping centres to deal with “jerks, drongos and bloody idiots”. “I’d urge them to stop, have respect for each other, stop this panic buying, this violence, this stupidity going on,” he said. Australia’s major supermarket chains have also united to plead with customers to show consideration and stop abusing staff. They took out newspaper advertisements across the country after more footage emerged online of customers verbally attacking retail staff because of empty shelves. Aldi, Coles, IGA and Woolworth said they were doing everything they could to get as much produce into stores as possible, often under difficult circumstances. “We ask you to please be considerate in the way you shop,” the ad says. “If you buy only what you need and stick to the product limits, it helps everyone, especially the elderly and people with disability. “No one working or shopping in any of our stores should experience abusive or aggressive behaviour.” Coles on Wednesday held its first nationwide “community hour” for seniors and pension card holders from 7-8am, before opening to everyone else. On Tuesday, people with government-issued concession cards flocked to Woolworths, which implemented a similar measure, and IGA is considering whether to roll out the same. Eligible Woolworths shoppers reported mixed success with the exclusive shopping hour on Tuesday, with some reporting shelves already empty and long queues to gain entry. There were similar reports from supermarkets in Sydney on Wednesday. From Wednesday, Aldi has reduced its opening hours across Australia, and extended purchasing restrictions to a host of products – ranging from nappies and sanitary products to flour and tinned goods. “This is uncharted territory for many of us,” the company said in a statement. “Please remember to be kind, be calm, be empathetic and – most of all – be courteous.”  Aldi said it had joined Coles, Woolworths and IGA in temporarily suspending “change of mind” return policies. “If you have already purchased additional items you no longer want, please look at donating them to community organisations or neighbours who have been struggling to purchase them during this time,” it said. Coles is trying to employ more than 5000 casual workers to help restock its supermarkets quicker. It has restricted online orders to the elderly and vulnerable and both it and Woolworths have shut down their click-and-collect services. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Doctors in Italy forced to make life or death choices","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-doctors-in-italy-forced-to-make-life-or-death-choices\/","transcript":"On the afternoon of February 27, I finally got a call through to the local service in Milan conducting swab tests for coronavirus. I’d been provided their details by Italy’s COVID-19 national response team, after initially calling emergency on 112. When someone who spoke English was found, I explained the situation, as I had done already on three occasions: we had been working near the red zones, had come down with colds and were calling to arrange a swab. “No, no, no,” the woman said. “We don’t make this test.” She told me I had the wrong number, and insisted I call the emergency number. When I explained that it was in fact 112 which had directed me to her, she was silent for a moment. Then: “But that’s the only number we have to give you.” It was an early glimpse into a confused bureaucracy racing to come to grips with an unfolding crisis. At the time, there were only several hundred infections and 12 dead. Now, the death toll has spiked to more than 2,500, with almost 28,000 people diagnosed with the disease. On Sunday alone, 368 people died from coronavirus in Italy. On Monday that figure was 349. On Tuesday it was 345. At the centre of the pandemic is Bergamo — Italy’s most infected city — which is now home to apocalyptic scenes. Coffins waiting to be interred fill the Tempio di Ognissanti, a local cemetery church, which has been converted into an emergency morgue. The city’s crematorium is running on a new 24-hour schedule. Newspaper L’Eco di Bergamo is running 10 pages of obituaries; it normally prints just one. Bergamo anaesthetist Christian Salaroli told daily newspaper Corriere della Sera that the hospitals were so overwhelmed, and the supply of respirators so inadequate, doctors were having to choose who receives treatment. “We decide depending on their age and the condition of their health,” he said. Watching in horror, many around the world are now wondering how Italy got it so spectacularly wrong? The country’s first known cases were two visitors from Wuhan, in China. Detected on January 29, they were placed in isolation in a hospital in Rome and the wheels of a national response began to grind forward. The next day, Italy was the first European state to block all flights to and from China and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared his country’s emergency response “the most rigorous in Europe”. But a local outbreak was already taking hold. Two weeks after Mr Conte’s bold words, a 38-year-old man known only as Mattia — who in the days prior had socialised with friends and competed in a fun run — saw his GP in Codogno complaining of a flu. On February 16 and then again on February 18, he visited the 24-hour casualty department of the local hospital and was turned away both times with instructions for bed rest. On neither occasion was he tested for the virus. It was only after he returned at 3:00am the following day, now experiencing difficulty breathing, that alarm bells began to ring. He was tested 24 hours later and on February 21 a positive diagnosis was returned. Italy now had its first known local transmission. In the press, the man was dubbed Patient One. So-called red zones were draped over Codogno and 10 other villages in the north of the country and curfews were introduced for bars and restaurants in Lombardy. When he learned of the sequence of events, Mr Conte fumed. In a television interview, the Prime Minister said: “We know that the way one hospital facility was managed was not entirely appropriate … [and] that certainly contributed to the spread.” Mr Conte’s remarks prompted a war of words with Lombardy’s Governor Attilio Fontana and Codogno’s head of medicine, Giorgio Scanzi. “We have done our duty,” he hit back. “We have a clear conscience.” The squabbling reflected a general sense of confusion about the seriousness of the threat. Mr Fontana told the regional parliament the disease was “just a little more than a normal flu,” and the next day, the province even reversed the curfews on restaurants. The leader of the Democratic Party, Nicola Zingaretti, made a point of showing up at a bar for a very public Aperitivo, the traditional Milanese evening drink, and light supper. He urged the country to avoid “destroying life or spreading panic”. But within nine days, Mr Fontana went into quarantine after an adviser tested positive, and Mr Zingaretti himself contracted the virus. The following day, on March 8, Rome extended the lockdown from the northern provinces to the nation’s frontiers and unveiled a 10 billion euros emergency fund. In Lombardy alone, confirmed cases of the pathogen had climbed over 4,000, and the death toll was climbing past 267. Mr Conte delivered a televised address: “Non c’e’ piu’ tempo,” he said, which translated to: “We have run out of time.” The scale of the catastrophe in Italy remains difficult to digest. Just 19 days after Patient One was diagnosed, Italy had 12,462 coronavirus patients, more than 1,000 people in intensive care, and 827 people had already died. The epicentre of the global crisis had swung from China to Europe. Many have condemned those initial missteps in Italy as critical errors, including prominent Italian intellectual Beppe Severgnini. He wrote in The New York Times that “mistakes were made” by Italy in the early days of the pandemic. Mr Severgnini claimed, for example, that the China flights ban may have prompted travellers to enter the country via neighbouring European states, masking the spread of the virus and preventing an effective quarantine. A scientist from the Italian National Institute of Health told TIME the virus “had probably been circulating for quite some time” before it was detected, as the disease surfaced during the normal flu season. Nino Cartabellotta, a leading Italian public health expert, has raised questions about whether an unusually high number of suspected pneumonia cases a month prior to the outbreak should have been tested. “It could [also] be that there weren’t any severe cases,” he said. “[And] they only emerged in a clinically mild way.” It appears clear now that the only means by which Italy might have headed off the catastrophe was the implementation of its unprecedented national lockdown far earlier, before there was evidence of its prudence — an almost impossible proposition. “Waiting strategies have always favoured the spread of the virus,” Cartabellotta said. Exponential infection curves are now showing up not just in neighbouring European states, such as Spain and France, but also in the United States and in Australia. It may be simply that Italy was first by dint of sheer misfortune. “You can argue they noticed it late,” infectious diseases modeller from the University of Bern Christian Althaus told The Guardian. “But that could have happened elsewhere, too. Once they realised what was happening, I think they took it seriously. “The first lockdown was the right choice, and expanding it nationwide probably too. They realise they need to curb the epidemic.” There’s a separate question, however, as to how the disease has been fought. Italy is recording a mortality rate which rocketed on Sunday (local time) to 7 per cent — double the global average. Of the G7, Rome’s expenditure on public health has hovered at levels behind France, Germany and the UK. The Servizio Sanitario Nazionale – Italy’s answer to the UK’s National Health Service – has been grossly underfunded for years. Lorenzo Casani, who runs a medical clinic for the elderly of Lombardy, told TIME there had been “continuous cuts to care and to research”. “We were not prepared,” he said. “We do not have enough doctors for the people. We do not have an organised plan for pandemics.” Mr Casani too described a frightening new reality in which doctors “have to make this horrible choice and decide who is going to survive and who is not going to survive”. Part of the picture in Italy is demographic. Almost a quarter of Italians are aged 65 or older, the highest such number in the EU. Many of these people will be carrying pre-existing conditions and other vulnerabilities to such a virulent new strain of flu. In an attempt to get the outbreak back under control, Italy is now policing public squares and limiting movement of its 60 million inhabitants. In Milan, a trade fair pavilion is being converted into an emergency field hospital. It’s not clear however that other European states have been paying sufficient attention to the travails of their neighbour. Only in recent days have Spain and France enacted similar lockdowns. On Monday, the EU proposed a temporary ban on all non-essential travel to anywhere on the continent. The UK will be exempt from such a ban, but it appears that London is, in any case, forging a different path through this global disaster. When my colleague and I were finally allowed to fly out of Italy, we had expected to be screened at Heathrow. We were not. We placed ourselves in quarantine and tried to arrange a test for the virus; the NHS’s COVID-19 hotline was almost as difficult to negotiate as Italy’s. England has yet to introduce any of the more draconian restrictions: schools remain open, as do its borders. Until Monday, it appeared Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s administration had made a decision to tolerate the spread of the virus through a greater proportion of the UK than many other countries, in pursuit of herd immunity. But new modelling has revealed this approach risked a potential death toll of 250,000 people. Mr Johnson has since ramped up the UK’s response, asking those who display symptoms to quarantine themselves. He also flagged a three-month isolation for everyone over the age of 70, from this weekend. It’s an attempt, however belated, to head off the horror that has descended on Italy, and prevent the printing of page after page of obituary notices. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Virgin suspends all international flights","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-virgin-international-flights\/","transcript":"Virgin Australia will halt all international flights from March 30 and halve its domestic capacity, as travel demand plummets amid the coronavirus outbreak. The airline announced the move on Wednesday in response to government-imposed travel restrictions announced at the weekend. International travellers to Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Virgin’s latest round of cuts follow Qantas’ announcement on Tuesday it would slash international seat capacity by 90 per cent. Qantas also warned the moves would leave it with a “significant labour surplus”. Virgin’s announcement is the equivalent of grounding 53 aircraft. The cuts will apply until June 14. “These are unprecedented circumstances and unprecedented decisions,” managing director Paul Scurrah said., “Managing through this crisis is my priority, leading this business through this crisis is my priority and, given these decisions, we are well positioned to weather this storm.” Mr Scurrah also signalled the change would hit the airline’s 10,500-strong workforce. “The saddest part about this is there will be impacts on our people. What we’re working through now is how that impact can be shared, how it can lessen the long-term impact on people,” he said. Staff will be encouraged to take unpaid leave, go part-time or job share. Mr Scurrah said many employees had already offered to make such changes. “It is fair to say that all 10,500 people that work for us right now will see some impact,” he said. Virgin’s Melbourne-Los Angeles services will be suspended from March 20 while the inaugural Brisbane-Tokyo, and Melbourne-Denpasar services will be postponed from March 29. Virgin said it would operate a reduced international schedule until March 29 to enable Australians to return home and visitors to return to their own homes. The big airlines’ announcements came as Australia’s largest independent regional airline, Regional Express, warned the COVID-19 crisis would bring it down within six months unless it got more support from the federal government. Some smaller regional carriers had only weeks of reserve left, Regional Express said, warning regional communities would be plunged into “utter chaos and mayhem” if it and other regional airlines collapsed. In the past half-year Rex flew 659,000 passengers on 60 routes in its fleet of 57 Saab 340 turboprop airplanes. It made a profit of $6.9 million on $166.2 million in revenue. Rex withdrew its profit forecast issued on February 28 and said it couldn’t provide a new one. On Wednesday, the federal government announced a $715 million lifeline to help the ailing airline sector through the coronavirus pandemic. A range of government charges – including fuel excise, air service charges and regional security fees – will be refunded and waived as domestic and global travel plummets. The move is expected to create an upfront benefit of $159 million, with the government refunding charges paid since February 1.

The new ban applies to indoor, non-essential gatherings only, with exemptions for essential services. The ban, announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday morning, also excludes jails, hospitals, mining sites and public transport. Mr Morrison said it was also critical that families and businesses cancelled overseas travel and stayed at home. “Life is changing all around the world. This is a once-in-a-100-year event,” he said. “But together we are up to this challenge. We need to continue to keep our heads. “We are going to keep Australia running. It won’t look like it normally does.” Mr Morrison urged all Australians to remain a 1.5 metre distance from fellow citizens and practice common sense. “If you’re getting in an Uber, sit in the back seat and not the front seat,” he said. However, he urged parents to send their children to school. “The health advice is that schools should remain open,” he said. “As a father, I am happy for my kids to go to school. “Whatever we have to do, we have to do for six months.” Mr Morrison announced a range of heightened restrictions on Wednesday – and said more were being considered. Among them, Australia has upgraded its travel advice to to level four (do not travel) for every country in the world. It is the first time that level has been used. “Do not go overseas – that is a very clear instruction,” the Prime Minister said. “For those who are thinking of going overseas in the school holidays, don’t. Don’t go overseas.” He announced the new arrangements at a press conference in Canberra after a marathon meeting of the new national cabinet on Tuesday night. The new package also includes millions of dollars in support for the airline industry, which is expected to come under extreme pressure from the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Work restrictions have also been lifted on international student nurses in Australia, to allow them to help cope with the expected rush of virus-stricken patients. Mr Morrison said the coronavirus threat and the impact on the country’s economy could not be dealt with by shutting down businesses for a fortnight. “We are looking at a situation of at least six months,” he said. “Wherever possible, we need to keep Australians working.” Mr Morrison said it was critical that families practised social distancing and self-isolation if diagnosed with the illness. “If we slow the spread, we do save lives.” Chief health officer Brendan Murphy said there were 454 cases of coronavirus in Australia on Wednesday morning, and evidence of “low-level” community transmission. “The majority of new cases are still imported cases or direct contacts of imported cases,” he said. “But, be clear – a short-term two-four-week week shutdown of society is not recommended by any of our experts. It does not achieve anything.” He repeated Mr Morrison’s assertion that the restrictions could last six months. “We have to be in this for the long haul,” Professor Murphy said. “We have to have sustainable measures, but they have to be serious measures – they have to be effective.” -more to come"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Airlines to get $715 million coronavirus rescue package","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-airlines-rescue-package\/","transcript":"Australia’s battling airlines are set to receive a $715 million federal government boost to help the sector navigate the coronavirus pandemic.

Regional carrier Rex has urged government action, warning it could go under unless given help during the tumultuous period. Shares in Regional Express entered a trading halt on Tuesday pending an announcement to the market. Singapore-based Jetstar Asia, which is owned by Qantas, has suspended all flights for three weeks from March 23 to April 15. The Airlines for Australia and New Zealand group applauded the government package for a “critical pillar” of the Australian economy and the tourism industry. “In Australia, when the impact of the GFC spread beyond the financial sector to other industries, none were hit harder than the aviation sector,” A4ANZ CEO Alison Roberts said. “The impact of this economic crisis caused by COVID-19 is expected to be far worse.” Some analysts have warned that coronavirus will bankrupt most airlines by the end of May unless governments and the industry take coordinated action. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Simply couldn't be having' it: Global Anzac Day services cancelled","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/18\/gallipoli-anzac-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Australian-led international Anzac Day services have been cancelled as the government moves to slow the spread of coronavirus. Commemorations at Gallipoli and on the Western Front will be among the events cancelled this year because of the global pandemic. The decision affects all April 25 services at Gallipoli, including the break out Australian and New Zealand services at Lone Pine and Chunuk Bair, as well as services in France. Veterans’ Affairs Minister Darren Chester said the decision to cancel was made with great regret, but the safety of people involved was paramount. “We simply couldn’t be having large gatherings of 500 or 1000 people on Anzac Day on foreign soil this year,” he told ABC News Breakfast on Wednesday. Anzac Day gatherings have also been cancelled in many Australian states, although there are plans for commemorations in capital cities in different formats. RSL Tasmania president Robert Dick said the decision to call off services and marches had been difficult. But many older veterans fell into the group most at-risk from coronavirus. “The consequences could be devastating and we don’t want to put people in that position,” he said. “We’re asking people in their own private way to pay respects to our serving and ex-service members. “Even if it’s like on Remembrance Day, where you take a moment around 11 o’clock to pause and reflect on those who have gone before.” The spread of cancellations prompted RSL Queensland to suggest a driveway service on April 25. It has urged Australians to honour Anzac Day by standing at the end of their driveways for a minute’s silence instead. RSL Queensland said the display would send a powerful message of solidarity to Australia’s defence community. “This is an idea that has gathered momentum in social media, and we agree it’s a brilliant way to collectively honour the dedication, commitment and sacrifice of our service people,” state president Tony Ferris said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, tthe national ceremony in Canberra will go ahead, although it will be smaller than usual and televised nationally. “We know that if we can reduce the spread of this virus we can save lives in our communities,” Mr Chester said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Brother of UK suicide bomber at Ariana Grande concert found guilty","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/18\/brother-uk-bomber-guilty-ariana-grande\/","transcript":"The brother of the bomber who blew himself up at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in the English city of Manchester three years ago has been found guilty of murdering the 22 victims. Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton born to Libyan parents, detonated his bomb at Manchester Arena as parents arrived to collect their children at the close of a show by the US pop singer in May 2017. Among the dead were seven children, the youngest aged just eight, while 237 people were injured and 670 survivors reported suffering from psychological trauma. Prosecutors had said his younger brother Hashem Abedi, now also 22, was just as guilty of the murders by helping his sibling to carry out the attack. “Hashem Abedi encouraged and helped his brother knowing that Salman Abedi planned to commit an atrocity. He has blood on his hands even if he didn’t detonate the bomb,” Max Hill, Britain’s Director of Public Prosecutions said in a statement. London’s Old Bailey court was told Abedi helped his brother get the components of the homemade bomb and that together they experimented with its construction, buying screws and nails to be used as shrapnel. They stored and made the device at a separate address in Manchester and, shortly before they returned to Libya in mid-April 2017, they bought a car to be used to store the bomb-making equipment. Hashem Abedi was in Libya when the attack took place and became the first suspect to be successfully extradited to Britain when he was sent back in July 2019. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Toilet paper ugliness not the worst of our post-coronavirus regrets","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/18\/garry-linnell-coronavirus-china\/","transcript":"Albert Einstein liked to say there are only two things that are infinite – the universe and human stupidity. He just wasn’t sure about the universe. In these times when it feels like our universe is coming to an end, the smartest man in history has been proven right again. There are no limits to human stupidity – or selfishness. So when this pandemic is over and we have buried the dead and begun the slow and painful revival of the economy, lest we forget: Feel free to add your own examples. It’s an almost infinite list that grows by the hour, a dark catalogue that confirms how that most basic instinct underpinning the human condition – self-interest – takes over when the right amount of pressure is applied. So let there be no doubt. We have looked in the mirror and seen our true selves staring back. It has not been a pretty sight. But as the politicians will undoubtedly remind us, we need to get over the ugliness for there are lessons to be learned. One of them, surely, is that it is time for us to stop bowing and pandering to China, the nation that lied to the world about the coronavirus when it first appeared and whose subsequent cover-up helped ignite this global pandemic. For years the West, including Australia, has preferred to look the other way as Chinese authorities stripped their citizens of basic human rights. The world, of course, has suffered plenty of brutal totalitarian regimes. But none have ever combined such dedication toward silencing dissent with sophisticated electronic surveillance and personal monitoring. Terrified of the consequences of intervening, we have muttered and stammered and offered a few lame, token protests. In doing so, we have become nothing more than the neighbours who lock their doors, close their windows and turn up the television volume whenever the thug next door begins his nightly wife-bashing routine. Even now, as the virus spreads around the world, linking its origins back to a “wet market” selling fish and other live animals in Wuhan – the capital city of Hubei province – is accompanied by accusations of xenophobia and racism. Better to gush and slavishly praise the Chinese for erecting two 1000-plus bed hospitals in little more than a week than point to the crippling cover-up that took place in the critical weeks before and after Christmas. Typical of the politically correct reaction is a recent article on The Conversation website by Rachel Clamp of Durham University that drew parallels between coronavirus and the Black Death of the 14th century. Linking the persecution of Jews during the Plague to a host of bizarre Internet conspiracy theories about COVOID-19, Ms Clamp claimed – on the basis of a few isolated incidents and a drop in patronage at Chinese restaurants – that Asians around the world were becoming the targets of racist attacks. “Our seemingly instinctive desire to scapegoat inevitably creates an epidemic of misinformation more potent than the virus itself,” she wrote. “As the coronavirus continues to spread, lessons from the past remain an important tool for preventing further racist and xenophobic attacks.” Indeed, lessons from the past will be important tools for dealing with the future. So lest we forget the doctors who were reprimanded by Chinese authorities when they first began to warn colleagues that they had identified a new virus. Lest we forget the late Li Wenliang, the doctor accused of “rumour-mongering” and “illegal behaviour” and whose warnings about COVID-19 were dismissed or minimised for valuable weeks after the outbreak first appeared. Dr Li, whose wife is due to give birth in June, died in early February after contracting the virus from a patient he was treating. Lest we forget growing evidence that the first appearance of COVID-19 was detected as far back as the middle of November and that Chinese authorities, having delayed warning Wuhan’s 11 million residents to take precautions, only began shutting down the city on January 23. Had the Chinese government acted earlier instead of concerning itself with appearances – the outbreak coincided with China’s annual meetings of People’s Congresses around the country – the world would have had more time to take stock and prepare. But then, as we have all been reminded in recent weeks, self-interest remains at the core of the human condition. It’s something those of us who survive the coming months will most certainly not forget. Garry Linnell was director of News and Current Affairs for the Nine network in the mid-2000s.

The retailer has suspended all sausage sizzles and will instead be donating gift cards to community groups that had pre-booked the popular fundraiser. The coronavirus had made it increasingly difficult for Bunnings to attract volunteers and maintain a steady supply of meat, contributing to its decision to suspend all sausage sizzles as of Wednesday. “Having listened closely to community groups, we’ve learned of the challenges many groups are facing finding volunteers and even supplies to sell given some of the reported challenges being faced by other retailers,” Bunnings Managing Director Mike Schneider said in a statement. “We also want to make sure our team remain focused on helping customers to access the products they need,” Mr Schneider said. He acknowledged the “important role these sausage sizzles play for thousands of local community groups and charities and that finding alternative fundraising opportunities at short notice isn’t easy”. Bunnings will be donating $500 gift cards to assist community groups that have sausage sizzles booked over the next month, he said. That will equate to an investment of more than $1.2 million to local groups across Australia and New Zealand, Mr Schroder. “There’s no doubt that our decision will disappoint some people in the community and we can’t wait to bring this much-loved community program back,” he said.

It comes as the vice president of Japan’s Olympic committee, Kozo Tashima, tested positive for the coronavirus after travelling to Britain, the Netherlands and the United States in the past month. A statement issued via the Japan Football Association, which he also heads, confirmed the diagnosis on Wednesday morning (Australian time). It cast further doubt on whether the Olympics should go ahead. In a statement on Wednesday morning (Australian time), the IOC confirmed it “remains fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, and with more than four months to go before the Games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage”. “Any speculation at this moment would be counter-productive,” it said, less than an hour after European soccer body UEFA postponed its 2020 European Championship to 2021. IOC President Thomas Bach encouraged all Olympic athletes to continue to prepare “as best they can” and said it was taking all necessary measures to keep them safe. Its decision to proceed as planned comes less than a week after Olympics chief Yoshiro Mori said his team was not even tossing up whether the Games should be suspended or postponed. He went so far as to say a board member had even apologised for suggesting there would be a delay to the Olympics because of the coronavirus. But around the world, there is growing alarm over the virus’ spread and sporting codes are changing schedules and halting games. Stopping large gatherings, such as crowds of sports fans,  is considered vital to ‘flattening the curve’ and halting the spread of the illness. Spain’s Olympic Committee president Alejandro Blanco said he would prefer the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed because his country’s athletes are unable to train due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The news that we get every day is uncomfortable for all countries in the world, but for us the most important thing is that our sportspeople cannot train and to celebrate the Games (as planned) would result in unequal conditions,” he said in a statement. “We want the Olympics to take place, but with security. We’re an important country in the world and four months before the games, our athletes can’t arrive in equal conditions.” Meanwhile, the French tennis federation has decided that it will be postponing the French Open tennis tournament until September 20-October 4 “in order to guarantee the health and safety of all those involved”, it said in a statement. It was initially scheduled to be played from May 24-June 7. “While no one today can predict what the health situation will be like on May 18 (when qualifications were due to start), the lockdown measures in force make it impossible to prepare for it and therefore to organise it on the dates initially planned,” the federation said. It is the first instance of a grand slam being affected by the virus that has spread around the world. The next major tennis championship currently on the calendar is Wimbledon, which is slated to start in late June in England. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"More coronavirus bans to change how Australians socialise","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-australians-cafes-pubs\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison is eyeing drastic new social distancing measures at hospitality venues in an attempt to stop the coronavirus spreading. New rules on how many Australians are allowed to gather at once are imminent, with the federal government to announce further virus prevention measures on Wednesday. The decisions will be based on advice from the nation’s chief medical officers, and are set to also focus on precautions for aged care homes and schools. Already Australians have been banned from attending events with more than 500 people. Tighter requirements are expected to be be announced to stop groups of people mixing in close quarters. It could mean restrictions will be in place on how many people gather at indoor venues such as pubs, clubs and cafes – a further blow to the hospitality industry suffering from lower patronage. The plan to reduce gathering numbers comes as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade urged those overseas are to come home as soon as possible. Late on Tuesday, the Department of Foreign Affairs updated its travel advice as the government warned Australians wanting to return home in future could become trapped as airlines restrict flights. “If you’re already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means,” the advice on the Smart Traveller website says. “As more countries close their borders or introduce travel restrictions, overseas travel is becoming more complex and difficult. You may not be able to return to Australia when you had planned to.” All people arriving from overseas must self-quarantine for 14 days and cruise ships are barred from Australian ports for at least 30 days. The federal government has also flagged a second round of economic stimulus measures on top of the $17.6 billion package announced last week. States have developed their own economic packages to lessen the blow caused by the virus, which is set to crush major industries and hurt workers. Australians have been encouraged to take steps for social distancing, while non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people have been banned. Most schools are already taking precautions, including cancelling excursions and assemblies. But a number of private schools have independently taken the decision to move to online classes. Chief medical officers haven’t ruled out school closures but they’re being cautious about the idea. Health Minister Greg Hunt said the government’s focus was on protecting vulnerable Australians. “This is our fundamental national task,” he said in Melbourne. “Because they are the ones who are most likely to have an impact from the coronavirus which could either be serious or could, of course, lead to a fatality.” A scaled-back federal parliament is on the cards for next week’s sitting, where the focus will be on passing legislation allowing the economic stimulus measures. It comes as a third coalition member, NSW senator Andrew Bragg, has tested positive for the virus after LNP senator Susan McDonald and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. The widespread impact of the virus has led to Australia’s highest court delaying cases for months, while major events have either been canned or postponed. Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has again implored the public not to panic buy. “This panic buying is just stupid and I really encourage Australians to take a deep breath and just buy what you need,” he said.

Normally, the popular snaps of Sydney’s beaches and pools that Eugene Tan takes are filled with crashing waves and green trees. But over the past few years NSW has struggled with a crippling drought, which was backed up by one of the worst bushfire seasons in history and images of Sydney covered in thick red smoke beamed across the world. The surf city went from blues to brown. And as it changed, so did Mr Tan’s work. To highlight how quickly the drought took hold, The New Daily put together these timelines below. Mr Tan’s new series, part of a project with SydneyWater, shows the affects of long-term drought on the city’s landscape. The aerial photos were taken a week before the February rainfall increased dam levels by more than 40 per cent. But they act as a reminder that saving water needs to be a way of life, given how quickly dams can deplete in a severe drought. “From the air I was shocked by how dry Sydney was,” Mr Tan said. “We think the dry, cracked land was only in rural areas, however last month it was on our doorstep. “It’s so important we continue to be considerate in how we use water around the home. “If this drought and project has taught me anything, it’s that water is a finite source that brings an enormous value to the thriving culture we have in Sydney.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australia’s coronavirus hotline rejects callers as it buckles under pressure","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-hotline\/","transcript":"Australia’s coronavirus hotline is buckling under demand, with one caller saying she was put on hold for more than five hours. Kylie Robertson called the hotline after her 13-year-old boy, Wally Brown presented flu-like symptoms. “I first called my local GP. They went ‘if it is as expected coronavirus, we don’t want you in the building. Call the hotline’,” she told The New Daily. Wally had been in contact with people from overseas, had aches and was feverish – it had come on suddenly. All the symptoms of a bad cold and COVID-19. “When you first get on the line, they ask you questions like, ‘Are you suffering from these symptoms?’ I answered yes to all of them. “I was put on hold for five-and-a-half hours.” Eventually, she hung up out of frustration. Wally is on the mend, but Ms Robertson is worried he could still be contagious. The mixed messages over public protocol haven’t helped, she said. “If he was really, really sick we would have gone to the hospital, but they don’t want you there,” Ms Robertson said. “My reality is now because it is getting worse, and the phones are more in demand, do I even bother trying to ring back? “They’re labelling it a state of emergency, so there should be clear information saying, ‘This is what you have to do, these are the steps you have to take’.” The New Daily tried six times over the course of Tuesday to call the hotline and was told on five of them the line was too busy to take the call. “The telecommunications network you are calling is temporarily congested,” the voice machine said. “We apologise for any inconvenience. Please try again later.” In the afternoon, it finally picked up. The service is struggling to meet demands, with calls in the past week surging up to 9000 per day. A spokesperson for Health Direct, the publicly funded company providing the Telehealth services to Australia, said the average wait times were sitting around one hour. “We have just added a COVID-19 clinical assessment tool to the service, which is experiencing average wait times of around an hour,” she said. “During peak times we have additional nurses answering calls and we are ramping up capacity over the coming week to meet demand. “These are the same nurses that work on the front line, delivering care to patients in the health system, so we are conscious about managing their capacity and welfare. “We understand this is a time of high anxiety for many and apologise for any inconvenience. We are working to improve the wait time across the service.” The Australian Health Department said concerned Australians could also get information from health.gov.au and the World Health Organisation website. “These calls are being answered promptly and shouldn’t result in a significant wait time,” a spokesperson said. “There is also a wealth of information on the health.gov.au website, the health direct website, the World Health Organisation website and the state and territory health department websites to guide people.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Prince Harry, Meghan take 'precautions' over suspected virus exposure","date":"03-18-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/royal\/2020\/03\/18\/prince-harry-meghan-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly taking “necessary precautions” amid reports that he might have been exposed to coronavirus during his last round on royal engagements in Britain. The couple are back in their Canadian hideaway with their baby son, Archie, after a whirlwind of official outings – where they are said to be “taking government advice” about COVID-19. Prince Harry’s possible exposure came at the opening of the Silverstone Experience Centre on March 6, where he hugged Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. Two days earlier, Hamilton appeared at the charity events in London alongside actor Idris Elba and wife of the Canadian prime minister Sophie Grégoire Trudeau. Both have since confirmed they have tested positive for COVID-19. Hamilton has not yet commented on whether he has been tested. “Like everyone, [Meghan and Harry] are taking government advice, and if and when they are specifically made aware of being in contact with someone who has tested positive they will act accordingly,” a royal source told People magazine. On Tuesday, Canada – which then had nearly 450 confirmed cases of the coronavirus – closed its borders to anyone except citizens, permanent residents and US citizens. “We will be denying entry to Canada to people who are not Canadian citizens, or permanent residents,” Mr Trudeau said. “This measure will carve out some designated exceptions including for air crews, diplomats, immediate family members of Canadian citizens, and at this time, US citizens.” It is not known what that means for Prince Harry, as he does not fit any of those designations. Meanwhile, the Queen has cancelled garden parties at London’s Buckingham Palace and will leave the palace on Thursday for Windsor Castle as a “sensible precaution” amid Britain’s coronavirus outbreak. Several meetings at Buckingham Palace this week, including the Queen’s audience with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, would go ahead as as planned, it said. “Her Majesty will move to Windsor Castle for the Easter period on Thursday, March 19, one week earlier than planned,” the palace said. “It is likely the Queen will stay there beyond the Easter period.” It said the changes to the 93-year-old monarch’s plans were made “as a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances”. Officials are are also concerned for the 98-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, who since retiring spends most of his time on the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Other events expected to be attended by the Queen and other members of the royal family, as well as large numbers of people, in coming months will be cancelled or postponed. They include five garden parties scheduled from May at Buckingham Palace, and investitures (where people are presented with awards such as knighthoods by a senior royal).

The diagnosis has raised fresh fears that Mr Dutton may have passed on the killer virus to cabinet, bringing into question the wisdom of Scott Morrison’s decision not to be tested for the virus on medical advice. The New Daily has confirmed that Cornerstone Group founder Joseph Tannous had contact with Mr Dutton on the same day he attended a four-hour federal cabinet meeting last Tuesday with the entire frontbench, including Mr Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in Sydney. Although Mr Tannous does not know for certain who infected him, or how he caught the virus, he confirmed the only contact he had with a known coronavirus sufferer was Mr Dutton. He received an email on Friday from the Liberal Party that Mr Dutton had tested positive and he should consider testing if he had symptoms. “They’ve been good. They’ve followed through and when I got tested I told them,” Mr Tannous told The New Daily. “I got an email from the Liberal Party, the organisers, just to say that Dutton had tested positive and they suggested I got tested. “I started to get a bit of a cough on Friday afternoon. I thought, ‘OK, there are no symptoms I don’t have a sore throat or a fever’. Then on Sunday, I started to get vomiting and cough got worse. I went and got tested.” He said the coronavirus symptoms were “not good” but he was at home with his family. “Hot and cold flushes. Lots of vomiting in the last 48 hours. It hasn’t been great. But it is what it is. It’s extraordinary times,” he said. “We’ve just got to suck it up and deal with it.” Mr Dutton and Mr Tannous did not sit next to each other at the Liberal fundraiser. He sat next to Brisbane Broncos chairman Karl Morris, who has self-isolated and was tested as a precaution. The New Daily understands his results came back negative. Despite insisting that the federal cabinet does not need to be tested for the virus, the contact between Mr Dutton and the businessman on Tuesday, March 10 has raised fresh concerns over the medical advice that he was not contagious before showing symptoms. On Friday night the Prime Minister’s office insisted that there was no need for federal cabinet to be tested because Mr Dutton was not showing symptoms on Tuesday. “The minister attended Tuesday’s meeting of the federal cabinet in person and Thursday’s meeting of the National Security Committee via video link,” a spokesman said. “In advice provided to the Prime Minister this evening, the deputy chief medical officer has reiterated that only people who had close contact with the minister in the preceding 24 hours before he became symptomatic need to self-isolate. “That does not include the Prime Minister or any other members of the cabinet.” I've been discharged from hospital and am at home self-isolating with my dog Ralph.

The PM’s spokesman said he planned to attend because he did not want to create any unnecessary alarm as a result of the new arrangements. He subsequently decided not to attend following Mr Dutton’s diagnosis because it might be misconstrued or misrepresented. Australia’s Parliament will meet next week to pass the stimulus package with just 90 MPs and a skeleton staff in the House of Representatives to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. It comes as political leaders prepare to consider banning gatherings of just 100 people or less. The move could have a devastating effect on bars, restaurants and gyms and the Morrison government is considering a further stimulus package on Wednesday. Mr Morrison told Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese in a phone conversation on Tuesday that the government would offer 30 ‘pairs’ to ensure that not all MPs needed to fly to Canberra for the vote.

The video, which has racked up more than two million views in just two days, features recorded messages from people who don’t want other countries to follow Italy down the same fateful path that caused a nation of 60 million to be confined to their homes. The caption for the video reads: “It is believed nations like the US, England, France, Spain and Germany are about 9 to 10 days behind Italy in the COVID19 progression. We asked people from all around Italy to record a message to themselves of 10 days prior.” A woman speaking through a face mask admitted she used to make fun of people wearing face masks. Another woman’s message stemmed from the regret of not taking her mother’s advice to stockpile on masks and is now stuck at home under mandatory quarantine. It was only 10 days ago when another citizen recalled being able to attend work meetings, have dinner with friends, go to the gym and hairdresser – just “the usual boring things”. That’s what many other countries like Australia continue to do – but that won’t be for long if greater precautions aren’t taken to stop the spread of infections and prevent health care services from being stretched far beyond their capacity.  It’s too late for Italy, which is the second-worst affected country after China. “Nobody can leave their house unless they have a very serious reason,” one person said. “You’ll realise that even just being able to breathe air in your own house … it’s something you should already be grateful for,” another said. The Italians shared insights into just how much their lives have changed since their government imposed unprecedented national restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. “Hospitals are literally blowing up, lots of infections even among young people,” one said. “There are currently kids our age who are intubated and in intensive care,” the video continued. The video was created in hopes that people from other countries would realise the best thing for them to do was to stay home. “If you must go outside, only do it if indispensable,” it continued. “Because what you’re risking is not a regular ‘flu’. “The issue is more serious than most of the world believes. “This is not unfounded pessimism.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Economic relief on the cards as Chinese factories reopen","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/03\/17\/coronavirus-economy-manufacturing\/","transcript":"Australia’s embattled economy has been given a small reprieve as China’s once-quiet factories whir back to life.

Professor James Laurenceson, from the University of Technology Sydney’s Australia-China Relations Institute, said many Australian industries will benefit from the recovery in Chinese production. “The Chinese government made some awful mistakes at the start by shutting down the free flow of information,” Professor Laurenceson told The New Daily. “But once they admitted the extent of the problem, they do deserve some credit for getting the virus’ spread under control. “I think we’ve probably got another one or two months in China before they’re back to their peak [manufacturing capacity].” That spells good news for Australians as it means fewer disruptions to supply chains.  The coronavirus factory shutdowns put a dent in the manufacture of pesticides and herbicides used by Australian farmers to protect their crops. Farmers haven’t been directly affected by that slowdown yet, but IBISWorld senior industry analyst Yin Yeoh said things were beginning to look risky. “I’ve seen people say if the Chinese factories don’t reopen in time they won’t have enough pesticides for their July crops,” she said. A spokesperson for the National Farmers Federation (NFF) said the problem never reached a critical point, but the uptick in Chinese activity is nevertheless “welcome news for Australian farmers”. “Following much-needed, widespread rainfall during the start of the year, many grain growers are now starting to turn their mind to sowing a winter crop. Some farmers have not had a crop for consecutive years due to drought,” the NFF said. The recent rains created more demand for these crop-protection chemicals just as China’s production plummeted. But the NFF said it’s unlikely farmers will go without now the factories are up and running again. A spokesperson from national agribusiness Elders told The New Daily deliveries from China should return to normal by the end of April. “Supply will continue to be restricted through March,” it said. “Delivery of key products will arrive late March and through April which will meet forecast demand. Products required beyond that will be delivered as per normal seasonal timing.” The materials used to build Australia’s apartment blocks come primarily from China, and factory closures have created delays for builders. CFMEU national secretary Dave Noonan said the pressure this has caused is still visible, but said it’s “probably true” that supply will start returning to normal within the next two months. “It’ll be welcome if it’s true, but what we’re hearing from contractors is that there are still delays,” he said. “It will depend on what happens next because there’s now talk of a second wave [of coronavirus infections] in China now.” The construction sector is a major part of Australia’s economy, employing 1,190,500 people, or 9.2 per cent of the total labour force. Retail is another sector that has suffered from the closure of Chinese factories, with many ‘made-in-China’ labelled products simply unavailable. Although the reopening of factories will remove some of that supply-side pressure, Ms Yeoh said affected businesses are still likely to struggle as shoppers simply aren’t venturing into stores. “Those who have faced difficulty sourcing their products will find it easier to secure those items,” she said. “But if people aren’t walking into stores and there’s less foot traffic, getting in products is unlikely to help retailers.” Shop owners’ best hope of finding a lifeline will be to focus on online sales – allowing self-isolating Australians to comfortably buy goods without risking their health or the wellbeing of those around them. The good news for consumers is that a lift in Chinese production could help refill barren supermarket shelves. “I wouldn’t say toilet paper will be affected, but we do import food from China, frozen stuff and also canned products,” Ms Yeoh said. Many of the key ingredients used in the medications Australians rely on are also manufactured in China, putting pharmaceutical companies under pressure, Ms Yeoh said. But Professor Laurenceson said the pharmaceutical industry’s supply chain is more complex than most because they require inputs from multiple countries – meaning the reopening of Chinese factories won’t end the industry’s problems. “If we import a finished drug from India, often some of the ingredients for that drug will come from China, so it’s not simply about the Chinese factories aren’t working any more,” he said. “Even if a Chinese factory got up and running and was producing the ingredient again, then the challenge you might face is Indian factories might go down and they’re the ones we import from.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australians overseas urged to return home as soon as possible","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/17\/australians-overseas-urged-return-home\/","transcript":"Australians overseas have been urged to return home as soon as possible as the Morrison government prepares to unveil a new stimulus package to protect the airline industry from collapse over the coronavirus outbreak.

Like many public attractions, the US site has shut down to public visitors until at least the end of March. But that doesn’t mean everyone has gone home – the permanent residents (the animals) and their carers (aquarium staffers) are still hanging out around the clock. As the world shifts into a new mindset of working from home – and not going stir crazy in the process – the aquarium is coming up with some novel ways to entertain itself, and the outside world. This week,  Shedd’s penguins made like Ferris Bueller and had a day off from the Arctic, visiting the Amazon, south-east Asia, and even the reception desk.  Penguins in the Amazon?! 🐧🌴 Some of the penguins went on a field trip to meet other animals at Shedd. Wellington seemed most interested in the fishes in Amazon Rising!

If large crowds have been banned to limit the spread of COVID-19, why should parents feel OK sending their children to schools where dozens sit in tightly packed classrooms? Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision to cancel non-essential events with more than 500 attendees was “precautionary” at this stage. “It is getting ahead of this to ensure that we can minimise the impact on your health and [so] we can ensure with confidence the ability for people to be accessing the health services that they and their families will need,” Mr Morrison told reporters. Australia’s chief medical officer added: “The risk to the Australian community in general still remains low, (as) most of our cases are still imported”. Even though COVID-19 is not rapidly spreading through our communities just yet, some have suggested it would be wise to shut down schools as a “precaution”. But shutting down schools can cause other problems, like childcare issues. In most Australian families, it is common for both parents to work, some part-time and many full-time. If school is suddenly cancelled, millions of parents will be left scrambling to sort out childcare arrangements so they can keep going to work to earn money for their families. Julian Rait, Victorian president of the Australian Medical Association, said closing down schools could inadvertently end up putting pressure on our health systems. “You could have couples where both parents are healthcare workers, what do they do?” Professor Rait told the ABC. “We don’t want them out of work, especially at a time when there may be other people missing from the workforce because of ill health.” Although there have been no reports of children dying from the coronavirus so far, it is possible that children could be unwittingly spreading it without showing many – or any – symptoms. And those most likely to suffer the worst effects of the virus are the elderly or people with a pre-existing health condition. Who do many parents turn to when they urgently need a babysitter? Their parents. Professor Rait said he was worried that if schools were shut down then grandparents – some of our most vulnerable to COVID-19 – could be relied upon to look after children."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NAB HQ evacuated after worker contracts coronavirus","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/17\/nab-bank-coronavirus-hq\/","transcript":"Hundreds of NAB workers were ordered to evacuate their Melbourne office building on Tuesday afternoon after a worker tested positive for COVID-19.

The doctors are demanding state and federal governments implement strict lockdown and social distancing, and ramp up health resources to cope with a surge in critically ill patients. The demands are outlined in an open letter currently circulating among doctors. The letter’s author, intensive care specialist Greg Kelly, told the ABC he consulted with intensive care colleagues at several major hospitals in Melbourne and Sydney when formulating the call for action. “We are almost at 4000 signatories,” he said, adding he was confident “at least 3500” were doctors. The ABC has not been able to verify those figures. According to the letter, Australia’s health system and spread of age demographics are similar to Italy’s, rather than China’s. “On current growth rates, the 300 cases in Australia today will be … 10,000 by the 4th of April” the letter reads. They argue that under current preparations, Australia will be “in a worse position than Italy is currently in”. Italian doctors are reporting they do not have the necessary ventilators and other resources needed to save critically ill COVID-19 patients, and they have been forced to make the wrenching choice between patients who can be helped and those who will be refused the treatment necessary to save their lives. The Australian doctors’ letter points out that the death rate in Italy is “very high” – much higher than in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late December. It calls on the Government to heed the lessons of China, Singapore, Korea and Taiwan, which have enforced widespread economic lockdown and social distancing measures greater than what have so far been adopted in Australia. “We believe that Australian federal and state governments can avert disaster by heeding the lessons of other countries,” it says. The Federal Government said today it was taking medical advice on whether it needed to bring in a new wave of restrictions. “We will continue to act as we are advised,” Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said. “As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday in relation to some of these things, it is important to time these decisions in the right way.” Frontline general practitioners have told the ABC they believe the Australian Government is ignoring what has been learned in those Asian countries. “We have had two months to prepare for this,” Victorian GP Ern Chang told the ABC. He said Australia should learn from countries which had dealt with previous pandemics and adjusted their health systems in response. “Singapore and Hong Kong had SARS”, he said. “Singapore has a National Centre for Infectious Diseases and has an all-of-government, consistent response.” The Australian Medical Association distanced itself from the sentiments expressed in the letter. “The AMA do not believe that the actions proposed in the letter are necessary yet”, it said. “There are many messages out in the community – from official and unofficial sources, from individuals and groups. “[Chief medical officer] Professor Brendan Murphy … will provide advice on these matters at the appropriate time, based on the best available medical evidence.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus scam text message in circulation | The New Daily","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/17\/coronavirus-scam-text-message\/","transcript":"Australians are being warned of a scam text message, capitalising on the coronavirus outbreak.

The new national cabinet, comprising Prime Minister Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders, was to meet late on Tuesday to firm up details of the stimulus plans, which come as the number of people testing positive to COVID-19 rose again. Victoria had 23 new cases overnight on Monday (now 94 cases) and NSW had 39 in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 210. As of 2pm on Tuesday, Australia had 377 people testing positive to the deadly virus, with the death toll remaining at five. Among them was the country’s third federal politician, with NSW Liberal senator Andrew Bragg confirming he had contracted coronavirus. Queensland LNP senator Susan McDonald confirmed her diagnosis on Monday, while Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton is quarantined at home after being diagnosed on Friday. On Tuesday, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the proposed stimulus package, off the back of a $17.6 billion package announced last week, was in line with unprecedented measures to help Australia through the spread of the global pandemic. Senator Cormann warned the “grim reality” was that some businesses would close because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, noting hospitality and tourism would be hit hard. “The grim reality is some businesses will close and some Australians will lose their jobs,” he told Sky News on Tuesday. “We are focused on supporting those businesses and workers most affected by the downturn of the coronavirus,” he told the Seven Network. Meanwhile, NSW residents have been offered a further financial lifeline, with Premier Gladys Berejiklian announcing a $2.3 billion stimulus package, consisting of $700 million for healthcare and $1.6 billion for job creation and tax relief. There’s also concern about aviation after Qantas cut international flights by 90 per cent and domestic routes by 60 per cent. Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham would not rule out a bailout. Senator Cormann raised the prospect of Qantas and Virgin workers being used to help surging demand at the big supermarkets. Labor will back the government’s stimulus measures when they hit parliament next week. On Tuesday, the public service commission confirmed casual workers required to self-isolate or afflicted with the coronavirus will get access to paid leave. The Reserve Bank predicts a 10 per cent drop in services exports during the March quarter because of a steep decline in inbound arrivals. “This effect alone was expected to lower Australian GDP growth by around 0.5 percentage point in the March quarter,” minutes from the RBA’s most recent meeting note. “Tourism and education exports were expected to remain low in the June quarter, before returning to their previous levels over the second half of the year as the Chinese economy recovers and travel resumes.” The estimate does not include potential supply chain disruptions and further measures to stop the spread of the virus. Major features of the state’s stimulus package include capital works investments, payroll tax relief and waiving charges and licence fees for small businesses. There has been $700 million earmarked to ramp up COVID-19 testing, establish dedicated fever clinics and double intensive care capacity. “Our approach in relation to dollars in NSW will be first and foremost to save lives. I don’t ever want to look back and think we should have done more,” Ms Berejiklian said on Tuesday. “I don’t want to look back and say, ‘Why didn’t we give health what they asked for?’. So the Treasurer went to health and asked what they need. “I want a no-regrets policy.” Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the state was on track to experience a “substantial exponential increase” in coronavirus infections. The number of confirmed cased of COVID-19 in NSW almost doubled over the weekend. On Tuesday morning, it reached 210. Mr Hazzard on Monday said the virus “has very much a mind of its own”. “It knows that at the moment across the world it’s winning the battle, here in NSW I think we’re holding the line, but we still need to do a lot more work as it evolves,” he told reporters in Sydney. Meanwhile major public events across the state continue to be cancelled or postponed. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Premiers under growing pressure to close nation's schools","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/17\/schools-close-coronavirus\/","transcript":"State premiers and chief medical officers are resisting growing calls to shut Australia’s schools as the deadly coronavirus spreads. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said closing schools might do more harm than good. “I know many, many parents are anxious, they’re concerned, and I know to a certain extent it’s a bit counterintuitive that schools remain open,” he said on Tuesday. “But the advice is, closing schools now – that’s not to say they won’t close at some stage in the future – but if we were to close them now, across the board, that could make a very difficult set of circumstances even worse. “It could do more harm than good.” Another 23 cases of COVID-19 were been recorded in Victoria overnight on Monday, taking the state’s total number of positive tests to 94. One of them was a teacher at Toorak Primary School in Melbourne’s inner south-east. It closed for at least 24 hours from Tuesday after confirmation of the infection. And while schools in general have been told to remain open, some private schools – including Ballarat Grammar, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Loreto Mandeville Hall, St Kevin’s and Yeshiva-Beth Rivkah College – have shut their gates regardless. In NSW, the teachers’ union said misinformation and a lack of support was putting NSW educators at risk amid the COVID-19 pandemic. NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said the state government needed to provide clearer messaging for schools and institutions as many struggled with a lack of resources and poor cleaning practices. He also said the implementation of social distancing measures was difficult for many NSW schools due to overcrowding. “So far the advice on coronavirus has been conflicting, contradictory and impossible,” Mr Gavrielatos said on Tuesday. “It is unacceptable that our schools, teachers and principals are left carrying the can with respect to what should be a government responsibility.” Parents should exercise their own discretion when deciding whether to send their children to school, Mr Gavrielatos added. That came amid anecdotal reports of many parents option to withdraw their children from schools – with attendance rates in some classrooms this week as low as 50 per cent. Macquarie University in Sydney’s northwest confirmed on Monday a student had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The student is receiving appropriate care, the university said in a statement. Campus areas were “intensively cleaned” overnight. The university had earlier on Tuesday announced the suspension of classes from March 18 with teaching to resume on March 30. Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said the decision not to close schools was based on how the coronavirus presented in children, and to avoid busy health and emergency workers being forced to look after their children. It comes despite the federal government’s ban on non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino said the advice was that it was best to close schools closer to the peak of the infection. If government schools were forced to shut, teachers would continue to be paid and would keep working on their laptops, he said. Some of Victoria’s biggest universities are moving classes online after a state of emergency was declared in Victoria to deal with the spread of COVID-19. From Tuesday, La Trobe, Monash and Swinburne universities have suspended classes for the week to allow staff to prepare for online learning. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan also resisted renewed calls to close schools and shut down parliament, which would be an “absolute last resort”. “I want our society to continue to function,” he said on Tuesday. Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace told state parliament on Tuesday that the state’s government and independent schools were working together during the COVID-19 crisis. “Queensland state schools will remain open until further notice,” Ms Grace said. “If there is a need to close individuals schools these decisions will be made quickly based on further advice from health experts.” Any school that needed to close following confirmation of a case of the lethal coronavirus would remain shut until Queensland Health could complete contact tracing, she said. School gatherings including assemblies and fetes should also be cancelled to quell the surge of the virus. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"MONA shuts doors as Tasmania declares public health emergency | The New Daily","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/17\/mona-shuts-tasmania-declares-public-health-emergency\/","transcript":"Tasmania has declared a public health emergency amid the coronavirus pandemic, while the state’s popular Museum of New and Old Art will shut indefinitely.

Instead, the local share market unexpectedly surged, attempting to rebound from yesterday’s panic sell-off, which was also its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday crash. By 2.05pm AEDT, the All Ords index was up 2.7 per cent to 5194 points, while the ASX 200 was up 3.1 per cent. Shortly after 12pm, the indices had been up more than 4 per cent as US stock futures predicted a strong rebound (at least 5 per cent) on Wall Street tomorrow. Overnight, Wall Street experienced a bout of panic selling, with the Dow Jones index dropping 13 per cent, its biggest fall in three decades. “This is 2008, but with a completely different focus,” said Axicorp market strategist Stephen Innes, referring to the global financial crisis. “This isn’t a banking crisis, it’s a global economic crisis where virtually every global industry will be facing extreme pressure without a public bailout.” The best performing stock was Metcash (+18.3p), the company which owns the IGA grocery stores and Mitre 10 hardware stores. This was after investment bank UBS, in an investment note, upgraded its rating to “buy” from “neutral”. “We believe COVID-19 will embed new behaviours in consumers, potentially leading to an acceleration in the rate of online penetration (both grocery & fast food) and is likely to see a return to cooking at home, at least in the near term,” the bank said in its research. UBS also upgraded its rating for Coles (neutral) and Woolworths (buy), which led to their share price jumping 8.3 and 5.4 per cent respectively. Many of Tuesday’s best performers are gold stocks like Saracen Mineral, Northern Star Resources and Resolute Mining, which have rocketed by more than 15 per cent each. This was despite a fall in the precious metal’s spot price, down 0.5 per cent to $US1506.91 an ounce.

Mining giants are also pushing the local bourse higher with BHP jumping 9 per cent, while Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals are up more than 5 per cent. The travel industry has been hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with shares in Qantas down another 3.3 per cent (bringing its total losses to 59 per cent since the year began). This was after the airline said it would cut international capacity by 90 per cent, and domestic capacity by 60 per cent, until at least the end of May. Webjet shares fell by 3.5 per cent after the Government introduced tougher restrictions, requiring everyone who enters Australia to undergo a two-week self-isolation period. Since January, the online travel booking company’s share price has plummeted by 71 per cent. Commercial real estate is also feeling the impact of the outbreak, particularly Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which saw its share price sink 30 per cent. The COVID-19 crisis has led to European governments forcing the “non-essential” stores within its shopping centres to close in France, Spain, Poland, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, the company said in a statement to the ASX. The announcement does not apply to Westfield malls in Australia. Despite its shopping centres being “substantially closed”, its supermarket, food store and pharmacy tenants are still typically allowed to open, the company said in a statement. The Australian dollar was steady at 61.2 US cents."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Police axe random breath-testing amid coronavirus concerns","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/crime-news\/2020\/03\/17\/police-random-breath-testing-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Police forces across Australia have suspended high-volume random breath-testing of motorists due to the widening coronavirus outbreak. Police in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia said mass tests for drugs and alcohol – such as from booze buses – would not be conducted for the foreseeable future. “The decision has been made to minimise health risks to Queensland Police Service (QPS) officers and the community,” Queensland Police said in a statement that echoed the other states’ police forces. “Road safety continues to be a significant priority for the QPS. The QPS will continue to undertake random breath and drug testing through high visibility mobile patrols.” The move is designed to help close the spread of the deadly COVID-19. All police forces will instead boost mobile patrols to conduct random testing of drivers for alcohol and drugs. NSW Police announced on Tuesday it would follow its Queensland colleagues. The decision was made by NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller and Emergency Services Minister David Elliott, with a statement saying “officers will use their discretion to determine the viability of conducting stationary RBT and RDT”. Mobile patrols will continue. Victoria Police said also said mobile breath tests would still be conducted across the state. “We don’t want the community to be under any misapprehension that we’re not out there testing or not out there trying to enforce road rules. This is just a different way of doing them,” a spokeswoman said. She said Victoria Police wanted to be “as visible as we can be to the community” in coming weeks to provide reassurance. “We want to reassure the community that public order is being enforced by police,” she said. “We are here to keep the community safe as they move about.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Doubt cast on whether Tokyo Olympics will go ahead on time | The New Daily","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/17\/coronavirus-olympic-games\/","transcript":"In another sign the 2020 Olympic Games may be postponed, the European, Americas and final world qualifying boxing tournaments for the Games were suspended on Monday after falling victim to the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the globe. The latest announcement comes as France’s Olympic Games boss said the games should be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic was still raging in May. “My feeling is that if we’re still in the crisis by the end of May I can’t see how the Games can happen (on time),” Denis Masseglia said in a telephone interview with Reuters on Tuesday (AEDT). “If we are beyond the peak and the situation is getting better questions will arise about who qualifies, but we will find the least worst solution.” The IOC will hold talks with heads of international sports organisations on Wednesday (AEDT) in response to COVID-19 and will also hold an unscheduled Executive Board teleconference to discuss the latest developments. Sports competitions ground to a halt across Europe and the US in recent days, and the Australian football codes have revised down their playing schedules, suspended competitions and, at this stage, given the go-ahead for AFL games in round one without crowds. The IOC’s Boxing Task Force (BTF) is organising the events after the suspension last year of world body AIBA, acted as countries went into lockdown and sport ground to a halt. The Americas and final world tournaments have yet to happen but the 10-day European event at London’s Copper Box, on the site of the 2012 Olympics, was already into its third day of competition. Sixteen male boxers, flyweights and featherweights, still managed to secure their tickets to Tokyo before the shutdown came into force at the end of Monday’s evening session. The BTF had already closed the doors to spectators after Sunday’s sessions. Africa, Asia and Oceania have held their qualifying tournaments while the America’s one scheduled for Buenos Aires on March 26-April 3 was postponed last week. The final worlds were due in Paris on May 13-20. The Asia and Oceania event was held in Amman, Jordan, this month after being moved from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic. The task force said it would provide details on the qualification process for the other regions at a later date. “The BTF … took the decision to suspend the event today, amid increasing global travel restrictions and quarantine measures, in order to allow the participants from over 60 countries to adjust their travel plans and return home,” the IOC said in a statement. “The BTF’s priority remains the qualification of athletes on the field of play, and it will inform all stakeholders as soon as more information is available,” it said. Mr Masseglia said Japan had been tackling the spread of the virus perfectly. “A week ago, I couldn’t even imagine the situation we’re in today (in Europe). When I came back on Saturday morning (from Japan) I came back confident, optimistic, telling myself the Japanese had handled the problem a little differently,” he said. “They are in extreme precaution, there are water-based gels everywhere. Everybody wears a mask, they work almost normally.” The Tokyo Olympics are scheduled for July 24 to August 9 with the Paralympic Games due to be held from August 25 to September 6. The coronavirus pandemic has infected almost 182,000 people and killed 7115 worldwide, with the epicentre switching from China to Europe. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Qantas slashes seats by 90 per cent, warns on jobs","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/17\/qantas-coronavirus-seats-jobs\/","transcript":"Qantas will slash its international seats by 90 per cent, and domestic capacity by 60 per cent, until the end of May as it struggles with the collapse in demand from the global coronavirus pandemic. The sweeping cuts, announced on Tuesday morning, are on top of reductions announced last week. In total, they represent the grounding of about 150 planes – including almost all of Qantas and Jetstar’s wide-body fleets. Qantas, which had already urged its staff to use up any available leave and repeated that call on Tuesday, said “the precipitous decline in demand and resulting cuts to flying mean that the Qantas Group is confronted with a significant labour surplus across its operations”. “Travel demand is unlikely to rebound for weeks or possibly months and the impact of this will be felt across the entire workforce of 30,000 people,” it said. Qantas has already said that chief executive Alan Joyce and board chairman Richard Goyder will have their pay frozen for the remainder of this financial year. There have been other pay freezes for the group’s management and board members. Other flight reductions already announced will remain, at least until September. The route-by-route detail of the latest changes across Qantas and Jetstar will be announced in coming days. Qantas’s dramatic cuts came as a leading Australian aviation expert warned most of the world’s airlines could be bankrupt by the end of May without enormous and coordinated government and industry bailouts. Sydney-based airline analyst and consultant CAPA Centre for Aviation said airlines faced a huge threat from the coronavirus fallout. “Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented,” CAPA said in a report. “Normality is not yet on the horizon.” Restrictions on international travel due to the deadly coronavirus outbreak are hammering the airline and wider travel industry. International travellers are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Australia. New Zealand has also imposed the same rules for travellers to that country. On Monday, Air New Zealand put its shares into a trading halt as it slashed passenger capacity by 85 per cent. It also said it would make some of its staff redundant. “We are now accepting that for the coming months at least Air New Zealand will be a smaller airline requiring fewer resources, including people,” Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran said. In the US, United Airlines Holdings booked $US1.5 billion less revenue in March than the same time last year. It has told employees that planes might fly nearly empty into the northern summer, even after severe flight cuts. United said it would cut corporate officers’ salaries by 50 per cent and reduce flight capacity by about 50 per cent in April and May. “This crisis is moving really quickly,” United chief executive Oscar Munoz and president Scott Kirby said in a memo to employees on Sunday. Things worsened over the weekend as Spain declared a state of emergency and the Trump administration added Britain and Ireland to countries facing travel bans. “We call on Congress and the White House to take all measures available to protect the health and payroll of American workers,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 US flight attendants at 20 airlines. US President Donald Trump committed on Monday (US time) to helping the airlines – but has not commented on the roughly $US50 billion ($A81 billion) in assistance the industry has sought. “We’re going to back the airlines 100 percent,” Mr Trump said in a White House briefing. “We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much.” UK airlines have asked the British government to help ensure their survival, while Germany’s Tui AG and Scandinavian carrier SAS said they would suspend the vast majority of operations due to the COVID-19 outbreak and apply for government support. UBS analysts said the latest travel restrictions would have a significant effect on Qantas’ international traffic, which historically accounted for about 45 per cent of revenue and 25 per cent of earnings before interest and tax. “A downside scenario where international traffic is down 50 per cent for a whole year and domestic down 30 per cent could result in cash burn of up to A$200 million ($123.60 million) per month after incorporating changes to the business,” UBS said of Qantas. Rival Virgin Australia, which has a weaker balance sheet but a heavier domestic focus, said it was assessing its response to the new travel restrictions. S&P Global Ratings downgraded its credit rating on Virgin to B- and placed it on creditwatch negative due to rapidly deterioriating industry conditions spreading from the international market to the domestic market. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Community hour’: Elderly flock to supermarkets for exclusive shopping","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/17\/supermarkets-open-early-elderly\/","transcript":"Supermarket tension has reached crisis point as a Woolworths supermarket staffer was stabbed and dozens of angry, elderly shoppers left empty-handed during a dedicated “community hour”. Police said an employee, 37, was collecting trolleys in the supermarket carpark when he was approached by an unknown man and allegedly  stabbed to the lower body on Tuesday afternoon. He was airlifted to a Melbourne hospital from Rosebud with stab wounds in a serious but stable condition. Police arrested a 25-year-old Rosebud man a short time later. A Victoria Police spokesperson said the incident was not in relation to “panic buying’ in supermarkets. General Manager Woolworths Supermarkets Victoria, John Di Tirro, said their thoughts were with the injured man. “Our thoughts are with our team member and his loved ones at this difficult time and we’ll be offering them our full support,” he said in a statement. Meanwhile, as thousands queued outside Woolworths supermarkets on Tuesday morning for a dedicated hour of shopping running nationally between 7am and 8am, many were left disappointed and without the grocery items they needed most. “It’s day one of our dedicated shopping hour and we know it wasn’t perfect across all of our stores,” Woolworths Managing Director Claire Peters said in a statement. Former Radio 3AW journalist Ron Bourke said hundreds were queued when doors opened at Woolworths in Sunshine, in Melbourne’s west. “There’s a big crowd here, about 200 people,” he told 3AW’s Ross and John. “It’s getting slightly aggressive at the moment because security has just come out and told everyone to move back a bit as they can’t open the doors. “Just a little while ago there was quite a bit of verbal argument with people coming in from the side and trying to push into the queue.” Scenes of elderly residents arriving before dawn in taxis, community buses and being dropped off by relatives, many with walking frames and short scribbled shopping lists, will now be the norm as the global coronavirus pandemic rages. “We are the most vulnerable, people over 65, so we need to be careful,” one grateful senior told the ABC. Woolworths fresh food director Paul Harker said the initiative had proved popular on Tuesday morning but agreed there were still shortages of toilet paper and pasta. “Our supply chains are working 24\/7 to make sure they get product to our stores,” he said. He insisted there was no shortage of goods, despite reports of widespread products shortfalls. “There is no shortage of goods here in Australia,” he told the Nine Network on Tuesday. The duplicate so-called “community hour” at rival Coles will begin on Wednesday, which has also further limited shoppers’ purchases. It will restrict shoppers to two packets each of eggs, chilled pasta, frozen vegetables and frozen dessert. Coles’ latest move comes amid reports worried consumers are stockpiling vast loads of freezer goods, including meat. There are also anecdotal reports of city shoppers hiring buses to drive to rural supermarkets to clear their shelves of food. Coles is also seeking more than 5000 casual workers to help keep its shops stocked. It will also hire more drivers for online deliveries. The supermarkets started the dedicated shopping hour for the elderly and vulnerable to help those who have been disadvantaged by panic buying as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Supermarkets at both chains open to everyone else after 8am. They are also closing earlier than normal to allow shelves to be properly restocked. Australia’s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy told Sydney Radio 2GB on Tuesday that the ongoing frenzied buying was “just stupid”. “The chances of any given Australian citizen suddenly being asked to quarantine are pretty low,” he said. “This panic buying is just stupid and I really encourage Australians to take a deep breath and buy what you need.” Supermarkets across the country have been stripped of toilet paper, hand sanitiser, pasta, rice and frozen food, and tinned and other dried goods in recent weeks in a wave of panic buying. The issue has been stressful and frustrating for elderly shoppers, many of whom find it difficult to make frequent visits to supermarkets for essential goods. In many cases, particularly for toilet paper, the shelves are often stripped bare. Mr Harker said the supermarkets had taken a huge hit on demand. “It is a logistics exercise of moving the product to get it back into stores with the pace and demand we’re seeing,” he said. He said the exclusive shopping hour would be reviewed later this week to determine how it could best be managed. Meanwhile, Coles has also said it will close online delivery to all but people who are isolated and vulnerable. Both supermarket giants have suspended their click and collect services. “We believe all Australians deserve the right to access their share of grocery items, particularly the elderly and the vulnerable,” Coles CEO Steven Cain said. Meanwhile, the smaller supermarket chain IGA is considering whether to roll out a similar pensioners-and-seniors-only shopping hour across its 1300 Australian stores. Many IGA supermarkets operate in smaller communities with a significant proportion of elderly residents. Its outlets have reported the same run on consumer products. The idea is being trialled at an IGA in Melbourne’s Altona. It is offering dedicated shopping from 6am to 7am, which could be extended across the country if successful. IGA chief executive Fred Harrison said a final decision would be made by Wednesday. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"WHO urges countries to rapidly scale up coronavirus testing","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/17\/who-testing-coronavirus-pandemic\/","transcript":"Social distancing and good hygiene aren’t enough to slow the coronavirus, the World Health Organisation has warned, as it urged countries to ramp up testing which remained the number one priority. While individuals play a key role in thwarting the spread – such as by washing hands and avoiding contact with others – WHO’s director-general says nations need to invest in strategies to track down people who’ve had contact with patients. “We have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response” to determine who is sick, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference on Tuesday morning (Australian time). “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” His comments come as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public to stop travelling and steer clear of pubs, clubs and theatres. The UK had about 5000 ventilators but would need “many times more than that”, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News. Mr Johnson further warned that “without drastic action, cases could double every five to six days”. He said employees should start working from home. Like the UK, which Mr Johnson said was “now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve” in coronavirus cases, Spain has moved to shut down its land borders to “slow down the curve of infected people” after it became the country with the fourth-highest number of infected patients, surpassing South Korea. Only China, Italy and Iran have more confirmed cases of COVID-19 than Spain, where the number of infections increased overnight by roughly 20 per cent to 9191. Germany, which saw its infections increase by over 1000 in 24 hours, restricted border crossings with France, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Luxembourg, while insisting the flow of goods wouldn’t be affected. Among the most drastic measures, the Swiss city-state of Geneva banned gatherings of more than five people, though exceptions were made for business meetings that followed public health rules. In the US, health officials recommended a limit to groups of 50 or more people and a government expert said a 14-day national shutdown may be needed. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested putting in place a 30-day ban on people entering the EU for non-essential travel.

Swinburne University will pause lectures until next week, while those at La Trobe and Monash will be recorded and made available online. In a statement posted online, La Trobe said the outbreak of COVID-19 is posing “unprecedented challenges” for the university. “Events over the weekend and this morning have necessitated a rapid review of the university’s response,” it said. If forced to close its campuses, La Trobe said all fixed-term and continuing staff would be paid, while casual staff would be paid for up to four weeks, based on the work they would have performed if not for the shutdown. It comes after Premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of emergency along with multiple other states on Monday to enforce the national 14-day isolation sanctions on all travellers coming into Australia, earlier announced by the prime minister. Schools have not been told to close but many private schools across the state – including Ballarat Grammar, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Loreto Mandeville Hall, St Kevins and Yeshiva-Beth Rivkah College – have decided to. Coronavirus cases across the nation have reached more than 360 while five people have died. Anzac Day services and marches have been cancelled in NSW, Western Australia and Tasmania with other states reviewing their commemorations.

A “deeply disturbed” Defence Minister Linda Reynolds reiterated the need for an inquiry into allegations against special forces after a Four Corners investigation uncovered helmet camera video of a Special Air Service operator shooting an Afghan man three times in the head. The seemingly defenceless man in his 20s could be seen cowering on the ground of a wheat field as the SAS operator aims an assault rifle at him and fires off the three shots on a May 2012 day. The alleged incident, which was one of a number of allegations uncovered by Four Corners, occurred just three minutes after their helicopter swooped down near the village of Deh Jawz-e Hasanzai. Before the soldier started shooting, he could be heard twice asking a nearby patrol commander “You want me to drop this c***?” An Australian Defence Force (ADF) investigation later ruled the soldier acted out of self-defence and deemed the killing as justified. According to the ABC, the soldier is still a member of the special forces. A former SAS soldier has also told the program he saw a further three incidents of alleged murder. Afghan villagers provided details, saying a SAS squadron raided the village of Sola in Uruzgan province on August 31, 2012, days after a rogue Afghan soldier killed three Australian troops. Villages were allegedly blindfolded and tied up, and a local imam and his son were shot dead. Defence Minister Ms Reynolds is calling on the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force to investigate allegations against special forces in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2016. The military watchdog is investigating 55 separate allegations of unlawful conduct in Afghanistan by Australian soldiers. “Where serious allegations are raised, Australians would rightly expect they are thoroughly examined,” she said. “The Chief of the Defence Force has advised me that the IGADF will soon provide a report on the findings of the Afghanistan Inquiry.” Amnesty International Australia’s Tim O’Connor backed calls for a federal inquiry, saying international law emphasises the need for soldiers to avoid civilian casualties and use proportionate force, but not when there is a high risk of non-combat deaths. “People have a right to know if the government they elected and the departments and services they pay for are behaving legally and ethically,” Mr O’Connor said. “The ADF Inspector-General must fully investigate the claims made in the program and it is critical that the Australian Defence Force is transparent about its involvement, and informs the Australian media and public as soon as possible.” In a statement to the ABC, the ADF Inspector-General said it was investigating “whether there is any substance to rumour and allegations” about possible war crimes committed by Australian special forces in Afghanistan. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"No masks or coronavirus tests for travellers arriving in Australia for isolation","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/17\/coronavirus-self-isolation-travel\/","transcript":"Shocked passengers boarding a Sydney-bound flight were given just 10 minutes to decide whether to stay on the aircraft and face 14 days of self-isolation in Australia, or get off and be stranded in the United States. The dramatic announcement at San Francisco International Airport came after Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed mandatory self-isolation rules for international travellers. But returning Australians have revealed that despite the government’s strong response to the coronavirus crisis, in planes and at airports when they touched down they were not tested or given masks. “The plane had been filled up with everyone when it was announced what had happened, that 14 days of isolation would apply to all of us,” passenger Zoë White, an Australian-American dual citizen, told The New Daily. “They said, ‘If anyone changes their mind about the flight, you can leave in the next 10 minutes’. “People were getting off and crying. You could tell whatever their plans were had been completely upended.” Ms White, a cinematographer, was filming a new Netflix series in Israel with her partner Michael when shooting was cancelled due to COVID-19. “We’d been shooting since September and we only had about three weeks to go when Israel announced it was banning gatherings of over 100 people,” she said. “A day or two later Netflix had shut down all of its productions around the world.” Ms White usually lives in New York with Michael, but the pair diverted their flights to Australia. “I’d rather be home with my mum in sunny Sydney, feeling close to my family,” she said. During their flights from Tel Aviv to San Francisco to Sydney, the couple was not given any protective gear like face masks, nor did they have their temperatures screened at the airports. “As we left the plane in Sydney we were given a piece of paper with questions about where you’ve been,” Ms White said. “The first question was: Are you aware you need to self-isolate for 14 days? “All the staff were wearing masks around the airport, and as they took our e-tickets they asked, ‘Are you OK? Do you feel sick? Have you been around any at-risk people?’” Anyone who had come from China or other high-risk countries had to have their temperatures screened at Sydney Airport, she said. Although there was no way Ms White could make it back to Australia in time to avoid the new self-isolation period, other travellers were lucky to just land on home soil before the deadline. Brett Diedrich and partner Johannes Wilson run a luxury travel and lifestyle company together in Singapore, but have set up a home in Bali. When the pair heard about the new rules, they wasted no time packing up to head home to Western Australia. “We booked our flights during the Prime Minister’s speech,” Mr Diedrich told The New Daily. “We knew it was coming and we didn’t question it. We thought, ‘OK let’s book our flights and get out of here’. “We just put things in our bags and made a loose plan. “We locked up and left. We don’t know when we’re going back … it’s that uncertainty and inability to plan that is the biggest problem for us.” Mr Diedrich and Mr Wilson rushed to Denpasar International Airport in Bali and jumped on the next flight to Perth. They landed at 7.30pm, Perth time – three hours behind AEST time. “People were so confused, was it a midnight cut-off in each time zone? Or just in the east coast?” Mr Diedrich said. “When we landed there was no temperature screening, and we weren’t given masks. “There was just the standard immigration procedures where they ask you questions like, ‘Have you been to China in the last 14 days?'” Mr Diedrich said when he was in Singapore three weeks ago, he was temperature screened at least three times a day and was told to use a tracking app to tell the government where he was moving around the city. “In Singapore, people aren’t alarmed because they know everything is being managed,” he said. “It’s a bit strange that we didn’t see that degree of control in Australia.” The pair said they felt healthy, but will practise social distancing as a precaution."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus death toll in Australia coult hit 50,000, government predicts","date":"03-17-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/17\/australia-coronavirus-death-toll-could-hit-50000\/","transcript":"Australia’s death toll from the coronavirus could hit 50,000 with millions infected, based on the Morrison government’s more conservative predictions. It’s the figure that the Prime Minister has consistently declined to provide, despite predictions in New South Wales that more than 1.5 million people could catch the virus. Scott Morrison has repeatedly declined to publicly reveal the government modelling for weeks – despite releasing graphs on Sunday that predict the daily demand on GPs and hospitals for coronavirus testing and treatment could hit 300,000 patients a day. But the deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly came close to nominating the potential death toll on Monday when he conceded anywhere between 20 and 60 per cent of the nation’s citizens could contract the disease. “It’s something in the range. I’m not going to speculate on the actual numbers,” Professor Kelly said. “The death rate is around one per cent. You can do the maths.” Based on the more conservative prediction of one in five Australians contracting the virus, that would result in five million people being infected and around 50,000 deaths based on a 1 per cent death rate. However, if 60 per cent of the population was infected – an unlikely prospect according to NSW Health – the death toll could rise to 150,000 people and 15 million patients overwhelming GPs and hospitals. Professor Kelly said the majority of those affected will experience mild symptoms, but the death toll for over-70s is consistently much higher at around 15 per cent of patients.

And indeed in our intensive care units. “And unfortunately, there are some people that die.” The grim prediction came as the Prime Minister confirmed the economic impact was likely to be worse than the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. “This is nothing like the GFC. This has gone well beyond that now. I mean, in the GFC, we didn’t have to shut down the borders,” Mr Morrison said. “In the GFC, we didn’t have to stop mass gathering of the public. “I mean, this is of an order well beyond what we saw last time. And it’ll be a challenging period. But, you know, Australians will come through.” Trade Minister Simon Birmingham confirmed Tuesday’s national cabinet meeting would consider further stimulus measures to protect the economy from the impact of the coronavirus. “There are already job losses. There are businesses under immense stress and pressure,” Senator Birmingham said. “The government can’t step in and run the entire economy. “We can’t run everybody’s business or save everybody’s business, but we are looking at how we continually recalibrate and approach the different policy responses to give the most effective assistance on the ground.” But Labor leader Anthony Albanese said it was not reassuring that a second stimulus package was being proposed so quickly after the first tranche. “It’s just days afterward. I think they were quite clearly gaps in terms of ensuring that some sectors that would be impacted. “We’ve said repeatedly that casual workers, gig workers in the gig economy, people who are sole traders are very concerned that there’s a big gap there. “They’re going to miss out on income. And many of them are fearful. “There was one fellow who was working on camera duty on my statement to the nation that was broadcast on ABC last night. “He essentially is a contract worker, the sole bread-winner in his family a wife and three kids and they are very concerned. “People like him [are] very concerned about the impact that this will have on their capacity to just pay their bills and put food on the table for their families.” Mr Albanese said it was “prudent” the Reserve Bank was looking at quantitative easing. “The Reserve Bank, of course, was warning a long time ago – many months before the bushfire crisis and coronavirus – that the economy was not doing well,” Mr Albanese said. “They were calling for stimulus … and for fiscal policy to do some of the work that they said monetary policy couldn’t do all the heavy lifting. “That’s why this government needs to make sure, not just in terms of announcements, but the money flows out the door. “We know for the bushfires, the notional $2 billion allocation, just $200 million as of a week ago went out the door.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Michael Pascoe: Yes, they are making it up as they go along","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/16\/michael-pascoe-confidence-crisis\/","transcript":"As the Lindt Cafe siege was unfolding in Sydney on December 14, 2014, political leaders were quick to tell the public we had the best police and security agencies to deal with it. “We have police and security organisations of the utmost professionalism that are ready and able to respond to a whole range of situations and contingencies including this situation that we are now seeing in Sydney,” said Prime Minister Tony Abbott. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird and federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten chimed in with similar statements. “I have full confidence in the skill and professionalism of our police and security agencies,” Mr Shorten said. Mr Baird said: “NSW police are trained to deal with these events.” And I remember thinking, no, our security agencies are largely untested. NSW police have rarely if ever dealt with anything like this, there’s little reason to think they should be particularly good at it. Tragically, that proved to be the case. There’s been a sense of déjà vu with both the COVID-19 health and economic crisis as the current Prime Minister has rushed to tell us there was a plan, that we were ahead of the crisis, that we had the best experts, that we just had to remain Australians, that no country could do better. It’s that confidence and trust thing. Again. Such statements further undermine trust when the government is making it up as it goes along. The reality on the health front is that, like the bushfire crisis, we were not prepared for the pandemic that every expert knew would turn up one of these years. Oh, there was a plan in a drawer that was taken out and dusted off, but we weren’t prepared. We don’t have enough respirators. We don’t have the temperature-screening equipment commonplace in other airports. We’re not capable of large-scale rapid screening. We’re still working on developing a public information program. The messages have been mixed and at times confusing, not helped by politicians wanting to get in front of the experts who are supposed to be calling the shots. The political history is that pollies can get a lift in the opinion polls by displaying “leadership” in a crisis. But when they are muddying (footy\/no footy) and inane (“keep being Australians”) and merely sloganeering (“get ahead, stay ahead, keep our heads”), already damaged confidence ebbs. The reality at this stage is that we would be better off being Taiwanese, Singaporean or Hong Kongers rather than Australians as they are the three places that were prepared and are best dealing with the crisis. That’s the payoff from having a corporate memory of SARS. As knowledge of COVID-19 is still evolving, it is understandable that our medical authorities seem to be making it up as they go along to a degree. Full and frank honesty about our shortcomings though would help. And then there’s the economic crisis. Again, we were unprepared. Policies that should have already been in place had been ignored and consequently the Reserve Bank’s interest rate firepower had been largely used up. The Prime Minister told us it would be fine, there was “a plan”. But as time went on, it looked more like there was a plan to develop a plan, a process that took weeks. Treasury had a 14-year-old study on the economic impact of such a pandemic, a study that indicated very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus would be required to stave off a severe recession. But when the ideologically-tinkered-with plan was unveiled last week, it was already inadequate – a plan mainly aimed at the June quarter and politically inspired to deliver three-quarters of the $17.6 billion directly to businesses rather than indirectly to them via consumption. Consequently, it is taken for granted that last week’s grand plan will only be a first instalment, that the government is continuing to make it up as it goes along, that it has underestimated the size of the task, that it’s started behind and is determined to stay there. The tourism industry in this country has been smashed, the international side killed, the domestic deeply wounded. Large parts of the hospitality industry are already sinking, some sunk. There’s an element of understanding that halting sporting events will hurt but unnoticed so far is that the business events industry, estimated to generate some $30 billion a year in economic activity, has been frozen. The arts and live music industries are similarly imploding. As more companies advise staff to work from home, watch the pain for city coffee shops and cafes trying to make the rent with fewer customers. Hospitality and entertainment, in all their forms, are major employers of workers easily let go. And still to really land is the supply side of the crisis. An unimportant example: Phone companies have been hit by an iPhone shortage. Not so unimportant: Construction materials not landing in our ports will hurt a building industry that is already down. Yes, Blind Freddy can see the federal government will be dragged, belatedly, into offering more support if we are to avoid unemployment hitting recessionary levels. But when specifically asked on the weekend if there would need to be more stimulus spending in the May budget, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg predictably went into a talking points trance about last week’s effort, ending up with only: “We will obviously watch how it is implemented and the effect that it has throughout the community.” Hardly confidence building while the RBA not only announced it was doing what it had to do to maintain liquidity but also foreshadowed there would be much more coming. “The bank will announce further policy measures to support the Australian economy on Thursday,” Governor Lowe said. There’s the RBA doing what the government won’t, trying to instil confidence that it is on the job and will continue to do what needs to be done. The central bankers are making it up as they go along, too. Like our health authorities and federal government, they haven’t faced a crisis like this pandemic before, but they are signalling they’re aware of just how serious it is and how uncompromised the effort will have to be."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Morrison's coronavirus response not what the doctor ordered","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/16\/paul-bongiorno-morrison-coronavirus-response\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison is stuck between the rock of the economy and the hard place that is the health of the nation, and more than one medical expert thinks he is getting it wrong. Even now after the $17.6 billion stimulus package, including the $2.4 billion health package is, according to Bill Bowtell, too little too late. The infectious diseases expert, who in the 1980s was the brains behind Australia’s world-leading AIDS\/HIV campaign, says the federal government’s responses have been “reckless and beyond stupid”. The trigger for his outburst was the decision to hold off a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people till after last weekend’s sporting fixtures, particularly the rugby league. On Monday Mr Bowtell told the Seven Network “we have to get real on this”. “We have to adopt measures that really do increase the security of all Australians,” he said. “A virus has no clue whether it’s in a school assembly room, a large university, Parliament or a hospital. The advice is not logically consistent.” He is supported in his criticisms by the ABC’s resident medical expert, Dr Norman Swan. Dr Swan tweeted a quote of  President Donald Trump’s key medical adviser, Anthony Fauci: “I think we should be really overly aggressive and get criticised for over reacting.” Dr Swan says “when you do the right thing nothing happens”. He clearly believes we will pay the price for our piecemeal approach in 14 days’ time. Dr Swan says we don’t have a day to waste and accuses the Morrison government of not being straight with the public but rather using “public relations Valium”, waiting for the number of coronavirus cases to tick up before taking action that is overdue. The stark message is Australia should be following the lead of Singapore by shutting schools, sanitising public transport and forcing the entire population into self-isolation. Mr Morrison’s reaction on Sunday when he ramped up travel bans and urged social isolation measures that for days he was saying were not needed doesn’t inspire confidence. The PM seemed to be playing down the need for a high-profile advertising campaign to keep the public alert and informed when he was asked what  “social distancing” meant. “We don’t need to tell Australians how to get out of bed in the morning and how to put their shoes and socks on and things like that,” Mr Morrison told his late afternoon news conference on Sunday. Perhaps he realised he had put his foot in it because he immediately tried to backtrack by saying he was not “trying to make light of this”. Maybe the government needs to ask Clive Palmer how to get billboards, taxis, TV, radio and social media messages out. Health minister Greg Hunt is especially prickly when the government’s inconsistencies are pointed out or people ask “where the hell is the public information campaign?” The lack of so-called “common sense” behaviour advice probably goes a long way to explain Newspoll’s finding that a huge 76 per cent of the population is worried about the impact on the Australian economy – which translates to their  income security. Only 22 per cent are very confident about the incipient information campaign. Labor’s Anthony Albanese, while promising to be constructive in his address to the nation, pinpointed six areas where the government needs to do more. They are telling. More consistent advice, such as when to self-isolate and when to get tested, and getting more people tested more quickly. Mr Albanese says the fever clinics should be fast-tracked, Medicare expanded, “a serious reduction” in large gatherings, and timely and comprehensive travel advice that is updated more frequently. Giving priority to the health side of the Prime Minister’s dreadful dilemma will go a long way to dealing with the economic challenges.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison is meeting with the Treasurer and Finance Minister on Monday afternoon to discuss further economic measures, following last week’s $17 billion stimulus package. They are discussing problems in specific sectors such as airlines, and what challenges require immediate responses. The Prime Minister has also decided he will relocate from Sydney to Canberra to be closer to bureaucrats and make it easier to conduct meetings of the National Security Committee of Cabinet. No decision has been made yet about whether his family will join him. On Monday morning Mr Morrison and his senior ministerial colleagues went on a media spree in a bid to reassure Australians, as Victoria declared a state of emergency and the ACT declared a public health emergency. “A state of emergency is not a state of panic,” the Prime Minister said. “A state of emergency puts in place special powers for state governments to help manage the spread of a health epidemic. “Yesterday [Sunday] it was an issue discussed by the state premiers, that they would be all moving effectively to that footing.” Federal leaders also urged shoppers to stop panic buying, as supermarket chains announced restricted opening hours solely for elderly and disabled people. Concerns have been raised about whether some of the most vulnerable members of the community are missing out on essentials as panic buying and stockpiling continues. “Let’s all look after each other and be respectful to each other and help each other out,” Mr Morrison said. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said people needed to be measured in their shopping. “I’ve also seen the reports of panic buying, I suppose would be one description,” she said. “They’re not just happening here, they’ve happened in other countries as well. And it’s not necessary. “It’s not the case that stores are going to close or supplies are going to cease.” The Prime Minister’s early morning media blitz came as new ban on non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people came into force. A newly formed national cabinet, including Mr Morrison, the premiers and chief ministers, held its first meeting on Sunday as the Commonwealth and states work together to counter coronavirus’ spread. New travel requirements mean all people arriving in Australia, including citizens, must self-isolate for a fortnight. The Government has also banned cruise ships from docking in Australia for 30 days. Health authorities are considering whether to restrict visits to aged care facilities to protect elderly people from the spread of the coronavirus. Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck said residential aged care providers were being encouraged to limit visits from today. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly said chief medical officers from around the nation would meet in person on Monday afternoon to consider what more should be done to protect high-risk groups. “We need to do what we can to limit the opportunity for the infection to come into aged care,” he said. “There are a range of measures that we put in place in flu seasons when there’s a large number of influenza cases in the community or indeed if there is an outbreak within an aged care facility.” Professor Kelly said the Government needed to “careful and prudent” about its use of testing, flagging some issues with “consumables” in relation to the testing kits. After one testing clinic was opened, 1600 people were tested but just one was found to be positive. “You need to look at where you get your best bang for your buck,” he said. He declined a request to elaborate, saying only that “we’re continuing to test”. The Prime Minister said the Federal Government would continue to monitor whether schools should be shut down. But he said the advice of medical authorities was that schools currently remained safe. “That situation may change in the future, but when it does, that’s when we’ll act,” he said. “This is something that changes each day, and you proportion your response to the information and the case load that you have now.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Demand for guns soars as Americans prepare for coronavirus chaos","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/16\/guns-us-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Australians have gone mad for toilet paper and hand sanitiser as the threat of the deadly coronavirus looms ever larger. In the US, one of the biggest runs has been on guns and ammunition. Amid widespread shortages of consumer products across the US, guns are one of the most popular items. At one Los Angeles shop, customers waited more than five hours to be served at the weekend. The queue stretched out the door and a fast-food truck outside took orders for hungry shoppers. Among them was a medical doctor who would give only his first name, Ray. He told the Los Angeles Times he’d come to buy his first gun. “I want to buy a handgun, I think they call it a Glock, but I’m not sure,” he said. “I have a house and a family, and they’ll need protection if things get worse. “The fear is that civil services will break down.” Another customer, John Gore, 39, was in furious agreement. “Politicians and antigun people have been telling us for the longest time that we don’t need guns,” he said. “But right now, a lot of people are truly scared, and they can make that decision themselves.” The US has reported more than 3700 cases of coronavirus so far. Of those, there have been 69 deaths and 73 patients have recovered. However, there are fears the numbers of COVID-19 cases in the US has been underreported because testing has been difficult to come by for many people. The rush to buy guns was not unique to suburban LA. Online retailer Widener’s Reloading and Shooting Supply said its ammunition sales had doubled on a year ago. “It’s clear our customers want to be prepared in a worst-case scenario,” spokesman Jacob Long told American Rifleman (a National Rifle Association publication). “For a lot of our families, a disaster plan includes having ammo on hand.” Danny Garcia, manager of North Carolina’s Money Quick Pawn and Guns, said handgun and rifle ammunition sales had jumped in recent months. “February was a record sales month,” he said. “Talking with our customers, we are hearing the increase is due to both the prospect of a coronavirus outbreak and the pending elections.” In San Francisco’s north, Raymond Prather told Fox News customers were also flocking to buy ready to eat meals from his military surplus store. “We’re bringing pallets up all the time now, and even our supplier in southern California is having trouble keeping them in stock,” he said. The compact meal packets are usually bought by bushwalkers and campers. In southern California, David Liu,who owns Arcadia Firearm and Safety in the San Gabriel Valley, told CBSN he was worried and he recently purchased a gun for his wife. One customer, Daniel Lim, said he wanted his family to be able to protect themselves. He also said he hoped predictions of a financial crisis springing from the spread of COVID-19, and the potential social disorder that might follow, were wrong. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"States of emergency called in Victoria, ACT, to buy time amid coronavirus pandemic | The New Daily","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/16\/coronavirus-pandemic-state-of-emergency-victoria-act\/","transcript":"Victoria and the ACT have declared states of emergency as Australia goes into lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19. As of Monday at 4pm, 344 Australians tested positive to the coronavirus, five people have died and 23 are recovering in isolation. In NSW, there has been a “dramatic increase” in infections, with the state’s Health Minister Brad Hazzard confirming 37 new cases overnight, with 1282 cases under investigation. In an unprecedented move in Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of emergency for four weeks, effective from 12pm on Monday, which would remain in place “for as long as it needs to be”. The special powers have been declared to enforce the 14-day isolation requirements for all travellers coming into Australia, he said. “Make no mistake, the next few weeks and months will be tough for everyone, but we’re doing what is necessary to protect Victorians,” Mr Andrews told reporters on Monday morning at 8.30am. This means authorised officers can detain people, restrict movement and prevent entry to premises to protect the public. Anyone who does not voluntarily comply with the new order could face fines of up to $20,000. Non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people such as cultural and sporting events and conferences, are banned. Businesses large and small are also being advised to look at the option of employees working from home for the next two weeks. In the ACT, Chief Minister Andrew Barr declared a public health emergency in Canberra minutes after Victoria’s decision, and coming after the nation’s capital confirmed a man in his 30s tested positive over the weekend. Mr Barr said the declaration would give Canberra’s chief health officer more powers to enforce isolation and quarantines. In Tasmania, everyone arriving in the state from Tuesday [March 17] would have to provide contact details as part of measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. They will also need to fill in an ‘arrival card’ that will be rolled out at ports and airports, Premier Peter Gutwein said, adding that filling out the card will be mandatory and will allow the state government to pass on health advice if needed. And in Western Australia, hefty fines of up to $50,000 come with anyone defying the state of emergency declaration. Mr Andrews said Victoria was taking its drastic action “after agreement from the National Cabinet that includes the Prime Minister and all premiers and chief ministers, to contain the spread of coronavirus as much as we can”. “It is an offence under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act to not comply with the orders that have been made,” he said. In NSW, emergency powers have also been introduced to force the immediate cancellation of public events of more than 500 people, with fines of up to $11,000 for those who break the laws. And Transport for NSW is urging commuters to avoid travelling on public transport during the peak-hour rush if possible to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. “While staff have boosted maintenance and cleaning efforts on the network in response to COVID-19, customers need to take extra precautions too,” Transport Minister Andrew Constance said in a statement on Monday. It comes as state health authorities confirmed an additional 37 people tested positive to the coronavirus, bringing the state total to 171. Mr Hazzard told reporters on Monday afternoon severe penalties would also be imposed if people breach the new quarantine order. “I stress that it is quite a serious scenario, because people will be liable for individual fines of up to $11,000 if they breach that direction and they may be also liable … for up to six months’ imprisonment. “Obviously the New South Wales government – indeed all governments around the country – are not wanting to impose penalties on people. “What we’re looking for is co-operation,” he said. The self-isolation sanction was declared by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday. Institutions such as the National Gallery of Victoria, State Library, and museums are temporarily closed, while the Melbourne Comedy Festival and Food and Wine Festival have already been postponed. “This is about flattening the curve,” Mr Andrews said. While a handful of schools have closed, no announcement has been made to stop students attending schools, TAFEs, universities and early childhood centres. However, camps, extra-curricular activities including music, drama and band practice, and excursions have ceased in many schools until further notice. On Sunday, Victorian authorities recommended the public have a two-week stockpile of food – but no more – in preparation for a major coronavirus outbreak in the state. Mr Andrews said it would be “sensible” to have extra staples on hand as the number of cases of COVID-19 rose. But he warned against panic buying as it would impact those “most at risk of being quite seriously ill”. “It is sensible to try to have some of those (staples) on hand, more than you would normally have,” Mr Andrews said on Sunday. “But if everybody goes out and buys not two weeks worth of staples but two months worth, the shelves will be empty and the only people who suffer then are vulnerable people who might not have got to the shops, or can’t go to four different supermarkets and get the basics that they need.” Supermarkets Coles and Woolworths, meanwhile, have imposed purchasing limits on staples such as rice, flour, pasta, toilet paper, tissues and hand sanitiser to two units per customer."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus pandemic puts paid to Anzac Day plans","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/16\/coronavirus-anzac-day\/","transcript":"Anzac Day services have been cancelled in NSW, Western Australia and Tasmania after the federal government banned mass gatherings in response to the coronavirus crisis.

Returned and Services League of Australia WA chief executive John McCourt told ABC radio on Monday plans were underway for some sort of commemoration for April 25 using social media and live streaming. RSL-held services and subsequent marches have been called off in Tasmania. “It was a tough decision because a lot of the sub-branches would have been organising these events from February onwards,” State President Robert Dick said. “A lot of preparation work has already been done. But I emphasise the fact that public safety and wellbeing is more important.” Mr Dick said many older veterans fell into the group most at-risk from coronavirus. “The consequences could be devastating and we don’t want to put people in that position,” he said. “We’re asking people in their own private way to pay respects to our serving and ex-service members. “Even if it’s like on Remembrance Day, where you take a moment around 11 o’clock to pause and reflect on those who have gone before.” Late on Monday afternoon, the NSW also cancelled all public Anzac Day commemorations across the state. “The risk to vulnerable people during the current health situation is simply too high,” it said.

The Morrison government has confirmed the April holidays could be extended to keep schools closed as the spread of the virus increases in the community. Contingency plans are being put in place now. The advice came as Today Show host Karl Stefanovic clashed with the Prime Minister over the schools’ confusion. In their exchange, Scott Morrison said Stefanovic was “not a doctor” and the PM would prefer to deal with facts. Mr Morrison also revealed his own two daughters went to school on Monday. “As a parent, I have to say to you, PM, I find this confusing and I find it disturbing – that it’s almost OK for our kids to be in an area where there’s more than 500 kids,” Stefanvoic said. “That’s not the medical advice, Karl,” the Prime Minister responded. “You’re not a doctor and neither am I. My kids are going to school. I trust the medical advice of those who are responsible for the medical health of our nation. They don’t consider these things idly; they consider them very carefully.” Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan said he understood it was a worrying time for parents, but the best current medical advice was to send children to school. “There are two main reasons why we’re doing that – because the advice is saying if we shut them now, then children would be at home. In many cases, they’d have to be looked after by grandparents or the elderly, and that could pose a risk to them,” he said. “Also, we need the workforce at the moment. We want to make sure that we’ve got our nurses, our allied health workers, our doctors working, and we need our kids at school. “There might come a stage where the medical advice says, ‘Maybe the school holidays need to be extended for a week’. There might be other measures that need to be put in place.” Asked if public school closures were “inevitable” in coming weeks, the Prime Minister said only that – for now – expert advice was that they remain open to help nurses and teachers go to work. “At some stage, if that’s the advice, then that certainly will happen,” Mr Morrison said. “But I should stress, that is not the advice at the moment. And different schools are doing different things. Some of them are moving towards remote learning and things like that. But the advice from all of the states, which is consensus advice from the states and territories health officers, chief medical officer, is that it’s not something that’s been recommended. “In fact, as I outlined yesterday, at a time like this, that could cause more problems for the involved. And children and younger people, I should stress, the medical advice is that they are the least at risk, unless there are very serious other health issues that they might have. “The vulnerable are those who have other health issues, the elderly, and that’s, they’re the ones that I have most in my mind. And for the rest of us, about eight or 10 of us who will contract this virus, it will be a mild illness. That’s good advice.” Mr Morrison said the elderly and vulnerable would be helped by “commonsense, the sensible social distancing measures, not hand-shaking, coughing into our handkerchiefs or our elbows, and washing their hands, and being careful about our contact with the elderly, and the 1.5 metres where that’s practical to do so”. “It’s not going to be practical everywhere, these things aren’t absolute,” he said. “But they’re just putting them into place sensibly wherever you can.” But calls for students to remain 1.5 metres apart were rubbished by Stefanovic as impractical. “Even my 14-year-old daughter said ‘dad, we are a lot closer than that at school’,” he said. “I’m sorry but the level of discrepancy in the advice is mind-blowing. Which is it – 1.5 metres? Or is it OK to be 30 centimetres apart?” In another concerning development on Monday, the Morrison government confirmed it had referred to police a fake letter claiming Victorian schools are to close. “There is a forged letter circulating on social media purporting to be from myself and the Victorian Minister [Jenny] Mikakos,” Mr Hunt said. “This letter is a fake and falsely asserts school closures. Schools remain open, with the unanimous support of the states and Commonwealth. The matter is being reported to the police.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NSW man charged with a terrorism offence | The New Daily","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/16\/nsw-man-charged-terrorism\/","transcript":"A NSW man has been charged with a terrorism offence after police uncovered an alleged right-wing plot to attack an electrical substation on the South Coast. The 21-year-old man from Sanctuary Point was on Saturday charged with one count of preparing or planning a terrorist act after a Joint Counter Terrorism Team investigation. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life in jail. The accused allegedly attempted and planned to buy or acquire military equipment including firearms and items capable of making improvised explosive devices, police say. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Walton says officers acted swiftly because the man’s behaviour online was of “significant” concern. “This person had anti-government sentiment, he was anti-semitic, he has neo-Nazi interests and he has anti-indigenous interests,” he told reporters in Sydney on Monday. “It’s fair to say that the online environment is a petri dish of hate in our community.” Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Scott Lee says although the man had not finalised any attack plans, authorities became concerned by his online activity over the past week. That included the potential testing and construction of explosive devices. Mr Lee said the first anniversary of the Christchurch attack was a factor in the weekend arrest. “There was no information that we had that anything would actually occur on the anniversary itself, but honestly the upcoming anniversary, the ideology and the alignment of that ideology to Christchurch was one of the factors that we took into account as to when we went,” Mr Lee told reporters. Detectives on the weekend raided properties in the rural town of Parma, southwest of Nowra, and nearby Sanctuary Point. Several electronic devices, tactical equipment and three paintball firearms were seized at the accused’s Sanctuary Point property while four registered firearms were taken from the Parma residence which police say is the home of an associate of the 21-year-old man.

Hanks and Wilson are quarantined in a Gold Coast hospital after testing positive to coronavirus last week. Late on Sunday, the Hollywood star posted a cheery update to social media. He again thanked those who are looking after him and Wilson, and said “Let’s take care of ourselves and each other”. But the LA power couple’s choice of breakfast – as shown in the post – has stirred up quite the reaction. “Tom. What are you doing? No Australian puts that much Vegemite on their toast,” wrote on Twitter user. “According to this, Tom Hanks is going to die! Stop him!” wrote another. And this: “He went full on Vegemite … Never go full on Vegemite.” Although not everyone disagreed with the level of consumption. “He isn’t Australian, so … Get well, Tom! Put the jar’s entire contents on your toast if you want,” wrote one fan. And another who didn’t quite get the joke: “Ummmm, he’s not Australian … maybe that has something to do with it. And who gives a s–t how much he uses???? He was sending out a nice message and all you people can take from it is how much Vegemite he uses?? Wow unbelievable people out there!!!” Hanks, 63, is in Australia to film a Baz Luhrmann-biopic on Elvis Presley being filmed at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast. Production on the film has halted for a fortnight followed his diagnosis. A representative for the production said no cast or crew had come down with the virus. “We are aware of only the one case of the coronavirus amongst our cast and crew, and additionally the cast member’s wife,” the statement said. “Working closely with the Queensland Health Department we have delayed our start date by approximately two weeks to allow for the cast member’s full recovery.” Singer-songwriter Wilson performed at the ballroom of the Emporium Hotel South Bank in Brisbane and also at the Sydney Opera House in the first week of March. Veteran Nine Network entertainment reporter Richard Wilkins, who met Wilson at the opera house, also has coronavirus. On Friday, Hanks posted a photo of himself and Wilson in isolation on the Gold Coast. The Oscar-winning actor looked sombre while Wilson was smiling as he assured fans and friends on Twitter that the couple is doing fine and wanted “to thank everyone here Down Under”. “There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts and taking care of ourselves and each other, no? Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball. Hanx”. Hanks’ statement about ‘no crying’ in baseball refers to his famous line from 1992’s A League Of Their Own, in which he portrayed manager Jimmy Dugan. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Qantas, Jetstar to credit passengers hit by coronavirus restrictions","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/16\/qantas-credit-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Passengers due to fly with Qantas and Jetstar will be able to cancel bookings in exchange for credits as travel restrictions deepen with the coronavirus outbreak. Qantas’s decision came after Australia imposed self-isolation restrictions on all arrivals to the country from midnight on Sunday. Customers with new and existing bookings on domestic and international flights would be given the option to cancel their flights and receive travel credit, Qantas said. “We understand that some customers would prefer not to travel at the moment,” Qantas chief customer officer Stephanie Tully said. “We have removed the standard change fees, where it applies, and are giving customers the option to cancel their flight and receive a travel voucher that can be used anywhere on our network at a later date.” The changes apply to Qantas, Jetstar and QantasLink flights and apply until March 31 for travel until May 31. However, the airline said passengers should not contact its call centres about the credit offer. “Due to high demand, we are experiencing long call wait times,” it said. Passengers should visit the Qantas or Jetstar websites to make the change to their booking. Flights booked through travel agencies or websites will need to be refunded through the same agency or site. Qantas also said on Monday it would make further cuts to its flying schedule beyond those announced last week. “We”re working through the implications for our schedule now given the expected impact on demand, with a view to announcing more detail as soon as possible,” a Qantas spokesman said on Monday. Across the Tasman, Air New Zealand has offered credits, refunds or date changes to passengers booked to fly before March 31. On Saturday, New Zealand said it would require all incoming travellers to go into 14 days self-isolation on arrival in the country. On Monday, the airline also said it would reduce long-haul capacity by 85 per cent in coming months and make some staff redundant as COVID-19 slashes demand for air travel. New Zealand’s flag carrier put itself in a trading halt “to allow it time to more fully assess the operational and financial impacts of global travel restrictions”. On Monday morning, Air NZ advised it would “significantly reduce” trans-Tasman flights, and operate a bare bones network to Asia and North America. It will end flights between Auckland and Chicago, San Francisco, Houston, Buenos Aires, Vancouver, Tokyo Narita, Honolulu, Denpasar and Taipei from March 30 for three months. Domestic capacity will be cut by a third but all destinations will remain. Air NZ chief executive Greg Foran said the business was in discussions with the government for support. “We are now accepting that for the coming months at least Air New Zealand will be a smaller airline requiring fewer resources, including people,” he said. Mr Foran said the airline would work with unions that represented its 8000-strong workforce. “These are unprecedented times that we are all having to navigate,” he said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australians on board stranded coronavirus cruise ship","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/16\/austrlians-coronavirus-msbraemar\/","transcript":"An Australian passenger is among those on board a cruise ship frantically searching for somewhere to dock in the Caribbean after five passengers tested positive for coronavirus. One Australian and one New Zealander are on board the MS Braemar, which is carrying 682 passengers and 381 crew members. The British government is urgently scrambling to find a country willing to take the ship, after it was turned away from the Dominican Republic, where it was scheduled to arrive on February 27. The ship was meant to end its journey in Barbados on Thursday but was turned away again before also being refused in the Bahamas. Currently, the ship is stranded 25 miles off the cost of the Bahamas and if negotiations to have it docked in the region fail, it will have to voyage back across the Atlantic – a journey that lasts up to ten days. Passengers are waiting for vital supplies, including extra food, fuel and a small medical team of two doctors and two nurses to help with the outbreak. Early Monday morning Australian time, Captain Jozo Glavic updated the guests on board, saying they had not got clearance for the supplies to be delivered yet. “All our supplies and medications are at the pier in Freeport,” he said. “They have been there since yesterday. We are still waiting for clearance for delivery. We will not go anywhere until we have the medical staff on board and these supplies arrive. “I can tell you that our situation continues to be looked at as a matter of the utmost urgency between the UK government and our head office. “Until then, please continue to bear with me and my crew.” The passengers on board MS Braemar are mostly British, but also include Canadians, Colombians, Irish, Italians, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegians and Belgians. Passengers have been advised to self-isolate and contact the ship’s medical centre if they felt unwell. On Twitter, one British passenger posted a video of herself on aboard the ship saying they were being ‘looked after’. “For everyone that’s worried at home, we’re absolutely fine. We’re being really well looked after,” she said. On March 9, the company reported two people who had been on the ship tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home. The prompted six people on the ship with flu-like symptoms to be tested, and five cases of the virus were confirmed on Wednesday – four crew and one passenger. The other test was inconclusive."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to near zero","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/16\/us-federal-reserve-interest-cut\/","transcript":"The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates for the second time in less than a fortnight in another emergency move to help shore up the US economy amid the rapidly escalating global coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the central bank said it was cutting rates to a target range of 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent. “The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, the committee decided to lower the target range,” the Fed said on Monday (Australian time). “The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.” But the emergency rate cut failed to allay fears about the coronavirus’ economic shock. After the announcement, the US dollar sank more than 2 per cent against the yen, while US crude fell 5 per cent to under $30 per barrel. “[The] market is wondering what the Fed knows that the rest of us don’t,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes in New York. “Is COVID-19 an even bigger deal than we think?” Robert Pavlik, the chief investment strategist at a New York investment company, said the Fed “must really be scared”. “To do that in one fell swoop is really quite shocking,” he said. “They pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don’t think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we’re down to sticks and stones.” The Fed has already cut interest rates by half a percentage point at an emergency meeting on March 3. That was the first rate cut outside of a regularly scheduled policy meeting since the financial crisis in 2008. Policymakers were not due to hold their next interest-rate setting meeting until March 17-18. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has slashed the country’s official cash rate to just 0.25 per cent, down from 1.0 per cent, on Monday. The central bank, which held an emergency meeting on Sunday, also took the step of guaranteeing the rate for the next 12 months as New Zealand looks to cushion the effects of the coronavirus. The rate is the lowest in RBNZ history. In response, the New Zealand dollar and stock market continued their downward moves on Monday morning. The benchmark NZX50 plunged, dropping 3.5 per cent of value in the opening two hours of trading. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Extreme measures’: States of emergency declared in Victoria, ACT | The New Daily","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/16\/coronavirus-victoria-state-of-emergency\/","transcript":"Victoria and the ACT have declared states of emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In taking the unprecedented move – which applies from midday on Monday – Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the state of emergency would remain for “as long as it needs to be” to combat COVID-19. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr will also declare a public health emergency in Canberra. It comes after health authorities confirmed the national capital’s second case of coronavirus – a man in his 30s who tested positive on Sunday. Mr Barr said the declaration would give Canberra’s chief health officer more powers to enforce isolation and quarantines. “I want to be clear at this point … any directions under the public health act would be the last resort measure,” he said. Also on Tuesday, the Tasmanian government said everyone arriving in the state would have to provide contact details as part of measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. They will also need to fill in an ‘arrival card’ that will be rolled out at ports and airports from Tuesday, Premier Peter Gutwein said. Filling out the card will be mandatory and allow the state government to pass on health advice if needed. Mr Andrews said Victoria was taking its drastic action “after agreement from the National Cabinet that includes the Prime Minister and all premiers and chief ministers, to contain the spread of coronavirus as much as we can”. “Make no mistake, the next few weeks and months will be tough for everyone, but we’re doing what is necessary to protect Victorians,” he said. “It is an offence under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act to not comply with the orders that have been made,” he said. “Those orders, in the first instance, relate to that mandatory – not optional in any way – mandatory home quarantine or at a hotel, if you are not a resident.” The special powers have been declared to enforce the 14-day isolation requirements for all travellers coming into Australia, he said. The self-isolation sanction was declared by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday. Victoria’s state of emergency will initially run for four weeks, but is likely to continue beyond then. Under the move, authorised officers can detain people, restrict movement and prevent entry to premises to protect the public. Non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people such as cultural and sporting events and conferences, are banned. Institutions such as the National Gallery of Victoria, State Library, and museums are temporarily closed, while the Melbourne Comedy Festival and Food and Wine Festival have already been postponed. “This is about flattening the curve,” Mr Andrews said. Victoria’s coronavirus tally sits at 71 after 14 new cases were confirmed overnight. There are 297 confirmed cases across Australia. Victoria’s Department of Premier and Cabinet said the drastic measures meant that “gatherings that are deemed essential”, including public transport, food markets and workplaces, will remain open – for now. “Schools, TAFEs and universities will remain open for now but have been asked to restrict mass gatherings such as assemblies and lectures of over 500 people,” it said. “At this stage, spaces or locations where 500 or more people may be in transit, such as Federation Square or Bourke Street Mall, are excluded from the ban on mass gatherings. “However, if it is deemed necessary to protect public health, the powers can also be used in future to quarantine entire suburbs, businesses or professions – rather than just individuals. On Sunday, Victorian authorities recommended the public have a two-week stockpile of food – but no more – in preparation for a major coronavirus outbreak in the state. Mr Andrews said it would be “sensible” to have extra staples on hand as the number of cases of COVID-19 rose. But he warned against panic buying as it would impact those “most at risk of being quite seriously ill”. “It is sensible to try to have some of those (staples) on hand, more than you would normally have,” Mr Andrews said on Sunday. “But if everybody goes out and buys not two weeks worth of staples but two months worth, the shelves will be empty and the only people who suffer then are vulnerable people who might not have got to the shops, or can’t go to four different supermarkets and get the basics that they need.” Supermarkets Coles and Woolworths, meanwhile, have imposed purchasing limits on staples such as rice, flour, pasta, toilet paper, tissues and hand sanitiser to two units per customer. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Supermarkets cut deliveries, bring in 'exclusive' shopping for vulnerable","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/16\/woolworths-coles-elderly-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Supermarket giants Woolworths and Coles will roll out dedicated daily shopping hours for the elderly and people with disabilities after panic buying stripped Australian supermarket shelves bare. Both companies have said they will also close early to allow staff to restock shelves – both being among a range of measures to try to cope with the massive spike from coronavirus-induced frenzied buying. They will also suspend in-store pick up and some home delivery services, with Woolworths citing the weekend’s “extraordinary levels of demand for groceries”. “We want to slow the panic down,” Woolworths managing director Claire Peters said on Monday. “We understand that our customers’ priority is to be prepared, but the vast majority of our food is grown or manufactured in Australia so there is not a concern with supply. What we have is a spike in demand.” From Tuesday, Woolworths shops will open from 7am-8am exclusively for the elderly and those with a disability. Eligible customers will have to produce a relevant government-issued concession card. Coles will introduce the same measure – dubbed “community hour” – from Wednesday. Ms Peters said Woolworths had experienced huge demand last weekend, far exceeding Christmas or any other sales in the past 12 months. “We continue to encourage all Australians to be mindful of those in our communities who might need extra help at this time,” she said. “Now – more than ever – we need to be kind to each other, especially to those most vulnerable.” Among Woolworths’ most radical plans is a decision to shut all of its Australian supermarkets at 8pm on Wednesday, hours earlier than normal for most. Shelves will be restocked and the shops will reopen at 7am on Thursday – with the first hour dedicated to elderly and disabled shoppers. In Melbourne’s west, IGA Altona said it would also start opening an hour early to allow vulnerable customers time to shop in calm. Other chains are expected to follow suit. “We see how the elderly are struggling, and the people with disability,” the IGA manager told the ABC on Monday.  Woolworths said suspending its “click and collect” service would allow staff to focus on serving customers in-store. Home delivery will also be cut for the majority of Victorians – with only one catchment area unaffected. “We’ll continue to service online deliveries in selected metropolitan areas of Melbourne from our West Footscray customer fulfilment centre,” the spokesman said. The suspension is until further notice, and includes orders already paid for but not picked up. Woolworths said it was processing refunds for affected customers, and delivery services would resume as soon as possible. “We believe this is a necessary step to allow our team members to prioritise restocking shelves and serving customers in our Victorian stores,” the spokesman said. Nationwide, Coles will restrict its home deliveries to “those in genuine need, especially the most vulnerable and those isolated”. Click and collect and UberEats services have been suspended. “Coles is taking all possible steps to improve the level of stock on our shelves for the community,” chief executive Steven Cain said. “Our team members, suppliers and transport partners have been working as hard as possible delivering more products to stores every day and replenishing shelves of popular products such as toilet paper, long-life pantry staples and healthcare items as quickly as possible. “We ask for customers to continue to respect and support our team members in store and [online] … particularly if a product is unavailable or if the checkout queues are longer than normal.” Panic over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked chaotic scenes in supermarkets across the nation, as frenzied shoppers stockpile large amounts of food. In some cases, fights have broken out. Shelves have been stripped bare and some of Australia’s most vulnerable, including the elderly and those with disabilities, have struggled to get the food they need to survive. The dedicated shopping hour follows attempts by major supermarkets, including Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and IGA, to stop frenzied customers buying more than they need. Coles has limited customers to two packets of pasta, flour, rice, paper towels, paper tissues and hand sanitiser per transaction. At Woolworths, customers can buy two packs of tissues and hand sanitiser, and one pack of rice, paper towels, serviettes and wipes per shop. On Sunday, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said it was “sensible” for people to have a few weeks of food stored as the COVID-19 outbreak spread. But he cautioned against panic buying. “It is sensible to try to have some of those (staples) on hand, more than you would normally have,” he said. “But if everybody goes out and buys, not two weeks’ worth of staples but two months’ worth, the shelves will be empty and the only people who suffer then are vulnerable people who might not have got to the shops, or can’t go to four different supermarkets and get the basics that they need.” Woolworths said it would review its opening arrangements on Friday."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Grim coronavirus forecast for Australia, but schools to stay open for now","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/16\/coronavirus-scott-morrison-schools\/","transcript":"Two more elderly Australians are confirmed to have died after contracting coronavirus, as leaders unveil a grim forecast for the nation and a warning daily life may not go back to normal for six months. The focus worldwide remains firmly on protecting the elderly and the already unwell from the flu-like illness – with countries taking ‘wartime’ steps to protect the vulnerable including in the UK where the over 70s will be asked to self-quarantine for up to four months. In Australia, a key part of the protection measures is making it hit home to the young and healthy that they could be unknowingly spreading COVID-19. That has led Education Minister Dan Tehan and Prime Minister Scott Morrison to make the call that for now parents should keep their children in schools – despite a ban on gatherings over 500 people from Monday. Parents have expressed frustration and confusion over the ruling schools will remain open. But Mr Tehan and Mr Morrison said medical advice was that having kids out of school and coming into contact with strangers could put more people at risk. It comes as the PM revealed shock new predictions that hospitals and GPs could soon be overwhelmed by 300,000 people a day seeking treatment or testing for the coronavirus. The prediction was made on Sunday as the Prime Minister announced the toughest precautions to date would be enacted from midnight, including mandatory 14-day self-isolation rules for international travellers.

The Queensland woman was aged 77, from Noosaville on the Sunshine Coast. She died in Sydney after flying from Brisbane on Friday. Authorities believe the woman may have contracted the virus from her daughter who recently returned from the US. A Queensland Health spokesman said the woman had developed symptoms on the plane and was taken to hospital. She died that day. NSW Health announced on Sunday night a fifth fatality – a 90-year-old resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged-care home, where two other residents have died. The woman died on Saturday. Pleading with Australians to help health authorities manage the pandemic by ‘flattening the curve’ or peak of cases in coming weeks Mr Morrison revealed government modelling predicts hospitals and intensive care units could struggle to cope if nothing is done. The modelling, obtained by The New Daily, is based on two infection rate scenarios that each coronavirus patient will spread the virus to 1.72 others or a higher infection rate of 2.48. Assuming that every person infected will spread the virus to 2.48 people demand for hospital care, treatment or tests could spike to 300,000 people a day needing care if tougher measures are not taken. But if quarantine measures for those infected is followed and self-isolation is practised that peak can be brought down to 100,000 coronavirus presentations a day in the health system. Mr Morrison warned it could lead to rationing and new rules for intensive care unit beds and emergency department services. “If you don’t take measures that seek to contain the spread, and mitigate the spread, then you have scenarios that look like this,” he said. “You have scenarios where you get a very severe effect on the spread of the virus. “You may move through it much more quickly, but what happens is the virus reaches more people, and that puts maximum pressure on your health system.” The Prime Minister’s office was not prepared to provide estimates or modelling on how many people it expects will be infected, amid predictions it could involve millions of Australians. Travellers who fail to follow the self-quarantine rules could be detained and face penalties of up to $20,000. But international flight crew will be exempt and have been asked instead to practise social distancing when in Australia. “I want to be clear about those travel restrictions I’ve just announced,” Mr Morrison said. “All people coming to Australia will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days. “This is very important. “What we’ve seen in recent weeks is more countries having issues with the virus and that means the source of some of those transmissions are coming from more and more countries.” The PM warned that the disruption to Australians daily life could last up to six months or even longer as the world confronts a once-in-a-generation virus threat. But he said there were good reasons to keep schools open for now. “People are naturally anxious about the issues of schools,” Mr Morrison said. “As the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of wide-scale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these curves operate. “The two reasons: When you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk. “Also issues of herd immunity which relate to children. “The other is the disruption impact that could have and put at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses, doctors and others who are essential in the community because they would have to remain home and look after their children. “That could make the situation worse, not better.” The PM said the issue would be considered further on Friday, along with arrangements for Anzac Day. “We will be putting out specific guidelines about those [Anzac Day] gatherings, and particularly the participation of more vulnerable Australians and our elderly veteran community,” Mr Morrison said. New restrictions around the visiting of aged-care facilities are also likely to apply shortly."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus crisis response helps Scott Morrison to Newspoll lead","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/16\/coronavirus-crisis-scott-morrison\/","transcript":"Federal Labor remains ahead of the coalition on a two-party preferred basis in the latest Newspoll but the survey also suggests Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s approval ratings were boosted by his government’s economic stimulus package.

The famous incident resulted in Harding being banned for life from figure skating. Born in 1970 in East Portland, the controversial sport star grew up in a troubled family home. She alleges she was abused by her mother and molested by her half-brother on several occasions throughout her childhood. To try to earn the approval of her family, Harding dedicated her life to figure skating. She dropped out of high school when she was 16 to train full time. After climbing up the ranks in the US Figure Skating Championships between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 Skate America Competition. She was the 1991 and 1994 US champion and became the first American woman to land the notoriously difficult triple axel in a competition. But her illustrious career came to an abrupt end after an incident on January 6, 1994. Just one day before an important figure skating championship, Harding’s rival, fellow American skater Nancy Kerrigan was attacked after a practice session at the Detroit Cobo Arena. It later emerged that Harding’s ex-boyfriend had hired a hitman to smash Kerrigan’s right knee with a bat to try to force her out of the nationals competition and the Winter Olympics, allowing Harding to take her spot. The attack left Kerrigan’s leg bruised, not broken, and she went on to win silver at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Harding finished eighth. Even though Harding denied any involvement in the attack, police believe she knew about plans to attack Kerrigan. At the time, she was the centre of a media frenzy in the US and around the world. Many people didn’t believe her and there was much speculation about her role in the plot.

Sometimes he holds the boy tight. Mostly, though, he feels guilty for bringing his son to the mosque where gun blasts shattered Friday prayer, and for not protecting him from being hit. “I saw smoke coming from a hole in his diaper,” says Zulfirman Syah, recalling the day a gunman walked into his mosque and another in Christchurch, New Zealand, a year ago Sunday, killing 51 people and injuring dozens, including him and his son. “I couldn’t care for him.” Syah, an artist with dark, stoic eyes, knows the guilt is irrational; he couldn’t help his son because he had slipped into unconsciousness after diving over the boy and taking bullets in his own back and groin. He nearly died saving his only child’s life. But terrorism scars both bodies and minds. For Syah; his wife, Alta Sacra; and their son, Roes, the past 12 months have been defined by an anguish that recedes and then rushes back. The pain comes when they have to deal with a health care system that leaves them on their own. When they confront conspiracy theorists who use video of Syah to deny reality. When their son’s bruised psyche pushes them further from normalcy. And now, as the anniversary delivers another emotional jolt. Their searing experience points to forces the world has yet to contain: Guns, technology and white supremacy. In their day-to-day lives – documented through repeated visits by a reporter and a photographer for The New York Times – the story is simpler. It’s stubborn love battling a trauma that won’t let go. “Do you think that pain relief has kicked in?” the nurse asks. Syah nods. A few days after the shooting, he is lying in a bed at Christchurch Hospital. The nurse pulls off the bandage covering his back, revealing a moist red hole as wide as a tennis ball. Probing the wound with what looks like a narrow straw, the nurse follows a winding, foot-long path through his insides – one of many signs leading doctors to believe the gunman used hollow-point bullets, which rip through flesh more than regular ammunition does. “Is it very sore?” the nurse asks. “No,” Syah says without hesitation. Physical trauma tests independence while magnifying personality, and in the days and weeks after the shooting, he and his wife go down different paths. Syah, 41, a painter whose works have appeared in a respected gallery in his native Indonesia, tries not to be a bother. Sacra, a 35-year-old teacher from Delaware, is stormier and more demanding of a health care system that has never seen so many gunshot wounds. What they’re grappling with, together, is a complicated set of injuries. In addition to his back, bullets tore through Syah’s upper thigh, his elbow, the top of his penis and his scrotum. “I’m afraid of having to deal with something that isn’t my job,” Sacra says, sitting beside her husband after the nurses leave. “There’s this giant question mark: What does his recovery look like? They say they’re going to take care of us, but what if they don’t?” Like many of the other victims, they are immigrants in this city of 380,000 people, wedged between mountains and the teal Pacific. They arrived on temporary work visas two months before the attack, having been married for three years after meeting on a Muslim marriage app. “Alta came to me like a gift from God,” Syah says. Her version is less mystical. She grew up a daughter of fundamentalist Christians, married young, divorced, moved to Bali, converted to Islam, met her husband, married and had Roes (pronounced Row-ees). The happy family part, she says, “all happened very fast”. And efficiency is how she plans to preserve it. One minute, she’s stopping at the store to buy her husband a tablet so he can watch movies and go online; the next, she’s in his room, putting balm on his chapped lips, joking about how she hopes he can handle her germs. When he comes home two weeks later, however, she struggles. Syah arrives at their first-floor, two-bedroom apartment carrying a device that draws pus from the wound on his back, but the hospital forgot to include a charger. He has a catheter, too – but it comes with no instructions, prompting frantic YouTube searches. Nor is there a clear plan for his medicine, or for physical or psychological therapy. “There’s nothing in the discharge papers telling me what to do,” Sacra says. While Syah lies in bed, trying to lure Roes with chocolate, Sacra is trying to organise therapy for her son and get her husband a general practitioner. What consumes her most is elemental: What if he dies? Late one night, a few weeks in, the pressure becomes too much. She yells at her husband; at her older sister, Leah Sacra, who has come from the US to help; and at the world. “I’m going to slit my throat,” she shouts. Her sister sits with her as she falls to the floor and cries. “I feel like such a failure,” Alta Sacra tells her. “I’m not a good mother. I’m not a good wife.” “What a total invasion.” Sacra is on the couch, glaring at a mention of her husband in some story on the internet. News of him saving his son spread quickly through Indonesia and the US with a mix of half-accurate articles and social media posts. To Sacra, it feels like tragedy porn: People far away feel good, and the traumatised feel used. She spends hours messaging the sources, the platforms, the police and the FBI to ask that images and posts be removed. The reality is this: Sacra was in the middle of cooking lunch when she received a call from her husband that cut out. She called back. “All I heard were horrible sounds,” she says. “People in agony.” There were prayers mixed with wailing, Arabic mixed with English. “Say something, say something,” she recalls yelling. “Just one word!” “Chaos, chaos, chaos,” her husband replied. “I’m down.” The phone went silent. Syah had passed out on the carpet. In the video, Roes pulls at his father, trying to climb on top of him – and away from a man in a grey sweatshirt who lies centimetres away, dead still. Roes was hit with burning shrapnel. He received stitches in his buttocks and legs. If not for his father, it would have been worse. “I did what anyone would have done,” Syah says. But he can’t help asking if he could have done more. He sits on some extra pillows on the couch, the same couch where his wife sat while fighting the conspiracy theories. He seems surprised to hear his ordeal had been manipulated. “I never told him about all that,” Sacra says. Her husband nods and takes it in. She had protected him. At first, Roes wears sunglasses inside the house. When his father comes home from the hospital, he stares, then averts his eyes and keeps his distance from the man who used to put him to bed every night. What Roes hates most is seeing his mother or father lie on the carpet – a clear reminder of the shooting. But faces and objects also throw him back. One day, police drop off the shoes he left at the mosque, and shoes become one of his many triggers. His healing, like their own, has been slow and incomplete. A week after the shooting, a nurse fills out forms to place Roes in art therapy right away. But it never happens. Appointments are cancelled. He falls through the cracks. So, in June, Sacra “goes rogue”. She reaches out to everyone in New Zealand who practises a storytelling therapy known as eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, in which traumas are recalled in brief doses while a therapist mildly distracts the patient. Dr Allister Bush, a child psychiatrist in Wellington, replies immediately to her email. He asks her to write the story of their family for Roes, moving from a comforting beginning to the moments of trauma to his current life of love and safety. “One day, Roes looked and saw Mommy lying on the floor,” she writes in English and Indonesian. “He was takut (scared) and said, ‘Mommy no lay down! Mommy no lay down.’ But it was OK, Mommy was just tired.” When she reads the entire letter to him in the first session with Bush, Roes is engaged but angry. On the second time through, Roes seems to be on the verge of tears. To his mother, sorrow looks like progress. But the trouble doesn’t evaporate. Even after follow-ups with a local therapist, even after they move to the blank canvas of a new home with white walls and skylights, Roes continues to behave in confounding ways. Some days, he plays without incident. He puts on his shoes now like any other three-year-old, which means more slowly than Mom and Dad would like. But there are also unexpected flare-ups. And yet, slowly, the anguish fades. Sacra goes into therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. She starts a new job as a mental health advocate, putting her unyielding approach to work for others. Syah’s routine begins with prayer at dawn. He makes Roes breakfast, then rides his bicycle to English class or paints in the garage. The only piece he’s finished since the shooting is titled Momentum. Roes no longer looks away from his father. He often pulls a book down from the shelf called Say Please, Little Bear, which tells the story of a father teaching his son about friendship. Near the end, when the bears hug, Roes likes to run away – then into his father’s arms, squeezing away the lingering guilt. Last weekend, Syah and Roes found themselves napping together on a plush grey rug at home. With one body curled into another, a father again holding his only son, it was a wonderfully ordinary sequel to March 15. This time, there was no gunfire and no heroism. Only peace. -The New York Times"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"If you must travel by plane amid the coronavirus crisis, here's how to do it","date":"03-16-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/16\/travel-plane-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The dramatic spread of coronavirus around the world has travellers cancelling flights, airlines grounding planes and cutting routes, but is this just panic? Not according to Nobel Prize winner Professor Peter Doherty, whose research is mainly in the area of defence against viruses. He “absolutely advises backing off on travel, especially for older people”. He argues that “you do not want to get sick in a foreign country, especially if they’re already dealing with their own pandemic situation. “There’s also the issue that you don’t know what countries will do with respect to border control. “If you go to Israel, for example, you already have to show you can self-quarantine for two weeks on arrival or they won’t let you in. “Domestic travel, airports and planes will be an increasingly risky environment as this ramps up.” Please view the latest advice on how you can help stop the spread of coronavirus. Have you recently travelled overseas? Know your risk, monitor your health and call your doctor ahead of time. pic.twitter.com\/lUCzJRUC0m — Greg Hunt (@GregHuntMP) March 15, 2020  But what if you really do have to fly? Are you likely to contract coronavirus (COVID-19) if you fly, and can you minimise the risk? The World Health Organisation (WHO) believes COVID-19 is transmitted like other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu, through droplets of mucus or saliva, or aerosols where particles remain suspended in the air. Infection can be through close contact (defined as just under two metres and for 15 minutes or longer) with someone who has the virus coughing or sneezing, or through contact with surfaces contaminated by the droplets. The WHO’s message is that your hands are the most likely place to pick up virus germs and that touching your eyes, nose and mouth is the most likely way to transmit them to your system. So – whether you are flying or not ­– wash your hands well with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitiser if you can’t wash. And don’t touch your face. Research by US company Insurancequotes in 2018 showed the dirtiest places at the airport include self check-in machines, the armrests on the seats at the airline gate, and the water fountain button. Once on the plane the dirtiest places were the tray table and seat buckle. We’re talking thousands more bacteria and fungal cells than your normal toilet seat. Print and take your boarding pass if possible, or use a mobile boarding pass. Keep your distance from people, especially anyone coughing or sneezing. If you do stop to eat, check that servers are using gloves and make sure the surfaces are being cleaned regularly. Pack anti-bacterial wipes and travel-sized alcohol-based hand sanitiser (60 per cent alcohol is recommended). Take tissues to cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing, then dispose of them immediately. The WHO does not recommend wearing face masks unless you have a cold or flu or suspect you have contracted an illness (that’s assuming you can buy a face mask). The WHO says you are most at risk of infection from people on either side in the same row, the people in the two rows in front and behind. Recent findings by two American researchers in a National Geographic Science Report  reveal that if you have a window seat you have the least risk of coming into contact with an infectious passenger. As people walk up and down the aisle they are more likely to come into contact with people in aisle seats, even though contact is minimal. If you are near the toilets, however, or the galley, you may find people standing there, and waiting for longer periods. As the toilet is potentially one of the most germ-infected spots on the plane, minimise your trips to the toilet. Before you settle down on the plane, use sanitising wipes to clean your area – tray table and arm rests, entertainment screen, seat buckle, headrest and window shade. Also consider if you need to put things in the seat pocket, which may have had all sorts of rubbish (dirty tissues etc) in it. The safety card and the airline magazine – especially at the end of the month ­– will have been well and truly handled. Judging by the number of times passengers bob up and down to the overhead lockers, those handles are also high-touch and may be germy too. There is no data for COVID-19 as yet, but it is known that with SARS contaminated materials could remain infectious for from two hours to nine days, longer in a cold environment. These pathogens thrive where it is a cold and damp. Transmission is through droplets, not through the air. Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar planes, like most modern aircraft, use HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Arresters) aircraft filtration systems, “which filter 99.999 per cent of dust particles and airborne contaminants such as viruses and bacteria, ensuring the highest possible quality of cabin air”. Virgin Australia’s CEO Paul Scurrah says, “To date, there has been no confirmed in-flight transmission of COVID-19 anywhere in the world”, which is reassuring. These filters are used in hospital operating rooms. The incubation period is thought to be two to 10 days [with five days the average], so watch for any symptoms in that time and if they do occur get medical advice.

Handshakes have been banned, and we are no longer allowed to attend events of more than 500 people. But what else are we banned from doing? Can we still go to the pub or the cinema? What about the gym? Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming into close contact with others to slow down the spread of a disease. It also intends to reduce the chance of high-risk groups, such as the elderly, from becoming infected, and to alleviate the burden on our health care systems and workers. Measures can include cancelling group events like rock concerts and sporting matches, as well as closing down public spaces like schools and universities. The best part? It works. In China’s Hubei province, where the virus broke out in December, health authorities quickly introduced tough travel restrictions and bans on large gatherings. The move contributed to a much lower rate of infection compared to other countries like Iran and Italy where the governments were slower to respond. Public health experts have described the success of social distancing as “flattening the curve” because it prevents surges in illness that could overwhelm health care systems. Fortunately, it’s not too late for us to curb the damage in Australia – but only if everyone plays their part. From Monday, all Australians will be banned from attending ‘organised, non-essential gatherings’ of more than 500 people. That means no more sporting matches, no theatre shows and no music festivals. The rule does not apply to schools, universities or public transport yet. In the meantime, we must also aim to stand at least 1.5 metres apart when possible. That means keeping your distance when you go grocery shopping and being mindful of other people in public places like the pub. It is also important to stay away from aged-care residences if possible, as elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the virus. Even if you don’t feel sick, you need to stick to the rules: There have been cases of people who haven’t felt any symptoms of COVID-19 who have unwittingly spread the virus to another person. I have Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which restricts my breathing. I have scarring in my lungs from frequent bouts of pneumonia. I also have heart arrhythmia when I have fevers. I am #HighRiskCovid19.

On Sunday morning, federal health minister Greg Hunt and chief medical officer Brendan Murphy told ABC’s Insiders that Australians who have not recently returned from overseas, nor been in contact with a confirmed case, could still take public transport, visit the gym or go to the cinemas. “Should people be shaking hands right now?”#Insiders host @David_Speers asks Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy for some basic facts for people confused about what’s ok and what’s not for #coronavirus #auspol pic.twitter.com\/9z7KIUq92s — Insiders ABC (@InsidersABC) March 15, 2020 But that advice looks likely to change. “As the situation evolves, every day we meet as the experts for two or three hours and we’re looking at the case numbers (and) the evidence,” Professor Murphy told the ABC on Sunday. “The epidemiology is evolving, but as the case numbers increase we’re likely recommending increased numbers of social distancing.” Professor Murphy said Australia could face an entire country lockdown like Italy. “Everything is up for consideration,” he said. Everyone. Previously, it was only Australian travellers returning from non-high risk countries who had to practise social distancing for two weeks. But now we all have to do it. On Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison introduced a new rule that all Australians returning home from overseas – even from countries where the virus hasn’t spread far – must now go a step further than social distancing and self-isolate for 14 days.

Short walks around the block at night time are OK, as long as you don’t stop and chat to anyone. If you share a house with other people, wear a mask when you’re around them and wash your hands regularly. If you live with a partner, you need to sleep in a separate bedroom.

Some remark that coronavirus has “only a 1-4 per cent” fatality rate, while others implore that everyone relax because “most people will only get mild symptoms”. These statements are broadly correct, but there’s a callous confidence that comes with knowing you’re part of the 96 per cent who will survive an infection – instead of being among the potential “four-percenters” who might not. Of course their comments are not aimed directly at us, but I cannot help wondering whether they know we’re listening. Last year I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had it removed and am now enduring four months of chemotherapy to keep me cancer-free. I’m seven weeks into my treatment and every time I receive a dose of the cancer-killing stuff, it also knocks out part of my immune system. Last week, I picked up a viral throat infection from one of my kids and ended up at Sydney’s St Vincent’s emergency department after the symptoms escalated worryingly. It was a real wake-up call. If I’m to fight off a viral infection, it is my lymphocytes I’ll be relying on. The normal range for a healthy person is a count between 1.5 and 4. When my blood was tested by the emergency department halfway through my third chemo cycle, it showed my lymphocyte count had dropped to 0.6. A reading that low does not mean I have no immune system to rely on, but it does leave me genuinely concerned that if I contract COVID-19 I might not be among the group who experience only mild symptoms. I am by no means the only one with this worry. As someone older and infirmer, I am not loving all the it’s “only” us who will die from the virus. I am quite nice, still moderately useful, occasionally funny and I have no franking credits … so please may I live a little longer ? — Patricia Barraclough (@PMBarraclough) March 8, 2020 When retired broadcaster Patricia Barraclough, who described herself as an “older” person, posted on Twitter that she felt uncomfortable seeing posts about it being “only” the elderly and those with underlying health conditions who will die from the virus, her sentiments were seconded by a range of mature people. This was echoed by those with chronic asthma and compromised immune systems. “I’m with you Patricia,” Jenny Harrison, another “older” person wrote. “I do feel rather expendable when they keep saying that.” I don’t just feel expendable, I feel exposed. My best protection right now is to avoid coming into contact with the virus entirely, and my best chance of that happening is if it is not spreading within my community. For that to happen, us potential 4 percenters are depending on hundreds of thousands of random strangers to be vigilant and take sensible precautions, not because they are worried they might die of the disease, but because they care enough about potentially thousands of vulnerable people who could. Right now, we are not feeling that love. Seems horribly lacking in any humanism. Will it change behaviour? How about some strong messaging that we must act, because if certain people get it they will die. It’s the people, stupid.#COVID19Aus #auspol https:\/\/t.co\/W6u790CnDO — Mary Lloyd (@MaryLloyd4) March 14, 2020 When people spread blithe messages about the fatality rate or flippantly comment about easily shaking the disease off, there is a risk others will take a similar careless approach. Less care in the community will lead to more infections. This is where it becomes truly terrifying for potential four-percenters: If so many people contract the virus that the healthcare system becomes overwhelmed, we cannot be sure we will receive the care we need. Look at Italy. The death rate there is alarmingly high, not because the virus is more virulent, but because doctors are having to make that most dreadful of decisions. They are having to “pick winners”, which means taking account of patients’ underlying health conditions and deciding who gets access to scarce resources like ICU beds, ventilators and ECMO machines (blood-pumping machines). Those less likely to survive are by necessity left to die. I’m expecting to fully recover from my underlying health condition, but if I contract coronavirus at the height of this outbreak, can I be sure in a contest between myself and another patient I will hold the winning ticket? Of course, I’d rather not find out, for their sake as well as mine. So instead of relying on the health system to be adequately equipped if I do succumb, I am left reliant on people like my neighbour Sarah. Last week she had a sore throat and insisted on staying two metres away from me, and immediately got herself tested. She did it not for the sake of her own health, but to protect me and her ageing father. And I’m hoping people will take note of the signs at places like Sydney’s Kinghorn Cancer Centre asking them not to enter the building if they are experiencing symptoms that could put chemo patients at risk. If over the next few days, however, it does not feel like Australians as a community of people are committed to staying away from large events, practising social distancing, supporting people to work from home, and keeping the virus out of schools, I will be taking action to isolate myself and my family until it is all over. What we are faced with is a public health risk, not a risk to every individual’s life. We need to respond accordingly. So on behalf of all the potential four-percenters out there, I beg that people be vigilant and take the virus seriously, not because we are all potential fatalities, but because among us there are people whose best chance of surviving the outbreak is if its spread is slowed so our health system can adequately treat everyone in need. Or better still, if they do not come into contact with the virus at all.

They say, ‘If we miss Baba, we will just hug you tightly. Because you are him and he is you’,” she says. “So I respond saying ‘when I miss him I will hug you too because you is him and he is you’. “I don’t know what I have done to be blessed with them.” Dr Tuyan returned to Christchurch this week for just the second time since the March 15 attack. The speech and language therapist moved to New Zealand with her family in 2013 after winning a scholarship to complete her PhD. She left Christchurch after finishing her studies in late 2018, hopeful of reuniting as a family in June last year. Dr Tuyan is one of 31 women widowed by the attack, New Zealand’s worst mass shooting. She speaks with remarkable grace when she remembers her husband. “He was a hero … a doting husband,” she said, “a beloved son. “He was a principled man, a hardworking man. He was quiet but humble. “He never had a bad thought for anybody. If he hears anybody saying a bad word about anybody he would signal to me to ‘sssh’. “That’s the kind of man he was.” Like many, Dr Tuyan was left searching for meaning in the aftermath of the attacks. She found it in the very thing that made her family a target – her faith. “Islam plays a very big special role in this,” she said. “We have a lot of stories and examples in the Koran about how more important people have been able to overcome their sadness and their depression and far worse experiences and situations than this. “That has given me a lot of healing … (helping) me to change our mindset and not to be bogged down by sadness. “That is what the supremacist and his supporters would want us to do “Fear cannot overcome faith.” Dr Tuyan has also found strength in telling her story. She is one-of-four women who have been profiled in a documentary series, launched this month, called Widows of Shuhada. She was also to have addressed the national remembrance service on Sunday, which was cancelled due to fears it could spread coronavirus. Dr Tuyan said she hoped to issue a challenge to New Zealanders to understand Islam and people of faith. “It’s our responsibility. Every one of us will be accountable for this if we don’t learn from this experience and understand,” she said. “If we do not want 15th March to happen again we all need to read up and learn about each other. “To see that there are a lot of similarities rather than differences. “We all have a role to play in calling out hate speech whether its coming from politicians or the neighbour. “We need to challenge and seek verification from whatever we hear about Islam and Muslims.” She also has a challenge for her own community. “I’m inviting our Muslim community to play a proactive role. Yes you hide, you isolate, you try to heal,” she said. “But you still have to come out and do your job … to extend the hand to other people in the community.” Dr Tuyan’s message echoes a call from the imams of the two mosques targeted in last year’s attack, Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre, which they have called the ‘Christchurch Invitation’. The Christchurch Invitation asks New Zealanders to make three acts – feeding the hungry, reconnecting with others, and spreading peace – the legacy of last year’s attack. “Last year we witnessed beautiful intentions and actions when people saw past labels and differences, saw other people as human beings, and came together after that dreadful shooting,” imam Gamal Fouda and imam Alabi Later Zikrullah said in a shared statement. “This is an invitation to remember what we saw, to recognise that this was us, and to keep those intentions alive. “We want people to remember the loss – forgetting helps no-one – but we want to remind them of the hope. “And there is hope.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Virus fears fail to send a chill through housing market | The New Daily Virus fears fail to send a chill through housing market","date":"03-15-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/15\/virus-doesnt-chill-housing-market\/","transcript":"The nation’s housing market looks resilient in the face of initial coronavirus concerns, property data analysts say.

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said cafes, restaurants and other non-essential businesses would be forced to close to contain the spread of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Spain has declared a 15-day nationwide state of total lockdown that demands residents remain in their homes unless there is an urgent reason to be outside. Announcing the borders would be sealed, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the coronavirus crisis required “extraordinary decisions” – a perspective reinforced by bad news very close to home: his wife, Spain’s First Lady Bergona Gomez, has been diagnosed with the disease. The latest measures come in response to fears over rising infections, as the number of people in intensive care climbs. The closures in France do not impact essential businesses such as grocery stores, chemists, banks and petrol stations. From Monday morning, French people will only be allowed to leave their homes to buy food and medicine, commute to work, go to hospitals and banks or take trips related to the care of the young and the elderly. Israel will also shut malls, hotels and restaurants in a partial shutdown of its economy from Sunday while using anti-terrorism tracking technology to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that, subject to cabinet approval, anti-terrorism monitoring tools would be deployed to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. “We will very soon begin using technology … digital means that we have been using in order to fight terrorism,” Mr Netanyahu told a news conference in Jerusalem on Saturday. He added that he asked for Justice Ministry approval because those measures would infringe patients’ privacy. “The enemy is invisible but we must locate it,” Netanyahu said. #Israelis rush to #grocery stores, stocking up on food and supplies as PM #Netanyahu announces restrictions on all of Israel. #Restaurants, #malls, #cafes, gyms and all #schools will be closed as of tomorrow morning.

The US president said it would take up to two days to know the results of the test which he took on Friday night (local time) in response to querying from journalists. It comes as questions are raised over medical advice against testing people who had been in contact with Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton, including the prime minister and cabinet ministers. Mr Dutton says he developed symptoms on Friday, just days after attending a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that included Scott Morrison which Labor’s Chris Bowen said should require ministers to self-isolate for 14 days. But Australia’s chief health officer Professor Brendan Murphy said it had always been public advice that people only be tested after being in contact with someone infected with coronavirus within 24 hours of them developing symptoms despite WHO advice about a 48-hour contagion period. I am in self isolation because I interviewed Rita Wilson for a total of maybe 15 mins. Yet the PM reckons he is ok after Dutton gets a positive diagnosis. To reduce infection we must all do the right thing. Even the PM. — David Campbell (@DavidCampbell73) March 14, 2020 Mr Trump said he underwent a coronavirus test because he had been asked about it during a press conference, not for any particular concern over contact with an infected person. He told journalists he had also had his temperature taken before entering the press conference room where he was questioned about why he was still shaking hands with people. Mr Trump said shaking hands was a hard habit to break but it was important not to continue the social practice. “People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out, it’s sort of a natural reflex and we’re all getting out of it, all of us have that problem,” he said. “Somebody comes up to you, they put their hand out, you probably tend to shake it, and we’re all getting out of that. “Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now I agree. People are thinking about it more and more. We have to think about it, it’s important.” America’s ban on UK and Ireland travel follows an earlier decision to close its borders to Europe while nations such as New Zealand ramped up border control with strict self-isolation requirements. Vice President Mike Pence said the decision followed “a unanimous recommendation” from “all of our health experts”. The ban will apply to anyone who was physically present in Britain and Ireland in the 14 days prior to their attempted entry to the US. Mr Pence specified that US citizens “can come home” and will be “funnelled through specific airports and processed”. Around the world a range of containment policies have been enacted including bans the closure of non-essential businesses in France, night curfews in the Philippines capital Manila, a lockdown in Spain and fresh emergency measures in Italy such as workplace safety policies. Australia’s ban on mass-gatherings which takes effect on Monday has thrown a number of events and fixtures under a cloud, including the rugby league season. The federal government is rolling out a nationwide advertising camping urging Australians to play their part to help to stem the spread, as the infection toll reached 238. A letter from Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Health Minister Greg Hunt and Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy will run in newspapers across the country on Sunday, along with the latest information on COVID-19. It urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they’re feeling unwell. “Australia has one of the best health systems in the world with some of the most dedicated and experienced health professionals,” the letter reads. “Containing the spread of an infection like COVID-19 comes down to every Australian playing their part by looking after their own hygiene, looking out for each other, and staying informed.” People are also being urged only to be tested for the illness if they are experiencing flu or cold-like symptoms and have recently returned from overseas, or have been in contact with a confirmed case. Advertisements with these messages will also run on television, radio, online and at more than 2200 outdoor sites from this weekend. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus pandemic: What do you need to know?","date":"03-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/14\/coronavirus-questions\/","transcript":"Not all of us have the mobile numbers of Australia’s best medical officers – but many of us are really confused about the coronavirus.

The plague which killed nearly half of Europe in the 14th Century broke out again in China in 1855, slowly making its way from the remote northern provinces to the port of Hong Kong. Emphasis on slowly. Without modern transport to hurry the bacterium Yersina pestis toward new hosts, it was decades before the last great killer wave broke on the shores of the Asia Pacific. But break it did, and medical authorities in the newly federated Australian Commonwealth saw it coming. They did not panic, but they did enforce severe quarantine and control regimes to limit the spread. Demolition crews tore down whole sections of Sydney’s waterfront and blocks of residential streets, where infected rats were known to have come ashore. Thousands of citizens were forced into isolation on Sydney’s North Head quarantine station and hundreds were eventually buried there. The initial outbreak lasted until 1907 and informed the drafting of Australia’s first Quarantine Act, a bill which with other laws afforded unusually draconian powers to the various Chief Medical Officers of the states, territories and the Commonwealth. The Quarantine Act was superseded by 2014’s Biosecurity Act, but the legacy of the Bubonic Plague was not. Medical authority and the scientific method remained the Commonwealth’s weapons of choice for dealing with pandemics. It’s telling to compare the response of the Morrison government to COVID-19 with their painful mismanagement of the summer’s wildfire holocaust and the accelerating changes to our climate which made it so much worse. On this issue, the government remains infected with a rich viral, load of conspiracy thinking, denial and performative stupidity. In responding to COVID-19, however, the entire political class has mostly been sober, practical and more than willing to defer to scientific expertise. Only a few of the usual suspects have beclowned themselves. Why? Most obviously there is no immense, and immensely powerful corporate cartel invested in denying the problem or delaying a response. No analogue of the fossil fuel lobby exists to pour billions of dollars into pseudo think tanks or captive political parties to maintain the value of their investment in a virus that may soon kill millions of people around the world. Even Big Pharma, which will definitely profit from the pandemic, is motivated by market forces to get to a vaccine as quickly as possible. Without the weight of an industry worth trillions of dollars to distort the very fabric of spacetime and reality, there’s not much of a quid to be made in, well, distorting reality. In a perverse way, the differences between the Murdoch media in the US and the rest of News Corp’s global empire throw this into stark relief. In Australia and Britain, Rupert Murdoch’s legions have mostly played the story straight, with a few notable diversions into tabloid bigotry during the early ‘Chinese’ phase of the epidemic. Haters gonna hate, as the kids say. In the US, however, where the Trump Administration seems determined to outdo Beijing’s early efforts at bungling and denial, Fox News has for now jumped the COVID-19 conspiracy shark with the priapic enthusiasm of a chemtrail-huffing QAnon cult leader. But only for now. The cable giant’s ageing target audience is especially vulnerable to this outbreak. Within a few weeks, devotion to the Dear Leader will probably give way to grave concerns about quarterly profits as the bottom drops out of the advertising market for colostomy bags and funeral plans. It’s tough to make a buck when your customers are dead. And of course Murdoch himself, at 89 years old, is not a good chance to survive an encounter with the virus. It’s the pile up of bodies that finally makes it impossible to ignore the science on COVID-19. The feedback loop is too fast. Even with the climate crisis intensifying every year, the worst of it is still in front of us. Even as the predictions of its own scientists came true, and mega-fires threatened the mass extinction of native species, Morrison and his government still retreated to weasel words, evasions and straight up lies about climate change. The screaming of koalas as they were incinerated in the tree tops made that difficult of course, but the donations from the mining industry and all those votes in regional Queensland and WA were a comfort in trying times. With COVID-19, however, it’s our species dying. And not in some vague future. The pandemic will probably peak in June or July here, and it could easily infect up to 70 per cent of the population. It’s cool that Canberra is treating this emergency with the urgency it deserves. When it has passed, it would be awesome if they could do the same for another emergency which will, in the end, do a lot more damage. After all, there’s some old and scary viruses about to thaw out of the Siberian permafrost."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Red Symons has a lightbulb moment and considers going into business","date":"03-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/14\/red-symons-schmerz\/","transcript":"The streets seem to be full of cars with a single passenger. If you conjure up a sequence of images from the turning of the first sod of iron ore, somewhere in the distant desert of Western Australia, then ship it around the world in order to mould it into a car, it seems like a lot of effort for a small return. My lightbulb moment was to put a paying passenger into the car alongside the driver. Since the driver can provide his own car, insurance, petrol, holiday pay, sick leave and superannuation, then all I have to do is make the introductions. I have noticed guides showing tourists around the city. The guide is the one leading the group and holding an identifying flag. I considered this as a way of connecting drivers and passengers like a proxy hitch-hiker flagging down cars. It occurred to me, however, that an app on a phone could do the introductions. I don’t even have to be there. I just skim off a bit of cream for the service everyone else is providing. All that’s left to figure out is a name for the company. Perhaps something German sounding, implying efficiency, order and a hint of sternness. SchmerzCabs! Part of the beauty of this plan is to make every driver and car owner a self-determining entrepreneur. Each of them is in charge of their own destiny and car and insurance, petrol, holiday pay, sick leave and superannuation. You may think that my part of the job is easy but my vision includes a public offering of shares underwritten by a brace of major banks. Try going into a bank and convincing them to invest in something that loses 11 per cent of its assumed value on the first day of trading. It doesn’t look good on paper but it prepares them for the loss of a billion dollars in the first quarter and five billion in the second. You just have to convince them that it will come good at the end of next year. When the plane’s in a steep descent, you don’t turn off the seat belt sign. When in doubt, expand. It can be enormously draining to get into a car to get fast food. Yes, it has already been cooked and good-to-go when you arrive. Yes, there’s no waiting but, when commercials interrupt a program, there’s not enough time to dash to the drive-through before the program starts again. With SchmerzEats, we do the hard yards of getting off the couch and talking to strangers. Just as a bottle of wine should be decanted to oxygenate, so food can be improved by “resting” in a plastic bag whilst travelling for half an hour. Who doesn’t love cold pizza? The beauty of SchmerzEats is that it costs nothing. You, the customer, pay the same price as is on the menu. The deliverer and I simply take a third of the price from the restaurant, not you. No doubt the restaurant is grateful since, without any customers cluttering the floor, they can concentrate on doing what they love, cooking rather than serving. I foresee a time when the tables and chairs and cutlery can be done away with entirely and they can just install kitchens in containers on abandoned building sites. To launch this Schmerz division I shall enlist local celebrities to pose on the couch eating Schmerz. They may have different tastes or even allergies whereby they would not eat a doughnut but throw enough money at them and they will smile obediently. With modern video techniques you could pair people who neither know nor like each other. They still look like they’re sharing a couch. When in greater doubt, expand further. I suspect there’s bigger margin for the deliverer if he’s riding a bike so it makes sense to rent them a SchmerzBike to do the delivery. I’ll do the hard work of borrowing the money from the banks. My final stroke of genius is thus. The deliverer will know what food he has taken to which location so it’s a simple matter to return an hour later to collect SchmerzLeftovers. This could be a bit tricky to on-sell at first. Not everything is as delicious as cold pizza. I shall trial this strategy by offering ScmerzLeftovers to the delivery person. The discount on the meal will be an incentive in itself. Remember, these people are economic migrants and I’m offering them the chance to find their feet and see the sights."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus casts its growing shadow over Africa | The New Daily Coronavirus casts its growing shadow over Africa","date":"03-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/14\/coronavirus-sweeps-across-africa\/","transcript":"No stranger to epidemics, famine and early death, Africa is being hit by the coronavirus, with health authorities across the continent reporting their first cases. Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Guinea and Mauritania have all confirmed outbreaks, giving the disease a foothold in 19 countries. Africa had until now largely been spared the rapid spread of COVID-19, which has infected at least 135,000 people and killed around 5,000 worldwide. Most of Africa’s reported cases were foreigners or people who had travelled abroad. Rapid testing and quarantines have been put in place to limit transmission. But concerns are growing about the continent’s ability to handle the disease. Cases have been reported in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. Mauritania’s health ministry said late on Friday that its first coronavirus patient is a European man – nationality not specified – who had returned to Nouakchott on March 9 and had since been in quarantine.

Senegal confirmed 11 new cases on Friday, raising the total in that West African nation to 21. Its health ministry said 16 had been infected by the same man who had returned from Italy. Among those confirming first cases on Friday, Kenya is the richest economy in East Africa and a hub for global companies and the United Nations, while Ethiopia is Africa’s second-most populous nation, with 109 million people. Addis Ababa and Nairobi are regional transit hubs. In Nairobi, the Kenyan authorities banned all major public events and said they would restrict foreign travel. The mayor of Addis Ababa urged citizens to avoid close personal contact but Ethiopia’s health minister said there were no plans to cancel flights. Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said the country’s first case, a 27-year-old Kenyan, was diagnosed on Thursday after travelling home via London on March 5. He said the government had traced most of the people she had been in contact with, including fellow passengers on her flight, and a government response team would monitor their temperatures for the next two weeks. The Ethiopian case was a 48-year old Japanese national who arrived in Ethiopia on March 4, the health ministry said. Guinea’s first case was an employee of the European Union delegation who had self-isolated after she felt ill upon returning from Europe, the EU delegation said.

The restrictions apply to all countries except for Pacific nations, and will come into effect at midnight on Sunday (10.00pm AEDT). It also includes any New Zealand citizens or residents returning to the country. Ms Ardern said these were “far-reaching and unprecedented” measures to tackle a global pandemic. “Alongside Israel and a small number of Pacific islands who have effectively closed their borders, this decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,” Ms Ardern said. “We are also encouraging New Zealanders to avoid all non-essential travel overseas. This helps reduce the risk of a New Zealander bringing COVID-19 back with them.” Ms Ardern also announced a ban on cruise ships coming to New Zealand. “As of midnight tonight, we’re issuing to all cruise ships not to come to New Zealand until at least 30 June 2020, that is for incoming cruise ships, at which time the directive will be reviewed,” she said. The news will have implications for a number of Australian sporting leagues and events, and already the remaining two games of Australia’s three-match ODI series with New Zealand have been called off, as well as Australia’s upcoming tour of the country. Earlier, a national remembrance service for victims of the Christchurch mosque attacks was cancelled because of concerns about COVID-19. The government said it was taking what it called a “precautionary approach” because the event, scheduled for Sunday, was expected to attract a large crowd with many travelling from around New Zealand and from overseas. “This is a pragmatic decision. We’re very saddened to cancel, but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn’t create the risk of further harm being done,” Ms Ardern said. “March 15 now becomes an opportunity for every New Zealander to reflect in their own way on the events of a year ago. I encourage everyone to take time on Sunday to remember and to recommit to the values of inclusion and love demonstrated so clearly a year ago.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Three more coronavirus cases confirmed in SA, taking national tally to 200","date":"03-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/14\/three-more-coronavirus-cases-confirmed-in-sa-taking-national-tally-to-200\/","transcript":"Australia has now recorded 200 coronavirus cases after three more were confirmed in South Australia. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall made the announcement this morning following an emergency state cabinet meeting. While we are not immune from the impacts of Coronavirus in #SouthAustralia we are working together to slow the spread. We’re acting on the advice from our medical professionals and have plans in place for all scenarios. — Steven Marshall, MP (@marshall_steven) March 14, 2020  The latest cases include a woman in her 30s who had travelled from the UK and a man in his 50s who had been in the US. The third new case was a woman in her 80s who had both been overseas and in contact with another confirmed case. South Australia has recorded a total of 19 cases, including a student at Sacred Heart College who tested positive yesterday. “Six of the people who have been affected have already passed through this illness and have been discharged from hospital,” Mr Marshall said. “We have 13 people who are currently isolated, most of those within our major hospitals.” Mr Marshall attended yesterday’s COAG meeting, along with his interstate counterparts and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, during which it was decided mass gatherings of more than 500 people would be cancelled. A national cabinet comprising state and federal leaders has also been established to coordinate responses to the spread of COVID-19. “We’re asking people who are unwell not to come to work. We’re asking people to adopt and abide by this norm in terms of social distancing,” Mr Marshall said. “We don’t want to be using finite resources to test the ‘worried well’.” Mr Marshall said Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton – who was later diagnosed with coronavirus – was not at Friday’s COAG meeting. “We certainly haven’t received any advice that we are in a cohort that should be tested,” Mr Marshall said. The nation’s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, today said he was at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting attended by Mr Dutton, but there was no need to place himself in quarantine. “No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him,” he said. The number of cases globally has reached 145,000, and the World Health Organisation this week declared a pandemic. “We have early evidence of community transmission, mostly in New South Wales but a little bit in other states. We have moved quite early to institute social distancing measures,” Professor Murphy said. “We have made the decision early enough so that we can give people a few days’ notice to start on Monday, so we can have an orderly transition.” South Australia’s chief public health officer Dr Nicola Spurrier said one “difficulty” had been in speedily accessing flight manifests to notify passengers who had been near those infected. “We’ve been working with the other states to try and improve the speed with which we can get the manifests,” she said. “The people we are really wanting to be able to contact very quickly are the people who are sitting two rows ahead and two rows behind and to the side.” Meanwhile, in Hobart, passengers and crew on luxury cruise ship have been prevented from leaving the vessel while it is docked, in the latest reaction to the pandemic. Swiss ship, the MSC Magnifica is on a world cruise and arrived at the Port of Hobart this morning, after travelling from New Zealand. The cruise ship can carry up to 3000 passengers and almost 1000 staff and crew. Fears of contagion have also led to the cancellation of New Zealand’s national remembrance service to mark a year since the Christchurch terror attack. Thousands of people were expected to attend the Sunday service in Christchurch to mark the anniversary of the March 15 shooting. New Zealand has had just six confirmed cases of COVID-19. All of those cases have been connected to people returning from abroad and so far there haven’t been signs of a local outbreak. The most recent case, involving a man in his 60s who recently returned from the US, was announced by health officials Saturday. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the decision to cancel the service at Horncastle Arena, also announced Saturday, was pragmatic and precautionary. “We’re very saddened to cancel, but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn’t create the risk of further harm being done,” Ms Ardern said in a release. The announcement came a day after Ardern had said at a news conference in Christchurch that the event would still go ahead. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cruise passengers kept on board in Hobart over coronavirus fears","date":"03-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/14\/cruise-passengers-kept-on-board-in-hobart-over-coronavirus-fears\/","transcript":"About 400 cruise ship passengers and staff have been barred from disembarking in Hobart, due to coronavirus concerns.

At a press conference today, Tasmanian Premier Gutwein said the decision followed national advice on border control. “We obviously act on the advice of the Australian Border Agency in terms of what occurs nationally, but controls that are set by the Australian Government are the ones we take into account and also the advice of our own health experts and the Director of Public Health.” “My understanding is there’s no outbreak of coronavirus on the ship itself and this is a precautionary measure that the ship [company] has taken.” Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that Tasmania’s fifth case of coronavirus is a man in his 60s who recently travelled in North America and Canada. He is in a stable condition and in isolation at the Royal Hobart Hospital. Health Minister Sarah Courtney said the man became unwell after he arrived in Tasmania. “Because of the period of time between him arriving in Tasmania and the onset of his symptoms, he was not infectious on his international or domestic flights,” she said. Ms Courtney also said the health system remained ready should the state see more cases. “There’s a range of scenarios that can be worked through at the Royal Hobart Hospital. “I’ve been advised that we do have capacity for more cases, we do have capacity around the state for more cases.” The Health Minister indicated the Government would not be fast-tracking the opening of the new K-block if an outbreak occurred. “We’re working very closely, we want to see K-block open, however, it would be completely inappropriate for me or the Government to open a facility against expert advice,” she said.

A series of images showing the excavation of a new section of graveyard in the city of Qom — the epicentre of Iran’s COVID-19 outbreak — that began around February 21, just two days after Iran reported its first cases of coronavirus, were first published by the New York Times. The images, provided to The Times by US space technology company Maxar, show what appear to be new rows of graves within the city’s largest cemetery and increased activity around the new site.

The Iranian government have reported 429 deaths and 10,075 confirmed cases, but health officials inside Iran previously told the BBC that the true numbers were much higher than were being reported. Among the dead are dozens of officials, including members of Parliament and a senior adviser to the Supreme Leader. Civilians inside Iran, who did not want to be named, told the ABC the death toll was numbering in the thousands and hospitals were so full that other public buildings were being used to house those infected. Between February 19 and 23, Iran reported 43 cases and eight deaths from the virus, but during the same period three exported cases originating in Iran were identified. A report published on health sciences website medRxiv — titled Estimation of COVID-2019 Burden and Potential for International Dissemination of Infection from Iran — estimated that by February 23, “18,300 COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing”. Kaveh Taheri, a Turkey-based researcher, investigative journalist and chairman at the Institute of Capacity Building for Human Rights, said: “Based on grassroots reports received from the country, I am convinced that the estimates would be very close to reality and we do not trust the official statistics.” “Iranians inside the country are extremely frightened,” he said. “You cannot imagine how desperate the people are.” Videos have also been shared on social media showing body bags lined up in a morgue, grave sites and people passed out in the street. أحد الكوادر الطبية يوثق وفاة عشرات المصابين بفيروس كورونا بمدينة قم فقط، ويقول الوفيات كثر ولا يوجد مكان للجنائز من المصابين بكورونا .. بينما الحكومة الإيرانية تتستر على حجم الكارثة وتقول لا يوجد شي يدعو للقلق.! pic.twitter.com\/X7K8YrAt2X — محمد مجيد الأحوازي (@MohamadAhwaze) March 2, 2020  One video shows multiple motionless bodies laid out across a morgue floor.

The US president made the dramatic decree in order to “unleash the full power of the federal government”, including $US50billion ($80 billion) to fight the virus. It comes as the World Health Organisation warned Europe was the “new epicentre” of the global pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China. “More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Mr Trump will give emergency powers to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar to waive federal regulations and laws so doctors and hospitals have “flexibility” in treating patients. The US President says he will “most likely” be tested for the virus, as questions swirl about why he, his top aides and his family weren’t doing more to protect themselves and others after repeated exposure to COVID-19. Mr Trump has now had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have tested positive for the pandemic virus. He also announced a new public-private partnership to expand coronavirus testing capabilities following criticism his administration was too slow in making the test available. The partnership will include drive-through testing in some locations and an online portal to screen those seeking to get tested. Nations have begun ramping up measures to contain further spread of the pandemic, including placing bans on large public gatherings and closing schools. The international tally stands at more than 144,000 infections and more than 5,000 deaths. Australia on Friday advised against mass gatherings of more than 500 people which will apply from Monday after a number of high-profile events were cancelled, including the Australian Grand Prix. Spain has declared a state of emergency while the UK has postponed local elections for a year. The Canadian parliament has been suspended for more than a month after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife tested positive, forcing the leader into self-isolation.

So far 1992 people in the USA have tested positive and 37 died. The country’s testing regime hit the spotlight after a top American health official said the system was “really not geared for what we need right now”. Since January just over 11,000 tests have been performed in America compared to about 20,000 per day in South Korea. Mr Trump criticised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the US organisations leading the fight against the deadly infection, for having a testing system that he said would “always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic”. Italy’s new infections soared by more than 2500 and virus-related deaths increased by 250, their biggest single day jump. On Friday, the country reached 17,600 confirmed cases and 1266 deaths. Tens of millions of students on three continents face weeks without classes. New infections also rose sharply in Spain and the government put 60,000 people in four towns on a mandatory lockdown on Friday. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a two-week state of emergency beginning on Saturday and pledged to “mobilise all resources,” including military, to contain the country’s sharp rise in coronavirus cases. In China, where new infections have tailed off, authorities mobilised to prevent a boomerang effect, quarantining new arrivals for 14 days. But the intensifying spread of COVID-19 beyond Asia dashed any hopes for containing the virus, despite drastic curbs on travel and social events. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Morrison ducks, weaves and backs out of attending Sharks game | The New Daily Morrison ducks, weaves and backs out of attending Sharks game","date":"03-14-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/14\/morrison-wont-attend-sharks-game-after-all\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison has abandoned plans to attend his ‘beloved’ Cronulla Sharks’ first NRL game but has decided not to be tested for the coronavirus, despite close contact with the hospitalised Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. The Prime Minister’s office confirmed on Friday night that chief medical officer Brendan Murphy had advised him he did not need to self isolate despite close contact with Mr Dutton during a four-hour cabinet meeting. “In advice provided to the Prime Minister this evening, the deputy chief medical officer has reiterated that only people who had close contact with the minister in the preceding 24 hours before he became symptomatic need to self-isolate,” Mr Morrison’s office said. “That does not include the Prime Minister or any other members of the Cabinet.” However, a short time later following questions from media outlets including The New Daily, his office confirmed he would no longer be attending the NRL game. Mr Morrison had insisted he would attend the match despite the proposed ban at a press conference earlier in the day. “The Prime Minister today said he would be attending the Sharks’ first NRL match because he wanted to make it very clear that the medical advice from the experts about mass gatherings of more than 500 people was not taking immediate effect,” the spokesman said. “The PM made the point the advice was being introduced after the weekend so the medical experts could finalise their arrangements and that there was no serious immediate health risk to Australians attending such events over the weekend. “This advice will be considered by the new National Cabinet, to be chaired by the Prime Minister, on Sunday. “The PM did not want to create any unnecessary alarm as a result of these proposed new arrangements. “After further consideration and the potential for the Prime Minister’s attendance to be misrepresented, the Prime Minister has chosen not to attend the match this weekend. The Prime Minister believes this would avoid any unnecessary confusion about his attendance.” In a statement, a spokesman for Mr Morrison also confirmed the Home Affairs Minister had attended a cabinet meeting in Sydney on Tuesday with over 20 ministers and their staff. “The Minister attended Tuesday’s meeting of the federal cabinet in person and Thursday’s meeting of the national security committee via video link,” the spokesman said. Asked if Mr Morrison would be tested for the coronavirus as a precaution, a spokesman replied, ‘no’. Earlier, Mr Dutton confirmed the shock news that he had contracted the coronavirus and is being treated in a Brisbane hospital just days after he sat around a Cabinet table with Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Queensland Health will now trace everyone that Mr Dutton has been in contact with that he could have passed on the communicable disease to not knowing that he was infected. The development sparked fears that the Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers, could be forced to self-isolate. Mr Dutton is the first federal politician to test positive for COVID-19 and recently returned from an overseas work trip. “This morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat,” Mr Dutton said in a statement. “I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for COVID-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive. “It is the policy of Queensland Health that anyone who tests positive is to be admitted into the hospital and I have complied with their advice. “I feel fine and will provide an update in due course.” Mr Dutton travelled to the United States in early March to meet security ministers from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance in Washington.

That word is Schadenfreude, which essentially means taking pleasure from someone else’s misfortune. For more than a decade, Labor has been trying to live down the bad reputation it gained during the last time it was in office, when the prime minister at the time, Kevin Rudd, and his treasurer, Wayne Swan, injected billions of dollars into the Australian economy to inoculate it against the ravages of the Global Financial Crisis. The tragic irony for Labor was that the bold cash splash was successful – Australians were spared from the worst economic impacts of the global recession and were therefore left none the wiser about the bullet we had dodged. Instead of being grateful for being spared from a recession, we focused on the mistakes made by the Rudd government in its rush to get the cash out the door.  Such as the $900 cheques sent to dead people, over-priced school halls and the tragic outcomes of the poorly implemented home insulation program. At the time, Labor already had a problem with older Australians who remembered its spendathon during the Whitlam years, and then a whole new generation was left with the impression that the party was as responsible with money as a drunk in a casino. This view may have also been reinforced by the big spending promises made by Labor during the 2016 and 2019 federal elections. This is borne out in a recent opinion poll, published this week, which found 40 per cent of those surveyed believed the Coalition is better at managing the general economy, compared with 31 per cent for Labor. Although it should be noted that the survey also found respondents believed Labor was superior when it came to managing the economy for workers, older Australians, and people living in regional communities. The Coalition’s electoral success in recent times, with John Howard in office for nearly 12 years, and the triumvirate of Abbott\/Turnbull\/Morrison for seven years so far, has almost entirely been based on voters’ perception that it was the superior economic manager. To date, Rudd has been the only Labor opposition leader able to pierce that shield, by successfully arguing during the 2007 federal election campaign that John Howard’s “reckless spending must stop!” If current opposition leader Anthony Albanese wants to take Labor to an election win at the next federal poll, he will also have to find a way to neutralise the Coalition’s strongest asset. Just three months ago, PM Morrison called the former Labor government ‘economic panic merchants’ for implementing its ‘wasteful’ GFC stimulus package. The temptation would now be great for Mr Albanese to play up the Coalition’s hypocritical change of heart on the merits of economic stimulus, perhaps by telling his opponent that it “Sucks to be you,” next time they meet in parliament to debate passage of stimulus legislation. There may even be battle-scarred MPs from the Rudd\/Gillard years still within Labor ranks who’d like to see some retribution taken for the Coalition’s decades of economic hubris. is sick and resting up. Diagnosis Rudd Flu – brought on by copious amounts of public debt. Pandemic warning in place. — Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) May 30, 2009 As Paul Bongiorno wrote earlier this week, shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers, who worked for then Treasurer Wayne Swan during the GFC, cranked up the pressure by claiming “Australia needs this government to do a better job managing these challenges.” Economist and former adviser to former PM Julia Gillard, Stephen Koukoulas, posted on Twitter “I am staggered that the government is still waiting to announce, let alone deliver anything to avert a recession. What does it need to see before acting?” However Mr Albanese has promised voters to take the high road in an effort to repair voters’ confidence in politicians and politics. So far in response to the Coalition’s stimulus package he has been constructive, calling for parliament to be returned a week early – namely next week – and offering to help the government quickly pass the necessary legislation. Coronavirus is a public health emergency. So why has it taken so long for there to be a public health information campaign? Australians want clear information, based on expert medical advice, to help us get on top of this pandemic and keep families safe. pic.twitter.com\/vbrj5GKLsp — Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) March 13, 2020 “Labor will expedite any passage of legislation through both houses of Parliament,” Mr Albanese said on Friday. The Opposition leader did note however that this spirit of cooperation did not come with a blank cheque. “Of course, we want to examine the legislation to see if improvements can be made, but we want to be constructive.” He said Labor would pay particular attention to measures that affected casual workers and low-income earners. It would also examine the regional investment fund “to make sure that the sort offences that we have seen in the sports rorts won’t happen [again]”. What happens next could be a pivotal point in Australian politics. When a global health crisis paired with a domestic economic crisis is threatening the nation, a genuinely bipartisan approach is needed. Albanese has proffered the hand of cooperation (albeit with caveats) and appears to have resisted the initial temptation to extract political mileage from the government’s misfortune. Now it is up to Mr Morrison to respond in kind. If the PM insists on playing partisan politics during the crisis, risking the cooperation of Labor and ability to provide help where it is needed, he will be guilty of putting his own interests before those of the Australian people. Voters won’t forget such an act of selfishness. Some things should be above politics – and this is one of them."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Why slowing the spread is just as important","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/13\/coronavirus-curve-flatten-what\/","transcript":"The Morrison government has its eyes set on halting the coronavirus outbreak – but slowing the rate of new cases is just as important. If the number of infections were to keep rising dramatically, the burden on health care providers would become unmanageable, a startling new graph from the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has shown. Doctors, hospitals and other medical providers can only handle so much at any given time without becoming overwhelmed, meaning slowing down the rate of infections – not just in the world’s hardest-hit countries – is critical to avoid more infections and deaths. The horizontal line drawn through the graph shows the point at which America’s health system would reach its capacity. If, in a short period of time, doctors see an upsurge in the number of people returning positive test results for the coronavirus, they would be stretched far beyond their capacity and there won’t be enough test kits, medicine, and hospital beds, for example, to meet the needs of patients. That’s a major reason why doctors in Australia have been calling for authorities to urgently impose similar strategies to those in Italy, where 60 million citizens remain under lockdown. Or, at the very least, advise people to avoid gathering in public spaces and even initiate limits on how many people can assemble as they don’t want to see a significant rise in hospital admissions for coronavirus infections. The sharp curve indicates a rapidly spreading virus where great numbers of people contract COVID-19 in a short space of time. To flatten the curve, the virus must spread at a much slower rate, meaning there will be fewer people diagnosed with the virus over time. For that to happen, precautionary measures must be taken to diminish the rate at which new cases occur and prevent overtaxing the finite resources available to treat the virus. It’s especially important in places that don’t have as many cases to ensure the virus does not start to spread at a rapid rate. Even in Pennsylvania, where there are 22 cases of the coronavirus, lieutenant governor John Fetterman is calling for local officials to take guidance from the federal health authority about slowing the virus’ spread by “flattening the curve”. “It’s like stopping a pack of matches from lighting by the other half, from the first three that are firing off,” Mr Fetterman told local news station Action News 4. “You have no reason to panic, but reason to be prepared – and to understand some of these changes and steps and cancellations that are going to be happening, even though you may not have any documented case in your county at the moment.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Australia is prepared, medical officials say","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/13\/coronavirus-australia-prepared\/","transcript":"The text message only said two words: “I’m scared.” A different number, an hour later: “What’s the deal with lockdown?” Then a third: “A co-worker is being tested.” For the past week, Australians have woken up to headlines declaring the mounting global death toll, mass graves in Iran and millions of people across the globe trapped in their homes. They’ve anxiously texted their friends and found themselves refreshing news feeds for fresh information on the coronavirus. Some, in a bizarre and extreme move, have filled their cupboards with toilet paper. It’s hard to fight the panic. But before we collectively cancel 2020 and head to the bunkers, some of Australia’s leading health professional want one thing to be very clear: we have been prepared for years. “We are in a good position,” Paul Komesaroff, professor of medicine and director, Centre for Ethics, Monash University told The New Daily. “The fact we’ve taken measures early, like self-isolation and travel bans, has at least to some extent protected the community. “We have processes and protocols in place to set up testing facilities, to educate the community. We’ve already done quite a lot of important work.” Although no government or community can ever rule out worst-case scenarios, there are some clear cut differences between Australia and countries more acutely affected. In Iran for instance, officials failed to take protective measures and after the first coronavirus deaths, they played down the threat. Ground Zero for Iran’s outbreak, the city of Qom, is filled with shrines people touch and kiss, which is thought to have spurred on the viral spread. The country also went through a general election right after the initial outbreak, and at some polling places in regional areas, no health and safety measures like wearing masks were undertaken. At first, the government said they weren’t interested in quarantining the city and it took officials 19 days after the first death to cancel Friday prayers. In short, the country was ill-equipped and acted slowly. In the Middle East, it became the heart of the outbreak. In Europe, Italy has been hit the hardest. Last week, in just 24 hours the country’s death toll jumped from 189 to 1016, making it the worst hit after China. The virus has overwhelmed the country’s health system, especially in the north in Lombardy, one of the wealthiest regions in Europe. It’s not completely clear why cases ramped up so fast. It may be partially due to the fact Italy has an older population who are more at risk. There is also speculation it spread between health workers before doctors realised it was a problem, as about 10 per cent of medical workers in Lombardy have been infected. Others have argued it just snuck up on the country. One former Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, pointed out to The New York Times the virus had been in the country for 10 days before the government caught on. “Today the red zone is Italy,” he warned. Associate professor Adam Kamradt-Scott from the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney said we had been preparing for a pandemic for years. “Our plans are nuanced, and permit variation to allow for a proportionate response to the threat we face,” he said. “Our leaders and senior public health officials are receiving some of the best medical and public health advice that is available, informed by people who have been working on the possibility of this very scenario for years.” Last week, the Australian government announced a national health plan, which includes 100 private practice respiratory clinics, and extension of the telehealth services. “The Australian response to COVID-19 has also included a number of measures designed to firstly contain and now slow the spread,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health said. “This includes current travel bans (some of which have now been in place for some time), previous careful repatriations and quarantines of at-risk Australians overseas and now the advice provided today regarding not undertaking mass gatherings of more than 500 people. “These measures are proportionate and made deliberately early to slow the spread and get ahead of the curve.” Speaking on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison advised all Australians to reconsider their overseas travel plans, regardless of destination, age or health. He said from Monday, gatherings of more than 500 people should be suspended. University of Queensland virologist Ian Mackay said there have been positives to our national response that set us apart, including pandemic plans and efficient laboratories. “I think we’ve done a pretty good job,” he said. “One of the big things missing has been good reliable communication to the public. That really has not been there. “We could have stopped the panic earlier; we could have some detail about what you can do. That’s all been missing. We’ve had some mixed messages, it’s a bit annoying.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"AFL games will go on -- but the stands will be empty | The New Daily AFL games will go on -- in front of empty stands","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/13\/afl-games-will-go-on-but-the-stands-will-be-empty\/","transcript":"The 2020 AFL premiership season will start as scheduled but fans will be locked out of stadiums indefinitely as part of the league’s measures to counter the spread of coronavirus.

The AFL took the step after deciding against delaying the start of the season following Friday’s decision by the federal government to place a blanket ban on gatherings of 500 or more people. Round six of the AFLW season, scheduled to get underway on Friday night when Geelong host North Melbourne at GMHBA Stadium, will go ahead with fans present before supporters are locked out for the rest of the round. League boss Gillon McLachlan flagged the move on Tuesday, with a decision to be made in close consultation with government medical experts. “It is important that we take the advice of those that know best and that advice right now is to continue with matches but not to host mass gatherings, which can put everyone at risk,” McLachlan said in a statement released late on Friday afternoon. “I am disappointed for our fans but we cannot put them in a situation that potentially jeopardises the health and well-being of the whole community. “The landscape is changing quickly; each organisation has their own set of challenges but our clubs, players, officials and fans know that the health and safety of all is the No.1 priority. “We are working through a major issue that impacts the wider community and we will work with all our clubs and industry partners to ensure that footy finds a way.” AFL clubs have implemented a range of measures, including excluding fans from training and banning autographs and selfies, in an attempt to protect players and staff. In other developments on Friday, two VFL practice matches were cancelled and Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett issued a plea to fans to stand by his club as it braces for a huge financial hit.

It doesn’t include university lectures. It doesn’t mean people getting on public transport or going to airports or things of that nature,” Mr Morrison said. “It is precautionary. It is getting ahead of this to ensure that we can minimise the impact on your health and [so] we can ensure with confidence the ability for people to be accessing the health services that they and their families will need.” The Prime Minister also said Australians should reconsider travel overseas unless it was essential. The government has raised the level of travel advice for all countries, regardless of people’s destination, age or health. “This is done to protect their health and to limit their exposure, given we have so many countries now that are affected by the coronavirus. Only essential travel should be considered if you are going overseas from this point forward,” he said. Australia’s chief medical officer had earlier made the recommendation that large gatherings be cancelled amid fears about COVID-19. State premiers, chief ministers and the Prime Minister subsequently acted on Brendan Murphy’s advice at the meeting in Sydney. The Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix in Melbourne had already been cancelled today, and spectators for cricket games banned. NRL, soccer and AFL officials are all currently grappling with questions about crowds and contagion. The Prime Minister insisted he would still be attending the season-opening game of his beloved Cronulla Sharks rugby league team in Sydney on Saturday night. The NRL match between the Canberra Raiders and Gold Coast Titans is also going ahead on Friday night. WA Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Andrew Miller had earlier posted on social media: “You want to go to the footy? I want my colleagues to stay alive.” He finished the tweet by declaring “this is not a game”. You want to go to the footy? I want my colleagues to stay alive. Cancel crowds at events.

Carnival’s Princess Cruise lines said it would halt its 18 ships until May 10, while Viking is to suspend river and ocean cruises until May 1. Carnival said the cancellation was “a difficult business decision”. It operates the Diamond Princess, which was stranded in Yokohama in February while COVID-19 spread through passengers and crew in one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus. Eventually, many nations – including Australia – evacuated their citizens from the ship. Those who had already tested positive for the lethal virus remained in isolation and quarantine in Japan. Carnival also operates the Grand Princess, which was finally allowed to moor in California earlier this week with 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus on board. Princess Cruises president Jan Swartz said the cancellation was intended to reassure passengers, staff and those who did business with the cruise line. “It is widely known that we have been managing the implications of COVID-19 on two continents,” she said. The company said on Friday that Princess cruises ending in the next five days will continue as normal. Those beyond March 17 will be concluded at specified locations. People on board ships that will end cruises in the next five days will not experience disruptions.  Viking chairman Torstein Hagen also described the move as a difficult decision. But he said the global coronavirus pandemic had made travel “exceedingly complicated”. “An increasing number of ports, including Venice, Monte Carlo and Bergen, have temporarily closed to cruise ships; major attractions such as the Vatican and other museums have been closed; and some countries are imposing restrictions on public gatherings and visitors,” he said. Viking had also had a passenger in South-East Asia exposed to the virus while in transit. She – and the cruise’s 28 other guests – is in quarantine. “The situation has now become such that operating as a travel company involves significant risks of quarantines or medical detentions,” Mr Hagen said. Viking’s cancellations apply to cruises that were to depart between March 12-April 30. The cruise industry is among those hard hit economically, and US President Donald Trump has pledged to help airlines, cruise ships and other travel companies. Travel companies and airlines have also been hit hard in Australia. On Friday, Flight Centre said it would close 100 branches within months, while Virgin Australia announced more cuts to its flights and passenger capacity. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Flight Centre to close up to 100 branches, cuts executive bonuses","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/finance\/consumer\/2020\/03\/13\/flight-centre-branches-close\/","transcript":"Travel agency Flight Centre will close 100 outlets across Australia and has scrapped its earnings guidance to try to soften the financial hit from the escalating coronavirus outbreak. Staff will also be encouraged to take leave or switch to part-time work, while executive bonuses will be cut as the travel retailer reels from the virus fallout. Flight Centre said on Friday that affected “underperforming” branches would close before June 30. Affected staff will be transferred to other outlets, as part of a wider set of cost-cutting moves by the agency. Flight Centre brands include Escape Travel and Student Flights. Managing director Graham Turner said reducing costs was priority in an uncertain environment. He reported significant softening in bookings, which he expected to continue into April at least. “Within this uncertain environment, our priorities are to reduce costs, while also ensuring that we and our people are ready to capitalise when the step discounting that is underway across most travel categories starts to gain traction and as the trading cycle rebounds,” Mr Turner said. “As we saw with both SARS and the global financial crisis in Australia, the rebound can be relatively fast and strong after a fairly significant downturn in international travel.” Management told the sharemarket that while early trends had been in line with expectations, the coronavirus’ spread and widening travel restrictions made it more difficult to predict the full-year impact. “Given this uncertainty, the company has elected to suspend its revised FY20 guidance,” Flight Centre said. The guidance on February 27 was full-year profit before tax of $240 million to $300 million, down from the previous range of $310 million to $350 million. On that day, Flight Centre announced an after-tax profit for first half of the financial year of $22.1 million – having collapsed from $85 million for the same period in 2019. In Friday’s ASX announcement, the company said its directors would also forgo 30 per cent of their fees for the remainder of the financial year. Trading hours will be cut at some branches, and staff will be encouraged to take leave. Recruitment will be suspended, and non-essential projects deferred. The company will also focus its marketing on destinations considered to be lower risk – such as South Pacific and domestic holidays. Flight Centre shares were down by 17 per cent in morning trade. They have lost 60 per cent of their value since February 20 amid a wider market sell-off. The travel industry is one of those hardest hit by the virus and travels bans. Many people have cancelled travel, prompting airlines and other businesses to cut the number of flights and services. On Friday, Virgin Australia joined rivals Qantas and Air New Zealand in reducing capacities for international and domestic flights more than once in quick succession. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Chelsea Manning to be immediately freed from prison","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/13\/chelsea-manning-release\/","transcript":"A US federal judge has ordered that former US Army soldier and WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning be immediately released from prison.

The airline on Friday suspended full-year earnings guidance as it flagged reductions in its Los Angeles, Japan, and trans-Tasman services, as well as announcing it would quit flying from Auckland to Tonga and the Cook Islands. Virgin said its total capacity cuts would increase from 3 per cent to 6 per cent in the second half of the 2020 financial year and rise to 7.7 per cent in the first half of 2021. It has also temporarily cut fees for its chairman and independent board directors by 15 per cent and frozen management bonuses. Virgin rivals Qantas and Air New Zealand have also reduced seats on international and domestic flights more than once in quick succession. Earlier this week, Qantas cut capacity for the second time in less than a month. It has now reduced its passenger capacity by nearly a quarter on a year ago, and grounded all but two of its Airbus A380s. Chief executive Alan Joyce – who will take no pay for the remainder of this financial year – said airlines were in a battle for the “survival of the fittest” as the coronavirus outbreak wound on. Air New Zealand has cut its overall passenger capacity by 10 per cent – and flights into Asia by 26 per cent. Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran has reduced his pay by 15 per cent. Virgin said it would also freeze external recruitment and the use of consultants for the remainder of this financial year – and seek government relief on charges. It had already announced last month it was slashing its Tigerair fleet and cutting back on flights to rein in costs as the coronavirus hit demand for leisure destinations and its budget airline’s routes. It tipped an earnings hit of between $50 million and $75 million in the second half but suspended this guidance on Friday. Virgin shares dipped back to Thursday’s all-time low of 5.0 cents within 25 minutes of trade on Friday. The one bright spot for Virgin is domestic tourism. Chief executive Paul Scurrah said travel bookings to Western Australia and local leisure destinations such as the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, and Hamilton Island were up on a year ago. “This demonstrates Australians are continuing to travel within our own backyard and support local tourism,” Mr Scurrah said. Passengers on flights affected by Virgin’s latest round of cuts will be contacted and offered alternative travel arrangements. That will include refunds for routes that have been axed. Passengers with international bookings up until June 30 will be able to change their flight to a later date or a different destination, without fees. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Labor wants parliament recalled, promises co-operation on legislation","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/australian-politics\/2020\/03\/13\/parliament-recalled-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has called for federal Parliament to be recalled next week to urgently deal with legislation to resolve the coronavirus crisis.

Mr Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg released details of multibillion-dollar the stimulus package on Thursday. Spending from the package is split between business  – which will get $6.19 billion between now and June 30 – and welfare and pension recipients, who will get another $4.5 billion over the same period. Vulnerable regions will also get $1 billion in two years, and the overall business spend will be $10.95 billion by 2021. Mr Albanese said the escalating COVID-19 pandemic would have an economic impact. “That’s why we have been positive about the government’s announcement … and we said we will be constructive,” he said. “Of course, we want to examine the legislation to see if improvements can be made, but we want to be constructive.” He said Labor would pay particular attention to measures that affected casual workers and low-income earners.

The two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not provide details on the targets being struck or name the groups being targeted. But the Pentagon earlier on Thursday directly blamed Iran-backed militia for Wednesday’s attack, which also wounded 14 people.

U.S war jets could be heard pic.twitter.com\/NyYlslAQIk — Zaid Sabah (@ZaidSabah) March 12, 2020  One of the officials said the US response would be proportional to that Wednesday rocket attack. The strikes marked a rapid escalation in tensions with Tehran and its proxy groups in Iraq, just two months after Iran carried out a massive ballistic missile attack against American troops at a base in Iraq. They came just hours after top US defence leaders threatened retaliation for the Wednesday rocket attack, making clear that they knew who did it and that the attackers would be held accountable. Two US troops and one British service member were killed and 14 other personnel were wounded when 18 rockets hit the base on Wednesday. The US military said the 107mm Katyusha rockets were fired from a truck launcher that was found by Iraqi security forces near the base after the attack. Defence Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon earlier on Thursday that President Donald Trump had given him the authority to take whatever action he deemed necessary. “We’re going to take this one step at a time, but we’ve got to hold the perpetrators accountable,” Mr Esper said. “You don’t get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” At the White House, Trump had also hinted that a US counterpunch could be coming, telling reporters, “We’ll see what the response is.” And Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters the US knows “with a high degree of certainty” who launched the attack. On Capitol Hill earlier in the day, Marine General Frank McKenzie, the top US commander for the Middle East, told senators the deaths of US and coalition troops created a “red line” for the US, but said he didn’t think Iran has “a good understanding of where our red line is.” Asked if any counterattack could include a strike inside Iran, Mr Esper said, “We are focused on the group that we believe perpetrated this in Iraq.” Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for a late December rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk that killed a US contractor, prompting American military strikes in response. They were followed January 3 by a US airstrike that killed Iran’s most powerful military officer, General Qassem Soleimani. In response to the Soleimani killing, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on January 8, at al-Asad air base in Iraq, that resulted in traumatic brain injuries to more than 100 American troops. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australian Grand Prix cancelled amid pandemic fears","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/13\/fans-australian-gp-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The Formula One Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled as fears grow about the spread of the lethal coronavirus at big crowd events in Australia.

In a statement, he added: “Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? “We’ll keep the world posted and updated.

And I say that, living within the sound of the revving practice engines at Albert Park. It prompted this tweet: ‘Look at the crisis in Italy with all sport banned. If coronavirus is so serious and Premier Andrews is talking about closing schools, why doesn’t he cancel the Grand Prix?’ The Premier has publicly warned that “extreme measures” will be needed but he seems reluctant to take them.

If coronavirus is so serious and Premier Andrews is talking about closing schools, why doesn’t he cancel the Grand Prix? — Derryn Hinch (@HumanHeadline) March 10, 2020 British team McLaren’s withdrawal from the Formula One season opener after a team member tested positive for coronavirus forced F1’s hierarchy into a crisis two-hour summit meeting. Numerous media reports are Friday morning stating that a decision has since been made to postpone the Grand Prix as a majority of the teams were unhappy to continue but there has been no official confirmation. Meanwhile, the federal Opposition is calling for bans on mass gatherings. Shadow cabinet minister Bill Shorten says Australian schools should close and mass events be cancelled. He called it a “public health emergency” that needs urgent, even “draconian”, action “not in weeks and months but in days”. I realise that more than 80,000 undeterred people jammed the MCG for the Women’s T20 World Cup cricket final on Sunday night and Prime Minister Scott Morrison sounded decidedly Trumpian when he said he’d be going to the football at the weekend and was looking forward to it. (That was around the time President Trump, in a broadcast to the world, made the dramatic announcement that he was banning flights into the US from Europe for a month, which sent airline and travel stocks down the drain. Then the public service stepped in to explain that wasn’t strictly true and published a ream of exemptions.) pic.twitter.com\/YioC9eARdP — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2020 But back to us and the Grand Prix. It does seem to me that a lot of Australians are not taking this genuine health emergency as seriously as we should – despite the dunny paper wars in supermarket aisles. There are now reported cases in more than 100 countries, and a growing international death rate, but there was a truly sophomoric feature in the Sydney Morning Herald by a yuppy, along the lines of ‘I’ve got coronavirus, so what? What’s the big deal?’ He’d obviously go down well in Italy, where they had 15 cases two weeks ago and now, not only is the figure around 50,000, the Italian government has ordered a shutdown of the whole country apart from supermarkets, food outlets and chemists. The Italian connection makes even more puzzling the Victorian government’s decision not to close the Grand Prix – or at least let it run with no spectators (as some overseas sporting events are now doing). And why were Italian Grand Prix teams allowed into Australia? I guess because there is no GP without Ferrari. No surprise to me that seven or eight pit crew members, under suspicion of contracting the virus, have been isolated. Whether the Grand Prix is cancelled or curtailed, that will then probably focus attention on the Melbourne Cup, which attracts 100,000 people at very close quarters. There is hope there, though. I have read that the coronavirus falters in the heat. So for Europe, the UK, the United States and Canada, the northern summer cannot come quickly enough for health reasons. By that reckoning, Melbourne will be warming up by Cup Day so the threat may be passing, or at least weakening. One thing can be guaranteed: Australia’s exposure is getting, and will continue to get, international headlines with the shock Thursday news from the Gold Coast that Tom Hanks (playing Colonel Tom Parker in a new Elvis Presley movie) and his wife, Rita Wilson, have both contracted the virus. pic.twitter.com\/pgybgIYJdG — Tom Hanks (@tomhanks) March 12, 2020 Hanks was at the Sydney Opera House on Saturday night to see Rita perform.

Over the last three years, the number of people who say they want to improve the world around them has increased. The bad news is that belief about generosity hasn’t always translated into action within their local community. A Red Cross survey of 1011 people found nearly three out of five Australians are willing to do more to help out. But there is still a gap between what people say they will do compared to what they actually do. While nine out of the 10 people surveyed believe we should be kinder to each other every day, fewer than two out of five Australians actually engage with the community. Even still, Australians still really care about those struggling in their local area, Red Cross chief executive Judy Slatyer said. That’s proven by the 69 per cent of Australians who say they care about making their communities a better place compared to 65 per cent three years ago. “We need to create more opportunities to be involved,” she said, pointing to the recent bushfire crisis as an opportunity to help and support those communities ravaged by the climate disaster. Women are more compassionate than men and are more likely to do a spontaneous act of kindness for someone in their community, the study found. Some 84 per cent of women have behaved kindly in the past year, including donating clothes or items to charity, compared with 62 per cent of men. Women were also more likely to spontaneously act in a kind way towards a friend, family member or colleague at 73 per cent, compared with 58 per cent of male respondents. The survey also found people over 40 years of age believed everyone should be more kind to others on a regular basis compared with those under 40. Yet those under the age of 40 are more likely to help vulnerable people in society compared with people over 40. Adelaide has the best intentions with 93 per cent of respondents saying the country would be a better place if people did one kind thing every day, while South Australia was also the top state for kind intentions too. Regional NSW topped the list at 78 per cent of people having donated clothes or goods in the past year. The MevCorp survey was conducted for Red Cross from a sample size of 1,011 Australians over the age of 18, in February this year. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"UK Prime Minister declares 'worst health crisis in a generation'","date":"03-13-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/13\/coronavirus-boris-johnson\/","transcript":"Boris Johnson has declared the coronavirus outbreak the “worst health crisis in a generation” but has stopped short of forcing drastic closures to contain the spread. The UK prime minister announced basic measures such as staying at home for seven days with a new cough or higher temperature, advising over-70s not to go on cruises and discouraging international school trips. He said the government was “considering” banning major events and sporting but schools would remain open. It comes as China urged nations to mobilise and take dramatic steps to fight the pandemic which its senior medical officer said could be over by June if it was tackled with extreme policies. The source of the world pandemic, the Chinese province of Hubei, recorded single digit new infections for the first time, with China claiming the country’s infection peak had passed. Chinese authorities credit strict measures they have taken, including placing Hubei under near total lockdown, with preventing big outbreaks in other cities, and say other countries should learn from their efforts. “Broadly speaking, the peak of the epidemic has passed for China,” National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said. “The increase of new cases is falling,” Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government’s senior medical adviser said, as long as countries take the outbreak seriously and are prepared to take firm measures, it could be over worldwide in a matter of months. “My advice is calling for all countries to follow WHO instructions and intervene on a national scale,” he said. “If all countries could get mobilised, it could be over by June.” Around the world, countries have announced increasing restrictions on mass gatherings as the WHO finally declared a pandemic amid concerns many nations were not taking the virus emergency seriously. There are reports the Australian Grand Prix could be cancelled after the withdrawal of the McLaren racing team after a member tested positive for the virus. Ireland will close all schools and cultural centres from Friday until March 29 after recording its first death and 43 infections while France will close all creches, schools and universities from next week. “Our advice is that all indoor gatherings of more than 100 people and all outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said. Rome’s 900 Catholic churches have been ordered closed because of the coronavirus pandemic in a move believed to be unprecedented in modern times. The cruise liner company Princess Cruises will halt its 16 ships for two months after recent disastrous outbreaks  – notably the Diamond Princess – which resulted in hundreds of infections and many deaths. However Europe reacted angrily to US president Donald Trump’s shock decision to ban all travel to 26 EU countries (excluding the UK and Ireland). In a joint statement by EU Council president Charles Michel and the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the two leaders insisted the coronavirus pandemic was a “global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires co-operation rather than unilateral action”. “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the US decision to improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” they said on Thursday. The coronavirus pandemic continues to take its toll on events and operations too with a Russian-European mission to send a rover to Mars postponed by two. The European Space Agency and Russia’s Roscosmos say they are postponing a planned joint mission to Mars until 2022, in part due to travel restrictions resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie are in self-isolation after she came down with flu-like symptoms and was tested for coronavirus, according to an official statement. The 48-year-old Liberal leader is exhibiting no symptoms and will continue to work from home until the results of his wife’s test comes in, the statement said. However, face-to-face meetings with provincial premiers scheduled for Thursday and Friday will instead be held by phone. “Having recently returned from a speaking engagement in London, UK, the Prime Minister’s wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau began exhibiting mild flu-like symptoms including a low fever late last night,” the statement from the prime minister’s office read. “She immediately sought medical advice, and is being tested for the COVID-19 virus. She is self-isolating at home awaiting test results, and her symptoms have since subsided.” The statement does not mention whether their three children are staying home as well. With the marked slowdown of the spread of the virus in China, more businesses have reopened, with authorities cautiously easing strict containment measures. Hubei province announced on Thursday a further loosening of travel restrictions and will also allow some industries to resume production in two of its cities and two counties. Hubei’s economy, driven by manufacturing and trade, including a sizeable auto sector in the provincial capital Wuhan, had been virtually shuttered since January 23. While the virus is spreading quickly globally, its progress in China has slowed markedly in the past seven days. In all, 15 new cases were recorded in mainland China on Wednesday, down from 24 the day before. Seven of the new cases were outside Hubei, including six imported from abroad. While only 85 of the cases in China have come from abroad, the rising number of such incidences has prompted authorities to shift their focus on containing the risk of imported cases. The total number of cases recorded in mainland China was 80,793. As of Tuesday, 62,793 people had recovered and been discharged from hospital, or nearly 80 pert cent of the infections. As of the end of Wednesday, the death toll in mainland China had reached 3,169, up by 11 from the previous day.

Citing a ‘duty of care’, McLaren said in a statement: “The team member was tested and self-isolated as soon as they started to show symptoms and will now be treated by local healthcare authorities”. “The team has prepared for this eventuality and has ongoing support in place for its employee, who will now enter a period of quarantine. “The decision has been taken based on a duty of care not only to McLaren F1 employees and partners, but also to the team’s competitors, Formula 1 fans and wider F1 stakeholders,” the statement from McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown and team principal Andreas Seidl read. In a statement released shortly before midnight on Thursday, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation chief executive Andrew Westacott said seven of the the eight GP personnel tested in recent days have returned a negative result. “AGPC and Formula 1 have been advised by the Victorian Chief Health Officer of the results of tests … [of] personnel from the Formula 1 paddock …   confirming that they do not have the COVID-19 virus,” Mr Westacott said. The individual who tested positive was from the McLaren Racing Team. A ninth individual – not associated with any Formula 1 team, the FIA or associated suppliers – has been assessed and tested, with results pending. Mr Westacott said the AGPC is in discussions with Formula 1, the FIA and the Department of Health and Human Services in relation to the broader implications of this test result and will provide updates as details become available.

The news comes hours after six-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton says it is “shocking” that the GP is being staged. The 35-year-old Hamilton didn’t hold back after it emerged on Thursday that eight F1 team staff had been quarantined and tested for the virus in Melbourne, sparking fresh uncertainty about staging the Albert Park event. “I am really very, very surprised that we are here,” the Mercedes driver said. “For me it is shocking that we are all sitting in this (press conference) room. “It seems like the rest of the world is reacting … you see the NBA has been suspended yet Formula One continues to go on – it’s definitely concerning for me.” Haas initially reported that four staff had been quarantined with McLaren saying one team member had been affected. Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos on Thursday warned that positive tests at Albert Park could stop Sunday’s race. “We have not reached the point in time where we need to take these extreme measures, but we will not hesitate to take those steps if we get that advice because we will prioritise public health,” Ms Mikakos said. The F1 calendar has already been affected by the novel coronavirus, with the Bahrain GP on March 22 (Round 2) banning fans and the Chinese GP (Round 4) being postponed. Ferrari’s four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who is also a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, said competitors may refuse to race if the number of coronavirus cases among F1 personnel became significant or someone died. “My stand would be I hope it doesn’t get that far. If it gets that far, you’d pull the handbrake (on racing),” Vettel said. Australia’s Renault F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo was more reserved. “I have to put my trust in the (motorsport governing body) FIA,” Ricciardo said. “(And) the racer in me is happy I am here.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bush mailboxes inspired by Aussie backyard items each have a story to tell","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/12\/bush-mailboxes\/","transcript":"Take a drive through regional or rural Australia and it won’t be long before you spot an unusual mailbox with a story to tell. They come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from unwanted household appliances to ambitious works of art. A two-metre-tall emu, a pig made from a gas bottle, a rusty microwave, even an old toilet – it seems like anything goes when it comes to collecting mail in the bush. Retired carpenter Ray Savage from Albany on Western Australia’s south coast says rural traditions may have something to do with it. “Most people use what’s lying around the backyard, because the motto for the old backyard Aussie is you never throw anything out because you never know when you’re going to need it.” That’s exactly the approach Mr Savage took when building his mailbox – an emu-like sculpture that he calls Silver Bird. “It’s just a cut-down beer keg, which I got from a salvage yard, and it’s pretty well all stainless steel so it won’t rust,” he said. “The neck part came off a wrecked fishing boat out at Israelite Bay. “I just happened to have my angle grinder with me, so I cut a bit of the railing off. “The legs are star posts, so it should be around for a fair while. The reflectors came off an old push bike, so it’s a handy landmark at night.” Australia Post recommends mailboxes should be large enough for an A4 envelope to lie flat inside. It should be 230mm wide, 330mm deep and 160mm high and should be free of sharp or jagged edges. In addition, mailboxes should be between 900mm and 1200mm off the ground and should be positioned on the property boundary or on a fence next to a driveway, with the number clearly displayed. Wendy Allan, an Australia Post contractor of 14 years who delivers to the outlying areas of Albany, says creative mailboxes are OK. “As long as it’s easy to reach and it caters to the amount of mail that you get,” she said. “A big opening on the back is good. It depends on what area they’re in too; they may want to put a lock on that. “And it depends on how many small articles they get. If they get a lot, then they can leave the back open and we can put the mail in.” Ms Allan says she delivers mail to several home-made mailboxes on her run and enjoys their quirky nature. “It’s something different to see on your run and it shows people’s creativity,” she said. Nearby Elleker resident Keith Richardson was inspired to make his mailbox after his neighbours made theirs, including a model pistol and a toilet. He is now the proud owner of a mailbox made from a beer keg that he acquired from a replica 19th century sailing ship. “I asked them if I could buy a couple of kegs to make a mailbox and they said ‘You can have them’,” Mr Richardson said. “The stand it’s made on is actually from a drilling rod from a gold mine and I just asked them if I could have the one that was a bit wrecked and they said, ‘Yeah, you can have it’,” he said. Mr Richardson said if he ever won the lottery he’d have a new Kenworth prime mover as his mailbox. “Because I drive trucks and stuff like that and I like my Kenworths,” he said. “But I actually drive a Volvo.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus symptoms myths busted – and the truth about toilet paper","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/12\/coronavirus-facts-checked\/","transcript":"You’ve probably heard people saying coronavirus is just like the flu, and that you’re less likely to get it. Or that face masks don’t work. Perhaps some savvy panic-shopper told you two-ply is better in a pandemic. Two things are certain: The coronavirus will continue to spread, and along with it will come waves of misinformation. Welcome to 2020. Before you start building a bunker, let’s bust five common corona-confusion points and put an end to some misinformation. In short, get out, if you can. If you can’t, take precautions. Straight from the Australian Health Department: “Only household members who are essential for caring for you should stay in the home. “Other people living in the home should consider staying elsewhere if possible.” If that’s not feasible, you should stay in a different room or separate as much as possible, it said. “You should use a separate bathroom, if available. Avoid shared or communal areas, and wear a surgical mask when moving through these areas. “Surfaces in shared areas such as door handles, taps and benches should be cleaned daily with household disinfectant or a diluted bleach solution.” Aside from just being a bit rude – this isn’t entirely correct. Let’s be very clear – most people who are young, fit and healthy, with no underlying medical conditions will not become severely ill from COVID-19. But just because you are in that demographic, doesn’t mean you should be flippant about your hygiene – or your health. The young, fit and healthy are a crucial demographic for fighting the coronavirus because even they can be carriers and pass it on to the more vulnerable. If you need to self-isolate, do it properly, and as always, wash your hands. You’re keeping yourself safe – and helping to keep other people alive. If you had shares in toilet paper, you would have welcomed this panic-buying like a pig in mud. But we need to stop stripping the shelves bare. Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles last week made it clear, if you’re stuck at home and in a messy bind – the Red Cross will help you out. “If you are under our instruction, self-isolating for that period of 14 days, then you will have support,” Mr Miles said. “If you run out of toilet paper, the Red Cross will be able to assist you to get toilet paper. There’s no need to be stockpiling toilet paper.” Honestly, a mask just won’t cut it. Viruses, including COVID-19, can transmit through eyelids and have tiny particles that get through masks. There are some situations where they’re helpful. If you’re going to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask can reduce your chances of catching the virus, but it won’t offer 100 per cent protection. In many ways, the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to seasonal flu. But there are a few clear differences. The Australian Academy of Science put together this explainer to clear all this up. Watch it below."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Hackers are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to scam online shoppers","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/12\/coronavirus-scams\/","transcript":"Just as heartless money-grabbers set up fake bushfire scams over summer, so too have hackers eager to exploit our fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. And this time we’re even more susceptible to being tricked. That’s because we’re spending more time on the internet ticking off the day-to-day jobs that we would normally do in public to avoid bumping into sick people. Online grocery sales in Australia have shot up by more than 45 per cent since the coronavirus reached our shores, research from ACNielsen Homescan shows. Scammers are taking advantage of shoppers by falsely selling coronavirus products or setting up fake fundraising initiatives. Advertisements selling so-called miracle cures and emails with subject lines like “COVID-19 Everything you need to know” and “Coronavirus Update” are popping up in inboxes around the nation. Don’t click on them. They have probably been sent by attackers looking for a breach in your computer or smartphone’s cyber defences. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commision’s (ACCC) Scamwatch website has received 31 coronavirus-related reports since January 1. Keep an eye out for dodgy websites too – more than 4000 coronavirus-related domains that contain the words ‘corona’ or ‘covid’ have been registered since the beginning of 2020, reports Cybersecurity firm Check Point. Roland Bleyer, founder of credit card comparison site creditcard.com.au, said there has been a “rise in scam websites marketing essential products and expensive miracle virus remedies” related to the coronavirus. “Everyone needs to be on high alert,” Mr Bleyer said. “While I am not an expert in the coronavirus, what I do know is that there is currently no known cure, so avoid clicking on any advertisements that offer miracle solutions. “Some of these scams are also undertaking phishing expeditions, trying to get you to give them your personal information as well as credit card details.” No legitimate business will ever send you an email asking you to verify your details through an online link. If you receive an email asking you for your credit card details, delete and block immediately. Cyber security expert Andrew Woodward, executive dean of science at Edith Cowan University, said our fear of the coronavirus was making us especially vulnerable to scams, including fraudulent health advice. “It’s not just the financial aspect – it’s the spread of misinformation,”  Professor Woodward told The New Daily. “These cyber criminals potentially have a greater target population over the bushfires because the coronavirus affects everybody so more people are concerned and scared.” In the United States, a guest who appeared on televangelist Jim Bakker’s show claimed drinking colloidal silver – tiny particles of the precious metal suspended in liquid – could kill some strains of coronavirus within 12 hours. The potential ‘cure’ has been widely shared on Facebook, particularly by members of “medical freedom” groups who are deeply suspicious of mainstream medical advice.  “Some of these cyber criminals are trying to sell products that they claim will help people, when evidence suggests that it’s just not true,” Professor Woodward said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"High Court reserves its decision on Cardinal George Pell","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/12\/high-court-reserves-decision-cardinal-george-pell\/","transcript":"• Cardinal George Pell was released from prison on March 7, 2020 after the High Court quashed his five convictions for child sexual abuse. The High Court of Australia has reserved its decision on whether it will overturn the convictions of Cardinal George Pell for child abuse.

Pell, now 78, was convicted in 2018 of the rape of one 13-year-old choirboy and sexual assault of another. The first boy gave evidence against Pell and the second died in 2014. Pell maintained his innocence through two trials – the first ending in a hung jury – and last year’s Victorian Court of Appeal hearing, which upheld the verdict in a 2-1 ruling.

Former Labor leader Bill Shorten said Australia should move to social distancing “not in weeks and months but in days”. “The only way to make sure this pandemic is not worse than it otherwise could be is to have more drastic social-distancing measures,” he told Sky News on Thursday. “Singapore and Japan and parts of China, they are putting in more draconian reactions. As a result it would appear that some of their pandemic numbers are not going to be as bad as other countries who are doing too little too late.” Mr Shorten’s call came as NSW’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said up to 1.6 million people in the state could be hit by the first wave of a statewide coronavirus outbreak – with up to 80,000 people likely to require intensive care simultaneously. Dr Chant told a NSW budget estimates hearing on Thursday that preparations are under way for 20 per cent of NSW’s eight million residents to catch COVID-19. Late on Thursday afternoon, Prime Minister Scott Morrison was considering extending Australia’s travel ban to those from Europe. The US suspended all travel from the continent on Thursday (exempting Britain). Health Minister Greg Hunt said Mr Morrison had asked cabinet’s national security committee to review all travel from Europe. Mr Hunt said there were 128 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, which already has travel bans in place for China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. Also on Thursday, two more crew members from Formula One Grand Prix teams were quarantined and tested for the deadly COVID-19. The Haas team now has four staff and the McLaren team one crew member in Melbourne awaiting test results. Practice sessions for the event – which can draw as many as 300,000 people over its four days – start on Friday. Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton warned that positive tests at Albert Park could stop the grand prix. “We need to consider what it means for their close contacts and if they have a number of close contacts across a number of crews, then those individuals need to be quarantined,” Dr Sutton told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Thursday. “If that effectively shuts down the race, then so be it. We’ll make that call.” Meanwhile, a man confirmed as a positive case was in the crowd of 86,000 at cricket’s T20 World Cup Final at the MCG on Sunday night. Another confirmed case is in a person who reportedly attended the Golden Plains music festival in central Victoria at the weekend. Some 12,000 tickets were sold for the festival. Other Australian events that will draw big crowds in coming days include the NRL season-opener between the Parramatta and Canterbury at Sydney’s Bankwest Stadium on Thursday, and the AFL’s first round of 2020 between the Western Bulldogs and Collingwood at the MCG on Friday. NRL players have been told to avoid shaking hands with fans in a bid to control the coronavirus outbreak. The NRL has also urged players to avoid taking selfies with fans after matches and not taking pens to sign autographs. Caulfield Racecourse is also expecting huge numbers to attend its feature All-Star Mile race on Saturday. In the US, the NBA said on Thursday it would suspend its 2020 season  after Utah Jetz centre Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. New York City has also postponed its St Patrick’s Day Parade for the first time in its 258-year history. Back in Australia, Victoria confirmed several new cases of the lethal virus on Thursday, including a student at La Trobe University’s suburban Bundoora campus. In NSW, the number of cases has reached 77. The origins of four of them are unclear. Authorities are investigating a virus cluster in Sydney’s north-west centred on Ryde Hospital and the Dorothy Henderson Lodge nursing home, where two elderly patients died last week. The ACT also has its first confirmed case. A man in his 30s was tested at a walk-in clinic on Wednesday, with the positive result confirmed on Thursday. He’s being treated at Canberra Hospital. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said more cases were expected in coming weeks. “This, however, is not cause for alarm,” he said. “We’re asking Canberrans to work with us to minimise the spread of the virus.” In Western Australia, which has nine confirmed coronavirus patients, health authorities said they would roll out a text message service for those who tested negative. Health Minister Roger Cook said the alerts would help “get the information out to people more quickly so that they can get back to work … or back to their lives” and help preserve Health Department resources. More than 2000 people have been tested for COVID-19 in WA. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Who qualifies for the PM's coronavirus cash handout?","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/12\/who-qualifies-coronavirus-handout\/","transcript":"It’s the question everyone is asking: Do I get Scott Morrison’s $750 coronavirus cash handout, and when will I get it? To find out if you qualify for a slice of Scott Morrison’s $22.9 billion stimulus pie, read on. About one in every four Australians will secure a $750 cash handout in their bank accounts. It will cost the budget $4.8 billion, swallowing up the entire forecast surplus. There’s no need to apply for the cash. It will be delivered using existing welfare systems to those eligible – which is expected to be over six million Australians. The one-off payment will be delivered into bank accounts from March 31, 2020, by Services Australia or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. It’s expected 90 per cent of payments will be made by mid-April 2020. To qualify for the cash, you need to already be receiving some form of welfare or pension, whether that’s the aged pension, Newstart, Austudy, disability support pension, carer’s allowance or family payments. By targeting the cash handouts at Australia’s aged pensioners and low-income families, the government hopes recipients will spend it to boost the economy and help avoid a recession. For parents, the good news is that those who receive family tax benefits will secure $750. Family tax benefits are a means-tested payment. The income test is determined by the number of children you have and whether they are teenagers or primary school students. For example, the income test for Family Tax Benefit A is up to $130,000 if you have three teenagers. LINK – Family Tax Benefit A Family tax benefit B is for single parents. You won’t be eligible for FTB Part B if your annual adjusted taxable income is more than $100,000. LINK – Family Tax Benefit B About half of the recipients of the $750 cash handout will be pensioners. For couples securing the age pension, both will get $750 – so their household will receive $1500. Again, there is no need to apply for the cash, it will be deposited automatically in bank accounts. If you qualify for a Commonwealth seniors health card, you will also get $750. It will also be awarded to anyone on the Veteran Service Pension; Veteran Income Support Supplement; Veteran Compensation payments, War Widow(er) Pension; and Veteran Gold Card holders. According to the Treasury website, “if a person qualifies for the one-off payment in multiple ways, they will only receive one payment.” For example, if you receive both Newstart and Family Tax Benefit, you are eligible for a single payment of $750. However, if you live in a household where, for example, a father is on a disability support pension and a mother gets family tax benefits you should qualify for $1500. The payment will be exempt from taxation and will not count as income for Social Security, Farm Household Allowance and Veteran payments. To be eligible, you must live in Australia. The Morrison government has flagged some flexibility for Newstart recipients who cannot meet mutual obligation requirements due to isolation. To be granted an exemption, you need to call Services Australia and can be granted a Major Personal Crisis exemption for 14 days, without having to provide evidence such as a medical certificate. Anything beyond that will require a medical certificate. One big change that might take some people by surprise is that the sickness allowance will close to new entrants and be replaced by the JobSeeker Payment. According to Treasury, this does not mean that people who previously may have been eligible for Sickness Allowance will be unable to access income support. At present, people who are aged 22 or over and under the age pension qualification age, who are unable to attend work because they have been diagnosed with the coronavirus or who are in isolation, might qualify for sickness allowance if they do not have any employer leave entitlements, such as sick leave. According to Treasury, young people under the age of 22 who are unable to attend work because they have been diagnosed with the coronavirus or who are in isolation might qualify for the youth allowance if they do not have any employer leave entitlements, such as sick leave, and they meet general eligibility requirements in respect of residency and income and assets tests. Students receiving the youth allowance who are in Australia but unable to attend studies due to the coronavirus will be taken to have a reasonable excuse for not meeting study activity requirements for their payments. But you need to contact Services Australia to advise of the circumstances. For more information on the Australian Government’s Economic Response to Coronavirus visit treasury.gov.au\/coronavirus. To be eligible, you must live in Australia and be receiving one of the following payments or hold one of the following concession cards March 12, 2020:"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Battered and bruised' ASX sinks further on Trump ban","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/coronavirus\/2020\/03\/12\/australian-shares-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The “battered and bruised” Australian sharemarket has plunged nearly 8 per cent after US President Donald Trump banned travellers from Europe because of the spread of the coronavirus. More than $100 billion was wiped from the value of shares on Thursday, before the market finished 7.4 per cent down for the day. Earlier, it hit its lowest point since November 2016 after stimulus announcements in Australia and the US failed to reassure investors. Thursday’s fall eclipsed Monday’s plunge, and was the ASX’s worst day since at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. More than $550 billion has been lost from the market as it has dropped from nearly 7200 to about 5300 in the past three weeks. First, the Coalition’s much-trumpeted $22 billion stimulus plan, announced on Thursday morning, failed to buoy the market. Later, Mr Trump’s announcement of a European travel ban dragged local shares down more than 5 per cent. By late Thursday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison was considering Australia extending its own travel bans to people from Europe. Asian stock markets also endured heavy falls, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan down more than 4 per cent. The local currency has lost one-third of a per cent to 64.62 US cents. There was more panic selling on the sharemarket in early trade as US stocks entered a bear market for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis. The falls came after the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Despite the bruising few days, one fund manager says Australian shares could recover in a year – if the global pandemic is quickly contained. “Once we’re over that, I think you’ll actually move there pretty quickly because you’ve got tailwinds on monetary and fiscal stimulus, you’re got very low interest rates,” said Paul Taylor, who manages the $5 billion Fidelity Australian Equities Fund. “People will then focus away from the coronavirus risk to the low cost of capital and I think people would move very very quickly. “The other thing we’re seeing is – the world is awash with money,” Mr Taylor said in Sydney on Thursday. With interest rates so low, there’s really no alternative to equities to finding yield and Australian equities are offering attractive yields of 4-5 per cent, fully franked, he said, It took the ASX a dozen years to recover from the global financial crisis, but the quality of company balance sheets was much healthier this time around, Mr Taylor said. Fidelity has analysts in many countries watching the spread of the outbreak. Mr Taylor was hopeful other countries could follow China’s lead and contain the virus in three to four weeks, although he acknowledged there were many unknowns. “It’s a reasonable assumption but it’s certainly not a certainty,” he said. Mr Taylor thought the Australian dollar was also set to rebound once the coronavirus was beaten. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Person diagnosed with coronavirus after attending Golden Plains festival","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/12\/golden-plains-coronavirus\/","transcript":"The ABC understands a person who attended the Golden Plains music festival south-west of Melbourne on the weekend has tested positive for COVID-19.

Four Queensland Government employees, aged 49, 57, 63, 62, along with their 39 year-old pilot, died when the twin-engine Cessna 404 Titan crashed into sand dunes at Lockhart River, about 800 kilometres north of Cairns, on Wednesday morning. The men, all from Cairns, worked for Q-Build and had been flown into the area to carry out repair work on the local school. But a tropical low in the Coral Sea has been buffeting the area with strong winds and heavy rain. Police have confirmed the plane made two attempts to land before crashing on Quintell Beach, about four kilometres from the Lockhart River township. David Glasheen, who lives on Restoration Island, about 20 kilometres north of Lockhart River, said he heard but did not see the plane as it flew overhead. He said weather conditions were volatile at the time. “I’m just amazed that they didn’t try another airport because I’ve been on planes where they can’t land and they go back to Coen or Weipa or even go back to Cairns,” Mr Glasheen said. “The wet season is very tricky because things change so quickly. “It’s very tragic, they were here to do repairs to the school.” Extra police have been sent to the area, along with officers from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. “ATSB transport safety investigators with experience in aircraft operations, aircraft maintenance and aeronautical engineering are preparing to deploy to the accident site,” a bureau statement confirmed. “On site, investigators will examine the wreckage and site surrounds, including with the use of a 3D mapping drone. “The ATSB will also analyse available recorded data and review weather information.” Staff from the Department of Education in Far North Queensland have been told to cancel all travel to rural and remote areas because of “extreme weather conditions”. On Wednesday night, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk tweeted: “A tragic loss of life on Cape York today.

Mr Trump described the sweeping measures as “strong but necessary” to curb the COVID-19 outbreak. He made the announcement in an Oval Office address to Americans, in which he blamed the European Union for not acting quickly enough to address the novel coronavirus and saying US clusters were “seeded” by European travellers. Mr Trump said the ban won’t apply to Britain, the US would monitor the situation to determine if travel could be reopened earlier. He said “we are marshalling the full power” of the government and private sector to protect the American people. Mr Trump’s speech came as as Washington raced to confront a viral pandemic that is roiling global financial markets and disrupting the daily lives of Americans. Communities across the US have cancelled public events, universities have halted in-person classes, and families are grappling with disruptions to public schools. Mr Trump said he would also direct agencies to provide unspecified financial relief “for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus,” and asked Congress to take action to extend it. He said the US would defer tax payments for some individual and businesses for three months to lessen the impacts of the virus outbreak. He said the Small Business Administration would make low-interest loans available to businesses to help them weather the storm. “This is not a financial crisis,” he said. “This just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.” Mr Trump reiterated his call on Congress to pass a cut to the federal payroll tax in order to stimulate the economy. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US has topped 1000 in the US, as the World Health Organisation finally declared the global crisis a pandemic. As US government officials warned the outbreak would only get worse, the Capitol was set to halt public tours as the shifting developments raised questions, urgency and a new level of unease. “I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,” Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He said the coronavirus was “10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu”. Elsewhere, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled an economic assistance plan that was gaining bipartisan backing. Central to the package is free coronavirus testing and emergency funding to reimburse lost wages for those who self-quarantine, miss work or lose jobs in the outbreak. The package would also give states money for the newly jobless. It would provide additional funding for food and nutrition benefits for pregnant women, mothers and young children. It also would up money for “meals on wheels” and food for low-income elderly people. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Chelsea Manning tries to take her own life","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/people\/2020\/03\/12\/chelsea-manning-suicide-attempt\/","transcript":"A lawyer for Chelsea Manning says the former intelligence analyst has tried to take her own life but was taken to hospital, where she is recovering.

She was scheduled to appear in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday for a hearing on a motion to terminate the civil contempt sanctions stemming from that refusal. In the motion filed last month, Manning’s lawyers argued that Manning has shown during her incarceration that she can’t be coerced into testifying before a grand jury. Manning served seven years in a military prison for leaking a trove of documents to WikiLeaks before President Barack Obama commuted the remainder of her 35-year sentence in 2017. Alexandria Sheriff Dana Lawhorne said on Wednesday: “There was an incident at approximately 12.11pm today at the Alexandria Adult Detention Centre involving inmate Chelsea Manning.

Woolworths has prohibited panic buyers from getting their money back on items stockpiled during the coronavirus outbreak. That means returns won’t be accepted on everything from baby wipes and serviettes to canned food and bread mixes. The supermarket usually allows refunds when there has been a change of mind and the product is “unopened, in its original packaging, within reasonable best before dates and with clear proof of purchase”. But since Wednesday, Woolworths has been rejecting returns after it announced the change in policy, which will continue until “further notice”. It issued a list of products that it won’t be accepting returns on. They include “toilet paper, paper towel, tissues and serviettes, medicinal (pain relief), cleaning (anti-bacterial wipes, sprays and cleaners, disposable gloves), feminine hygiene and incontinence, baby wipes. “Pasta and pasta sauce, canned food (fish, vegetables, soup, fruit and canned meals), flour and bread mixes, cooking oils, rice.” Woolworths said it believed this was a “necessary measure to meet the demand of as many shoppers as possible” and thanked customers for understanding. Meanwhile, Coles reportedly used a full-page advertisement in The Australian to announce a strict toilet paper limit and urge customers to only buy as much as they need. “The sudden and unprecedented demand for toilet paper has created a problem,” the ad explained. “But the problem isn’t a shortage of toilet paper,” it continued. “The problem is that some people are buying a lot more toilet paper than they normally do and more than they need to. “At Coles, we have a responsibility to ensure every Australian can access their fair share of the things they need every day.

As his Liverpool team ran out for his side’s Champions League round of 16 second leg match against Atletico Madrid, Reds fans leaned out over the tunnel, stretching their arms out to greet the German manager. However an angry Klopp could be seen waving off the fans, telling them to “put your hands away you f–king idiots’.” The Premier League and other leagues have banned pre-match handshakes between players to avoid the spread of the virus. Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation, and Juventus defender Daniele Rugani has tested positive to COVID-19. Klopp was praised last week when he advised a reporter who asked him for his take on coronavirus to go away and ask an expert instead. “What I don’t like in life is that a very serious thing [means] a football manager’s opinion is important – I don’t understand that,” Klopp said. “I really don’t understand it. If I asked you [the journalist], you are in exactly the same role as I am. “It’s not important what famous people say. No, we have to speak about things in the right manner, not people with no knowledge like me, talking about something. “People with knowledge will talk about it, and tell people to do this, do that and everything will be fine — or not. “Not football managers, I don’t understand that — politics, coronavirus, why me?

As the COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, continues to spread in the UK, royal protocols have changed as far as interaction in public goes. The Prince of Wales attended an awards event at the London Palladium on Wednesday, where he had to be reminded of a new policy of not shaking hands.

The rest of the royal family adhered to the same “no-handshake” protocol at Monday’s Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey. No one in the royal family shook hands with any of the attendees or those presiding over the service. Prince Harry was later spotted giving singer Craig David a forearm bump instead of a handshake.

William was spotted speaking to Kate Middleton as they sat in front of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. He reportedly told the Duchess “this whole handshaking thing is weird. We can’t shake hands and we have to hold back. “We will have to put loads of hand gel on afterwards.

The stunning multibillion-dollar economic stimulus package announced on Thursday is twice the size the Morrison government hinted at just days ago, with the majority of the cash assistance to small businesses, seniors and families to be delivered within weeks. It will wipe out the forecast “back in black” $5 billion surplus, a decision the Prime Minister predicted Australians would understand. “This is very front-end-loaded. We’ve done that on purpose,” he said. “The cash payments have two purposes. And they’re both important. “Of course, those who receive them – that is obviously a benefit to them. But more importantly, frankly, it is about a cash injection into the Australian economy, which supports small businesses and supports medium businesses. “This plan is about keeping a business in business, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, and this plan is about ensuring the Australian economy bounces back stronger on the other side of this and, with that, the budget bounces back with it.” The new measures to attempt to recession-proof the Australian economy also include a wage subsidy for apprentices and tax breaks for small businesses. Small businesses will also secure more generous instant asset write-off changes, which will apply from Thursday until July 1, to encourage immediate investment. Eligible employers with a turnover of less than $50 million will also secure up to $25,000 in tax-free payments to help cashflow – at a cost to the budget of $6.7 billion over the forward estimates. Any small business that withholds tax from the Australian Taxation Office on employees’ salary and wages will receive a payment equal to 50 per cent of the amount withheld, up to a maximum of $25,000. Warning there are predictions the coronavirus will wipe 0.5 percentage points from Australia’s GDP in the March quarter, the Prime Minister will argue action is needed but insist the nation is “well placed” to manage the economic shock from the coronavirus. “We’ve balanced the budget and managed our economy, so we can now use this to protect the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of Australians,” Mr Morrison said. “Our targeted stimulus package will focus on keeping Australians in jobs and keeping businesses in business so we can bounce back strongly.” The measures will include wage subsidies of $7000 a quarter for each apprentice to retain existing trainees or to re-employ those who lose their jobs because of any coronavirus downturn. Employers will secure a wage subsidy of 50 per cent of the apprentice’s or trainee’s wage from January 1-September 30, 2020. Eligible businesses will be those with 20 full-time employees or fewer. Larger employees can also benefit if they re-engage an eligible out-of-trade apprentice or trainee. The apprentice or trainee must have already been in training with a small business on March 1. Employers can register for the $1.3 billion subsidy plan from April 2. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the measures would be temporary and would not repeat the “mistakes” of the Rudd government during the global financial crisis. “In our response, we have been very careful not to repeat the mistakes of previous stimulus programs and not undermine the structural integrity of the budget,” Mr Frydenberg said. “By acting decisively, this package will put Australia in the strongest possible position to deal with the economic challenges we face and to make sure our economy bounces back even stronger.” The Prime Minister and Treasurer have previously flagged they are reconsidering the deeming rate, which determines access to the pension and part-pension, in light of record-low interest rates. Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said about 900,000 Australians will also see an increase to their fortnightly social security payments under a separate measure to reduce deeming rates. “The government is absolutely committed to ensuring the deeming rate is fair and is a reasonable reflection of the state of the market,” Senator Ruston said. “The lower deeming rate will be cut from 1.0 per cent to 0.5 per cent for financial investments up to $51,800 for single pensioners and $86,200 for pensioner couples. “The upper rate, which only impacts about 40 per cent of payment recipients with deemed assets, will decrease from 3.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Caltex warns of expanding virus hit to jet fuel shortage","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/12\/caltex-jet-fuel-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Caltex Australia says a coronavirus-driven spate of flight cancellations could hurt jet fuel demand even more than it already has.

At its full-year results last month, Caltex had flagged jet fuel demand was down by 5 to 10 per cent as the coronavirus epidemic tightened its grip on the local aviation industry. On Thursday, the company said this could blow out further following further service reductions by the likes of Qantas and Air NZ. The company also said it was unable to see any clear impacts on demand in the petrol and diesel markets related to COVID-19 due to different influences on demand – including lower prices, lower volumes, weak economy and natural disasters. “Convenience retail has benefited from stronger industry margin conditions, which has offset the earnings impact from lower volumes arising from the combination of bushfires, floods and weaker economic activity,” Caltex said.

Brewers Association of Australia chief Brett Heffernan said it was an injustice that the nation paid much more than most countries. “At $1.52, the Poms reckon their beer tax is unfair on punters, that it kills jobs and they can bear no more hikes,” he said. “We’d take $1.52 any day.” Mr Heffernan said Australia’s beer tax – at $2.26 a litre – was the fourth highest in the industrialised world. He said that was “grossly over the top” and should be reduced to bring it into line with comparable countries. “Cutting beer tax rates now will give Aussies the fair go and relief they deserve, while providing timely and much-needed stimulus to small, medium and large businesses, especially in hard-hit hospitality and tourism,” he said.

Police believe the man stabbed a Protective Services Officer at a train station near the MCG late on Wednesday, caught a train to the neighbouring suburb of Hawthorn where he killed one woman and left another with life-threatening injuries, then stabbed another man in Kew who later died from his wounds. Officers then shot the suspected killer dead while attempting to arrest him on a nearby street. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said the suspected killer, a 34-year-old Roxburgh Park man, had visited police stations twice in 2018 because he believed “ISIS operatives from Mildura have been out to kill him”. Commissioner Ashton said the police had flagged his mental health in the internal crimes database LEAP (Law Enforcement Assistance Program). An investigation into the deadly attacks has so far not found any links to terrorism. Investigators said there was nothing to suggest the victims were known to the man. “There’s nothing to indicate at this early stage that this is anything other than a random act of senseless violence,” Assistant Commissioner Glenn Weir said on Thursday. Police raided the man’s Roxburgh Park home as they searched for a motive for the deadly attacks. Commissioner Ashton said the man was not taken in for assessment after either of two conversations with police in 2018 about his fears about “ISIS operatives” and was not under active surveillance. He said the man had no criminal history, no warrants out against him and no parole history. He had an intervention order out against him by his estranged partner and child, but Commissioner Ashton said he had not breached the order in the years it had been in place. “To go from so little background to the offending he had last night, that’s unusual,” he said. He said investigators were “eagerly awaiting toxicology results”. Police said the first attack happened at Jolimont Station, near the MCG, about 10.40pm on Wednesday. Commissioner Ashton said the man was speaking to two PSOs when he pulled out a large knife “without any warning” and slashed one officer across the cheek and arm. He then fled the scene on foot. PSOs are uniformed members of protective services who monitor trains, stations and surrounding areas. The officer will undergo plastic surgery on his cheek and is recovering in hospital. Police said it was believed the man fled past the MCG to nearby Richmond Station, where he then caught a train to Glenferrie Station in Hawthorn. He travelled to Coppin Grove, where two women were returning home in their car after a night out about 11.20pm. He attacked the women after what police said was a short conversation. A 30-year-old woman died at the scene. Her 31-year-old companion was taken to The Alfred hospital, where she is fighting for life in a critical condition. “It’s just a random, dreadfully wrong place at the wrong time,” Commissioner Ashton said. It is believed neighbours called emergency services after hearing screaming, but there were no witnesses to the attack. Police said the man then travelled to the neighbouring suburb of Kew, when he stabbed another victim who was out for a walk. The 59-year-old man called triple-zero and the Police Communications Centre as he lay bleeding. “He’s made that call because obviously he’s worrying about the community more than himself,” Commissioner Ashton said. “He’s worrying about what else this guy’s going to do and who else he’s going to harm. So I think it’s a tremendously brave act,” he said. Police found him with critical injuries near Cotham Road and Queen Street about 12.15am on Thursday. Officers gave the man CPR and called an ambulance, but the 59-year-old died shortly afterwards in hospital. A large police operation, including Critical Incident Response Team officers, found the suspected killer a short time later on Walton Street in Kew. He came at CIRT members with a knife with “in their view, lethal intent”, Commissioner Ashton said. After trying to subdue the man using tasers and non-lethal bean bag rounds, police shot the offender. He died from his gunshot wounds at the scene. “I heard somebody shouting out ‘drop the knife, drop the knife, drop the knife it’s on your head’ and then bang, bang, bang,” Kew resident Peter Walker said. “After the bangs, silence. Absolute silence. No more running, no more calling out, no more gunshots. “The police gave plenty of warning, they did a very good job.” Commissioner Ashton said he was found with two large kitchen knives and a smaller portable knife. Police Minister Lisa Neville praised the officers for their “quick actions”. Crime Command, the Homicide Squad and Armed Crime are leading the investigation. The investigation will be overseen by Professional Standards Command, which is the protocol any time police fire a gun, and the coroner. Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Iraq rocket attacks kills US, UK personnel at military camp","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/12\/iraq-rocket-attacks-kills-us-uk-personnel\/","transcript":"Two American personnel and one from Britain have been killed and about a dozen wounded when 15 small rockets hit Iraq’s Taji military camp north of Baghdad, two US officials say, citing preliminary information.

Mr Sanders acknowledged he was falling behind Mr Biden in the count of delegates needed to win the nomination, but said he was committed to the overarching goal of defeating Republican Donald Trump in November’s general election. “On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal,” he told reporters on Wednesday, referring to a scheduled debate with Mr Biden. Mr Biden on Tuesday notched decisive primary victories in Michigan and three other states, taking a big step toward the party’s nomination to take on Mr Trump in November and casting doubt on the future of Mr Sanders’ fading White House bid. Mr Sanders – who won in North Dakota but had hoped for an upset victory in the key state of Michigan to boost his flagging chances – was forced to cancel an election night rally in Cleveland, Ohio, due to concerns over the coronavirus. The losses on Tuesday, coming after a series of sweeping Biden wins in last week’s Super Tuesday contests in 14 states, put Mr Sanders in a deeper hole in the delegate count. But Mr Sanders said his anti-corporate economic agenda was winning the ideological battle and gaining support from young people who are the country’s future. He said many Democratic voters still believe Mr Biden has the best chance of beating Mr Trump. “While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,” he said. Mr Biden has already begun to look ahead to the November election, calling for party unity and making an appeal to supporters of Mr Sanders. “We share a common goal, and together we are going to defeat Donald Trump,” Mr Biden said in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, thanking Mr Sanders and his supporters for their energy and passion. Just two weeks ago, Mr Sanders was seen as the frontrunner after an impressive win in Nevada in mid-February, while Mr Biden and the other moderate candidates continued to split the vote of the party’s centrists. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/12\/harvey-weinstein-sentenced-prison\/","transcript":"Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for raping a woman and sexually assaulting another. The wheelchair-bound 67-year-old appeared unrepentant as the sentence was handed down in a Manhattan criminal court by Justice James Burke on Thursday morning (Australian time). It comes less than a month after Weinstein was found guilty of committing a first-degree criminal sexual act against production assistant Miriam Haley and of the third-degree rape of former aspiring actress Jessica Mann. Before sentencing, the former movie producer pleaded with the court for a light prison sentence, saying he was going through “hell on earth” and was “really trying to be a better person”. Weinstein, who will have to register as a sex offender, also said he felt “remorse for all of the men who are going through this fight” and that he was worried for the “thousands of men” being denied due process in the Me Too era. In a rambling statement, he said he was “confused” and that he believed he had a “serious friendship” with Ms Mann and Ms Haleyi – the two women he was convicted of sex crimes against. Weinstein had repeatedly maintained his innocence, saying any sexual encounters were consensual. He originally faced the possibility of a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison after six women testified against him. That’s not to discount the more than 100 women, including famous actors, who accused him of sexual misconduct and rape stretching back decades. In an emotional statement in court, Ms Haleyi spoke of the trauma she had endured since the attack in 2006. “It scared me deeply, mentally and emotionally, perhaps irreparably, perhaps forever,” she said. Ms Mann also addressed the court about the 2013 incident. “I want to remind you I told Harvey, ‘no,'” she said. “I am forced to carry that experience until I die.” Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told reporters afterward that the judge sent a message that “this type behaviour is something that any potential offender is going to have to consider”. “The judge took it seriously, which is exactly how we think he should have. And we’re grateful.” Prosecutors in court filings last week said the sentence should reflect not only the crimes of which Weinstein was convicted but a “lifetime of abuse towards others”. In a statement after the proceedings, the group Silence Breakers, which speaks out against sexual assault and harassment and includes Weinstein accusers, said Weinstein’s “legacy will always be that he’s a convicted rapist”. “He is going to jail – but no amount of jail time will repair the lives he ruined, the careers he destroyed, or the damage he has caused.” Last week, prosecutors listed more than a dozen accusations going back to 1978, when they said Weinstein sexually assaulted an employee of his Buffalo, New York-based music company in a hotel room. Unsealed court documents included an email to Weinstein from his estranged brother, Bob Weinstein, telling him he belonged in hell. “U deserve a lifetime achievement award,” Bob Weinstein wrote in the November 2017 message, “for the sheer savagery and immorality and inhumaneness, for the acts u have perpetrated”. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus: Calls for Australia to copy Italy with whole country quarantine","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/12\/coronavirus-australia-quarantine\/","transcript":"This week, Italy’s government decided to lock down the whole country to stop the spread of the coronavirus as the country became the worst place for the sickness outside of China. There are now growing calls from doctors for Australia to do the same before the cold weather hits. GP Muhammad Mohsin, who heads 13 CARE and founded internet health service provider Prime Medic, said Australia needed to urgently put in place similar strategies to those in Italy stop the virus from taking off here. “I believe the only way to stop the spread of the virus is to shut down all schools, universities, businesses and public places for four weeks,” he said. “We urgently need to get people working from home, learning from home, and watching sport and other events from home.” Dr Mohsin said if we don’t stop it soon, it will become more difficult to handle later on. “This is the only way we can avoid a complete and utter epidemic in Australia. Otherwise, the virus will spread and it will devastate our country and our economy. “We must do it before winter arrives. This is absolutely critical.” Cathie Hull, an emergency doctor who works at Ryde Hospital in Sydney, has been self-quarantining along with other colleagues after being exposed to the virus via a doctor at work. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); “Isolation after exposure is scary because there is time to consider the risks,” Dr Hull said. “That leads to worrying days of information gathering, sharing and overload, pondering any slight change in our bodies and enduring long anxious nights. “We call each other and talk. “We worry about our families, our friends and our future, our sick doctor, our hospital colleagues, our responsibilities, and our community. “Over 60, I have life-long asthma and I’m allergic to medications that may be needed for secondary infections. “I packed a bag ready for the hospital.” Dr Hull agreed that to protect everyone, especially the elderly and vulnerable, we should all self-isolate for two weeks. “Two weeks now will be difficult and expensive, but at least most people will be well,” Dr Hull said. “Taking this action later will be much harder. “People half-expect strong government action similar to other affected countries. “Committing to isolation to slow spread at this critical stage, and reducing close contact when possible, may help us to manage the weeks and months before we have a vaccine, or forms of treatment, to lessen the impact of COVID-19 disease.” On Wednesday the federal government unveiled a $2.4 billion coronavirus health package as the country confirmed its 100th case. The package includes 100 pop-up fever clinics, a $30 million advertising campaign and a Medicare item for tele-health consultations to slow the spread of the virus. Italy was also added to Australia’s coronavirus travel ban, alongside China, Iran South Korea and China. In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews said a state-wide closure of schools and workplaces was an “inevitability”. “Now’s not the time for those things, but that time will come, and it is appropriate … to be frank with people, to be honest with people,” Mr Andrews said on Wednesday. “We are going to ask a lot of Victorians.” But Dr Danielle McMullen, the vice president of the Australian Medical Association’s NSW branch said a nationwide quarantine now would just be “kicking the can down the road”. “Firstly at the moment, community spread is very low,” Dr McMullen said. “Outside of that small pocket in north-west Sydney, we haven’t had other reports of sustained community spread. “It’s at least premature to put the whole country into lockdown. It just kicks the can further down the road. “Coronavirus isn’t going anywhere quickly, so two weeks of significant quarantine, then what do you do two weeks from that?” Dr McMullen said the best thing people could do right now was wash their hands, cough into their elbow and stay “alert but not alarmed”. “It is an evolving situation. “Our advice may change and that’s OK. “At the moment, locking down the country is not likely to help and will cause widespread panic.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Robots taking over our jobs? This the future of work in Australia","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/12\/jobs-robots-australia\/","transcript":"Health, education and retail are among our top industries set to benefit from robots and automation over the next 15 years, a new report shows. Already, technology is changing our work lives for the better. Busy parents can work from home if they need to look after a sick child or do the school pick-up. No longer do business managers have to worry about co-ordinating large team meetings now they can easily set up a conference call. Technology won’t just make our lives easier – it has the potential to create new jobs that we can’t even imagine existing. But it’s not all good news. A new report, from the Australian Computer Society (ACS) and AI work analytics platform Faethm, predicts that by 2034 an extra 5.3 million jobs could be created in Australia – but only if the government invests in preparing our workers for the future. About 2.7 million Australian workers are at risk of losing their jobs to automation over the next 15 years, so we need to pour money into re-educating them and giving them new skills to prevent long-term unemployment, the report says. “If we can lift the skills of the entire population, that will have great economic returns for the nation and provide people with greater economic opportunity,” ACS chief executive Andrew Johnson told The New Daily. Over the past decade, a huge number of jobs have already been lost to automation – just ask a former factor worker, bank teller or supermarket checkout operator. Other jobs on the chopping block include sales assistants, waiters, kitchen hands, truck drivers (hello, driverless trucks), journalists and accountants. But it’s not all doom and gloom – especially if we’re prepared for it. Aaron McEwan, vice president of Gartner research and advice company, said jobs will inevitably disappear due to new technologies, but argued “there are many more upsides to automation than downsides”. “It’s going to free us from the mundane, the repeatable, the mind-numbing stuff that nobody likes to do,” Mr McEwan told The New Daily. He said among those set to benefit were teachers, and people working labour-intensive jobs that can’t be replaced by robots like house cleaning. “If you’re a teacher, most of your lesson planning will probably be automated, which then frees you up to focus on actual teaching,” Mr McEwan said. “Children have already embraced iPads – yes, they’re mind-rotters, but they’re also incredible teaching tools.” Jobs of the future will be in the tech industry, or will be “social creative” jobs like Instagram influencers, he said. “Somebody who is using advanced, emerging technology, and using it in a creative way, those are the jobs of the future,” Mr McEwan said. “The advice I’d give to the average Aussie is: Don’t wait for your employer to tell you what skills you need for the future – you really have to go out and find it and focus on that.” In the near-distant future, automation is going to revolutionise almost every industry. But will that make our working life easier or harder? Business futurist Morris Miselowski has predicted that by 2040, we’ll be working more hours than we do now. That’s because technology is going to make it even harder to switch off outside traditional nine-to-five hours. “We’re doing more work at home and looking at emails away from the office now, so if we add up those micro-minutes we’d argue that we’re already working more hours and I think that’s going to get deeper and deeper,” Mr Miselowski told The New Daily. He said many people will likely have multiple income streams. “You’ll have a central job, but perhaps you enjoy doing gardening, or you’re a great knitter or enjoy painting,” he said. “We can rent out a room, or jump in a car and be an Uber driver. That’s the world we’re moving into, a world of fluidity and multiple incomes.” Mr Miselowski said education had already undergone huge changes. “If you’re not familiar with how to change a tyre, what do we do? We jump onto YouTube, teach ourselves something in that moment and go and do it,” he said. “Today’s kids know that they’re going to be learning forever.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus is now a ‘pandemic’, World Health Organisation declares","date":"03-12-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/12\/coronavirus-pandemic-declared\/","transcript":"He’s already called it a global public emergency and told leaders they need to consider it a threat worse than terrorism. But the chief of the World Health Organisation fears the daily alarm bells about coronavirus have fallen on deaf ears. On Thursday morning (Australian time), WHO leaders finally used the label they had been hesitant to attach to the novel coronavirus: It’s hoped that describing the outbreak that way would shock some countries into action, Dr Tedros said. “We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction,” he said. The decision to declare a pandemic was not made lightly, he said. But a 13-fold increase in infections outside China in the past fortnight had led to concerns individual countries hadnot implemented serious enough prevention measures. The spate of new cases in Iran and Italy, the two other countries worst hit by the virus, are just the tip of the iceberg, as other countries will soon be in the same situation, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said. Dr Tedros stressed cases in China and Korea were declining ‘significantly’ and several countries had demonstrated that the outbreak could be controlled. But he said other nations lacked the resources to deal with the “crisis”, while others “lacked resolve”. Dr Tedros said the pandemic declaration was more about semantics than actually changing how WHO was responding. He urged the public not to panic. “Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,” he said. “It’s a word that if misused can cause unreasonable fear or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over – leading to unnecessary suffering and death. “There has been so much attention on one word. Let me give you some other words that matter much more and that are much more actionable … these are prevention, preparedness, public health, political leadership – and most of all, people.

If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise their people in the response,” Dr Tedros said. “We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,” he said, adding that it was up to governments to “strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimising disruption and respecting human rights”. “We’re in this together to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It’s doable.” In Victoria, where the outbreak’s emergency status was raised to level two this week, Premier Daniel Andrews said the state control centre had begun coordinating the response from government agencies. It came after three Victorians were confirmed on Wednesday with coronavirus after returning from the US. Carey Baptist Grammar School, in Melbourne’s inner-east, later reported a second infected staff member, bringing the state’s total cases to 22. Meanwhile, in NSW, the Lismore and Coolangatta campuses of Southern Cross University reopened on Thursday after an overseas staff member who visited them returned a positive virus test result. Both were shut on Wednesday. Vice-chancellor Adam Shoemaker said 45 people are believed to have come into contact with or been close to the man while he was in Australia. Four new coronavirus cases were confirmed in NSW on Wednesday afternoon, taking the state’s total to 65. NSW Health said COVID-19 clinics will be opened across the state to diagnose patients with coronavirus symptoms. The number of cases in Queensland jumped to 20 on Wednesday after a man and woman in their 30s returned positive test results. They are in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital. In South Australia, two men, one in his 60s and the other in his 70s, were also confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus. Also, on Wednesday night, a 20-year-old man who had travelled to Hobart from Nepal became the third person in Tasmania to test positive for COVID-19. Director of Public Health Services Mark Veitch earlier this week said the man did not self-isolate while waiting for the COVID-19 test results. So far, nearly 125,000 people have contracted the coronavirus and more than 4500 have died. In Iran, by far the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, the senior vice president and two other cabinet ministers were reported to have tested positive. Iran has reported another jump in deaths, by 62 to 354, and is behind only China and Italy. Italy weighed imposing even tighter restrictions on daily life and announced billions in financial relief on Wednesday to cushion economic shocks from the coronavirus. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"PM farewells surplus with business-oriented stimulus plan","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/11\/stimulus-package-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison will jettison the budget surplus in an attempt to recession-proof the Australian economy with a wage subsidy for apprentices, a cash splash for welfare recipients, and tax breaks for small businesses. The New Daily has confirmed the Prime Minister’s coronavirus stimulus plan will wipe out the forecast $5 billion surplus, sending the promised “back in black” budget back into the red. Small businesses will also secure more generous instant asset write-off changes that will apply from Thursday until July 1 to encourage immediate investment. Eligible employers with a turnover under $50 million will also secure up to $25,000 in tax-free payments to help cash flow at a cost to the budget of $6.7 billion over the forward estimates. Any small business that withholds tax from the Australian Taxation Office on their employees’ salary and wages will receive a payment equal to 50 per cent of the amount withheld, up to a maximum payment of $25,000. Warning there are predictions that the coronavirus will wipe 0.5 percentage points from Australia’s GDP in the March quarter, the Prime Minister will argue action is needed but insist the nation is “well placed” to manage the economic shock from the coronavirus. “We’ve balanced the budget and managed our economy, so we can now use this to protect the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of Australians,” Mr Morrison said. “Our targeted stimulus package will focus on keeping Australians in jobs and keeping businesses in business so we can bounce back strongly.” He said the various actions would protect the jobs of 120,000 apprentice tradies and trainees, and assist about 690,000 small and medium employers. The measures will include wage subsidies of $7000 a quarter for each apprentice to retain existing trainees or to re-employ those who lose their jobs because of any coronavirus downturn. Employers will secure a wage subsidy of 50 per cent of the apprentice’s or trainee’s wage from January 1 to September 30. Eligible businesses will be those with 20 full-time employees or less, but larger employees can also benefit if they re-engage an eligible out-of-trade apprentice or trainee. The apprentice or trainee must have already been in training with a small business as of March 1. Employers can register for the $1.3 billion subsidy plan from April 2. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the measures will be temporary and would not repeat the “mistakes” of the Rudd government during the global financial crisis. “In our response, we have been very careful not to repeat the mistakes of previous stimulus programs and not undermine the structural integrity of the budget,” Mr Frydenberg said. “By acting decisively, this package will put Australia in the strongest possible position to deal with the economic challenges we face and to make sure our economy bounces back even stronger.” Pensioners and Newstart recipients could also secure a one-off $500 cash splash to help protect the economy from the impact of the coronavirus and a recession, Sky News reported on Wednesday. That’s about half of the $900 handout that PM Kevin Rudd used to fight the global financial crisis in 2009 and avoid a recession. Asked on Wednesday if pensioners could expect a one-off cash splash, Mr Morrison said he was closely examining options for using the welfare system to deliver cash, and would announce more on Thursday. Morrison has spent the last decade ridiculing our government’s stimulus strategy. Until now that is. When with absolute hypocrisy he embraces it. The uncomfortable truth is that when economic crises arise, responsible governments must respond. We did. https:\/\/t.co\/46aM5wlNPk — Kevin Rudd (@MrKRudd) March 10, 2020 Mr Rudd accused the government of hypocrisy because it has repeatedly rubbished his strategy of “go hard, go early and go households” during the GFC. “In his belated response to the coronavirus crisis, Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s stated strategy to date seems clear. It’s that ‘he is not me’,” Mr Rudd said. “Indeed, whenever he’s asked why he suddenly seems so interested in the dreaded ‘S’ word – stimulus – he protests ‘it’s not a Rudd stimulus’. “Methinks he doth protest too much. “I must confess I’m pleased about the distinction. That’s because I have no interest in being associated with Morrison’s tardy response to the public health and economic impact of the current crisis.” The Prime Minister and Treasurer have previously flagged they are reconsidering the deeming rate, which determines access to the pension and part-pension, in light of record-low interest rates. The stimulus package to be announced on Thursday is also expected to include significant funding for aged-care facilities caring for seniors, who are most at risk from the coronavirus. Mr Morrison also said on Wednesday Australia would close its borders to travellers from Italy, extending the restrictions already in place for travellers from China, Iran, and South Korea. They will remain until health authorities determine it is safe to lift them. Australian citizens or permanent residents returning from those countries will be allowed into the country but will have to self-isolate for 14 days."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Christmas Island robber crab suspected of nicking expensive camera","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/11\/christmas-island-crab-burglary\/","transcript":"It seems Christmas Island’s notorious robber crabs have earned their name after a suspected late-night burglary on the remote territory. One of the species, which can measure up to a metre wide and weigh four kilograms, has been accused of destroying and stealing a thermal-imaging camera belonging to a researcher studying one of the island’s other native residents. The robber crab or coconut crab, which can live for up to 80 years, is sometimes referred to as a “gentle giant”. But Western Sydney University PhD candidate Annabel Dorrestein would challenge that description. “They have been bothering me ever since I started my PhD,” she said. “Dragging away cameras … I just see them and I run after them and they let go and I retrieve my equipment. “But not this particular time.” She has had numerous troubling encounters with the species – the world’s biggest land crustacean – while she has been studying the Christmas Island flying fox. Ms Dorrestein said she had to fight off crabs on numerous occasions in recent months as they attempted to steal her backpack or other equipment. Ms Dorrestein said she had set up a $6000 camera on a tripod with an external battery, but when she returned the next morning the camera was gone. The thief left an obvious clue. “This particular night we were recording a mango tree, so we set it up and we hooked it up to an external battery so it could run the whole night and we left it running,” Ms Dorrestein said. “[In the] morning when we went to the mango tree to retrieve the thermal camera – and this has been going very well for weeks – there was no thermal camera any more. “The tripod that it was mounted to was knocked over, we saw claw marks on the tripod where the thermal camera was attached to the cord that ran from the thermal camera to the battery – [it] was mangled or claw marks on the battery. “So basically, a big robber crab ripped the thermal camera off the spotting scope and mangled the cables so it came loose and just dragged it into the forest. “[We were] looking for hours and hours in every nook and cranny and we found lots of big robber crabs hiding everywhere, but none of them have had my thermal camera.” Christmas Island local Chris Bray attempted to help the researcher find her camera, but said the piece of equipment was nowhere to be seen. Christmas Island National Park’s chief ranger Rob Muller said the crabs were known to have kleptomaniac tendencies. “They are very inquisitive and they have an exceptionally good sense of smell, so that takes them into all sorts of places that arouses their curiosity,” Mr Muller said. “And if they find something that arouses their curiosity, they want to drag it away – and they are big enough to – to have a closer look at it. “Shoes and thongs around my doorway I’ve had go missing and found sometimes quite a while away.” Ms Dorrestein’s account has inspired others to share their stories of robber crab encounters. Mr Bray, who runs a business, said some of his most recent guests had their own story to tell. “We had some guests for lunch the other night and there’s a nice little barbecue, like strapped to a pole a long way away. “I can’t imagine how a robber crab would even get up there … the guests sent me some photos just this morning of this huge robber crab that has somehow lifted up the hood of the barbecue and was like climbing inside,” he said. “They’re pretty amazing animals actually and [some] live for like 80 or 90 years, [so] they learn a few tricks in that time for sure.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Police confirm five dead in Far North Queensland light plane crash","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/qld\/2020\/03\/11\/plane-crash-lockhart-river\/","transcript":"Queensland Police have confirmed that all five occupants of a small passenger plane reported missing in far north Queensland have died in a crash. Emergency services found the wreckage of the Cessna 404 twin-engine piston on a beach near Lockhart River, about 800 kilometres north of Cairns about 1.20pm on Wednesday after a search. Acting Chief Superintendent Chris Hodgman told a media conference on Wednesday afternoon that the four government workers and the pilot were killed when the plane crashed into sand dunes about five kilometres south of the Lockhart River township. During a search of the wreckage, the bodies of the 39-year-old pilot and four male passengers aged between 49 and 63 were located. All five men were from the Cairns area. The accident is being investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. A preliminary report is expected to be released in about a month. “ATSB transport safety investigators with experience in aircraft operations, aircraft maintenance and aeronautical engineering are preparing to deploy to the accident site,” a statement said. “The investigation’s final report can be expected to be released in about 18 months.” Perth-based charter company Aerohire has confirmed it was their aircraft. Superintendent Hodgman said it is understood the plane attempted to land twice in the “rough” conditions but crashed on a third attempt. The aircraft was reported overdue at Lockhart River at 11am on Wednesday. Emergency services were called to the region, in Cape York, after reports the plane was missing near Lockhart River. Queensland Police and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority started a co-ordinated joint search about 11.30am (local time). The Bureau of Meteorology had earlier warned of high winds and flooding rain in the area. The rough weather is the result of a tropical low that is expected to develop into a cyclone over the Coral Sea at the weekend. AMSA sent two rescue helicopters from Cairns and Horn Island and its Challenger Search and Rescue jet from Cairns to the area. Lockhart River is also the scene of one of Australia’s worst civil aviation disasters in May 2005. Pilot error and company safety issues were eventually found to be partly to blame when a Metroliner 23 plane crashed on approach to the local airport, killing two pilots and 13 passengers on board. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Catch of the day: Police reel in alleged Melbourne jewel thief","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/03\/11\/police-melbourne-jewel-thief\/","transcript":"An alleged jewel thief who used a fishing rod to land a designer necklace from a high-end Melbourne store has himself been reeled in by police.

CCTV footage showed the man spent about three hours trying to snag the $700 Versace necklace in the middle of the night on Little Collins Street on February 24. Victoria Police had previously shared CCTV video of the thief’s unusual fishing expedition on social media. “It’s fairly blatant and quite bold as well, to have someone with a fishing rod in the middle of the night in the city.

The ever-growing tally came as the Morrison government approved a $2.4 billion response to the COVID-19 outbreak and closed Australia’s borders to travellers from Italy. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy again urged calm, saying the country’s “magnificent, magnificent” doctors were doing all they could. “We’ve got small numbers of cases at the moment. We do expect more and I’ve also said on many occasions, for most people who get this virus, it is a very minor illness,” he said. “Certainly we are worried about the elderly, certainly we are worried if we have a large outbreak that that would put pressure on our hospitals … but at the moment, there is no reason for community panic in Australia.” NSW remains the worst-hit state, with six more cases confirmed on Wednesday morning and a further four in the afternoon. That brings to 65 the number of coronavirus infections in the state – including two elderly patients who have died. Also on Wednesday, three more Victorians were confirmed with the deadly virus, along with another three in Western Australia and one case at Southern Cross University campuses in northern NSW and on the Gold Coast. The campuses at Lismore and Coolangatta are in lockdown to stop any potential spread of the virus after a staff member tested positive. The decision means an estimated 8000 students will have to study at home. They are not required to self-isolate. A university employee from the Philippines attended workshops at both campuses between March 2-6 before falling ill. Health authorities are expected to set up 100 “pop-up” coronavirus clinics across Australia, as part of the government’s $2.4 billion package. The clinics are expected to handle up to 75 patients a day. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country’s health system would be stressed as the outbreak got worse, but said there was no reason for alarm or concern. “These are not usual times and usual demands on our health system,” he said. “[But] the plan and the resource and the preparedness and the professionalism of our health system will attend to those needs.” He said Australia would close its borders to travellers from Italy at 6pm on Wednesday (ADST), extending restrictions already in place for travellers from China, Iran, and South Korea. The restrictions will remain until health authorities determine it is safe to lift them. Australian citizens or permanent residents returning from those countries will be allowed into the country but will have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Prime Minister also said he was closely examining options for using the welfare system to deliver targeted cash payments. More details of the government’s planned stimulus package will be announced on Thursday, but it is likely to include handouts for pensioners and significant funding for aged-care facilities caring for seniors, who are most at risk from the coronavirus. “We’re still finalising some of those measures,” Mr Morrison said. In other developments on Wednesday, the country’s big four banks were said to be on the verge of offering “mortgage holidays” to customers affected by the virus epidemic. Two British banks have recently made such offers, and RateCity research director Sally Tindall told the Nine Network similar deals were likely to be considered in Australia. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has demanded the government legislate for two weeks of paid leave for all workers to deal with the virus. ACTU secretary Sally McManus also hit out at Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter for suggesting casual workers would have made provisions for staying home while sick or quarantined. “It’s absolutely outrageous and so out of touch that our government would say that casual workers should have been putting money aside for a pandemic,” Ms McManus said. “No one in the world or in Australia could prepare or know that a pandemic was coming.” Mr Morrison urged bosses to look after their workers, saying they would need staff on the other side of any economic slump that stemmed from the virus fallout. “I’d be encouraging employers to take a flexible and forward-leaning approach in supporting their employees during this process,” Mr Morrison said. “Businesses spend a lot of time talking about the value and integrity of their brands. Their brands will be defined in these months ahead.” In Victoria, Treasurer Tim Pallas has warned his next budget will be “extremely difficult” in the aftermath of the bushfires and amid the coronavirus outbreak. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has declared the virus a “class-two” emergency and opened the state’s emergency control centre to manage the crisis. The revelations come as AFL players are bracing for the prospect of playing matches in front of empty stadiums because of the outbreak, which has already claimed the scalp of Tasmania’s Dark Mofo winter arts festival. Elsewhere, queues stretched the lengths of city blocks as more than 1000 Victorians went to clinics in hospitals across Melbourne to be tested for the virus.  The South Australian government has also announced a $350 million economic stimulus package to help secure jobs affected by the triple whammy of bushfires, drought and the coronavirus. Infrastructure projects, including road and hospital maintenance work and funds for tourism facilities will form the centrepiece of the initiative. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Artist charged with sexual assault of four womenand tattoo offence","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/03\/11\/anthony-lister-court\/","transcript":"Renowned Australian artist Anthony Lister has appeared in a Sydney court over allegations he sexually assaulted four women and tattooed one without her consent. Mr Lister, 40, was arrested on Tuesday morning after police raided his inner-city Darlinghurst home and an industrial space at Marrickville, in Sydney’s inner west. He is accused of sexually assaulting four women on separate occasions between 2015 and 2018. Three of the complainants were art students, NSW Police said. He also allegedly tattooed three lines on one of the women without her consent. Mr Lister appeared in Sydney’s Central Local Court via video link from Surry Hills Police Station. Magistrate Robert Williams adjourned the matter until May 7 and Mr Lister’s lawyer Joe Blackshield flagged a possible release application next week. Outside court, Mr Blackshield said he was yet to speak to Mr Lister. “I believe at this stage the plan is to defend most of the charges,” he said, without elaborating. Surry Hills Police Commander, Superintendent Tim Beattie, said the complainants were aged 18 and 19 at the time and alleged there were elements of grooming. “That’s part of the allegation and that will come out, we will allege, through the court process,” he said. “What we do know is we believe he has engaged these people through social circles in parts of the community.” One of the alleged assaults is understood to have happened at a function in Redfern, while others allegedly took place at Mr Lister’s home. Mr Lister’s charges include causing grievous bodily harm with intent, five counts of sexual intercourse without consent and using an intoxicating substance to commit an indictable offence. During the searches, police seized four replica pistols, knuckle dusters and drugs including cocaine, MDMA and cannabis. Computers, mobile phones and SD cards were also seized. Mr Lister was born in Brisbane and has become one of the country’s most internationally-recognised painters, once included in a list of the 50 most influential street artists of all time. The father-of-three has described his work as “bold, at times violent, definitely direct and intentional”.

Frank Abbott’s interaction with people in the mid-north coast township of Kendall, from where three-year-old William went missing in 2014, was examined at the toddler’s inquest in Taree on Wednesday. Patrick Teeling, the Johns River General Store owner, said Abbott came up to him when news broke that Tyrrell investigators had seized a car associated with another person of interest, Tony Jones. No one has ever been charged over the disappearance of William, who vanished while playing at his foster grandmother’s Kendall home on the morning of September 12, 2014. “Frank was saying ‘I knew they’d get him, I knew they’d get him’,” Mr Teeling told the Coroners Court. “I said ‘Who’ and he said ‘that Jones chap’ and I wondered what that was all about.” Mr Teeling told the court he’d not previously discussed the Tyrrell investigation with Abbott, who he’d known since the early 1990s. “He decided he just had to tell you?” counsel assisting the coroner, Gerard Craddock SC, asked Mr Teeling. “Yeah, for some unknown reasons,” the shopkeeper replied. “I did [see media coverage of Jones that night] … it worried me why he is telling me that.” Abbott, who is in a Cessnock jail on an unrelated conviction, was questioned by police in late 2019. Representing himself at the inquest via video link from prison, he took issue with Mr Teeling saying he “ran up to him”. After Abbott suggested he had a walking frame, the shopkeeper agreed the running might not have happened. On Tuesday, Mr Jones told the court he had no recollection “whatsoever” of the day William went missing, before claiming he might have been having extramarital sex with his next-door neighbour. He thought about it again overnight but was unable to remember anything, he told the court on Wednesday. Hundreds of people have been dubbed “persons of interest” during the investigation and a case detective admitted during the inquest there’s “a very low standard to meet in order to become a person of interest”. The inquest heard Mr Jones and Abbott met in Grafton prison in 2019 and had a falling out over what Abbott was saying about the Tyrrell investigation. “You were talking s—,” Mr Jones said, under questioning by Abbott, on Wednesday. “I said ‘I didn’t give you up’ and I was locked in my room for a number of weeks because the officer said I was going to be shivved,” Abbott replied. The inquest is in its third tranche, having begun in early 2019. Mr Craddock earlier this week said it’s “certainly clear” someone knows something they haven’t passed on to police. “Perhaps they don’t realise the significance, perhaps they’re afraid either of some person or merely afraid of being disbelieved,” he said. “It’s [an] appalling thing that we still have no certainty as to what became of a three-year-old innocently playing in a suburban back yard.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"George Pell backers clash with 'angry' protester at appeal","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/george-pell\/2020\/03\/11\/george-pell-protest-appeal-hearing\/","transcript":"• Cardinal George Pell was released from prison on April 7, 2020 after the High Court quashed his five convictions for child sexual abuse. Supporters of George Pell have clashed outside the High Court with a man calling for the disgraced Catholic cardinal to “burn in hell”. The full bench of the High Court began hearing Pell’s legal team’s final bid for his freedom in Canberra on Wednesday. On Wednesday morning, Michael Advocate from Victim Justice stood outside the court holding signs depicting Pell in front of fiery scenes and the words “Burn in hell Pell”. A group of Pell supporters tried to block Mr Advocate from speaking to reporters, yelling for the jailed cardinal to be forgiven. The group of about 50 supporters, many holding Australian flags, sang hymns outside of the court as lawyers prepared for the case inside. Bhikku Buddha Dhatu said he had lived through the Vietnam War, showing his burn scars and saying he had forgiven those responsible. Mr Advocate, who supports close to 200 victims of abuse, said more help was needed for compensation and justice. “George Pell is a terrible man,” he said. “A lot of us here are Catholics but we’re just outraged and we’ve got to get rid of this idiot. “If he does get released I’d say ‘George, respectfully, get on a plane, go back to Italy and we hope to never see you again’.” Pell, 78, was jailed for six years last year for sexually abusing two choirboys at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral, shortly after being appointed Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. The High Court hearing is expected to run into Thursday. The court has not formally granted Pell’s application for appeal, instead referring it “for argument”. That means after the hearing, the court can refuse the application for special leave, or approve it. It can then either allow or dismiss the appeal. Pell, who has steadfastly maintained his innocence, is not in Canberra for the hearing. He remains in Victoria’s Barwon Prison, and will be relying on his legal team for news of the outcome. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Genius website pairs coronavirus hand-washing with your favourite lyrics","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/11\/coronavirus-hand-washing\/","transcript":"With the deadly coronavirus spreading ever-faster across the world – and closer to home in Australia – we’re surely all aware by now that washing our hands properly is one of the best ways to avoid contracting it. That means with soap and water for 20 seconds – or, according to Britain’s National Health Service, as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice to yourself. Health authorities in Australia and internationally agree that washing hands, often, with soap and water is one of the best ways to avoid spreading – or catching – infections such as COVID-19. But, now that we’re months into the global outbreak, Happy Birthday might be getting a little old for many diligent hand-washers. That’s where Wash Your Lyrics comes in. The work of a creative – and hygienically minded – teenage British developer, it pairs the lyrics to a song of your choice with instructions on how to wash your hands properly. The developer, who says he is 17 and is known only as William, says he came up with the Wash Your Lyrics website in less than 24 hours. In its first day online, he had more than 120,000 user requests and more than two million server requests – with that number growing rapidly through Wednesday (Australian time). “Thanks to everyone who has used the site so far,” William posted. “Also sorry for the downtime, [I] didn’t expect the traffic the site received.” William’s site is simple but effective. Users enter their choice of song name and author and it automatically pulls the lyrics from Genius (the world’s biggest collection of lyrics) and puts them, line-by-line, over an infographic from the NHS. Elsewhere, as hand-washing gains ever more prominence, a how-to guide produced by Vietnam’s Health Minister has also been a viral hit. It uses an upbeat song described by comedian John Oliver as a “genuine club banger” – and the original video has 9.4 million views on YouTube. The English-subtitled version has 1.2 million. It’s called Ghen Cô Vy – a play on words implying the coronavirus is like a jealous troublemaker trying to come between a couple – and it has also inspired a dance challenge on social media app TikTok. The kitschy animation includes demonstrations of hand-washing, warnings about face masks and public gatherings, and a gloved hand flicking away an angry-looking green coronavirus particle. In the Philippines, the Department of Health released a video on TikTok highlighting protective measures against COVID-19, with instructions like “stahhhp, don’t touch your face” and “follow cough etiquette”.

But the massive stimulus package will wipe out the modest forecast $5 billion surplus for 2020, ending the Liberal Party’s election campaign boast the budget is “back in black”. Sky News reported on Wednesday that pensioners and Newstart recipients will secure $500 in coronavirus payments to kickstart the economy. That’s about half of the $900 handout that then prime minister Kevin Rudd used to fight the global financial crisis and avoid a recession. Asked on Wednesday if pensioners could expect a one-off cash splash, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was closely examining options for using the welfare system to deliver cash, and would announce more on Thursday. “We’re still finalising some of those measures after what was a very lengthy meeting yesterday,” he said. “Those who have been around this place for a long time will know that the Coalition actually supported stimulus back in the first round in response to the global financial crisis. And that’s exactly what we did. “There were two tranches to that stimulus at that time. The first one acted and worked through the existing payment mechanisms, and that was able to be put through fairly quickly. The Coalition supported those measures at that time. These are measures that the government has been looking closely at.” Mr Rudd has accused the government of hypocrisy because it has repeatedly rubbished his strategy of “go hard, go early and go households” during the GFC. “In his belated response to the coronavirus crisis, Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s stated strategy to date seems clear. It’s that ‘he is not me’. Indeed, whenever he’s asked why he suddenly seems so interested in the dreaded ‘S’ word – stimulus – he protests ‘it’s not a Rudd stimulus’,” Mr Rudd said. “Methinks he doth protest too much. I must confess I’m pleased about the distinction. That’s because I have no interest in being associated with Morrison’s tardy response to the public health and economic impact of the current crisis.” The Prime Minister and Treasurer have previously flagged that they are reconsidering the deeming rate, which determines access to the pension and part-pension, in light of record low interest rates. The stimulus package to be announced on Thursday is also expected to include significant funding for aged-care facilities caring for seniors, who are most at risk from the coronavirus. Mr Morrison also said Australia would close its borders to travellers from Italy on Wednesday, extending the restrictions already in place for travellers from China, Iran, and South Korea. The restrictions will remain until health authorities determine it is safe to lift them. Australian citizens or permanent residents returning from those countries will be allowed into the country but will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Health Minister Greg Hunt also confirmed that pregnant mums, over-70s and cancer patients will be offered bulk-billed consultations over phone, video link or WhatsApp to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The first tranche of the government’s $2.4 billion health plan to tackle the worldwide COVID-19 crisis was announced on Wednesday morning. It came as the global death toll topped more than 4000 and amid a significant rise in confirmed cases in Australia. There were six new cases in NSW overnight on Tuesday, and another four in Victoria. Most of the people who have tested positive in the past two days had recently returned from Europe or the US. Mr Morrison said the plan would assist vulnerable people who might be concerned they were exhibiting symptoms. It follows complaints of patients being charged up to $350 for coronavirus testing and “pop up” drive-through testing by GPs in car parks. “This package is about preventing and treating coronavirus in the coming weeks,” Mr Morrison said. “Australia isn’t immune, but with this $2.4 billion boost we’re as well prepared as any country in the world. “Our medical experts have been preparing for an event like this for years and this is the next step up in Australia’s plan.” The new Medicare payments for at-home care for coronavirus sufferers and vulnerable patients will begin on Friday and will be fully bulk-billed (free). They will allow medical, nursing and mental health medical staff to deliver services over the phone via video conference including via FaceTime, Skype and WhatsApp. Those eligible will include:"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Hazard-reduction burns to go ahead after devastating fire season","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/03\/11\/hazard-reduction-victoria-2020\/","transcript":"Victoria is about to start a program of planned burn-offs as milder autumn weather follows a devastating bushfire season that ravaged about 1.6 million hectares statewide. With all blazes in Victoria contained and average rainfall predicted for autumn, the Country Fire Authority and Forest Fire Management Victoria will carry out burn-offs, it was confirmed on Wednesday. “Victoria is one of the most bushfire-prone regions in the world,” FFM Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said. “While planned burning will never be a cure-all, it is a key part of bushfire preparedness.” Areas including the Dandenong Ranges, Mount Dandenong, Upwey, Olinda, the Macedon Ranges – all near Melbourne – and Bendigo, in central Victoria, will be the initial focus of the program. Hazard-reduction burns are also scheduled for the state’s south-west at Colac, Cressy and Camperdown, and around townships along the Great Ocean Road. The amount of prescribed planned burning carried out in Victoria in 2019 became a point of contention during the recent summer’s fire season. Authorities said dry conditions made hazard-reduction burning extremely difficult in the previous year, but denied the state had not been prepared for the fire season. A $2.55 million inquiry will be held into the deadly 2019-2020 bushfires, with the first report due in the middle of 2020. The review will be run by inspectorate general of emergency management Tony Pearce.

A full bench of the High Court will start hearing George Pell’s final bid for freedom in Canberra on Wednesday. As the disgraced cardinal spends another day in solitary confinement at a Victorian prison, either five or seven judges will consider his legal team’s arguments. The 78-year-old is one year into his six-year sentence, handed down last year for sexually abusing two choirboys at St Patrick’s Cathedral while he was Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. Pell was convicted by a jury in 2018 of raping one 13-year-old choirboy and sexual assault of another. The first boy gave evidence against Pell; the second died in 2014. Pell was steadfast in his claims of innocence through two trials – the first ending in a hung jury – and last year’s Victoria’s Court of Appeal hearing which upheld the verdict in a 2-1 ruling. The High Court has not formally granted Pell’s application for appeal, instead referring it “for argument”. That means after the hearing, the court can refuse the application for special leave, or approve it. It can then either allow or dismiss the appeal. The trial centred around five or six minutes after Mass when the jury found the abuse occurred. The jury did not accept the defence claim the sacristy after Mass was a “hive of activity” which would not have given Pell the required opportunity to offend. Pell’s lawyers are arguing the appeal on two grounds. First they say the Court of Appeal majority – Chief Justice Ann Ferguson and President Chris Maxwell – erred in requiring Pell to prove the offending was “impossible” in order to raise reasonable doubt. They say there was evidence which in combination raised and left doubt as to Pell’s guilt, but the judges “examined each piece of evidence in isolation”. His lawyers Bret Walker SC and Ruth Shann also argue believing the complainant’s account did not eliminate reasonable doubt. “The majority accepted there was some evidence supporting the applicant’s contentions of impossibility on virtually every matter raised,” they said. The third judge, Justice Mark Weinberg, found in Pell’s favour, noting the prosecution was required to eliminate any reasonable possibility there was no opportunity for offending. This was the right approach, Pell’s lawyers say. Secondly, they argue since the majority found there was a reasonable doubt as to the existence of any opportunity for Pell to have offended, they made an error in concluding the guilty verdicts were not unreasonable. They want Pell’s convictions on five charges to be quashed, resulting in his immediate release from prison. But prosecutors countered the submissions by accusing the defence of giving the court an “incomplete and inaccurate picture of the facts”, glossing over evidence supporting the complainant. “The fact that the appellate court considered there to be multiple views of the evidence open to the jury, including a view consistent with innocence, does not necessarily mean that the jury verdict was unreasonable,” chief crown prosecutor Kerri Judd QC wrote in joint submissions with trial prosecutors Mark Gibson QC and Angela Ellis. “The assessment of the evidence is a matter for the jury.” The High Court is also expected to examine whether Victoria’s Court of Appeal judges were legally allowed to watch video recordings of trial evidence in considering the case. They watched evidence of 12 witnesses, including the complainant, visited St Patrick’s Cathedral and examined the ornamental robes worn by Pell at the time. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Joe Biden eyes Michigan win to steamroll Bernie Sanders","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/11\/joe-biden-michigan\/","transcript":"Joe Biden has won the Democratic presidential primary in Michigan, the largest of the six states voting, with 125 pledged delegates at stake. Mr Biden emphasised the Obama administration’s bailout of the auto industry, which saved thousands of jobs. He also counted on continued strong support among African American voters. Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan’s 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Losing the state this year may greatly diminish his chances at the nomination. Many voters are already looking ahead to November and whether President Donald Trump can again win in the state that, perhaps more than any other, catapulted him into the White House in 2016. Earlier today, Mr Biden has delivered decisive wins in Missouri and Mississippi, dealing an early blow to rival Mr Sanders on a night when six states were up for grabs. Tuesday marked the first time voters weighed in on the Democratic contest since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Mr Sanders and Mr Biden. Mr Biden had made a last-minute pitch to the blue-collar workers he hopes will help deliver Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary and build an insurmountable lead over Mr Sanders. Mr Sanders had been aiming for an upset that would breathe life into his flagging White House hopes. Mr Biden’s impressive showing in last week’s “Super Tuesday” states, along with a surge of endorsements and campaign donations, has elevated him to frontrunner status, narrowing Mr Sanders’ path to the nomination. Washington, North Dakota and Idaho also hold contests. Michigan is also likely to be a crucial battleground in the general election, after Mr Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate four years ago to carry the state in nearly three decades. Late in the day, both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticise the Mr Trump administration’s response.

Mr Biden, whose propensity to veer off script occasionally causes self-inflicted wounds, snapped at the worker with an obscenity. Here is a close up video of the interaction.

On Wednesday morning (Australian time), lawmakers voted in favour of a proposal that could give Mr Putin the green light to serve two extra back-to-back terms – allowing him to rule until 2036. But first, whether his second consecutive term in office comes to an end in 2024 will come down to a nationwide vote in April that will determine if the move to reset his presidential term tally to zero is adopted. Before the public can have their say, the proposed constitutional amendments which Mr Putin gave his blessing for while addressing the lower house of parliament on Wednesday (Australian time), must go through two more rounds of approval. It will then need to get clearance from the Constitutional Court before a public vote on April 22 can be held. In January, the 67-year-old Mr Putin unveiled his plan for constitutional overhaul that could see him side step into a different role and make the new president more of a figurehead position. It was a move thought to signal a clear intention to find a way to rule long after 2024 when his second sequential, and fourth presidential, term ends. “The proposal to remove restrictions for any person, including the incumbent president … In principle, this option would be possible, but on one condition –  if the constitutional court gives an official ruling that such an amendment would not contradict the principles and main provisions of the constitution,” Mr Putin said. A former KGB officer, Mr Putin – who has served a stint as prime minister as well as four presidential terms – had previously said he would abide by the law and step down in 2024. MP Valentina Tereshkova, who is an outspoken supporter of Mr Putin, said the proposal to extend his time in office will promote stability in Russia. “I don’t know if the president is ready to run in that election but what I know for sure is that the very existence of this possibility for the current president, given his huge authority, is a stabilising factor for our society,” she told CNN. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australian bushfires emitted the same amount of CO2 as annual air travel","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/11\/australian-bushfires-climate-council\/","transcript":"Australia’s severe bushfires released a massive amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, equivalent to the annual emissions from commercial air travel worldwide, a new report reveals. Australia’s black summer took 33 lives, killed one billion animals, destroyed 2439 homes, burnt millions of hectares, wiped billions out of the economy and put a devastating amount of CO2 back into the atmosphere, the first comprehensive overview, compiled by the Climate Council, shows. The catastrophic bushfires spewed an average of 900 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, more than Australia’s annual emissions that sit around 531 million tonnes, Australian National University climate scientist Will Steffen told The New Daily. “This is an enormous burst of carbon [dioxide], bigger than what we’ve ever seen before,” Professor Steffen said. “They were more than our annual national emissions. “The question now is, we’re not sure what type of forest or ecosystem is going to regrow. “If you have a new ecosystem that sucks up less, that will be a net loss to the atmosphere and affect the climate in the future.”  Last year ended with global average temperatures 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, according to the latest State of the Climate report by the World Meteorological Organisation released on Wednesday. Australia finished 2019 where it started: With extreme heat. The 2018-2019 summer was the hottest on record, as was December. Professor Steffen said the report showed just how intense the bushfire season was. “The big takeaway is this was totally unprecedented in terms of the extent of these fires,” Professor Steffen said. “If you look for an example, the eucalyptus forests in the eastern part of Australia, on average, only two per cent of that burns each year. In this season it was over 20 per cent. “That is just massive.” Although the record-breaking summer may be over, many communities are still reeling. Nearly 80 per cent of Australians were affected by the bushfires, and communities are still recovering. Port Macquarie resident Colleen Carmody had never had a respiratory issue in her life, until this summer. “We had a big fire that started last July and it only went out two weeks ago,” she said. “So we had seven months of fire smoke. Sometimes it was so thick it closed the road, the highway in and out.”   “Last September I was coughing a lot. I got coughing fits that I had never had before. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t lie down. I would have to sit up in a chair all night.” Some days Port Macquarie’s air quality was 20 times over the safe limit. It got so bad Mrs Carmody was treated in hospital for five nights and she still uses a ventilator every day. The smoke also damaged her voice, and she doesn’t know if it will ever be fully restored. “It’s my voice that hasn’t recovered. I used to have a strong voice. Sometimes now I can’t even get the sounds out,” she said. “I feel like I’m having to really project. I’m yelling to get people to know I’m even talking.” In Inverell, a small town in northern NSW, Gundi Rhodes is the local vet – she watched as farmers struggled to keep cattle alive through the drought and then saw native animals suffer through the fires. “It’s hard to describe when you haven’t seen it. Imagine you go out to a farm and you have a dust storm on the left, and two on the right. It’s a 38-degree day with a hot wind.  “You go onto a farm. They’re struggling, there’s no grass, the cattle are skinny. You can’t sell them because they’re too skinny, so the farmers had to pay $100 for their cattle to be slaughtered. “All the kangaroos would be near the roadside, 10,000 of them. Then they thinned out and there were hardly any left because there was nothing to be eaten. “In the last few months the kolas had to come down from the trees. A couple of young guys found one on the road that was just putting his arms out to them. “I would get them in the clinic. I had them drink and drink and drink, for an hour. We could hardly save any of them.” Further down south, Lyn Trindall was evacuated from her property in the Blue Mountains five times over six weeks. A 2013 bushfire survivor who has lived in the area for 30 years, Ms Trindall said fire season almost stretched across the entire year.  “It’s not just summer, it’s starting in spring now. It’s been pushed forward and doesn’t leave the firefighters much time. It’s almost all year now,” Ms Trindall said “As a bushfire survivor, I took it seriously and evacuated every time.” Now she wonders if it would be different had Australia acted on climate change sooner. “I think about it every day. It’s still very much in my thoughts. I’m very concerned. Really, the whole of Australia is at threat and I think it’s high time the government stepped in.”  Climate Councillor and former NSW Fire and Rescue commissioner Greg Mullins said this summer was proof we need urgent action on climate change. “The scale of the bushfires and the extreme weather conditions that drove them surprised veteran firefighters and climate scientists,” Mr Mullins said. “To keep Australians safe and protect our economy, we must urgently and drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. “If we do not, the fires, heatwaves and floods will only get worse. “As the sunniest and one of the windiest countries on the planet, we have the solutions to address climate change. “We must accelerate the transition to renewable energy and storage.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Drive-through coronavirus testing facilities are coming to Australia","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/11\/drive-through-coronavirus-testing\/","transcript":"Drive-through COVID-19 testing facilities are rolling out at hospitals and medical centres around Australia to help fast-track testing of people who think they may have contracted the virus. Pop-up clinics have already opened in Melbourne and Adelaide this week. The Repatriation Hospital in Adelaide’s south is expected to be able to receive a patient every 20 minutes once fully operational. At the hospital’s testing site, which officially opened on Tuesday, patients who have a referral from their GP will be able to drive by, wind down their windows and have test swabs taken. The push for new ways to quickly and safely test patients follows concerns from medical practitioners who have accused authorities of not doing enough to support GPs at the frontline. Many GPs have complained about a lack of protective equipment like medical-grade face masks, while others have criticised the government for delivering conflicting advice about how to manage the outbreak.

He said the government would also expand the COVID-19 national hotline (1800 020 080), which will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For inspiration on how to quickly test as many people as we can, we need to look to South Korea. Since announcing its first case of coronavirus on January 20, the tech-savvy Asian country has tested more than 140,000 people and confirmed more than 7500 cases. How did they do it? Drive-through testing clinics play a huge part. In South Korea, it takes just 10 minutes for a patient to have their swab taken and test results returned. Aside from the convenience for patients and medical practitioners, one of the best parts about drive-through clinics is that it prevents potentially contagious patients from leaving their cars and infecting other people in hospital waiting rooms. A growing number of local governments have launched roadside testing facilities to keep up with demand. South Korean officials say the solution has reduced testing time by a third, keeping the country’s death rate down to around 0.6 per cent. Germany followed suit on Monday, and drive-through clinics have since begun opening in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the US city of Washington, a Seattle healthcare system has developed an impressive five-minute drive-through testing clinic for its workers in the hospital car park, NPR reported. But aside from the quick-thinking response in Washington, the US has largely been lagging behind in managing the outbreak. Despite announcing its first case of coronavirus on the same day as South Korea, the US – where 27 people have already died – has only tested about 4384 people. Meanwhile, in the UK, where three people have died of COVID-19, authorities have already tested more than 24,900 people. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australian MH17 cops 'likely hacked' by Russians, court hears","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/11\/russians-hacked-australian-mh17-files-trial\/","transcript":"Russian intelligence services likely hacked and leaked an Australian Federal Police report about the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a court has heard. Misinformation masquerading as news allegedly spread via a Russian-linked website which had selectively published only parts of the government-held documents that questioned the authenticity of video footage of the Buk-TELAR missile launcher used in the attack. That’s according to prosecutor Dedy Woei-A-Tsoi who told the murder trial of three Russians and a Ukrainian over the crash, which killed 298 people, that “parts of the (AFP) report that confirm the authenticity of a video were not published” to cover up Russia’s involvement in the downing of MH17. They included an analysis of four photos of the Buk missile launcher by the AFP who initially believed were manipulated because the modified date of the files was earlier than the creation date. Despite the AFP being able to later corroborate its authenticity with the help of video footage, that information which was obtained in February was not published by Russian military intelligence, the GRU, the court heard. Rather a selective batch of classified documents from the Joint Investigation Team — formed by Australia, The Netherlands, Belgium and Malaysia – served “as part of a cynical misinformation campaign that has gone on for more than five years now”, Ms Woei-a-Tsoi said. “This website’s goal is therefore not to share information in a responsible, journalistic manner, but rather to spread disinformation,” she said. “We must take into account the possibility that the published (AFP) documents were obtained following a successful GRU hacking operation in one of the four JIT countries mentioned above.” Russians tried to hack the Malaysian police and attorney-general’s office and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons’ offices in the Netherlands to obtain information about the case, Ms Woei-a-Tsoi added in her statement to the court. The court heard several witnesses in the MH17 trial were terrified about the repercussions of speaking out, with one witness fleeing his home in eastern Ukraine after being visited by two armed members of the GRU. AFP Detective-Superintendent David Nelson confirmed the AFP and the wider JIT had stepped up IT security since the documents were released. “We’ve all considered our own systems and taken the necessary steps,” he said. Det-Supt Nelson said the incident was the only known unauthorised release of documents about the investigation. “The prosecution service spoke about an instance of disinformation and how disinformation is being portrayed in the media and to the general public,” he said. “I don’t wish to comment too much further on what the (Dutch) Prosecution Service said other than to say that (the disinformation campaign) is not helpful for the next of kin, I don’t think it assists their grieving and ability to follow the trial and know what the facts are.” Bryan Clancy, who lost his brother Michael and sister-in-law Carol on MH17, said Russia had gone to unbelievable lengths to avoid scrutiny. “They’re murderers and they’re trying to cover their tracks,” he said. Russians Oleg Pulatov, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko are also being tried in absentia for murder and the destruction of the civilian airliner.

In what would be one of the biggest environmental catastrophes of our time, the natural wonder could disappear within 50 years, the report by Bangor University, Southampton University and the University of London, revealed. If we don’t act on preventing the irreversible tipping point, many of us will watch the rainforest shift to a savannah-type ecosystem with a mix of trees and grass within the next 50 years, lead author Dr Simon Willcock of Bangor University’s School of Natural Sciences said. “Unfortunately, what our paper reveals is that humanity needs to prepare for changes far sooner than expected,” Dr Willcock said. “These rapid changes to the world’s largest and most iconic ecosystems would impact the benefits which they provide us with, including everything from food and materials to the oxygen and water we need for life.” The predicted tipping point of next year matches other research conducted into the forest’s health. Scientists and economists across the globe have expected the Amazon to reach a point of no return by 2021.  When this happens, the forest will stop producing enough rain to sustain itself, turning into barren grasslands and releasing billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Co-researcher Professor John Dearing, from Southampton University’s geography and environment department, said he was surprised by the alarming rate of decline. “We intuitively knew that big systems would collapse more slowly than small ones – due to the time it takes for impacts to diffuse across large distances,” Professor Dearing said. “But what was unexpected was the finding that big systems collapse much faster than you might expect – even the largest on Earth only taking possibly a few decades.” Endearingly referred to as ‘the Earth’s lungs’, the forest is home to 10 per cent of our biodiversity and has been a vital carbon sink, taking out around two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from the atmosphere. Now, the ecosystem is changing. In a sign of things to come, plants that prefer wet conditions are starting to die and those that prefer dry conditions, such as the Brazil nut tree, are thriving. The average temperature in the forest has risen by 1 to 1.5 degrees in the past century and the dry season has spread from four months to five. Soaring rates of deforestation, encouraged by Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro have seen around 20 per cent of the rainforest destroyed. This continues at an alarming rate of 51,799 square kilometres a year – almost double the size of Sydney. Last week, Brazilian congresswoman Joenia Wapichana called for international solidarity to save the Amazon and the Indigenous people who live there. Leading climate scientist Carlos Nobre, who predicted the Amazon would reach a tipping point if deforestation was to continue, has said to reverse the current trend, global carbon emissions and Amazon deforestation must be stopped, and an ambitious reforestation plan implemented immediately. “The only sensible way forward is to launch a major reforestation project especially in the southern and eastern Amazon, actions that could be part of Brazil’s implementing its commitments under the Paris agreement,” he wrote in an editorial for Science Advances in December. “The tipping point is here, it is now. “The peoples and leaders of the Amazon countries together have the power, the science, and the tools to avoid a continental-scale, indeed, a global environmental disaster. “Together, we need the will and imagination to tip the direction of change in favour of a sustainable Amazon.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Free, phone-based COVID-19 consultations to form part of $2.4 billion plan","date":"03-11-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/11\/free-phone-covid-19-consultations-plan\/","transcript":"Pregnant mums, over 70s and cancer patients will be offered “free” bulk-billed consultations over phone, video link or WhatsApp to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

It comes as the global death toll topped over 4000 by Wednesday morning and there was a significant rise in the number of confirmed virus cases in Australia. Six new cases had been recorded in New South Wales by Wednesday morning and another four in Victoria. Most of the people who have tested positive in the past two days had recently travelled overseas to Europe and the US. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the new plan to help Australians would assist vulnerable people who may be concerned they are exhibiting symptoms.

They are being billed as a “one-stop shop” for testing of people concerned they may be showing symptoms. The Morrison government said the aim of the clinics was to divert people with mild or moderate coronavirus symptoms away from hospital emergency departments and GP clinics and reduce the risk of the virus spreading. The clinics will be able to treat up to 75 patients a day over the six-month spike of new coronavirus cases. The government will also announce a $30 million national communication campaign to provide “timely, factual and consistent information is provided to prevent and mitigate the impacts of coronavirus”. “We’re ensuring our health system is well prepared and has the resources it needs for our fight against coronavirus,” Mr Morrison said. \"It's in its infancy and it's just starting to affect people (but we're) remaining calm, stepping through the protocol and the doctors have told us not to stress too much.\" https:\/\/t.co\/PaAAh5LeVw — AFL (@AFL) March 10, 2020 News of the first tranche of the novel coronavirus package came as the AFL revealed its games could soon be played in empty stadiums to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at mass gatherings.

He said the games would go on, even if the crowds were not attending. “If mass gatherings are suspended, then we’ll play games in stadiums with no crowds,” he said. “We’re also working on other protocols to protect not only players and staff but our members and supporters.” Across Australia, 106 people had contracted the coronavirus by 9pm on Tuesday. But the Morrison government remains under fire for not taking action to help casual workers. Attorney-General Christian Porter said on Tuesday casual workers are already paid extra in lieu of sick leave if forced to take two weeks of unpaid leave. “Many people would have already made provisions for that because of course the purpose of casual employment is that you’re paid extra in lieu of the types of entitlements,” Mr Porter said. “If it is the case that large numbers of people in particular industry sectors by virtue of the casual nature of their employment are having these types of problems and that is something we’re aware could happen, that is something that can be responded to, likely through the welfare system, but there might be other options. “We’re not going to jump to a solution in anticipation of a problem that is broad before that problem has arisen or we reasonably know that it will arise.” “Any response that does not stop casual workers from being financially penalised for doing the right thing, getting tested and isolating will totally fail,” Sally McManus#coronavirus #auspol #ausunions https:\/\/t.co\/8cjcap8Dde — Australian Unions (@unionsaustralia) March 10, 2020 Speaking after a meeting of unions, business leaders and government on Tuesday, ACTU secretary Sally McManus told The New Daily that the pressures on casual workers were immense and could lead to workers shunning testing for the virus. “Any response that does not stop casual workers from being financially penalised for doing the right thing, getting tested and isolating will totally fail,” Ms McManus said. “Many will avoid getting tested and will go to work sick and this will spread the virus, especially as they are working in industries such as healthcare, retail and hospitality.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Run out of toilet paper?

Disgraced Cardinal George Pell’s future could be decided by Australia’s highest court this week, but he won’t be there to see it. The full bench of the High Court will hear his legal team’s final bid for his freedom in Canberra on Wednesday. The 78-year-old was jailed for six years last year for sexually abusing two choirboys at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral, shortly after being appointed Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. He was convicted by a jury in 2018 of the rape of one 13-year-old choirboy and sexual assault of another. The first boy gave evidence against Pell while the second died in 2014. Pell maintains his innocence. Victoria’s Court of Appeal last year upheld the verdict in a 2-1 ruling. The High Court has not formally granted Pell’s application for appeal, instead referring it “for argument”. That means after the hearing, which is scheduled to continue on Thursday, the court refuses the application for special leave, or approves it and either allows or dismisses the appeal. Pell’s lawyers are arguing the appeal on two grounds. First they say the Court of Appeal majority – Chief Justice Ann Ferguson and President Chris Maxwell – made an error in Pell was required to prove the offending was “impossible” to raise reasonable doubt against the surviving boy’s evidence. The third judge, Justice Mark Weinberg, found in favour of Pell’s appeal. Second, they argue the majority found there was a reasonable doubt about the existence of any opportunity for Pell to have offended, so they made an error in concluding the guilty verdicts were not unreasonable. They want Pell’s convictions on five charges to be quashed. That would mean he is released from prison immediately. Last month it was revealed the High Court had also raised legal questions over the use of video evidence in Pell’s previous appeal, rather than relying on written transcripts alone. Victoria’s three most senior Court of Appeal judges watched the recorded evidence of 12 witnesses, including the complainant, visited St Patrick’s Cathedral and examined robes. While Pell has been in court for all his hearings so far, he will remain in Barwon Prison, near Geelong, this week. The proceedings also will not be live streamed, like his previous appeal was. That means he will have to rely on information being fed back through his lawyers. Viv Waller, who represents the surviving choirboy, said he understood appeals were part of the checks and balances within the criminal justice system. “Both my client and I are deeply respectful of that process,” she said in November. Lisa Flynn, who represents the father of the boy who died, said her client hoped the High Court would uphold Pell’s convictions. “This has been a very drawn-out process for him,” she said, adding that the man’s faith in the legal system would be lost if Pell was freed. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus cases hit 100 as schools and hospitals under pressure | The New Daily","date":"03-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/10\/coronavirus-cases-hit-100-schools-hospitals-pressure\/","transcript":"Health authorities have confirmed Australia has 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus lost as drastic quarantine measures are introduced in Europe. The latest escalation in the number of Australians testing positive comes as Italy takes the unprecedented move to introduce lockdown measures across the entire country. Australia’s chief health officer Professor Brendan Murphy told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon Sydney had “significantly the biggest part of our outbreak” in the country. “We have continued to have some cases that have come from contacts of imported cases, some continued cases imported from a range of countries, and some additional cases from the community transmission event that’s happened in northern Sydney,” he said. However, when asked whether Australia should follow Italy and have a complete shutdown of schools and universities and quarantine for 14 days, Professor Murphy said that decision would be made if there was more “sustained” community transmission. “If we had more sustained community transmission, then we wouldn’t hesitate to make recommendations about public gatherings, schools and the like. We only had that one issue of community transition in Ryde,” he said. Earlier, Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree on Monday local time restricting people to remain inside the areas where they live, restricting their movements in public spaces, restaurants and the transport system. He said there won’t just be a “red zone”, referring to the quarantine order he signed for a vast swath of northern Italy with a population of 16 million over the weekend. “There will be Italy” as a protected area, he said. The latest developments come the Australian government follows the US in advising its citizens to “reconsider” taking an overseas cruise as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread around the world. “Australians, particularly those with underlying health concerns should reconsider taking an overseas cruise at this time due to COVID-19,” the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said on its SmartTraveller website. “This is obviously a very significant development,” federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Tuesday. “It just reflects the uncertainty and the seriousness of the spread of the coronavirus.” Overnight, there have been another eight new infections in NSW as parents and teachers from two schools wait to find out whether students can return on Wednesday. Another 600 tested awaiting results. In Victoria, the state’s coronavirus help hotlines crashed due to an influx of calls. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters on Tuesday up to 20,000 around the country had contacted the hotline for advice. The state’s dedicated COVID-19 phone line and the Nurse-On-Call Hotline have crumbled under the pressure “experiencing system issues due to extraordinary call volumes”. “We thank the community for their patience as we work to increase the capacity of the hotlines – including putting on additional staff,” Ambulance Victoria said on Tuesday. While the phone lines crashed, one Melbourne doctor resorted to seeing patients in their cars. Former Australian Medical Association president Mukesh Haikerwal puts on a moon suit, mask and shoe covers before meeting patients outside his Altona North clinic. After calling ahead, patients drive to the car park and remain in their vehicles before Dr Haikerwal comes out to take a swab while protected from transmitting the disease. “They park outside the building and we go out one entrance that is okay to go out of to do the swabs, collect the swabs and they can go off and self-isolate until their result comes back,” Dr Haikerwal told 3AW radio on Tuesday. “We go to our flu area and clean up all of our dirty garb… We are clean, they are clean. And nobody is contaminating the waiting area of rest of the practice, so it is clean.” The makeshift car park clinic is the first of many expected to open in the coming weeks at car parks and open spaces, near medical practices across Melbourne. The federal government has flagged funding the drive-through COVID-19 testing sites at up to 10 Victorian medical clinics, Australian Medical Association Victorian president Julian Rait told 3AW on Tuesday. A teacher who tested positive for the virus sent elite private school, Carey Baptist Grammar School, in Melbourne’s east into shutdown. The school closed to staff and students on Tuesday, initially over fears of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 before testing positive overnight. The teacher was in direct contact with someone who has coronavirus, and the school is working with the health department to map the potential spread of infection. A Melbourne Assessment Prison inmate is in isolation after being in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, but no other prisons have been affected, Corrections Victoria said.

The advice comes as the government also weighs its response to Italy’s decision to declare a country-wide travel ban on 60 million residents after more than 7000 people were infected and 366 died from the infection. “This is obviously a very significant development,” federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Tuesday. “It just reflects the uncertainty and the seriousness of the spread of the coronavirus.” Also on Tuesday (Australian time), Californian authorities finally allowed a cruise ship with 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus on board to dock. The Grand Princess had been idling off the coast of California for four days as authorities worked out how to get passengers ashore without spreading the potentially deadly virus. Four Australians are among more than 2000 passengers and crew aboard the ship. Sick passengers and crew will be taken to hospitals, while those who do not require immediate care will go into quarantine. Italy declared its travel ban more than a month ahead of the busy Easter holiday season, when millions of international and domestic tourists usually flock to Rome and other major cities such as Venice and Florence. The federal government continues to advise travellers to Italy to “exercise a high degree of caution” and cautions they will be subject to health screening upon their return. Meanwhile, temporary school closures are likely to become the norm across Australia as the nation also tries to batten down the hatches. Three schools in NSW and Victoria were shut on Tuesday after students tested positive to COVID-19. “School closures, I think, will become the norm as we go ahead. But we are doing everything we can to keep our children safe,” federal Education Minister Dan Tehan told Nine’s Today program. The Minister was asked why schools were being closed for a day or two, while people with or suspected of having the virus are being told to self-isolate for two weeks. “The schools have been closed for a day so they can be thoroughly cleaned,” he said. “That is the best medical advice that we’re being given at the moment. Now, if that changes and it says that schools need to close for longer, then schools will close for longer.” The schools closed on Tuesday include Carey Baptist Grammar School in the eastern Melbourne suburb of Kew, St Patrick’s Marist College in Dundas in western Sydney and Willoughby Girls High School on Sydney’s north shore. Two year 10 students from St Patrick’s Marist College and a year 7 pupil from Willoughby Girls High School were on Monday confirmed to have COVID-19. The fathers of the St Patrick’s students and the mother of the Willoughby student had previously tested positive for the virus. Carey Baptist Grammar has been shut after a teacher developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Another Sydney School, Epping Boys High, reopened on Monday after closing on Friday after a year 11 boy tested positive. Across the country, more than 80 people have been confirmed as having the virus. More than half of the cases are in NSW. Three elderly people have died so far in Australia. Across the world, there have been more than 110,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and more than 3817 deaths in 105 countries. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Former Victorian science teacher jailed for 15yrs for abuse | The New Daily","date":"03-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/03\/10\/former-victorian-teacher-jailed-abuse\/","transcript":"A former Victorian teacher who preyed on students, plied them with alcohol and molested them in the 1980s has been jailed for 15 years.

His crimes against his victims were “manipulative and cruel” and left the men he abused feeling ashamed and guilty for what happened to them, Victorian County Court Judge Gabriele Cannon said on Tuesday. “The only person who should feel ashamed is you, Mr Myers,” she told the pedophile.

Mr Trump abruptly left a White House press briefing on Monday (local time) without taking questions about his own health. Vice-President Mike Pence said shortly after he did not know if the President had been tested for the coronavirus, but said he would try to find out. One of the three is Florida House representative Matt Gaetz, who flew to Maryland on Air Force One with Mr Trump on Monday. Mr Gaetz apparently learned shortly after the plane was airborne that he had been in contact with a person at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland in late February who since has been diagnosed with coronavirus. He announced he was entering self-quarantine about an hour after he got off the plane. Fellow representative Doug Collins also had contact with Mr Trump – shaking his hand at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday. Both men said they had no symptoms but would remain at home for 14 days. On Sunday, senator Ted Cruz and representative Paul Gosar placed themselves in quarantine after coming in contact with the same person at CPAC. It comes as US political leaders grapple with a public health and economic maelstrom as fears about the coronavirus outbreak escalate. The White House said it was “conducting business as usual”, and Mr Trump sought to project calm as the epidemic poses one of the greatest tests yet to his administration. Trump officials said they had the matter in hand, and claimed political opponents were rooting for an economic collapse. The President shook hands with supporters on Monday when he arrived to headline a fundraiser in Florida for his re-election campaign. He ignored shouted questions about the plunging stock market as he boarded Air Force One for the flight back to Washington. In Monday morning tweets, he lashed out at the steep market drop and news that large public gatherings were being called off because of the virus. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths,” he tweeted, comparing it to seasonal influenza and the thousands of deaths that causes. “Think about that!” At the Pentagon, officials have begun “social distancing” measures. On Monday, defence secretary Mark Esper’s regular meeting with senior staff, which would normally be held face-to-face in a single room with 40 to 50 participants, was broken up into three rooms, with video-teleconferencing among the rooms. Mr Trump is delegating much of the virus response to Mr Pence, who convened a video teleconference with US governors to give an update on the federal government’s response. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Probe launched into photo of Police Minister shooting submachine gun","date":"03-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/03\/10\/david-elliott-submachine-gun\/","transcript":"Police are looking into whether NSW Police Minister David Elliott broke the law, after a photo surfaced of him firing a submachine gun at a rifle range for prison officers. It was one of a series of pictures posted on Mr Elliott’s official Facebook page in September 2018 to mark the opening of the range at the John Morony Correctional Centre near Windsor in Sydney’s north-west. The Opposition says Mr Elliott, who was corrections minister at the time, should be stood down over the allegations. In one picture, Mr Elliott is holding the fully automatic weapon and firing at a target, while in another he is taking aim with a pistol. The matter is now the subject of a police inquiry to determine whether the Firearms Act has been breached. Submachine guns are illegal in NSW, except for use by the Army and some police and corrections officers. Those without a specific licence are required to sign a series of forms prior to firing the weapon at a shooting range. It is understood the police probe into Mr Elliott’s actions will centre on whether the documentation was completed. The Minister’s office initially would not comment on the matter, instead referring the ABC to Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW). However, in a statement Mr Elliott said he fired the weapons “under the strict supervision of the range master”. Labor MP Lynda Voltz questioned what Mr Elliot was doing on a rifle range if he did not know the laws around firearms. “He’s the Minister for Police. He can’t just come along and say, ‘Well, you know, despite having been in the army, despite being Minister for Police, I didn’t know what I was doing.’ “[He was] up in the Parliament just last week amending the firearms act. “I don’t know what it takes to get this minister with a long list of indiscretions stood aside, but the Premier should stand him down.” Corrective Services NSW has issued an apology to the Minister for “any embarrassment caused” at the weapons range as well as any suggestion he had done something wrong. “At all times … the former minister was acting on the advice of Corrective Services and under the direction of a qualified weapons instructor,” a spokeswoman said. “As a result of media inquiries, Corrective Services has referred its actions at the range to the NSW Police Firearms Registry to ascertain if an administrative error has occurred.” In a statement, NSW Police said the Minister contacted Police Commissioner Michael Fuller on Sunday in relation to “concerns over the conduct of the shooting range”. “The matter will now be referred to an appropriate command in order that further inquiries can be conducted,” the spokesperson said. The rifle range is designed to provide specialised firearm training for prison officers. The now Police and Emergency Services Minister is likely to face a grilling on Tuesday as he is scheduled to face a budget estimates hearing. “Minister Elliott has very serious questions to answer,” Greens MP David Shoebridge said. “We have tough firearms laws in this state providing hefty criminal penalties if you are holding or operating a firearm without an appropriate licence and I’d invite him to put on the record if he held such a licence.” Mr Shoebridge said it also showed a lack of judgment from a minister in charge of law and order. “You’d have to wonder what is going through the mind of a senior minister … to go and pick up a lethal weapon like this without checking if they had a lawful capacity to do that,” Mr Shoebridge said. Mr Elliott was already expected to face some uncomfortable questions at the budget estimates hearing over his decision to leave the country on a European holiday when bushfires were blazing across the state. His refusal to cancel his trip came less than a week after the furore over the Prime Minister’s Hawaiian holiday. Ultimately, Mr Elliott decided to cut his holiday short. The Minister has also been the subject of a NSW Police review after a 17-year-old P-plater alleged Mr Elliott grabbed his arm and chased him through the streets after a minor car crash last October. Mr Elliott denied the allegations and the review found “no further police action” could be taken. “I acted in good faith under the assumption that CSNSW had complied with all of its administrative requirements according to the Firearms Act,” the statement said. Mr Elliott said he was told that he “and potentially hundreds of individuals” who had used the range were potentially in breach of the act. “Given the safety and security of firearms is of the utmost importance to me, I immediately asked the Police Commissioner to investigate the operation of the CSNSW firing range to ensure they comply with the relevant legislation governing the use of firearms within their training establishments.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Qantas slashes passenger capacity by nearly a quarter","date":"03-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/10\/qantas-flights-cut-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Qantas is slashing seats on international flights and pay to its top executives as it reels from the demand hit from the global coronavirus outbreak. Chief executive Alan Joyce will take no salary for the remainder of the financial year, while his peers will accept similar reductions and board chairman Richard Goyder will not get fees. Qantas’s executives will also take 30 per cent pay cuts and board members will have their fees reduced by 30 per cent. On Tuesday morning, Mr Joyce said while redundancies were a last resort, the changes meant about 2000 jobs were surplus to requirements. He said the company was pulling “every lever that we can to make sure that the group gets through this environment”. “This will be a survival of the fittest,” he said. The airline had the capability to expand and grow, if the marketed responded. But it expected “long tail and a slow recovery”. “If it gets worse, we can always bring forward the retirements of aircraft like the 747. We can bring forward the grounding of more of the A380s. We have grounded 10 of the 12 aircraft,” Mr Joyce said. “We could do that if it gets worse. If it gets better, our intention is to put those aircraft back in the air. And we think this will rebound.” The cuts come on top of reductions already confirmed – and are the equivalent of grounding 38 Qantas and Jetstar planes in Australia and internationally. Qantas announced other cuts less than a week ago, with flights to Tokyo, Sapporo, Osaka, Hong Kong and Auckland most affected. “Further changes are expected,” it said at the time. With Tuesday’s reductions, the total international capacity of Qantas and its budget arm Jetstar will be cut by 23 per cent on the same time in 2019. The reductions will apply until mid-September 2020. Mr Joyce said Tuesday’s move was in response to a sharp drop in international bookings in the past fortnight as the COVID-19 outbreak worsened. “We expect lower demand to continue for the next several months, so rather than taking a piecemeal approach we’re cutting capacity out to mid-September,” he said. Worldwide, there have been more than 110,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 3801 deaths. Early on Tuesday (Asutralian time), Italy – which has Europe’s worst outbreak – took the unusual step of locking down the entire country to try to halt the spread of the infection. Qantas’s biggest cutbacks remain focussed on Asia (now down 31 per cent compared with the same period in 2019). China remains the country worst hit by the virus, even though it is now spreading more rapidly in other countries. There are also further cuts to capacity on flights to the US (down 19 per cent), Britain (down 17 per cent) and Trans-Tasman (down 10 per cent) – which the airline said was in line with forward booking trends. Many of the reductions will come through the use of smaller planes and reduced flight frequency, rather than quitting routes altogether. Qantas said eight of its largest aircraft, Airbus A380s, will be grounded until mid-September. Two are already grounded for maintenance and upgrades, while only two will remain in active use. Jetstar will also make significant cuts on its international network. It will suspend flights to Bangkok and cut flights from Australia to Vietnam and Japan by almost half. Jetstar’s daily Gold Coast to Seoul flight was suspended last week. Both airlines will also cut domestic capacity by 5 per cent until mid-September. Rival Virgin Australia also cut domestic and international capacity in February, citing the hit to its bottom line from the coronavirus. Air New Zealand has also cut capacity on its Asian, Trans-Tasman and domestic networks. On Monday, it said it would officially withdraw its full-year earnings guidance issued on February 24, “due to increased uncertainty surrounding the duration and scale of the COVID-19 outbreak”."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘For the good of Italy’: Lockdown extended to entire country | The New Daily","date":"03-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/10\/coronavirus-italy-lockdown-country\/","transcript":"Italy has taken an unprecedented move amid the growing coronavirus crisis and introduced lockdown measures across the whole country.

World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed Italy’s tough measures, noting that just four countries – China, South Korea, Italy and Iran – accounted for 93 per cent of cases worldwide. “Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,” he told a news conference. Mr Conte ordered people should stay at home unless they have solid reasons related to work, health or other special needs. “Our habits must change, must change now, we must all give up something for the good of Italy,” Mr Conte said. Commuting to work will still be allowed but school and university closures have been extended until April 3. The measures will come into effect on Tuesday morning local time. The government also adopted a decree to stop all sporting activities, including Serie A football matches. There have been 9172 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy and 463 people have died. Italy registered 1807 more confirmed cases as of Monday evening. With those numbers, Italy again overtook South Korea as the country with the most cases outside China. The premier also took to task young people in much of Italy who have been gathering at night to drink and have a good time during the public health emergency that started on February 21. “This night life…we can’t allow this anymore,” Mr Conte said. Under the weekend decree that applied to regions in the north, pubs, restaurants and cafes are now required to close at dusk. The mandatory early hours will affect all of a locked-down Italy.

In laying out their case against the accused – three Russians and a Ukrainian – Dutch prosecutors argued that although the men did not push the button to fire the missile that destroyed the passenger jet, they played a coordinating role in the disaster. “They were in command of others,” Netherlands prosecutor Ward Ferdinandusse said of Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Leonid Kharchenko. It’s alleged the former rebel fighters had directed the missile launcher to the launch location and spoke about the need for it to “serve their cause”, even questioning whether it had “done its job”. “They noted with delight that an aircraft has been shot down, they directed others in the delivery of the system to the launch site and they organised the removal of the Buk-TELAR (missile) to the Russian Federation,” Mr Ferdinandusse said. He said the accused should face a criminal trial because they were not regular military personnel fighting for a state at the time. The trial follows a half-decade long fight for justice by families of the 298 passengers and crew who were killed in 2014. Earlier, Prosecutor Dedy Woei-A-Tsoi made a solemn roll call of the names of all 298 people killed, including 38 from Australia. District Judge Henrik Steenhuis adjourned the court briefly afterwards so families and friends of victims could gather their composure. “The heavy silence in this room when the names were being read out … makes abundantly clear that everyone sitting here was lost in their thoughts,” Dutch District Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said. Australian Federal Police commander Jennifer Hurst said the roll call had been incredibly moving. “You could have almost heard a pin drop in that room … that gives a real indication of the significant and absolute atrocity that happened on that day,” she said outside court. Australian Angela Nagel, whose husband died in the MH17 plane disaster fought back tears as she explained how important the trial is to her. “It’s still a daily tragedy for those family and friends involved that we’ve had no justice, that we’re still in this terrible grief – that’s why it’s really important today.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Harry and Meghan out with William, Kate before day one as semi-royals","date":"03-10-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/royal\/2020\/03\/10\/harry-meghan-william-kate-goodbye\/","transcript":"There were smiles and waves – well, from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, at least – as the royal family reunited at London’s Westminster Abbey for the last public event together before the official start of the historic “Megxit”. The Commonwealth Service on Tuesday morning (Australian time) marked the first time the younger couple has been seen with the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and Kate Middleton since their January crisis talks when the family worked out a plan for Harry and Meghan to ‘step back’ from senior royal life. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were hand in hand and beaming from the moment they stepped out of their car before walking into the abbey to the sounds of a cheering crowd and bagpipes. Meghan waved to William and Kate, who were in the row in front. The couple then chatted and laughed with Prince Edward, who was sitting next to them. While photos and video released of the Cambridges from inside the service showed them looking noticeably stiff, they did share photographs of the proceedings on social media – including close-up shots of the Sussexes performing official duties.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined The Queen and Members of @TheRoyalFamily for the annual #CommonwealthDay Service at Westminster Abbey. The Commonwealth represents a global network of 54 countries working in collaboration towards shared economic, environmental, social and democratic goals — the Commonwealth theme for 2020 is Delivering A Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming. Her Majesty The Queen was 26 years old when she became Head of the Commonwealth in 1952 — important symbolic and unifying role. As Head, Her Majesty personally reinforces the links by which the Commonwealth joins people together from around the world. From working to protect the earth's natural resources and preserving the planet for generations to come, to championing fair trade and empowering the youth of today to transform the communities of tomorrow, this year’s Service celebrated the Commonwealth's continued commitment to delivering a peaceful, prosperous and more sustainable future for all. #CommonwealthDelivers A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Mar 9, 2020 at 10:46am PDT  Taking to their Sussex Royal Instagram account shortly after the service, Harry and Meghan made no mention of the personal significance of the event, and did not upload photos of other members of the family, choosing instead to focus on the Commonwealth’s role in promoting peace and prosperity. They said that as president and vice-president of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust they had been “passionate advocates” of the Commonwealth and had spent “many years” working closely with “the next generation” of leaders.  This afternoon, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex attended the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on Commonwealth Day, alongside Her Majesty The Queen and Members of The Royal Family. The Commonwealth is a global network of 54 countries, working in collaboration towards shared economic, environmental, social and democratic goals, and the Service today seeks to highlight the vast community which spans every geographical region, religion and culture, embracing diversity amongst its population of 2.4 billion people, of which 60 percent are under 30 years old. As President and Vice-President of the @Queens_Commonwealth_Trust, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been passionate advocates of the Commonwealth having spent many years working closely with the next generation of Commonwealth leaders. The theme of the Commonwealth for 2020 is ‘Delivering A Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming', placing emphasis on youth, the environment, trade, governance, and ICT (Information and Communications Technology) and innovation.

From the end of March, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex hope to carve out a “progressive new role” as they live a more quiet life while protecting baby son Archie from the eyes of the British media. In a description of the new arrangements, published on the couple’s website, the royals said: “The Royal Family respect and understand the wish of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to live a more independent life as a family, by removing the supposed ‘public interest’ justification for media intrusion into their lives. They remain a valued part of Her Majesty’s family”. Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, will stop using their HRH titles – His or Her Royal Highness – and will not use “royal” in their branding. Harry will remain a prince but will relinquish his military titles. As the grandson of the Queen and second son of Prince Charles, Harry will remain the sixth in line to the throne and the order of precedence does not change. Their announcement two months ago that they wished to step back from some of their royal duties sent shock waves through the monarchy. It led to a crisis meeting involving the 93-year-old Queen, her heir Charles, William and Harry. It was concluded Harry and Meghan would have to give up all their royal duties. The couple have spent most of their time since in Canada, but returned at the start of the month for a farewell round of engagements. Harry and Meghan’s baby son Archie has remained behind in Canada. Monday’s event to mark Commonwealth Day is their last official royal appearance and comes less than two years since they married in a dazzling ceremony of pomp and pageantry watched by millions worldwide. There is no certainty about when the family will next be seen together. “Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations without public funding. Sadly that wasn’t possible,” Harry said in January. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Treasurer calls for calm as government prepares to announce major stimulus package | The New Daily","date":"03-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/09\/josh-frydenberg-asx-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Fears over the COVID-19 coronavirus have now spread to the Australian stockmarket, where $136.5 billion has been wiped off the value of shares. There are predictions Australian shares are on track for their worst day since the Global Financial Crisis as the stockmarket tumbles. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who is preparing to announce a major economic stimulus package this week, has called for calm. But falling oil prices could deliver good news for motorists at home, with the Morrison government instructing the consumer watchdog to ensure that falls in the wholesale price are passed on to consumers. “Australia is well prepared, economically, and we go into this challenge from a position of strength,” Mr Frydenberg said. “This is a very different situation to what we saw through the GFC, which was essentially, a problem with the banking and the financial system and issues of liquidity. We haven’t seen those same problems in relation to this health crisis.” However, Mr Frydenberg said there was no doubt the economic impact was very significant. “We’ve seen disruptions to international supply chains,” he said. “We’ve seen a hit on particular sectors, including the tourism sector, agriculture sector, seafood sector and education sector. We’ve already seen the Reserve Bank adjust interest rates downwards and the major banks pass those rate cuts on in full.” Qantas has already announced it will cut more international flights to Asia as it grapples with falling demand for travel to Tokyo, Hong Kong and Auckland, New Zealand. Mr Frydenberg urged investors to remain calm and said the big banks were working together to cushion the impact. “I was on a call with the International Monetary Fund just the other day. And on that call were Central Bank governors from China, from the United States, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England. Everyone is equally concerned. We’re seeing this in the global economy,” he said. “But this is very different to the GFC, and so the response needs to be very different. And our response is both on the supply and the demand side.” Mr Frydenberg is preparing to announce a major economic stimulus package that is likely to wipe out or delay Australia’s promised surplus. There are calls to offer wage subsidies and extend Newstart payments to casual workers forced self isolate. The Treasurer said he will have more to say on that front in coming days. “I’m very conscious that Australians in employment, be it casual or permanent, will be concerned about their job security. This is obviously an issue that will be raised at tomorrow’s meeting between the Minister for Industrial Relations and the peak employee and employer groups. Our focus is on getting a cooperative workplace,” he said. “Our focus is ensuring that businesses are flexible, given the stresses and the strains that we will see as a result of the spread of the coronavirus.” There are now more than 80 known infections in Australia and three people have died. New South Wales is at 40, Queensland has 15, Victoria 12, South Australia seven, WA has four and two in Tasmania.

Mr Chapman was asked whether it was possible he had mistaken the boy – in the back seat of a white Toyota Landcruiser that went by his home – for the grandson of a neighbour who also owned a Spider-Man suit. “I’m sure it was William Tyrrell that was in the vehicle,” he told the NSW Coroners Court. “He just had his hands up on the window and was looking. His face wasn’t pressed against the glass but he was very close to the glass. “He didn’t seem distressed or upset. Whether he knew the person I don’t know.” The Toyota was followed by a “light blue” and “fairly large” sedan, he said. “I wouldn’t know what make of vehicle but a six-cylinder because he really had his foot down when he cut the corner,” Mr Chapman said. “He had almost two wheels on the grass, he had cut the corner that much that had there been another vehicle (coming the other way) they would have had a head-on collision.” Mr Chapman said he didn’t know William at the time but recognised him after seeing a TV news report about the boy’s disappearance. He stated he was “the worst in the world” at telling the makes of cars but later saw a Toyota Landcruiser while stopped at roadworks. The inquest continues. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Incredible mother’: Final farewell for Hannah Clarke and her children | The New Daily","date":"03-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/09\/hannah-clarke-funeral-brisbane\/","transcript":"Hannah Clarke and her three children will be laid to rest in a single shared white coffin adorned with pink flowers after being farewelled in an emotional service at a Brisbane church. Hundreds of mourners, including prime minister Scott Morrison, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll, senior police officers, firefighters and paramedics congregated inside the church to pay their respects to the family. As her parents Lloyd and Suzanne Clarke grieved, it was her brother Nat Clarke who was among five speakers. He called his sister “one of the greatest mums to walk this Earth”. “With brown hair and brown eyes, after you were born, Dad heard Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison on the radio on the way home and forever this would be his song for you,” he said. He described his nieces and nephew as beautiful children who reflected their mum. “Aaliyah, you were everything a big sister should be, brave, strong and quite bossy,” Mr Clarke said. “Laianah, you were the ratbag, the little middle. There was so much of Hannah in you. You were beautiful, sweet and caring with an amazing imagination. You were the sweetest kid and a beautiful mermaid. “Trey, mother’s little man and her best surprise.” With their photos on display, the funeral for Ms Clark, 31, and her children Laianah, 6, Aaliyah, 4 and Trey, 3, was held three weeks after her estranged husband Rowan Baxter doused his family in petrol and set them alight on February 19. A vigil on February 24 was attended by thousands where a mass of flowers and children’s toys were laid. Friends and family spoke about a “nation in mourning” amid an outpouring of grief and anger over the failure of the nation’s domestic violence system which was supposed to be designed to protect families. Monday’s one-hour service, which began at 10.30am, was streamed live with mourners crowding an adjoining cafe as crowds spilled from the church. Bookmarks were handed out to the congregation with a declaration on social media Hannah herself had made in the days before her death. “I am a survivor and not a victim. I am in control of my life and there is nothing I can’t achieve. My girls will grow up strong women who understand their worth.” Family friend Fiona Cunningham began the ceremony, saying it was a time to “celebrate Hannah and her children’s lives and honour their memory”. “Today we’re navigating the grief of losing this family under horrific circumstances,” Ms Cunningham said. “It’s their deaths that have bought us together, but it’s their lives we’re here to remember. “This is an occasion for sorrow but may the occasion not be wasted trying to make sense of why we are here but rather may it be one where we are thankful for the gift of life and that our lives intersected theirs.” Hannah’s childhood friend Nikki Brooks said Hannah was “one in a million, kind and selfless … She was completely infectious”. “You had my back and without a shadow of doubt I would have laid down my life for you and I am so, so sorry I could not protect you. “You leave a legacy of love and there will never be a day I will not think of you.”  The domestic violence incident that killed Ms Clarke and her family shocked the nation and sparked more calls for greater efforts to bring an end to such violence. Hannah was on fire as she leapt from the driver’s seat screaming “he’s poured petrol on me” as people rushed to try to put out the flames. She died in hospital hours later with burns to 97 per cent of her body. Her children, safely strapped into their child restraints, never stood a chance. Rowan Baxter died on the footpath from self-inflicted wounds. Hannah’s family have asked that the details and location of the family’s funeral service not be released. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14 -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Paris shooting outside mosque leaves one person critical | The New Daily","date":"03-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/09\/paris-shooting-mosque\/","transcript":"A man is reportedly in a critical condition in a Paris hospital after being shot at a mosque in Paris.

Police said the male rider was killed after his horse was hit by a car on 13th Beach Road at Connewarre near Barwon Heads about 6.45am on Monday. Police said the rider, believed to be in his early 30’s, died at the scene on the Bellarine Peninsula while the horse suffered minor injuries. In a statement, Racing Victoria said: “The rider, who was employed by the Danny O’Brien stable, is believed to have been struck by a car whilst riding their horse”. “The unraced horse was transported from the scene and remains under veterinary supervision.” Racing Victoria has set up counselling for Mr O’Brien and his staff. “RV extends its sincere condolences to the family and friends of the track rider, some of whom are yet to be notified,” their statement reads. “RV asks that the privacy of Mr O’Brien and his staff be respected at this tragic time.” The ABC reported a spokesman for the stable said they were “devastated”. According to the Danny O’Brien Racing website, the 13th Beach Training Facility is a 64 hectare private training complex with sand and turf tracks and is located two kilometres from 13th Beach and “is specifically-zoned a horse beach”. The driver of the car also suffered minor injuries. Worksafe is attending the scene and police will prepare a report for the Coroner. The latest fatality in Victoria over the Labour Day long weekend comes after two men and a woman were killed on Sunday when a tree fell on to their car in the Dandenong Ranges at Kallista, east of Melbourne.

The 82-year-old man lived at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Sydney’s north where a 95-year-old woman also succumbed to the virus after coming into contact with an infected aged care nurse. With 76 people in Australia testing positive for the virus so far, and 500 cases still under investigation in NSW alone, authorities have expressed alarm at people defying advice to self-isolate while sick or awaiting test results. A student in Tasmania, who traveled from Nepal stopping in Singapore and Sydney and tested positive to coronavirus, ignored quarantine and went to two nightspots and to work at the Grand Chancellor Hotel at Constitution Dock on Hobart’s waterfront. The man, aged in his 20s, worked as a food and beverage attendant on seven shifts at the hotel’s restaurant, went to Cargo restaurant and O Bar between 10pm and 2am on March 6 and spent brief periods in between on Parliament Lawns near Salamanca Place. A Perth woman aged in her 70s, who traveled from Cuba via London, went to a concert at the Perth Concert Hall on Saturday night and later tested positive. She has now been isolated in her home. There are fears younger and healthier people who do not experience dramatic symptoms could spread the virus in public which could lead to more deaths of the vulnerable. It comes as Italy ordered a virtual lockdown across much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic attempt to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak. The unprecedented restrictions, which aim to limit gatherings and curb movement, will impact some 16 million people and stay in force until April 3. The new measures say people should not enter or leave Lombardy, Italy’s richest region, as well as 14 provinces in four other regions, including the cities of Venice, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini. “We are facing a national emergency. We chose from the beginning to take the line of truth and transparency and now we’re moving with lucidity and courage, with firmness and determination,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday (local time). Nearly 110,000 people worldwide have become infected and another 3799 people have died from the virus, the latest data shows. Authorities are considering tougher measures to prevent people flouting self-quarantine after the recent cases emerged over the weekend. A Melbourne GP, the father of singer Missy Higgins, was publicly shamed by the Victorian Health minister for attending work and treating 70 patients while he was unwell. Victorian Health minister Jenny Mikakos did not bow to pressure to apologise to Dr Higgins who slammed the MP for calling him out even though he had followed the government’s guidelines. Ms Mikakos instead urged everyone to play their part. “All of us have a responsibility to do what we can to prevent the spread of this virus.” The Australian Medical Association urged politicians to step back and let chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy be the main voice of the country’s response to avoid confusion. “I think leadership from the chief medical officer is essential at this time and obviously he can direct and influence the decisions made by the chief health offices in respective states,” Victorian AMA president Julian Rait told a press conference. “We ask the government to respect the leadership we have and withdraw and not insert themselves into these debates and discussions without adequate knowledge.” Victoria’s latest confirmed case is a woman aged in her 50s who arrived from Indonesia last Monday and visited Pho Hung Vuong 2 Vietnamese Restaurant in Richmond on Friday. She is now in self-isolation. In NSW, a Sydney hospital is contacting patients after a man in his 70s who went to the emergency department of St Vincent’s was diagnosed with the coronavirus. The hospital is getting in touch with patients who may have come into contact with him, the health department said in a statement on Sunday night. “The source of his infection is under investigation as he has had no recent overseas travel,” NSW Health said. Dr Higgins, his patients and staff at The Toorak Clinic in Melbourne are now self-isolating, along with two patients he visited at Malvern’s Mecwacare nursing home. One of two Australian Defence Force members who contracted COVID-19 had flown to a meeting at Defence Headquarters in Canberra before returning a positive test result. Four Australians remain trapped on board the Grand Princess cruise ship, which was heading from Hawaii to San Francisco but had to dock off the coast of California to undergo quarantine. The captain has told the more than 3500 passengers that the ship is headed to the port of Oakland. There are serious concerns COVID-19 could trigger an economic recession in 20 countries. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) this week slashed its forecast for global growth for this year to 2.4 per cent from 2.9 per cent. It warned that Japan and the 19 European countries that share the euro currency are in danger of recession. Italy may already be there. Capital Economics expects the Chinese economy to shrink two per cent in the January-March quarter and to grow as little as two per cent for the year. That would be a disastrous and humiliating comedown for an economy that delivered a sizzling nine per cent average annual growth rate from 2000 through last year. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Four men to stand trial for MH17 plane downing | The New Daily","date":"03-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/09\/mh17-trial-starts\/","transcript":"The trial of four men charged with murder over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 is set to begin in the Netherlands. Russians Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko have been charged with murder and destroying a civilian airliner for their alleged roles in furnishing the missile launcher used to fire on the passenger plane on July 17, 2014. The trial, which could run for up to 25 weeks, will begin before three judges at the Schiphol Justice Complex on Monday. The families of the 298 victims, including the 38 Australian citizens and residents who were on board, have been waiting nearly six years for detailed information about what happened to their loved ones. Netherlands Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor Digna van Boetzelaer says the trial is an important step towards finding truth and accountability. “The duration of the investigation has put a heavy burden on the families and friends of the MH17 victims,” she said in a statement on Sunday. “I am especially relieved for them that the judicial process will now commence. “The Public Prosecution Service is ready.” Dutch Public Prosecutions Service liaison officer Alwin Dam has been helping families, including Australians, prepare for a harrowing week of opening statements and possible evidence. “They will be constantly confronted with the horrible event in the coming period. That is hard for them,” he told Dutch broadcaster NPO 1. Mr Dam said families and friends will be allowed to give victim impact statements, claim compensation and tell the court what they think appropriate punishments should be. Some lawyers believe it could take the court four to five years to deliver a verdict. “People want a very severe punishment and we understand that, of course,” Mr Dam said. None of the accused will be present in court, but Pulatov will be represented by three lawyers. His participation stands in contrast to the Russian government’s steadfast rejection of the investigation and the trial. On the eve of proceedings, Russia’s ambassador to Australia Dr Alexey Pavlovsky claimed that the Australian Federal Police had “heavily tampered” with key photographic evidence and tried to withhold evidence from the public. The AFP denied his claim. Mr Van Boetzelaer said the international Joint Investigation Team, which includes Australia, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Ukraine and Belgium, is still hunting those who pulled the trigger on the missile. It’s understood the JIT is getting closer, with new photographs of the missile being fired set to be presented in court as evidence. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Sixteen million in lockdown as Italy imposes quarantine of northern region","date":"03-09-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/09\/coronavirus-italy-lockdown\/","transcript":"Italy has ordered a virtual lockdown across much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic new attempt to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

The new measures say people should not enter or leave Lombardy, Italy’s richest region, as well as 14 provinces in four other regions, including the cities of Venice, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini. Only people with proven, work-related reasons, or health problems will be able to move in and out of the exclusion zones. Leave has been cancelled for health workers. “We are facing a national emergency. We chose from the beginning to take the line of truth and transparency and now we’re moving with lucidity and courage, with firmness and determination,” Mr Conte said. “We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed,” he told a news conference. The number of coronavirus cases in the country jumped 25 per cent in a 24-hour period to 7375, while deaths climbed 57 per cent to 366 deaths. It was the largest daily increase for both readings since the contagion came to light on February 21. Head of the Lombardy regional crisis response unit Antonio Pesenti told the Corriere della Sera newspaper the health system in Lombardy was “a step away from collapse”. “We’re now being forced to set up intensive care treatment in corridors, in operating theatres, in recovery rooms. We’ve emptied entire hospital sections to make space for seriously sick people,” he said. The Milan stock exchange, whose all-share index has plunged 17 per cent since the crisis broke, was scheduled to open normally on Monday but one trader said he expected “a violent sell-off” as markets digested the lockdown of Italy’s economic heartland. The World Health Organisation said it fully supported the actions taken by Italy, which were in line with its guidelines for containing the spread of the virus. But with the Italian economy already on the edge of recession, some local politicians pushed back against the measures, which leaked out before the regions were consulted. Veneto head Luca Zaia complained he had not been properly consulted and was unhappy that three provinces in his region, including Venice, had been included in the clampdown. “We do not understand the rationale of a measure that appears scientifically disproportionate to the epidemiological trend,” he wrote on Facebook. On Saturday, health officials had expressed alarm at the apparent lack of concern in the general public, as fine weekend weather attracted large crowds to the ski slopes outside Milan.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison is finalising the economic package this week, after flying to Brisbane on Monday for the funeral of mother of three Hannah Clarke, who was murdered by her estranged husband. The budget razor gang will meet to sign off on the measures, which are believed to be worth up to $10 billion. But an announcement could be delayed until later in that week. It will likely wipe out the projected surplus, unless revenue predictions increase or further savings measures are found. It could include wage subsidies for industries hit hard by the virus and casual workers. But Social Services Minister Anne Ruston warned any permanent increase to Newstart or dole payments was a “separate conversation” to the coronavirus economic response. “As the Prime Minister has clearly said, the stimulus package he is looking to deliver to the Australian people is around a short-term, measured and proportionate response,” Senator Ruston said. “Any long-term structural changes to anything we’re doing will be subject to a separate conversation.” Labor’s health spokesman Chris Bowen said on Sunday that increasing Newstart should be considered particularly to help casual workers. “We would support any sensible steps here to support casual workers,” Mr Bowen said on Sunday. .@Bowenchris tells @David_Speers Labor would support an increase to Newstart as part of a coronavirus stimulus package #insiders #auspol pic.twitter.com\/vTo4bJed21 — Insiders ABC (@InsidersABC) March 7, 2020 One option on the agenda is an increase to the deeming rate, which determines how quickly retirees lose access to the full or part pension. The deeming rate described how much interest the government expects or ‘deems’ pensioners to be earning despite the fact that the reality is they may be getting much less. Interest rate cuts have sharpened the urgency on delivering a better deal for pensioners. “I suppose it’s a tool that we give people to make their life easier when they’re on pension or payment and they’re receiving income from their financial assets,” Senator Ruston said. “So whilst, as a secondary effect, I’m sure that any extra money in the pockets of any Australians is going to provide a stimulus, that’s not the underlying reason why we change deeming rates.” National Seniors chief advocate Ian Henschke said when it comes to the government’s deeming rates “enough is enough”. “We’re calling for immediate action to lower deeming rates,” Mr Henschke said. “The top rate needs to be lower by at least 1.5 per cent and the lower by 0.5 per cent. “As the cash rate has dropped, the higher deeming rate of 3 per cent on savings over $51,800 is now double the typical return on a term deposit.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Fake coronavirus health advice debunked: Don't fall for these ‘health tips’","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/08\/coronavirus-fake-health-advice\/","transcript":"As the coronavirus death toll rises around the world, so too has the number of misleading and potentially deadly health tips. So far, more than 3500 people have died and 105,000 people have been infected around the world. As of 11.30am on Sunday, Australia had 74 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including three deaths. There is still a lot of information that we don’t know yet about the deadly virus, and with a vaccine at least a year away, people are understandably worried. During this time of uncertainty and fear, it is easy to panic and take any advice you believe will protect yourself and your family – even if that means stockpiling enormous amounts of toilet paper. But not every bit of advice should taken as gospel. Self-proclaimed medical experts and conspiracy theorists have used the crisis as an opportunity to spread misinformation and add to the confusion. Some of their unscientific advice is bizarre and simply ineffective, while other so-called ‘health tips’ can be more dangerous than the virus itself. Here’s what they’re saying, and why you shouldn’t believe them. Eating garlic is generally good for you, but there is no evidence to suggest it will stave off the virus. In extreme cases, people have taken the ancient remedy way too far. One woman in the eastern province of Zhejiang, China, ate so much garlic that her throat became inflamed and she had to go to hospital, the South China Morning Post reported. Doctors found she ate about 1.5 kilograms of raw garlic – around 16 bulbs – over two weeks. Whatever you do, do not drink this. A group of conspiracy theorists, including outspoken anti-vaxxer and popular YouTuber Jordan Sather, have claimed that drinking Miracle Mineral Supplement, known as ‘miracle’ solution, can “wipe out” the coronavirus. Would you look at that. Not only is chlorine dioxide (aka “MMS”) an effective cancer cell killer, it can wipe out coronavirus too. No wonder YouTube has been censoring basically every single video where I discuss it over the last year. Big Pharma wants you ignorant. https:\/\/t.co\/7cqmyUxcXY — Jordan Sather (@Jordan_Sather_) January 23, 2020 Many of them have claimed it can cure autism, HIV and cancer, too. But what they aren’t telling you is that this so-called ‘miracle’ solution contains chlorine dioxide – a bleaching agent. Drinking it can kill you and it will not stop you from contracting the coronavirus. Instead, you will probably feel very nauseous, vomit and get diarrhoea. There is no evidence to suggest that clearing out your sinuses or gargling mouthwash is going to protect you from the virus. All it will do is give you a clear nasal passage and fresh breath. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body can be harmful to your eyes and mouth, warns the World Health Organisation. The only time when alcohol and chlorine can be useful is when they are being used to disinfect surfaces, such as wiping down your kitchen bench. In one unusual case, a woman in the south-eastern province of Anhui sprayed so much alcohol on her clothes that when she went to the kitchen to check on a meal she was cooking a few minutes later, it caused an explosion that left her with serious burns on her face and hands, reported the Guangzhou Daily. A Facebook post – shared numerous times – quotes a “Japanese doctor” who recommends drinking water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus that might have entered the mouth. Doctors say there is no evidence this flushing will help, even though drinking water and staying hydrated is generally good medical advice. Airborne viruses enter the body via the respiratory tract when we breathe, and while some might go into our mouth, constantly drinking water will not prevent the virus taking hold.  As hand sanitiser gels fly off supermarket shelves around the world, some DIY recipes have popped up on the internet. Some have suggested making sanitiser from vodka, but it won’t work. Vodka only contains about 40 per cent alcohol, while most sanitisers have an alcohol concentration of between 60 and 95 per cent. Besides, a lot of these home-made disinfectant solutions are better suited for cleaning surfaces, not for use on skin. That’s because professionally made alcohol-based hand gels usually contain emollients to make them feel softer on your hands. If your supermarket has run out of hand sanitiser, just wash your hands with water and soap instead. If you want to use hand sanitiser, make sure your hands are clean first. There is no point rubbing hand gel onto dirty hands. US televangelist Jim Bakker’s show has promoted drinking of colloidal silver – tiny particles of the precious metal suspended in liquid. A guest who appeared on the show claimed the solution can kill some strains of coronavirus within 12 hours. He did, however, admit the liquid hadn’t been tested on COVID-19. The potential ‘cure’ has been widely shared on Facebook, particularly by members of “medical freedom” groups who are deeply suspicious of mainstream medical advice. Proponents of colloidal silver claim it can treat a range of medical conditions, aid the immune system and act as an antiseptic. US health authorities, however, say there is no evidence colloidal silver is effective for any health condition, and in fact could cause serious side effects including kidney damage, seizures and even turn your skin blue."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Supermarkets tighten toilet paper rules again as charges laid over melee","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/08\/coronavirus-toilet-paper-limits\/","transcript":"Violent clashes over toilet paper in Australian supermarkets due to coronavirus fears has prompted supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths to announce even tighter purchase limits. On Sunday, Coles announced shoppers would be further restricted to buying only one pack of toilet paper per transaction, both in store and online. It comes just days after the retailer introduced a four-pack-per-transaction rule on Thursday morning. “Unfortunately many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery,” a Coles spokeswoman said. “We have therefore made the decision to change the limit to one pack per customer so that toilet rolls are available for more of our customers, particularly the elderly and people who are unable to purchase in large volumes. “Our suppliers have increased production and we are making additional deliveries to stores, while our team members work hard to restock shelves in stores.” Woolworths followed suit shortly after and tightened up its initial limit of four packs per transaction down to two packs. The latest crackdown on bulk-buying comes after two women were charged with affray following a fight over toilet paper at a Sydney supermarket.

Footage of the incident showed a group of women pushing, yelling and fighting over a jumbo packet of toilet paper amid panic buying caused by the coronavirus. One woman yells, “I just want one packet” to a mother and daughter as they try to wheel away a trolley packed with toilet paper. The sudden surge in doomsday preppers is largely due to fears of contracting the coronavirus and not having enough supply to last a period of self-quarantine. Anger is growing towards those who have bought an excessive amount of toilet paper, as well as non-perishable food items like canned beans, because it’s forcing low-income earners to go without. Aldi and Costco introduced limits of four packs of toilet paper on Thursday last week. Hand sanitiser has also been flying off supermarket shelves. Woolworths announced it will keep hand sanitiser stocks behind the customer services counter and bring in a two-pack limit. “… If we see new shortages, we may introduce other limits,” CEO Brad Banducci said in a letter to customers. “We’ll only do this if we think it’s absolutely necessary.” Woolworths has also slapped a limit for bulk rice buys to just one 2kg bag per customer."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Michael Pascoe: Morrison isn’t trying to prevent a recession","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/08\/michael-pascoe-morrison-recession\/","transcript":"I almost feel sorry for Josh Frydenberg. A second-rate Treasurer before the COVID-19 crisis, he is now facing a challenge that could beat the very best. But you can’t feel sorry for someone who has already given up, who represents a government that has signalled it won’t try to stop Australia suffering a recession, that is prepared to watch unemployment rise, people lose their savings, and businesses go broke because of an ideological\/political obsession. Or maybe it’s because this government’s leaders are not very bright. Based on everything the government has said, indicated and leaked so far, maybe they just can’t grasp the extent of the challenge and are being overwhelmed by the unfolding problem. Maybe their vision can’t extend beyond rorting government grants programs for their own political advantage. Some quick key points: When the government is promising to do as little as possible economically and a large majority of the population has little faith in the government’s promises, there’s no chance of building confidence in the government’s management of the crisis’ fallout. No confidence means greater public caution, less willingness to spend, and more to save. What the government and much of the commentary so far doesn’t get is that our economy is facing both a supply shock and a demand shock. That’s what makes a rescue package especially difficult. A sudden large demand shock is difficult to handle when the desire to spend is weak, but Australia’s GFC performance showed how it can be successfully fought. A sudden large supply shock is more difficult as the problem becomes the inability to obtain stuff to buy and sell, the stuff required for manufacturing, building and domestic consumption. Dr Andrew Charlton was Kevin Rudd’s senior economic adviser when the GFC hit and Australia’s senior representative at the subsequent G20 Leaders Summits during the GFC. He has written that a 2008-style “cash splash” won’t save us from a supply shock. But even the esteemed Dr Charlton seems to miss the crucial point: It looks like we’re facing both. To explain the double-whammy, consider for a moment a common (and uninformed) criticism of our GFC defence, the claim that people who received the $900 cheques “wasted it” by buying flat-screen TVs and drinks at the pub and putting it through the pokies. They didn’t waste it. They did what they were meant to do – spend it to keep the economy ticking over when fear of the recession sweeping the rest of the world was in danger of creating one here. Retail was Australia’s biggest single employer at the time. If the tills had stopped ringing, unemployment would have shot quickly higher with the danger of snowballing once that crucial confidence factor was damaged. Hospitality – the people pouring the drinks, cooking the meals, washing the glasses and servicing the poker machines – is particularly prey to marginal employment. Jobs can be quickly and easily lost. The feared supply shock is that there won’t be flat-screen TVs available for sale if punters want to buy them, or parts available here for our manufacturers and builders. The simultaneous demand shock comes from the next stage of the coronavirus’ spread – when people avoid crowds, cancel conferences and parties and sporting events and stop going to the pub. You don’t know who’s been pushing that pokie’s buttons. It’s hard to stimulate spending in pubs and clubs and shopping malls if people won’t visit them. And, for the umpteenth time, consumption was already weak, January retail sales miserable. We’re already seeing the start of the demand shock from the dive in foreign tourism. It’s not just the loss of tourists from the three (so far) specifically banned countries – trips are being cancelled and postponed right around the world to and from everywhere. The #ScottyfromMarketing promise of extra advertising dollars for Australian tourism to counteract the bad international bushfire publicity comes to nothing when people stop getting on planes. Dr Kennedy’s wan effort in Senate estimates included the expectation that COVID-19 would knock “at least” 0.5 per cent off March quarter GDP growth, but: “This preliminary estimate takes into account the direct impacts on tourism, international education exports and some exchange rate effects. It does not include supply chain disruptions or other potential broader impacts.” The immediate “direct” tourism impact estimates the value of the foreign tourists no longer coming. The direct impacts spread to the indirect very quickly. Sure, the number of foreign tourists visiting our restaurants plunges quickly, but, indirectly, the tour bus operator suddenly without shifts tightens his belt and doesn’t visit his local restaurant either. The loss of inbound tourists is obvious, the crash in outbound tourism less so. Anecdotally, bookings for Australians to travel overseas are down more than 30 per cent and falling fast. Airlines are rapidly cancelling flights. Air crew only paid when they’re flying will have less money to spend, so won’t. Flight Centre has advised its staff that it’s a good time for them to take holidays, long service leave, leave without pay, or perhaps try a four-day week. A little over a week ago, the company advised the stockmarket it expected its pre-tax profit to be down by between $50 million and $60 million in the current half year. My guess is that it will be fortunate if it’s only down by that much. It’s bemusing to be on cruise ship companies’ mailing lists, watching the special offers and discounts become steadily more generous, or desperate, depending on which way you look at it. Some of the loss of foreign travel will be recouped by domestic holidaying, but only some and not so much if\/when we move to the next phase of avoiding crowds. The Insurance Council of Australia cancelled its annual forum that was to be held this week. That’s the ICA, which has lots of actuaries who take what scientists say seriously, be it on climate change or coronavirus. That’s just one conference that no longer will provide all those casual shifts for staff at the dinner and drinks sessions, no coffee cart during conference breaks, hotel food orders cancelled, and cancelled accommodation. And never mind the Tokyo Olympics, our local sporting events are under threat. The Irish rugby team is meant to tour in July. We’re either going to be allowed or want to cram into stadiums in winter when virus transmissions of all sorts peak? All the workers on casual terms in those stadiums on match days – no game, no pay, no spend. So far, the copious speculation has been about the loss of income for people self-isolating, the nearly one-in-three Australians who don’t have access to sick pay. How long does it go on for? Nobody knows. I was asked to speak at a conference in October with international speakers. It has been cancelled. Dr Kennedy was only game to speculate very cautiously and conservatively about the March quarter, the one that’s nearly over, and even then he wouldn’t try a figure for the supply shock side. Whatever the potency of the disease, the domestic economic crisis hasn’t begun to get serious yet. If COVID-19 has taken “at least” 0.5 per cent off March quarter GDP growth, it’s a reasonable bet it will take the same off the June quarter. And then there’s minus 0.2 per cent for the bushfire effect. Remember our economy only grew by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter and was actually weaker than that soft figure appears. So if COVID-19 is knocking at least 1 per cent point off our already-soft GDP growth in the six months to June 30 and quite possibly depress our economy for longer than that, is the government considering stimulus of the order of 1 per cent of GDP – about $20 billion? No. Nothing like that, from all indications. The government will not try to avoid a recession. Like Mr Morrison’s bushfires effort, it looks like it’s going to be too little, too late. Worryingly, the government is still trying to fool itself about the pre-virus economy. Dr Kennedy told the senators our 2019 economic growth was “a solid result given headwinds from the weaker global economy in 2019”. That’s a Coalition talking point and nonsense – the global headwinds didn’t blow here while we enjoyed record trade figures. The Treasury secretary also said: “Household disposable income growth is being supported by the personal income tax cuts, ongoing labour market strength, a pick up in real wage growth, and supportive monetary policy settings.” Note that he used the present tense in that statement. He should have used the past tense regarding income tax cuts and labour market strength and – to put it kindly – he apparently has absolutely no idea at all about wages growth. More Coalition talking points. Of course, we don’t yet know what stimulus Josh Frydenberg will announce later this week. We could be pleasantly surprised, but a few days out, there has been no reason to think so. How good is Josh Frydenberg? We’ll find out this week."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"On This Day: The Barbie doll hit toy shelves for the first time","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/08\/on-this-day-barbie\/","transcript":"On this day in 1959, the Barbie doll went on sale for the first time and transformed the global toy industry. Created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, the long-legged fashion doll stood out because it looked completely different from other children’s dolls at the time. During the 1950s, most children’s toys were made to look like babies and many Americans had never seen a doll with an adult body before. The idea of creating an adult-bodied doll struck Ms Handler as she watched her daughter Barbara – after which Barbie was named – give her dolls adult roles as she played with them. She suggested the idea to her husband, co-owner of Mattel toy company, but he didn’t like it, nor did Mattel’s directors. Still, Ms Handler didn’t let it go. During a trip to Europe in 1956, Ms Handler stumbled across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli who looked just like what she had in mind. Bild Lilli was depicted as a blonde bombshell and successful career woman who got what she wanted without asking men for permission. After returning to the United States, Ms Handler redesigned the doll and gave it a new name. Donning a zebra-patterned ’50s swimsuit, the doll made its debut at the American International Toy Fair in New York. Since then, Mattel has sold more than a billion Barbie dolls, easily making it the company’s largest and most profitable line. But despite Barbie’s success, she has also copped heavy criticism. Some people have slammed the doll’s impossibly long legs, thin waist and big breasts for promoting an unhealthy body image for young girls. Although Barbie is sold as a range of different characters, such as Doctor Barbie, Astronaut Barbie and Sports Coach Barbie, her sexualised body – usually wearing tight pants or mini-skirts – has been blamed for making girls think more about their appearance than their career aspirations. On the other hand, the career-focused collectible has also been celebrated for encouraging women’s financial independence. Whatever side of the fence you sit on, for better or worse Barbie has become a cultural icon."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Six-year-old girl drowns in Kakadu National Park: NT Police","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/08\/girl-drowns-kakadu\/","transcript":"Northern Territory Police say a six-year-old girl has drowned in Kakadu National Park.

The paper, released on Sunday, calls for the phasing out of single-use plastic bags in NSW, as well as tripling the proportion of plastic recycled within 10 years and reducing plastic litter by a quarter. Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Sunday said the government would seek to legislate the bag ban by the end of the year and give business six months’ notice before the ban comes into effect. NSW is the only Australian state to not yet ban single-use plastic bags, while retail giants Coles and Woolworths have already banned the bags. The discussion paper will be open for public feedback for two months. “We always want to make sure people aren’t taken by surprise and have time to have their say and we’re looking forward to moving forward after the consultation period,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters. “We know other states have already done this but the difference with our paper is that it’s whole-of-government, whole-of-plastics.” Ms Berejiklian said the plastics review follows the government’s late-2017 enactment of a “return and earn” container deposit scheme. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"This is what Australia will lose after News Corp, Nine decided to close AAP","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/08\/aap-john-coomber-news-corp\/","transcript":"When I first walked through the doors of AAP’s old head office beside Sydney’s Wynyard station in July 1972, the first thing that struck me was the noise. In a spartan room with low ceiling, more than 100 teleprinters were going hammer and tong, receiving news from across the world, and sending foreign and domestic news across Australia, including to Antarctic bases, and even ships at sea. Each of them was driven by precisely-rolled coils of perforated paper tape – the fabled ticker tape once showered on parades in Wall Street. A few dozen men – there were no female journalists – sat at desks adding to the din by banging at typewriters and shouting into telephones. Others were editing reports on the war in Vietnam or the break-in at the Watergate building a few weeks earlier. AAP drew from the world’s news agencies, and at times had correspondents in London, New York, Jakarta, Port Moresby, Singapore, Suva, Saigon, Wellington, Los Angeles, Beijing. Plus every state and territory in Australia. Completed stories were propelled on a conveyor belt to teleprinter operators who converted them to tape and then it was on to newspapers via individual transmission In a dark corner of the office, generally in the dead of night, operators sent the Antarctic and “Shippress” bulletins by Morse code. I was 20 years old, fresh out of a cadetship at the Brisbane Telegraph, an afternoon newspaper long since gone the way it seems AAP is now to follow. That scene in Wynyard House sent a surge of excitement through me that I have never forgotten. Nor have I forgotten the words that Editor Lyall Rowe said that day. “Remember this, son: speed is essential, but accuracy is more important.” Those eight words were the mantra by which we all worked. And within them was the unspoken notion of integrity and independence. AAP’s foundation document stated that it was “devoted to the objective of supplying the Australian public with the most accurate and most searching information of all world activities without any tendency towards or opportunity for the exercise of political partisanship or bias”. While AAP is now owned by just four media groups – with Nine-Fairfax and News Corp each having 47.4 percent – no one shareholder has ever been allowed a majority. It is, and has always remained editorially independent. I worked there for 45 years – longer than any other journalist in its history – and throughout that time, including four years as a news editor and eight years as editor, I never once saw or knew of a journalist asked to write or withhold a story for commercial or political reasons. As I wrote in the book On The Wire to mark AAP’S 75th anniversary in 2010: “It is the purest form of journalism. We have no political axe to grind, nor advertisers to please. News value is paramount.” Until this week, the deep values of AAP have remained intact. Apparently they are now to be torn up, as are the work contracts of some of the finest journalists you have doubtless read, but never heard of. AAP journalists remain virtually anonymous; satisfaction comes from getting the job done, quietly, efficiently, reliably, speedily. News stories continue to be issued on the wire, 24 hours a day as they have been continuously for 85 years. They have often been plundered without attribution or appropriated in their entirety under someone else’s name. AAP reporters remain awake for all-night sittings of parliament, stay the distance in royal commissions, monitor dreary committee meetings for the nuggets that become major stories. Sports reporters toil away in long-deserted press boxes. They are there for every Sheffield Shield match, on every senior Australian cricket tour, at the Commonwealth Games badminton no-one else bothers to cover. AAP photographers cover multiple assignments in a day and produce Walkley Award-winning images. Subeditors volunteer to come in on days off when a really big story breaks because they know how busy it is. Newsrooms and journalists around the country rely on these people.They know AAP’s value, even if the bean-counters apparently do not. Nor, by and large, do the public. They don’t realise AAP’s hidden value, or how much of what they read or hear on the news is either wholly or partly AAP content, or informed by it. Many big names in Australian journalism cut at least some of their teeth at AAP. Names like Harry Gordon, Kerry O’Brien, Sally Neighbour, even Eddie McGuire, who as a teenager covered football matches as a stringer. Sydney Morning Herald editor Lisa Davies was an AAP cadet, as was News Corp columnist and TV wit Joe Hildebrand. How Australia is reported to the world is substantially shaped by the AAP service that provides the backbone for international news organisations based in this country. They don’t know that AAP’s London staff stayed doggedly at their posts as bombs fell around them during the Blitz. How can it possibly be that it has fallen prey to a public too apathetic to pay for news from reputable organisations? To a generation who get their news from Facebook or Google, apparently without wondering or caring who produced it in the first place, or indeed how reliable it is. AAP is one of the pitifully dwindling handful of national news agencies anywhere in the world not funded by or beholden to government. In his foreword to On The Wire, Rupert Murdoch wrote: “As an organisation that sits to one side in a fiercely competitive industry, AAP has a vital role in ensuring an accurate, independent and comprehensive coverage of daily news events across the country, providing a wide choice of content for the media, no matter where they are or what their market.” Soon that will cease to exist. If I can be permitted to stray from a lifetime habit of straight news reporting, our nation will be very much the poorer for it. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Hobart pub worker ignored 'COVID-19 positive' quarantine order","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/08\/hobart-worker-ignored-quarantine-order\/","transcript":"A young man in Hobart who has tested positive to coronavirus ignored health advice to self-isolate and worked at a major hotel in the city. The student, aged in his 20s, arrived in Hobart on February 26 after travelling from Nepal and Singapore and suffered cold-like symptoms in the days following his arrival. The revelation comes as the globe-girdling disease claimed its third Australian victim – an elderly man who appears to have caught the disease from an infected attendant at his Sydney nursing home. The Australian Defence Force has also been touched by coronavirus, with two members ordered into isolation after testing positive for coronavirus. One of the ADF members travelled to the ACT on February 28. ACT health authorities say the second case is unrelated to the Canberra meeting. Defence said on Sunday it was working to trace anyone who may have come into contact with the member who travelled to the ACT. The ACT government told anyone who was on flights QF1509 or VA651 on February 28 to contact local health services. The Hobart student was tested on Friday and advised to self-quarantine while awaiting results but didn’t comply and worked at Hobart’s Grand Chancellor Hotel. A test result returned a positive reading for coronavirus late on Saturday. Health authorities are working with the hotel to determine whether any of the man’s colleagues had “close contact” with him and require isolation. He also worked several shifts at the hotel last week and twice briefly attended the Australian Ideal College. “It is unacceptable to continue activities in public or attend work while waiting for the coronavirus virus test results,” state Public Health director Dr Mark Veitch said. The man is in isolation at the Royal Hobart Hospital in a “satisfactory” condition, the heath department says. He is second case of the virus in Tasmania, after a 40-year-old man tested positive in Launceston on Monday. Four members of his household and three friends have been quarantined for two weeks. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Arrests seen as proof Saudi prince will tolerate no critics, not even close relatives | The New Daily Family ties can't save arrested kin from Saudi prince's wrath","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/middle-east-news\/2020\/03\/08\/saudi-arrests-confirm-princes-crackdown-on-dissent\/","transcript":"The arrest of two senior Saudi princes is an indication that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is consolidating his power amid mild reforms that have infuriated elements of the ruling elite. Friday’s swoop on the king’s younger brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz, and the king’s nephew and former counterterrorism czar, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, came after comments and behaviour that provoked the leadership to action, according to Saudi sources. What makes the arrests so remarkable is that Prince Ahmed is known to be personally close King Salman, with one source describing the monarch’s brother as “beloved”. That such a prominent member of the royal court should find himself behind bars is being taken as a signal that no critic of the regime, not even a lofty member of the royal household, is exempt from feeling the Crown Prince’s wrath. It is also seen as confirmation that King Salman is firmly behind Crown Prince Mohammed, event to the extent of supporting action against his closest relative. The source said the arrests were a message to all those in the royal family feeling disenfranchised to stop grumbling and toe the line, saying that if Prince Ahmed can be arrested, any prince can and will be. Prince Ahmed, 78, has long held unfavourable views of the 34-year-old Crown Prince and was one of just a few senior princes to abstain from pledging allegiance to him when the young royal sidelined more senior princes to become first in line to the throne. He recently told protesters who were accosting him in London to ask the king and his son about the humanitarian disaster sparked by the war in Yemen. Prince Ahmed also grumbled about the decision to close Islam’s holiest site in Mecca to stymie the spread of coronavirus, according to one of the people familiar with the arrests. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 60, is well-liked by US intelligence officials for his counterterrorism cooperation in past years against al-Qaida. As head of the interior ministry, he oversaw the long arm of the government that both prosecuted and closely monitored and jailed dissidents and critics of the kingdom. The Wall Street Journal first reported the arrests, quoting unidentified sources allied with the royal court as saying the princes were plotting a palace coup that would halt the rise of the crown prince. The Journal has since reported that the sweep broadened to include dozens of Interior Ministry officials, senior army officers and others suspected of supporting a coup attempt. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus claims its third Australian victim | The New Daily COVID-19 claims its third Australian victim","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/08\/coronavirus-claims-its-third-australian-victim\/","transcript":"A NSW man in his 80s has died after contracting coronavirus in his Sydney aged care home, taking the nationwide death toll to three.

The fate of flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Repeated searches for the aircraft were called off in 2018. Holding star-shaped signs reading “Never give up”, “Waiting” and “Resume the search”, the relatives of those who were on the flight marked the sixth anniversary of their disappearance by making a fresh appeal for answers. “The pain is still the same, the fact that the plane is still missing is still the same, and the fact that we don’t know what happened to the plane is still the same, ” said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother was on the flight, during the event in Malaysia’s administrative capital, Putrajaya. “There are more questions than there are answers and that shouldn’t be the case after six years,” she told reporters after the event. A piece of aircraft debris, believed to be from the missing plane, was on display at the gathering. Malaysia, China and Australia ended a two-year, $200 million underwater search in the southern Indian Ocean in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane. In 2018, Malaysia contracted US firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search on a “no-cure, no-fee”-basis, meaning it would pay the firm up to $US70 million ($105 million) if it found the plane. But the 138-day search was also fruitless. “We depend a lot on the government to take some initiative. We want the government to come forward and say that they are open to companies coming to search,” Nathan said, calling for the government to engage Ocean Infinity again. Last month, the Transport Ministry said it had not received any new credible evidence to initiate a new search following a report that a fresh effort to find the plane could be mounted. Meanwhile, Najib Razak, who was prime minister when MH370 disappeared, said he hoped the new government would restart search efforts. “We spent a lot of money looking for the plane… But unfortunately, we couldn’t locate it,” Mr Najib told Reuters during an interview on Wednesday. “There is no finality to what actually happened,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Missy Higgins' dad demands apology for minister's \"cheap shot\" over coronavirus","date":"03-08-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/03\/08\/coronavirus-missy-higgins-dad\/","transcript":"Furious doctors have slammed the Victorian health minister for taking a “cheap shot” at Missy Higgins’ father after he tested positive for coronavirus. Dr Chris Higgins treated up to 70 patients before he underwent a virus test, which Minister Jenny Mikakos told media had left her “flabbergasted” given his symptoms. “I’m absolutely flabbergasted that a doctor who has experienced flu-like symptoms has presented to work,” Ms Mikakos said on Saturday. “I understand it was very mild symptoms – perhaps he didn’t make the potential link – but we’ve now got 70 patients that have been contacted, so it is incredibly important that all healthcare workers take this matter very seriously.” The Melbourne GP took to social media to seek an apology and blast the “inaccuracies and unfairness” of the minister’s public comments which triggered a flood of support from GPs who accused Ms Mikakos of being out of touch with the frontline situation. Dr Higgins’ so-called “naming and shaming” sparked a wave of reaction from outraged medical workers who warned that the health system would be paralysed if doctors closed their clinics if they had mild symptoms. “As the doctor concerned, I have been upset about the inaccuracies and unfairness of your comments,” Dr Higgins wrote on a post on Ms Mikakos’ Facebook page. “I had a mild cold when I returned from the USA last Saturday morning which had almost resolved itself by Monday morning, hence my decision to return to work. “I hesitated to do a swab because I did not fulfil your criteria for testing but did one anyway on Thursday evening for sake of completeness, not imagining for one moment it would turn out to be positive. “I believe you have taken a cheap opportunity for political grandstanding and would appreciate an apology.”  Medical practitioners accused authorities of failing to support GPs who were at the frontline of the coronavirus outbreak but lacked protective equipment such as masks and were not getting transparent information. A number of doctors described the minimal number of medical grade masks per GP, warning that clinics were not ready and not resourced to handle the deadly virus sweeping the world. “To say that we are well resourced is a blatant lie,” posted Bianca Carroll, who said she was a GP. “We have FIVE P2 masks per doctor at our clinic. I am fully prepared for the fact that I will get coronavirus whilst performing my job. “As Doctors we understand these risks yet still we show up because that is the oath we took.” Wrote Jenny Neily: “I’m flabbergasted that you can say GPS are well resourced. Many don’t have any masks and those that do have a handful that will only last a couple of days worth of suspected cases. “The GP with COVID-19 who you threw under the bus did not even meet your department’s definition of quarantine or testing. “You obviously have no idea what effect an AHPRA investigation can have on a doctor. Now the rest of us feel like you’d be happy to throw us under the bus too if any of our patients happen to catch it from us.” Added Kate Green: “I’m a GP and we are NOT fully resourced. We got one box of masks provided for a practice of 12 doctors. This is abysmal. “I’m flabbergasted you think this and flabbergasted you’re happy to throw an experienced GP under the bus who did NOT fit the case definition or the risk criteria at the time.” Furious medicos called on the minister to publicly apologise, saying her comments showed she did not have an understanding of the situation for doctors in the community. “Minister Mikakos, do you have any idea what your words have done to General Practices across the country?” wrote Kylie Gibson. “Already many are now considering turning symptomatic patients away – despite not meeting the screening criteria – because they feel so vulnerable after your appalling treatment of this GP.” Dr Higgins, aged 70, is believed to have contracted COVID-19 in the US. He showed symptoms while returning to Melbourne via San Francisco on February 29. His patients, along with staff, are required to self-isolate while two patients he visited in Malvern’s Mecwacare nursing home are also in isolation. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said on Saturday an extra 260,000 masks would be immediately released from the federal stockpile to primary health networks. “We realised that personal protective equipment for our healthcare workforce and our aged care workforce is absolutely fundamental. We need to make sure that they are kept safe,” Professor Kelly said. Professor Kelly had a message for unwell people, especially workers: “Don’t soldier on.” Australia has more than 70 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with two deaths and 22 people who have recovered as of Saturday evening.

I looked up and the whole building collapsed. Dust was everywhere, and glass fragments were flying around,” a witness said in a video posted on the Miaopai streaming app. “I was so terrified that my hands and legs were shivering.” A hotel used to quarantine patients with #coronavirus has collapsed in the Chinese city of Quanzhou, trapping around 70 people.

She said they had been scheduled to leave soon after completing their 14 days of isolation. “I can’t contact them, they’re not answering their phones, she said. “I’m under quarantine too (at another hotel) and I’m very worried, I don’t know what to do. They were healthy, they took their temperatures every day, and the tests showed that everything was normal.” Quanzhou is a port city on the Taiwan Strait in the province of Fujian with a population of more than 8 million. The official People’s Daily said the hotel had opened in June 2018 with 80 rooms. Beijing News’ video stream was viewed by more than 2 million Weibo users on Saturday evening, and the hotel’s collapse was the top trending topic on the Weibo site, China’s close equivalent to Twitter. Some users demanded a investigation into how the hotel could have collapsed. The Fujian provincial government said that as of Friday, the province had 296 cases of coronavirus and 10,819 people had been placed under observation after being classified as suspected close contacts."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Toilet paper rage continues as shoppers battle for scarce stocks","date":"03-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/07\/coronavirus-toilet-paper-fight\/","transcript":"Two women have been charged with affray after a fight over toilet paper broke out at a Sydney supermarket. Police were called to the melee at a Woolworths in the Sydney suburb of Chullora on Saturday after reports a 49-year-old woman had been assaulted. Footage of the incident showed a group of women pushing, yelling and fighting over a jumbo packet of toilet paper amid panic buying caused by the coronavirus. One woman yells: “I just want one packet.” Another woman replies “No, not one packet”, before two supermarket workers intervene to break up the argument.

Woolworths, Coles and Aldi have all imposed limits on the sale of toilet paper after shelves were stripped by shoppers this week amid panic buying over the coronavirus. On Thursday, a man was reportedly tasered after a violent confrontation over toilet paper at a Tamworth shopping centre in regional NSW. The 50-year-old man was taken into custody after the alleged assault ,The Northern Daily Leader reportrd. Police were called to the Big W store in the shopping centre after reports a staff member and a customer had been assaulted by a man. The newspaper said the argument was over toilet rolls. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said the panic buying of toilet paper and cheap staples like beans was “inherently selfish”. “By buying a trolley load of toilet paper or 40 bags of oats, you’re stopping people who generally don’t have any. People who actually need it,” Ms King told The New Daily. Low-income earners such as pensioners or people on Newstart Allowance were being hit hard, she said. “These people manage their income really, really carefully, and now they’re turning up to grocery stores and finding things they need like toilet paper and oats are off the shelves,” Ms King said. There are special groups of people in our community who do not have the ability to shop on a regular basis, & when they do, they really need the essentials, like toilet paper to be available.

That’s more than half of the profit Phillip Island Chocolate factory usually makes each month, owner Kondanapanny Letchumanan said. “We are trying to tighten all expenditures as much as we can so we can survive,” he said, adding that they’ve been forking out money on television advertisements to entice more locals to visit their factory. But it’s not the only tourist attraction to suffer from the coronavirus outbreak, with Yarra Valley Chocolaterie & Ice Creamery reporting 800 fewer visitors every day. Meanwhile, John Boyce, who takes tourists on yachts around the Whitsunday Islands and outer Great Barrier Reef, has not had a single person enquire about his company’s expeditions in more than a month. During the same time period, tourist guide Michael Guo has been out of a job, with no idea when he’ll be receiving his next booking. Like other tourism industry workers in former hotspots across Australia, he’s feeling the coronavirus’ impact. “We’re suffering,” said Ian Pickworth, who runs wine tasting tours in Victoria’s Yarra Valley. With 75 per cent of his customers coming from countries such as China, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia, Mr Pickworth suspects his company, Winebus, won’t be making any profit for at least another two months. The World Health Organisation recently advised that all countries make containment their highest priority, but for Mr Pickworth’s business, “it’s not going to get any better”, he said. Yarra Valley Chocolaterie & Ice Creamery, which averages around 2000 visitors per day, has seen a “big drop” in customers. They’ve recorded 40 per cent (800) fewer people coming through their doors, owner Leanne Neeland said. With no end in sight to the COVID-19 outbreak, Ms Neeland “like all other business owners” are “very nervous about what is coming around the corner”. “Some casual staff have had half-shifts or 10 to 20 per cent of shifts dropped,” she said. Now is the time John Boyce should be securing bookings for tours around the Whitsundays and Great Barrier Reef but in the six weeks since the coronavirus outbreak, he hasn’t received a single booking. Normally, bookings are made at least four months or even a year in advance as passengers have to be on board for days. No new bookings could mean there will be very little need to take his yacht out in the next two to six months which is when he is planning to schedule the tours. “Being two or three bookings behind is a significant percentage because our operation is so specialised.” All Whitsunday Luxury Sailing’s current bookings were made before the coronavirus outbreak. Enquiries have since “dried up”, Mr Boyce said. “There hasn’t been an email asking about our expeditions for four to five weeks. Not one.” And he doesn’t blame them. “…Not knowing what the future was and not knowing what the insurance situation would be … I’d be delaying my decision significantly until I knew what was going on,” Mr Boyce said. “I wouldn’t want to be wasting my money.” Michael Guo runs his own tour company, showing Chinese tourists around popular Victorian attractions such as Sovereign Hill, the Great Ocean Road, Puffing Billy and Dandenong Ranges. He hasn’t been working since February 3 as the five tourist groups he was meant to show around during that month and in March and April all had to cancel after the China travel ban was enforced on February 1. Mr Guo considers himself lucky because he does not have money loans that need to be paid off unlike some of his friends in the industry who have mortgages and business loans they need to get on top of. “I don’t know when this situation will end,” he said. July and August is when schools in China will be on summer holidays so  Mr Guo is “praying” he’ll get some bookings for that time if “fingers crossed” COVID-19 is contained before then."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Grounds for caution: Starbucks bans reusable coffee mugs to limit virus spread | The New Daily Grounds for caution: Covid-19 prompts Starbucks to ban reusable mugs","date":"03-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/07\/coronavirus-starbucks-reusable-cups\/","transcript":"Coffee-chain giant Starbucks is turning away customers’ own coffee cups in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus within the United States. There’s no sign if the Australian arm of the company will follow suit – Starbucks’s Australian operation did not respond to The New Daily‘s request for comment, but it could be something other chains pick up, with a spokeswoman for The Coffee Club, Australia’s largest chain, saying the company had noted the policy change. The spokeswoman told The New Daily the safety of customers and staff was the business’s number one concern, and it had adjusted some cleanliness procedures as a prevention measure against the virus. “The Coffee Club will continue to offer “keep-cup” coffee refills and, as usual, these refills come with a 50c discount,” she said. Back in the US, Starbucks’ executive vice-president detailed the company’s move in a blog post, saying it fed into a countrywide plan to combat coronavirus. “Our focus remains on two key priorities: Caring for the health and wellbeing of our partners and customers and playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government leaders as they work to contain the virus,” Rossann Williams wrote.

Mr Frydenberg reiterated the impact on the global economy from covid-19 will be significant and Australia is not immune to it. “There will be a comprehensive suite of measures that are designed to provide a significant boost to the Australian economy to help businesses stay in business and Australians stay in jobs,” he said in Melbourne on Saturday. AMP capital chief economist Shane Oliver is forecasting an economic contraction in both the March and June quarters, which would mark Australia’s first recession since the early 1990s. He expects an initial stimulus of $3-5 billion but he believes there will be a need to increase it to around $20 billion by the time of the May budget to include a boost for households. “So for now, much of the pressure remains on the (Reserve Bank),” Dr Oliver said. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese agrees there is an urgent need for a  stimulatory package, having visited retail businesses in Hurstville, Sydney, on Saturday. “We’ve heard firsthand today of declines in activity at some of these restaurants, furniture shops and other businesses of between 50 and 80 per cent,” he said. “The fact is this economy was tanking well before the bushfires and the coronavirus. The economy needed support much earlier.” Michael Croker, tax leader at Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, expects the package will include direct subsidies for affected businesses, as well as some deferred taxes. “We’re hoping for an investment allowance which will encourage not just small business, but big businesses which have got deeper pockets, to go out there and spend, and hopefully spend that money on small business suppliers,” he told Sky News. Liberal backbencher Andrew Laming also hinted the government was preparing a COVID-19 awareness campaign to try and stem panic buying. “I am anticipating a very large nationwide awareness campaign with useful information about how to conduct oneself prior to a pandemic being declared and during,” Dr Laming told ABC television on Saturday. World financial markets continue to be rocked by the spread of COVID-19 and the risk it poses to economic growth, with confirmed cases now exceeding 100,000 globally. Confirmed cases in Australia have topped 70. The Australian share market looks set for a fall of around 1.5 per cent on Monday after Wall Street indices dropped between one and 1.9 per cent on Friday. The US S&P 500 finished 1.7 per cent down, having tumbled as much as four per cent in early trading, following on from sharp falls in Europe and Asia. Global rating agency Moody’s Investors Service says it now seems certain that even if the virus is contained, the outbreak will dampen global economic activity well into the June quarter of this year. The Treasury estimates the virus will cut at least 0.5 percentage points from growth in the March quarter, on top of the 0.2 percentage drag from this summer’s devastating bushfires. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Saudi princes arrested for 'plotting coup' against king","date":"03-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/07\/saudi-princes-arrested-for-plotting-coup\/","transcript":"Three senior members of the Saudi royal family have reportedly been arrested, accused of plotting a coup. Saudi officials have detained three members of the royal family for allegedly plotting to oust King Salman and the son he has designated to succeed him, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal said guards from the royal court detained one of the king’s brothers, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al Saud, one of his nephews, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and a royal cousin, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef. The men were arrested at their homes and charged with treason, it said. Guards arrived at the homes of the royals wearing masks and dressed in black, and searched their homes, according to the report. Mohammed bin Nayef, a once powerful figure as head of Saudi counter-terrorism efforts, had been crown prince until 2017, when King Salman took away the title and put his son first in line for the throne of the longtime US ally. The crown prince, who is in charge of day-to-day governance in the kingdom, has been praised in the West for implementing social reforms, but he also has drawn intense criticism for a tough crackdown on Saudis perceived as critics of his policies.

At a news conference in Phoenix, Arizona on Friday (local time), Mr Sanders criticised Mr Biden for having opposed the rights of gay people to serve in the US military and for voting against federal funding for abortions, stances the former vice president has since rejected. “I was there on the right side of history, and my friend Joe Biden was not,” Mr Sanders said The American people are sick and tired of endless wars in the Middle East which have cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.

But where do these predictions come from, and how likely are they? Around the world, including in Australia, pandemic forecasters are working frantically to predict how COVID-19 will play out. Here’s what they can and can’t tell us, so far. Researchers’ understanding of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has exploded since it first emerged as a mystery illness in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. We now have a better idea of how it spreads and who’s most at risk, and new research about the virus is being published almost daily. But there’s still so much we don’t know. James McCaw, a University of Melbourne epidemiologist who is part of the team producing models of the potential pandemic for the Australian Government, says models are only as good as the information you can put into them. At the moment, the lack of knowledge about the new coronavirus makes it very hard to nail down exactly what an outbreak in Australia will look like. Two factors affect how a virus spreads: its generation time (the time between when one person becomes infected and when they infect someone else) and its reproduction number or R0, (loosely, the average number of people an infected person goes on to infect). These influence what the most effective control measures might be, but researchers are still unpicking how these two factors work together in the COVID-19 outbreak. “With the early epidemic data, it still remains compatible with a long generation time and a high R0, or a short generation time and low R0. And they influence how effective a control measure might be,” Professor McCaw said. “We’re doing work on it, but we still can’t make any of those really crisp predictions.” This means at this stage Professor McCaw can’t put figures on numbers of people who are likely to be infected, become seriously ill or die from the disease. But even though the numbers are spongy at the moment, what we do know can still help us prepare. Past pandemics and the emerging information about this specific virus all inform the plausible scenarios people like Professor McCaw are producing. He says, based on the increase in cases in New South Wales and elsewhere, it seems we’re on the verge of sustained transmission — that is, when a virus is spreading throughout the community. “Our models would suggest that if we are unable to definitively contain COVID-19 in Australia and the world, it will peak in the next two to four months,” he said. How we react to an outbreak here affects when that peak of cases would come, and how high it is. The worst-case scenario modelled by Professor McCaw and his colleagues has a very high peak of cases — meaning a large number of people would all be sick at the same time. “[That scenario is] highly unrealistic because it’s the idea that we don’t change our behaviour, we don’t have any control response strategies. And of course, we will. And they should make a significant difference to how this disease spreads.” Actions like introducing social distancing measures when the disease starts spreading in Australia will actually prolong the epidemic. While this seems counterintuitive, it makes for a better outcome overall. “It will extend the amount of time in which there is transmission activity within the population, but the overall magnitude of and burden on the health system will be far reduced. By slowing it down, the burden at any point in time will be lower and we will save lives. “Fewer people overall [will get infected], and for those who are ill, however many that is, a lower burden on the health system will allow for better care for those people.” The Government’s emergency response plan, which was put into effect last week, flags cancelling large events, closing childcare centres and locking down aged care homes as potential actions. Professor McCaw said these large-scale, centralised control efforts do make a difference in the models. But some of the most dramatic differences come from small actions people can take in their everyday lives: hand washing, practicing cough etiquette, staying away from others if you become sick. “I’m always concerned that people will think that once it’s going, there’s nothing you can do about it, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,” he said. “What the modelling says is that if everyone can make small changes to their daily routines, washing hands, not shaking hands, and being aware of when you might come into contact with infectious people, or if you were infectious, how you might reduce your level of transmission onwards … [that] can result in huge public health benefits.” If the number of people searching online for a topic is anything to go by, one of the questions on many people’s minds at the moment is “how long will a pandemic last?” Again, this isn’t something we can put a number or a date on yet. But Professor McCaw’s models hold some clues. He said it was likely COVID-19 would become a permanent, seasonal disease in humans after this initial epidemic. “Just as for [2009 swine flu], the virus will cause a large initial epidemic, perhaps followed by subsequent waves of infection, and then reduce to low levels,” he said. “But it is unlikely to truly disappear, just like seasonal influenza doesn’t truly disappear each year. “This is different to SARS — which we truly eliminated because we successfully controlled it before it could fully establish itself in the human population.” Models for disease forecasting can range from very simple extrapolations of the current figures through to incredibly detailed models that simulate every single person in the population. The simpler models are faster to produce than the detailed models, but they’re less accurate, and this is the line the Government is walking with its modelling at the moment. And of course, these more detailed models are just as constrained by limited information about the virus itself. Mikhail Prokopenko from the University of Sydney also models pandemics, using census and other data to essentially recreate every member of Australia’s population in digital form and see different ways a pandemic might play out. His team’s models will show how the disease might spread around Australia geographically over time, what proportion of the population is likely to be infected and on what day of the epidemic the peak would come. But even preliminary results from his forecasts are still weeks away. “There are so many moving parts, we need to take care in representing those,” Professor Prokopenko said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Global coronavirus outbreak hits grim milestone of 100,000 infections","date":"03-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/07\/coronavirus-infections-disaster\/","transcript":"The global spread of coronavirus has hit a grave milestone as Australia considers a range of drastic measures to contain an epidemic, with warnings that the virus could plague the nation for many more months. More than 100,000 people have now been infected in around 90 countries, far surpassing recent outbreaks such as SARS which infected 8,000 people. The vast majority of cases are in China (80,552 infections, 3000 deaths), followed by Italy (148 deaths, 3858 infections), Iran (107 deaths, 3513 infections), South Korea (42 deaths, 6284 infections) and Japan (12 deaths, 1066 infections). US President Donald Trump signed a $8.3 billion bill to fight the virus a day after Italy said it would double its own spending to $8.5 billion. In Geneva, the UN health agency said it had received applications for 40 possible virus tests, had 20 vaccine candidates in development and reported that numerous clinical trials of experimental drugs for the new coronavirus were under way. “We’re all in this together. We all have a role to play,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, chief of the World Health Organisation, urging more global cooperation from the business world and solidarity with the poorest. However the virus is still much less widespread than annual flu epidemics, which result in up to 5 million severe cases annually and between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths, according to the WHO. The Australian government estimates coronavirus could cost the health system $1 billion as the chief medical officer warned that millions of Australians could be infected over the course of weeks in a worst-case scenario. Mr Morrison announced a shared funding deal with the states to help with hospital, health service and other virus-related costs, with the federal government stumping up $500 million and the states contributing the rest. As more infections emerge, state authorities are considering the threshold for invoking a range of drastic measures such as school closures. Queensland’s government departments have gone into war mode, planning for a potential outbreak in the same way as cyclones or bushfires. “The way in which we prepare for natural disasters is exactly what we’re doing in preparation for a potential coronavirus outbreak,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian warned the state was bracing for “a concerning phase of a number of months ahead of us”. Authorities are considering potentially closing a Sydney high school for two weeks after a 16-year-old student tested positive. The student is the son of a Ryde Hospital healthcare worker who had contact with a 53-year-old male doctor who has coronavirus. The NSW education department is ensuring students across the state can attend virtual classes in the likelihood of more school shutdowns, The Daily Telegraph reports. Talks on epidemic planning were also held on Friday for the aged care sector. Australia has 59 confirmed cases nationwide  – with 28 in NSW and 14 in Qld – but the rate is rapidly climbing, with NSW doubling its figures in a week. Meanwhile, four more Australians have been caught up in yet another cruise ship emergency, this time off the coast of California. They are among twenty-one people aboard the mammoth ship to have tested positive for the new coronavirus including 19 crew members, US Vice President Mike Pence has announced.

We all have a role to play,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, chief of the World Health Organisation. The global outbreak continues to impact large international events, with Olympics organisers announcing they were scaling down a torch arrival ceremony for Tokyo 2020. Japan will also not send 140 children to Greece for a torch departure ceremony on March 19. A four-month torch relay around Japan begins on March 26 before the torch is due to arrive for the opening ceremony on July 24 at the Olympic stadium in Tokyo. A co-organiser of this year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Rotterdam is reviewing its options for the May 12-16 event. A doctor who recently returned from the US has become Victoria’s 11th confirmed coronavirus case, health authorities have said. It is believed the doctor subsequently treated dozens of patients before the infection was detected. A second man who recently returned from Iran became Queensland’s latest case, bringing the state’s infections to 14. The 28-year-old Brisbane man has been taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital. An 81-year-old man who returned from Thailand and a 29-year-old woman who travelled from London with a stopover in Singapore were also confirmed to have COVID-19 on Thursday. Authorities are tracing those who may have come into contact with a 26-year-old Logan man diagnosed with the virus on Wednesday after returning home from Iran. The state government says it is trying to contact all the people who were on his flight and were sitting within two rows of him. Fifteen staff members from the emergency department of Brisbane’s Mater Hospital are in self-quarantine for 14 days after they were exposed to a Chinese student who contracted COVID-19. On Thursday morning, the housemate of the Chinese student was released from hospital after testing negative. He is now at home and has been advised to self-quarantine. In NSW, a 21-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman who worked at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge nursing home in Macquarie Park have also been diagnosed with COVID-19. An 18-year-old woman on Friday became the state’s 28th case after she had been in close contact with a previously known case in western Sydney. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"NT tot's rapist gets 13 years for crime that shocked the nation | The New Daily NT tot's rapist gets 13 years for crime that shocked the nation","date":"03-07-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nt\/2020\/03\/07\/nt-tots-rapist-gets-13-years-for-crime-that-shocked-the-nation\/","transcript":"The man responsible for the 2018 rape of a two-year-old girl in a Northern Territory outback town, prompting national outrage, has been jailed for 13 years. The rape of the girl in February 2018 was a flashpoint for the troubled town of Tennant Creek and the safety of its children, where the population is mainly indigenous, including the victim and her attacker. It led to Malcolm Turnbull making the first visit to the region by a prime minister since 1982. Children’s Commissioner Colleen Gwynne was scathing in a 2018 report about NT child protection services, who had dealt with the family for years. They should have known the girl was at “foreseeable risk of harm and that risk could have been managed or mitigated”, she wrote. On February 15, 2018, some time between 10pm and midnight, Kingsley Corbett, then 25, entered the Tennant Creek house uninvited as the two-year-old girl, her brother and mother were asleep in the living room. Graphic details were read out by Justice Judith Kelly in the NT Supreme Court in Alice Springs outlining how Corbett picked up the child without waking anyone and took her to the main bedroom. After removing her nappy and raping her, he returned her to the living room and left. A relative visited the house later that night and woke her mother when he saw the toddler was bleeding profusely. She was flown to Alice Springs hospital and then Adelaide, and temporarily removed from her mother’s care. She received a blood transfusion and stitches to treat numerous lacerations, cuts, abrasions, and bruising on the inner and outer parts of her genitals. Corbett also infected her with gonorrhoea. The 27-year-old, who had never been charged with a sexual offence before but has a long criminal history, pleaded guilty on Friday to a charge of sexual intercourse without consent. “Crimes of this nature against children are abhorrent,” Justice Kelly said in court. “They inspire disgust and loathing. “Now, I don’t know how much planning was involved but the crime was not opportunistic; it is not as though you were living in that house and suddenly succumbed to temptation.” Justice Kelly said she agreed with crown prosecutor Glen Dooley that Corbett was not remorseful. He denied being responsible to police at first and gave a false alibi before his DNA linked him to the crime. He later blamed his difficult upbringing for his actions when speaking to a psychiatrist. Corbett had been raised by an aunt and abandoned by his parents but he was not found to have any psychotic illness or cognitive impairment that would explain his actions, the court heard A victim impact statement from the girl’s father stated that while his family were strong, “I can’t express my sadness, I have no words,” and that it had also been hard on the mother. Corbett was jailed for 13 years with a non-parole period of nine-and-a-half years. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Americans Downunder turn out to back Sanders or Biden","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/06\/australian-americans-democratic-primary\/","transcript":"When Melbourne woman Laurie Staub casts her vote in the Democratic primary election this weekend it will carry a lot of family history. Americans who live in Australia will be able to vote for who they want to see go up against Donald Trump in November’s presidential election by heading to a local polling station on Saturday. Still in the running are Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, who represents Hawaii in the US House of Representatives. Ms Staub will be choosing Mr Biden. She met him four years ago, when he was vice-president, and in Melbourne to open the city’s Comprehensive Cancer Centre. She told him of her ill 95-year-old mother, and how her father and sister had both died from brain tumours. She got a response she never expected. “Get her mother’s number. I want to call her now,” she recalled Mr Biden telling his aide after she expressed how her mother Nancy thought the “sun shone out of his eyes” and he could do no wrong. Mr Biden phoned Nancy, who was asleep at her South Carolina home. “My mother never kept the phone in her room so when I told her the next day … she was horrified she missed the call.” Come Saturday, Ms Staub, who works in the not-for-profit sector, will be sliding a vote in the ballot box for the Democratic presidential candidate. “I was just so touched that he would even take that time to acknowledge my mother,” she said. “Sure, he makes gaffes – who doesn’t – and sure, in hindsight, he might have made different decisions along the way, but it is time we take the lead to bring decency and honesty and empathy back into governments.” After 27 years of calling Australia home, US-born Stefan Moore’s desire for a better America has not waned. A documentary filmmaker from Sydney, Mr Moore believes Mr Sanders is best positioned to move the country forward. Mr Moore will be driving down to Sydney’s Palace Hotel on Saturday to cast a ballot for the independent democratic socialist from Vermont. Why? Because, as Mr Moore explained, Mr Sanders’ promise of Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, tuition-free public colleges and the re-allocation of military spending to other needs is “really, really vital to the American people”. Mr Sanders also has Alaina Vaisey’s vote. Her unwavering support for the US senator comes from the fact he’s built a campaign on small donations, not corporate handouts, and sustained “a more pragmatic track record in the Senate than he’s generally given credit for”, she said. The 36-year-old Victorian who works in public health research will also be casting a ballot on Saturday. She said the values underpinning Mr Sanders’ political philosophy and the changes he hopes to make have been clear and consistent. “Consistency is key when going head-to-head with Trump, as Trump will latch onto any hypocrisy or skeletons in the closet,” Ms Vaisey said. Mr Sanders also understands that “issues like Medicare for All are life-or-death issues and people cannot afford to wait”, she added. Self-described political junkie Marissa Parkin had Elizabeth Warren as her first pick until she dropped out of the race on Friday. “It’s basically the Bernie Sanders agenda with an actual plan. She’s healthcare for all, she wants to cancel student debt, she’s for free college, paid family leave, all things that are incredibly important to me and I think are just basic rights that any first world country should be providing to their citizens.” Ms Parkin is now hoping Mr Sanders will win the Democratic nomination. “Bernie by far has the strongest progressive platform … I also believe Bernie is more electable. Biden is not going to inspire any enthusiasm or hold up well on the campaign trail.” Andrew Baldyga, 32, is gung-ho about Mr Sanders who he says is unlike many other American politicians. “He stands for something and has been standing for the same things for the past 40 years,” he said. Mr Baldyga wants to see the US establish a national healthcare system and lift the minimum wage. “Having worked quite a few minimum wage jobs, it is quite hard to pay rent and eat on the current minimum wage. Impossible to put money away for retirement. “I fall to the far left in terms of American politics, and having previously voted for Bernie I have no problem doing it again.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"AAP's closure can't be left untouched by ACCC | The New Daily","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/06\/aap-shutdown-nine-murdoch\/","transcript":"Can anyone else think of a situation when the two biggest players in a market, both of which are listed on the ASX, get together and agree to close a joint venture which is a key supplier to most of their smaller competitors? Welcome to the News Corp and Nine decision to summarily shutter Australian Associated Press (AAP) on June 26, ending 85 years of history and jeopardising 600 media jobs. Surely this is unacceptable from a public interest and media diversity point of view, particularly in this era of fake news and constantly shrinking newsrooms. If Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg are looking for stimulus ideas for next week, they could do worse than give the ABC some funding to buy AAP. The closure announcement also appears utterly unacceptable from a competition point of view. In order to test this, I lodged a formal complaint with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) last night in the following terms: News Corporation and Nine Entertainment Company, as the joint controlling shareholders in AAP, have conspired to close the business in order to make life more difficult for their competitors, including the likes of Guardian Australia and The New Daily. AAP is a wholesale supplier of news, video and pictures which is pivotal for smaller media outlets. News Corp and Nine are the two biggest Australian media companies and have the resources to survive without AAP services. Smaller competitors do not have this luxury. Media reports have stated that News Corp and Nine are sick of subsidising their competitors. #AAP gave me the best possible grounding in journalism & has served as a vital part of our democracy. My thoughts are with all those affected. Questions are rightly being asked as to whether this was inevitable or a result of missed opportunities to keep AAP afloat. #SupportAAP — Ehssan Veiszadeh (@ehssanv) March 3, 2020 If that is the case, they should be required by the ACCC to offer the business for sale to a third party, such as the ABC, the Judith Neilson Institute or international wire services such as AFP or the Associated Press (AP). When News Corp sold the NRL franchise Melbourne Storm, it offered more than $10 million in ongoing subsidies to the new owners to keep it going. News Corp and Nine should be required by the ACCC to disclose AAP’s ongoing operating losses and the closures costs they anticipate meeting in June this year. They should be required to offer the business for sale to try and achieve a better exit outcome for their shareholders. I’m seeking a declaration by the ACCC that News Corp and Nine have colluded in an attempt to reduce competition in the media market and a requirement that they offer the business for sale to independent third parties before closing it in June. The lack of public or industry consultation ahead of the closure decision is just staggering. Surely News Corp and Nine should have first released the financial results of AAP and publicly declared that the business was under review with a view to either selling or closing it. The four different shareholders – Seven West Media and Antony Catalano’s Australian Community Media also own small stakes – should have then been given an opportunity to take each other out. If they all wanted to sell or close it down then the business should have been offered for sale, including to the ABC, which is an obvious buyer. And please don’t buy this line that AAP has long been a burden for the major players. It used to be a commercial powerhouse. Remember when it launched the telco AAPT in 1991 which was later floated on the ASX in November 1997 raising $76 million in fresh capital at the price of $1.85. AAP Information Services, the News Corp- and Fairfax-controlled joint venture, retained a 37.3 per cent stake in AAPT after the float. When Telecom New Zealand went over the top two years later offering $5 a share or $1.5 billion for AAPT in late 1999, it delivered a windfall of $264 million to AAP, as Fairfax disclosed in this announcement at the time. A responsible government working in the public interest would buy #AAP and integrate its staff and expertise into the ABC. If only we had one. — 💧Queen Victoria (@Vic_Rollison) March 3, 2020 TPG later bought all of Telecom New Zealand’s Australian operations for $450 million in 2013, so News Corp and Fairfax clearly sold at the top and profited handsomely from AAP’s telecommunications adventure in the 1990s. There has been much written about the demise of AAP, including important pieces in Guardian Australia and The New Daily. The old Fairfax papers have tried to be impartial, but News Corp journalists have predictably towed the company line. News Corp executive Campbell Reid has been making the public running on the closure as the current chairman of AAP, but we’re yet to hear from any of the minority shareholders or from Nine, which surely can’t be comfortable lining up with News Corp for a devastating jobs massacre like this. Given that Rupert’s father, Sir Keith Murdoch, was a pivotal player in the establishment of AAP 85 years ago, it is remarkable that the wider Murdoch family are sitting back and copping such a brutal decision which must have been signed off by News Corp’s co-chairs, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. After the Fox Entertainment sale to Disney, the wider Murdoch family are worth almost $30 billion. Keeping AAP going as a legacy to Sir Keith would be a drop in the bucket, but there’s seemingly no place for sentiment when it comes to a business which helps News Corp’s competitors. That means it’s over to the ACCC to intervene, just like the way they blocked the $1.45 billion takeover bid for AAPT by Cable & Wireless Optus in May 1999.

The Labor Opposition and the media have every right – in fact an obligation – to apply the utmost scrutiny to the government’s corruption of its grant-giving processes. Latest #SportsRort Morrison calls a Global Pandemic before the rest of the world because his temperature is rising over scrutiny! 136 degrees of email could prove hazardous to his health.#auspol — 💧Teresa Randal (@RandaltsRandal) February 27, 2020 Australians need to know their government is spending taxpayer dollars for blatant political purposes, even if voters in some electorates are indirect beneficiaries of the largesse. However, there is a second important point that needs to be remembered, one which can make it difficult to bring governments to account for such misbehaviour. Voters are frustratingly selective when it comes to becoming enraged about political malfeasance. This selectiveness is based, in the first place, on our very low opinion of politicians. We expect them to lie and we’re not surprised when they rort the system. The only time we get angry is when the rorts only benefit the politician – such as the abuse of travel allowance. In the case of ‘sports rorts’, there are hundreds of communities enjoying new or improved sports facilities, and they are probably finding it a bit hard to get angry about how that benefit was funded. As I’ve written several times in the past, even though voters believed John Howard lied about the ‘children overboard’ affair, they still trusted him to do what was in the nation’s interest, particularly when it came to the economy. When that trust evaporated over Mr Howard’s WorkChoices policy, voters had no hesitation in turfing him out. What a question time. @ScottMorrisonMP weazling his way to blame @senbmckenzie for very stinky #SportsRort revelations. Back dated approvals? Millions spent improperly during caretaker period? 73% of last round not recommended by Sport Aust? Dodgy as all hell. #auspol #qt — Tanya Plibersek (@tanya_plibersek) February 27, 2020 Another way of looking at how voters trust, or don’t trust, politicians is explained in the compelling new book on the ALP Party Animals, by my colleague Samantha Maiden. Veteran Labor campaign strategist Peter Barron notes in the book that Australian voters are notoriously risk averse, while former ACTU head, Chris Walton, argues that elections are usually won and lost on one question – who is the radical? “Generally you will find whoever is able to paint the opponent as radical wins,” Mr Walton says. So voters’ trust in politicians is not so much about who do we trust to tell the truth, but who do we consider the lesser risk, or who do have confidence in to do the right thing by the nation? This knowledge is what gives Mr Morrison the conviction that he can get away with refusing to answer a question on sports rorts. Journalists might rightly seethe about the injustice, but most voters will remain comfortable and relaxed if they believe their trust in PM Morrison to manage the ‘risks’ remains well-founded. The PM now realises this trust was shaken when he mishandled the summer bushfires. It’s been further eroded as the delivery of promised financial support for individuals and communities affected by the drought and bushfires has been interminably slow, adding to the active distrust of welfare recipients caught up in the robo-debt debacle. PM just said Australians are ‘common sense people’. True dat. Common sense says 136 emails between you and Bridget Mackenzie is a #SportsRort. — Dee Madigan (@deemadigan) March 3, 2020 With severe economic impacts of the coronavirus about to hit Australia, Mr Morrison knows this may be his last chance to prove he can manage the risks facing the nation. And no, that does not mean issuing a mandate for bigger supermarket trollies to cater for lemming-like toilet paper hoarders. It will nevertheless be a tricky manoeuvre, requiring the government to relinquish the totem of its risk management superiority – the budget surplus – in favour of a new measure for doing what’s best for the nation. The Rudd and Gillard Labor governments tried to make ‘saving the economy’ the new measure, but it didn’t stick. Perhaps the second time’s the charm. Failure to do so will permanently fracture voters’ trust in Mr Morrison. John Howard can tell him what happens after that."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Prime Minister strikes deal with states to share coronavirus burden","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/06\/prime-minister-coronavirus-deal\/","transcript":"The Morrison government has cut a deal with states and territories over sharing the estimated $1 billion in health costs in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement comes amid news that three Sydney hospitals have been directly affected as the virus spreads further in Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was a standalone arrangement, with $100 million put down upfront, and not linked to any other funding arrangements. Under the deal, announced on Friday, the federal government will stump up $500 million to fight the deadly COVID-19 epidemic. The states will pay the rest. “This is about dealing with the coronavirus, and making sure that the states, as they are leaning forward and responding we are leaning forward and responding with them,” Mr Morrison said. “It could be more, but we at least have to enter into these arrangements having some sense of the scale of what we’re dealing with here.” In Sydney, dozens of staff at Ryde Hospital were put in self-isolation and 56 patients were identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case. At Liverpool Hospital, in the Sydney’s west, 23 staff and five patients have been identified as potential close contacts of a confirmed case. A health worker at Canterbury Hospital has been diagnosed with the virus after returning from Iran. The diagnoses suggest Sydney’s coronavirus epicentre is in the city’s north-west. Epping High School, which is near the affected hospitals, closed on Friday and ordered more than 1100 teenage students to self-quarantine after a year 11 boy tested positive for the virus. NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said there were plans to make sure hospitals were adequately staffed. “We have several mitigation strategies in place to backfill any absent staff with other health workers to ensure continuity of service in our hospitals,” she said. Australia’s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, had earlier warned the worst-case scenario for Australia was “millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks”. Professor Murphy remains confident that the country’s public health systems are well prepared if widespread outbreaks happen. However, fears for the safety of front-line health workers responding to the outbreak have prompted union calls for dedicated clinics to be introduced. Australia now has 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and two elderly people have died. Worldwide, the virus has spread to 80 countries, with 95,000 confirmed cases and 3250 deaths. Authorities warn more cases are inevitable. They are now framing the campaign against the virus as a war that won’t be over quickly. The dawning realisation that the outbreak will be drawn out has affected supplies of key household items. Coles, Woolworths and Aldi have enforced limits on toilet paper purchases after panic buying. Woolworths is also limiting the sale of large bags of rice, and hand sanitiser. Further afield, four more Australians have been caught up in yet another cruise ship emergency, this time off the coast of California. Test kits are being dropped onto the Grand Princess, where dozens of people have shown flu-like symptoms. A passenger on a recent cruise died. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said consular officials were in San Francisco ready to support the four. Australia has already lost one person to a cruise ship outbreak, and others are still in hospital. – with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Family accidentally buys 2300 toilet rolls prior to national panic","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/06\/family-mass-toilet-rolls\/","transcript":"This is what 12 years’ worth of toilet paper looks like. Toowoomba’s Janetzki family have thousands of rolls of Australia’s most sought-after product, after mistakenly ordering 48 boxes of 48 rolls instead of their usual box of 48 rolls from online delivery service Who Gives A Crap. They received 2304 rolls and were charged $3264 instead of $68, something that went unnoticed until the two-pallet order showed up on their doorstep days later. The family estimate it is enough to last them 12 years. The accidental hoarders made the purchase in early February, weeks before fears relating to coronavirus sent the country into a toilet paper-buying frenzy. Now, they’ve got more toilet paper than most supermarkets have on the shelves. “It’ll take a while to live down,” said Haidee Janetzki, who placed the order. “We’ve told our three daughters that if we’ve still got all this toilet paper when they get married this is what they’ll have as their wedding decorations.” The Janetzkis have been ordering one box of 48 rolls every 12 weeks for the past two years. After Christmas, they decided to change product and set up a new subscription. “It asked for the quantity and I wrote 48 thinking I want a box with 48 rolls in it,” Ms Janetzki said. “A couple of days later, I got an email saying the order was on the way, and that was all good. “On a Monday there was a knock at the door at it was the courier. He said, ‘I’ve got two pallets of toilet paper for you.’ “We checked the credit card statement to try to figure out what’d gone wrong and turned out I’d ordered 48 boxes, so it was legitimately my mistake.” Ms Janetzki said she had paid off her credit card the day prior to being charged, and only checks her statement once a fortnight. “So I didn’t notice there was a large amount on the card and it didn’t max it out,” she said. Husband Chris Janetzki said he could not quite believe the size of their order. “At the time I thought, ‘Holy crap,'” he said. Little did they, or anyone, know that weeks later a toilet paper shortage would make national headlines. Both Woolworths and Coles have limited the amount of toilet paper rolls customers can buy. Toilet paper manufacturers have also ramped up production to meet demand. “I couldn’t believe that people have been mass-buying toilet paper like that. I still don’t understand why they’re doing it,” Mr Janetzki said. “I’m a pastor of a church and so a friend said, ‘How prophetic are you to be able to see the future and know there was going to be a toilet paper shortage?’ “We’re going to get a laugh out of it for a while.” Unable to contact the online-only company via phone, the Janetzkis had no choice but to accept the delivery. The Janetzkis eventually sent off an urgent email about their unusual purchase and the company responded with an offer to take back the unwanted boxes. But by that time, the family had come up with a cunning plan. The family is now selling their excess toilet paper to help raise money for their daughter’s school. Ms Janetzki said she jokingly offered up the toilet paper as a fundraising initiative for the school’s trip to Sydney and Canberra later this year. Days later it was a go. “Lots of people we know offered to buy them off us,” she said. “We’re getting lots of jokes though now. Every other order form I’ve put in for other fundraisers people have said, ‘Just check the quantity, make sure she’s ordering just one, pie not one box of pies.'” WGAC has also refunded $400 in postage for the boxes, which the Janetzkis have put towards their daughter’s trip. “It really has worked out for the best for us in the end,” Ms Janetzki said. While they wait for stock to sell out, the family have been having fun with it – building a wall in their garage, and then a throne in their lounge room. A spokeswoman for WGAC confirmed the Janetzkis’ story. “Haidee and Chris were so patient about this situation. I can’t even imagine what it would have been like to have a whole pallet of toilet paper turn up at my front door,” the spokeswoman said. “I can imagine there’d be some folks around Australia this week who wouldn’t mind it right about now.” The spokeswoman said the company was unable to check all orders manually. “When we were a smaller business, we’d run manual checks twice a day on all the orders we received and a mistake like this would usually jump out during that process,” the spokeswoman said. “Then we’d reach out to the customer before sending the order to the warehouse to make sure it was correct before shipping. “But as the business has grown up, we’ve had to automate how we process orders.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Economic stimulus is coming, PM promises – but details remain secret","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/06\/scott-morrison-stimulus-plan\/","transcript":"The Morrison government is keeping details of its promised stimulus plan close to its chest, refusing to be drawn on details or even when the package will be revealed, despite data showing the economy is starting to struggle. The stimulus package is expected to be a multibillion-dollar affair aimed at keeping business doors open and people employed after the summer’s bushfire crisis and as the coronavirus outbreak starts to have a wider effect on Australia. On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison would say only that the plan was being put together “swiftly” but not with “undue haste”. “We have been careful to get this right, to make sure it is targeted, to make sure it is measured, proportionate, and importantly that it is scalable,” Mr Morrison said. Earlier, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann also refused to be drawn on details, including the exact timing of the announcement of details – although he said it would be “well before” the May budget. The government’s promises come as retail sales data released on Friday show the bushfires and thick, choking smoke that covered much of south-eastern Australia kept consumers at home. Retail spending dropped 0.3 per cent in January after a downward revised 0.7 per cent slump in December. That was before any real awareness of the likely economic ramifications of COVID-19. Treasury has estimated the bushfires will cut 0.2 percentage points from economic growth in the March quarter, compounded by what could be at least a 0.5 percentage point drag from the impact of the coronavirus. Mr Morrison said on Friday he had struck a deal with the states and territories to go halves in the health costs from the virus – at this stage estimated at $1 billion. “Today, we have been very decisive, to date we have been very proportionate,” he said. “We will continue to see the disruptive impact of this in the months ahead and we want to leave ourselves in a position to continue to respond to that.” He reiterated Mr Cormann’s assurances the stimulus package would be revealed before federal budget day. Meanwhile, Tourism ministers met in Canberra on Friday to discuss the impact of the virus on the sector, which has also been rocked by the aftermath of the fires. The government last week added Iran to the ban and, on Thursday, South Korean visitors. It also introduced enhanced screening for travellers from Italy. In concluding its annual assessment of Australia, the International Monetary Fund has warned that downside risks to the near-term outlook “remain elevated” and have recently increased due to COVID-19. “Growth should continue to recover in 2020, but it will take time for the economy to return to potential and restore inflation to within the (2-3 per cent) target range,” the Washington-based institution said overnight. However, the report was concluded on February 21, and is already looking dated given world markets have since been volatile as the coronavirus spreads and central banks, including the Reserve Bank, have cut interest rates fearing a global downturn. Responding to the IMF report, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Australia was approaching the challenges ahead from a position of “economic strength”. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Delighted residents welcome return of Darling River after three dry years","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/06\/darling-river-flowing-2020\/","transcript":"After a three-year wait, the community of Wilcannia in far-western New South Wales is celebrating substantial Darling (Baaka) River flows. Locals had lobbied authorities to prioritise culture and the environment over agriculture as the river struggled through drought and claims of over extraction. Now, thanks to flooding rain in northern NSW and Queensland and soaking rain locally, the dry riverbed is full again. The town is the heartland of the Barkindji people whose culture revolves around the river, traditionally known as the Baaka. Barkindji elder Cyril Hunter said a full river would transform the local community. “It’s been a long wait,” he said. “We’ll be camping on the river, people will be taking their kids and going fishing. “It means a lot, it’s like bloody treasure coming down for us.”  Timelapse Baaka arrives in Wilcannia Three years in the waiting and the Darling (Baaka) is flowing through Wilcannia once again! 🌊💙💚🤎🌊 Posted by ABC Broken Hill on Thursday, March 5, 2020 Such was the excitement among local children that teachers brought them to see the water arrive on their lunch break on Friday. Teacher Sarah Donnelly said the positive impact of water in the river on students was undeniable. “You can feel the energy and the positivity around town; you can feel it at the school,” she said. “We’re doing a lot more learning on country at school and we’re so excited that we can be doing more of our lessons, in all of our key learning areas, down by the river more.” Many residents have relied on drinking water donations for almost a year, preferring to avoid drinking often-unpalatable bore water that was switched on after the river dried up. The local council expects current flows could mean the town supply is secure for at least 12 months. Long before millions of fish died in the river downstream at Menindee, the community held regular rallies at the town demanding state and federal governments prioritise water for cultural and environmental purposes. Mr Hunter said while the flows were welcome, the Barkindji people would continue to demand the government change how it prioritises water needs in the Murray-Darling system. “They’re selling us out.

The latest cuts to destinations including Tokyo, Sapporo, Osaka, Hong Kong and Auckland are on top of its grounding of the equivalent of 18 planes in February as it cut international and domestic capacity. “The coronavirus situation and its impact on international travel demand is evolving and we’re monitoring closely,” the airline said on Friday. “Further changes are expected.” Airlines have been hit particularly hard by the virus outbreak. The International Air Transport Association said on Friday the epidemic could rob commercial airlines of up to $US113 billion ($170 billion) in revenue this year – more than three times as much as it predicted just two weeks ago. “In little over two months, the industry’s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse,” president Alexandre de Juniac, said. The rapid shift in fortune was “almost without precedent,” he said. Qantas has already cut flights after posting a 3.9 per cent reduced half-year profit of $445 million in February. Those cutbacks also applied to Jetstar Asia, which reduced capacity by 14 per cent. By Friday afternoon, Australia had recorded 60 cases of COVID-19 and two elderly people had died from the virus. Globally, the coronavirus has spread to more than 60 countries. Almost 91,000 people have been infected and more than 3000 have died, most of them in China. With the virus spreading rapidly, international tourist bookings to Australia plunged by 56 per cent in the past month, Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham said on radio. Australia also ordered its first school closure on Friday after a 16-year-old pupil at a Sydney high school tested positive for the deadly coronavirus. Shares in Qantas fell 5.03 per cent to a more than two-year low of $4.815 by 1220 AEDT on Friday. The company has not closed higher on the ASX since February 20 and its share price has shed about 35 per cent since hitting an historic high of $7.46 in December, a $3.94 billion reduction in market capitalisation. Meanwhile, Qantas’ loss-making domestic rival Virgin Australia is holding meetings and calls with debt investors on Friday to discuss its recent interim results, a Virgin spokesman said, following a report in The Australian Financial Review there were concerns about falls in the airline’s bond prices. Virgin also said in February it would cut domestic and international flights in February. It is continuing to monitor demand and will make more adjustments if needed, a spokesman said. Virgin is to abandon the “challenging” Sydney-Hong Kong route and cut short-term capacity on Trans-Tasman and Cairns routes. Its subsidiary Tigerair is to quit five domestic routes. Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines this week also announced further capacity cuts than initially planned as the epidemic spreads to more countries. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Employee walkout at publisher over Woody Allen book","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/books\/2020\/03\/06\/woody-allen-book-protest\/","transcript":"Dozens of staff at Hachette Book Group have staged a walk-out in protest at the publishing company’s upcoming release of Woody Allen’s memoir. “This afternoon, Grand Central Publishing employees are walking out of the Hachette New York office in protest of the publication of Woody Allen’s memoir,” the employees said in a statement posted to Twitter. “We stand in solidarity with Ronan Farrow, Dylan Farrow and survivors of sexual assault.” Around 75 employees of Hachette took to New York’s Rockefeller Plaza to support journalist Ronan Farrow, who severed ties with the publisher after discovering that Hachette, which published his book Catch and Kill, was releasing his estranged father’s memoir as well.

The Gold Logie winner scored a $350,000 18-month contract in 2019 to promote apprenticeships for young people, but has attended just one event since October. “I want to see him do the job that he was contracted to do, it is a very important area,” Senator Cormann told Sky News on Friday. “We want him to inspire young people to pursue apprenticeships and careers in the trades. I’m sure that he will work very hard.” The Block star’s sole public appearance so far has been a media conference alongside Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Skills Minister Michaelia Cash to announce his appointment. Since then, Cam has pocketed $145,000 of his contract.

Two Senate estimates hearings and the committee inquiring into the matter heard this week her office sent Sport Australia an amended spreadsheet – adding nine projects worth $3.3 million – three hours after initially sending it her authorisation. The Auditor-General told senators its investigation showed the list of projects in the third round changed twice after it was initially sent to Sport Australia on April 11. Senator McKenzie’s office communicated with Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s office during that day. In a statement issued late on Thursday, Senator McKenzie said she only became aware of these changes through the estimates committee processes. She said the original brief she signed on April 4 – a week before it was sent to Sport Australia – did include the nine new projects among others funded in the third round of grants. “I did not make any changes or annotations to this brief or its attachments after 4 April 2019,” she said in the statement. “My expectation was that the brief would be processed in a timely and appropriate manner. “Nevertheless, changes were made and administrative errors occurred in processing the brief.” Senator McKenzie did not outline who she believed had been responsible for the changes. “I have always taken responsibility for my actions and decisions as a minister, and this includes actions by my office,” she wrote. “I was the minister for sport and therefore ultimately and entirely responsible for funding decisions that were signed off under my name, including and regrettably, any changes that were made unbeknown to me. “It is unfortunate to see a popular community program, which has delivered 684 projects, with 337 being delivered regionally, being undermined.” Labor frontbencher Don Farrell, who has been pursuing the matter through multiple Senate committees, said Senator McKenzie’s statement just raised more questions. “I think when she said that the final document she signed was 4 April, I think she was telling the truth,” he said. “What we now have to find out is who’s been lying in this process.” Sport Australia chief operating officer Luke McCann said the senator’s office told the organisation there had been errors in the original spreadsheet. He didn’t believe it was usual for attachments to decision briefs to change, but said the same thing had occurred earlier in the first grants round. Senator Farrell said it was fair to say there might have been “a couple of mistakes” but it was a stretch to believe that of moving 12 projects on or off the list. “That was not an administrative error. Somebody made a calculated decision about where that money was going to be spent,” he said. Senator McKenzie has maintained a low profile since resigning from Scott Morrison’s frontbench in the wake of the saga, but took to her personal website to distance herself from the evidence. The Auditor-General has criticised the minister’s office for using the $100 million program to funnel money into marginal coalition seats or those it targeted during the 2019 election. It found nearly three-quarters of the grants approved were not recommended by Sport Australia’s merit-based assessment process. Senator McKenzie said she made no apology for using her ministerial discretion and it was unfortunate to see the program being undermined. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"On track or in the black?

Labor’s finance spokeswoman Katy Gallagher reminded a Senate economics hearing on Thursday that Treasurer Josh Frydenberg boasted on budget night last April that the budget was “back in the black”. Senator Gallagher asked Assistant Minister for Financial Services Jane Hume – who was representing the government at the hearing – whether the federal budget “is back in black”. Quoting Mr Frydenberg from parliamentary question time on Wednesday, Senator Hume replied: “The budget is back on track.” Senator Gallagher asked whether “back on track” and “back in the black” are the same thing? “I think you are getting into semantics,” Senator Hume said. Senator Gallagher said it was an important semantic considering the government campaigned on the budget surplus trajectory at last year’s election. “I think we can safely confirm that the budget is back on track,” Senator Hume reiterated. Last April, the Treasurer bragged of a $7.1 billion budget surplus for the 2019\/20 financial year, which would be the first surplus in 12 years. In December, at the mid-year financial update, he wound back expectations, forecasting a $5 billion surplus. Softening wage growth and growing warning signs for the economy were blamed. Earlier on the Thursday, Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy told the committee in Canberra the bushfires and the emerging coronavirus epidemic will “undoubtedly have a negative impact on the fiscal position”. The Morrison government is expected to unveil a multibillion-dollar stimulus package to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak next week. Full details have not been released, but it is tipped to include tax incentives to help businesses with cash flow, alongside tax deductions for new investments.

Last week, the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said the dog’s nasal and oral cavities tested “weak positive” for the virus, but its owner said he had not shown any symptoms. “The department will continue to closely monitor the dog … and repeat the test later. It will only be returned to its owner when the test result is negative,” the AFCD said. However, it said there is no evidence pets can be a source of infection. The World Health Organisation (WHO) website states there is no evidence so far that companion pets can be infected with the coronavirus, however, washing hands after contact with pets has been advised. Professor Michael Wallach from the University of Technology, Sydney believes the method used to detect the virus is extremely sensitive and can pick up even minute amounts of virus, which can be present on any surface. “The question of whether that virus is causing any infection in the dog or is transmissible between human-to-dog is a different question,” he said. “You can detect a viral particle on many surfaces or the saliva of an animal, but to conclude an infection is taking place is a big jump,” He told ABC’s The World. “Everyone should remain calm and not assume that because there’s one test showing one result of one animal on the entire planet that we start changing our attitudes towards our pets. That would be a huge mistake.” While Hong Kong authorities have concluded pets can test positive for low levels of the pathogen, there is no evidence cats and dogs can pass the new coronavirus on to humans. However, other disease experts have said it is possible for animals to have the virus but argued they generally do not tend to have symptoms and are unlikely to spread the virus further. Infectious disease expert Dale Fisher, who chairs the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO, said some animals have the same receptor for COVID-19. “They can have the disease but in general, animals are not symptomatic,” Mr Fisher said. “It’s possible but it’s certainly not proven and I’m sure it’s not going to drive the outbreak.” “Apart from maintaining good hygiene practices, pet owners need not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets,” an AFCD spokesman said. The AFCD and WHO both said pet owners should maintain good hygiene, including washing hands before and after handling animals, their food and supplies and no kissing. People who are sick are also advised to avoid contact with pets and a veterinarian’s advice should be sought if changes in a pet’s health conditions are detected. Hong Kong has more than 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and two people have died. There are more than 95,300 cases worldwide, the majority in China, and more than 3,200 people have died."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'This is not a drill': Countries urged to pull out 'all the stops' against virus","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/06\/coronavirus-who-update\/","transcript":"The global march of the coronavirus has triggered a vigorous appeal from the World Health Organisation for governments to pull out “all the stops” to slow the epidemic. It comes as the virus drained colour from India’s spring festivities, closed Bethlehem’s Nativity Church and blocked Italians from visiting elderly relatives in nursing homes. As China, after many arduous weeks, appeared to be winning its epic costly battle against the new virus, the fight was revving up in newly affected areas of the globe, unleashing disruptions that profoundly impacted billions of people. The UN health agency urged all countries to “push this virus back,” a call to action reinforced by figures showing there are now about 17 times as many new infections outside China as in it. To date, the virus has infected nearly 97,000 people and killed more than 3,300. “This is not a drill. This is not the time for giving up. This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a daily briefing in Geneva. “Countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans.” As Chinese manufacturers gradually reopened their factories, anti-virus barriers went up elsewhere. In Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s outbreak, workers in latex gloves pinned “closed” notices on school gates, enforcing a 10-day shutdown of the education system. Italian sports fans are also barred from stadiums until April 3. A government decree that took effect on Thursday urged the country’s citizens to stay at least one metre apart from each other, placed restrictions on visiting nursing homes and urged the elderly not to go outside unless absolutely necessary. That directive appeared to be widely ignored, as school closures across the country left many Italian children in the care of their grandparents. Parks in Rome overflowed with both young and old, undercutting government efforts to shield older Italians from the virus that hits the elderly harder than others. Italy has the world’s oldest population after Japan. Italy’s death toll climbed to 148 on Thursday and its confirmed cases to 3,858.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders said they wouldn’t attend Holi events and the Holi Moo Festival in New Delhi was cancelled. In the United States, where 11 have died from the virus, hundreds of people were placed in self-quarantines due to cases in a New York suburb. A school district north of Seattle with 22,000 students announced it will close for up to two weeks because of coronavirus concerns. Across the globe, travellers faced ever-greater disruptions as countries sought to keep the virus out. South Africa confirmed its first case on Thursday, becoming the seventh African country to report infections. Britain and Switzerland reported their first coronavirus deaths. “The virus doesn’t care about race and belief or colour. It is attacking us all, equally,” said Ian MacKay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland in Australia. The outlook for the travel industry was increasingly grim. The International Air Transport Association said the outbreak could cost airlines as much as $US113 billion ($171 billion) in lost revenue. The struggling British airline Flybe collapsed on Thursday amid sinking demand. Indonesia announced restrictions on travellers from parts of Iran, Italy and South Korea after previously banning those coming in from China. The United Arab Emirates warned its people not to travel anywhere abroad. Palestinian officials closed the Church of the Nativity in the biblical city of Bethlehem indefinitely, weeks ahead of the busy Easter holiday. Japan said visitors from China and South Korea would face a two-week quarantine at a government facility and be barred from public transit. Sri Lankans arriving from Italy, South Korea and Iran will be quarantined at a hospital once used for leprosy patients.

Social media exploded this week with videos and photos of Australian shoppers wiping supermarket shelves clean of toilet rolls and canned tomatoes and beans over fears that a coronavirus outbreak will lead to forced self-isolation. On Thursday, tension over toilet rolls hit a new extreme when a man was reportedly tasered by police after a violent confrontation over toilet paper at Big W in Tamworth, New South Wales. Supermarket giants Woolworths and Coles have introduced a quantity limit of four toilet paper packs per customer. Almost 50 people have now tested positive for coronavirus across the country. Although it might sound funny that our nation’s first response to the virus was to madly stockpile toilet paper, social service workers have warned the behaviour was no laughing matter. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said the panic buying of toilet paper and cheap staples like beans was “inherently selfish”. “By buying a trolley load of toilet paper or 40 bags of oats, you’re stopping people who generally don’t have any. People who actually need it,” Ms King told The New Daily. Low-income earners such as pensioners or people on Newstart Allowance were being hit hard, she said. “These people manage their income really, really carefully, and now they’re turning up to grocery stores and finding things they need like toilet paper and oats are off the shelves,” Ms King said.

People who have health issues or disabilities were struggling, too. “There is no need to panic buy, but people with disposable incomes are doing just that,” Ms King said. “It’s not funny. It’s having a really dreadful impact on so many members of the community.” Brisbane pensioner Lorelle Tyndale, 69, is one of those community members. She said she had to drive to three supermarkets and one pharmacy on Wednesday before she finally found toilet paper. And she considers herself lucky. “At least I have a car,” Ms Tyndale told The New Daily. “What about other people who have little or no mobility and have to get public transport?” Ms Tyndale said plenty of other people would find the mass stockpiling of essential items a “very daunting situation”. “The toilet paper thing just points out that some people in this country are lucky, but others aren’t,” she said. “It’s so wrong, because we’re just expected to sit back and think, ‘Oh well, that’s another thing I’ve missed out on’.” There are special groups of people in our community who do not have the ability to shop on a regular basis, & when they do, they really need the essentials, like toilet paper to be available.

A 95-year-old female resident at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge at Macquarie Park has since died from the virus and two male residents, aged 82 and 70, are also infected. It comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison extended travel bans to include South Korea which is experiencing the largest virus epidemic outside of China with more than 6000 confirmed cases and 35 deaths. Four Australians are also among thousands of people in lockdown on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California that is being quarantined for coronavirus. The Mexico-bound vessel originally had 22 people on board who were experiencing symptoms, with further investigations forcing 62 passengers and several crew members to be placed in isolation in their cabins. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the four Australians aboard the cruise ship will receive consular assistance should they request it. The Northern Territory’s first case, believed to be a NSW man who travelled to Singapore, is among 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia. Queensland recorded another two cases on Thursday and 15 medical staff at Brisbane’s Mater Hospital self-quarantined at home after coming into contact with an infected Chinese student. Western Australia confirmed its third case and announced temporary precautions in Catholic churches that will result in holy water being removed and a ban on drinking from the chalice. Tasmania, in the meantime, has opened a dedicated coronavirus clinic in the state’s north, where a man tested positive to the virus earlier this week. South Australian authorities confirmed on Thursday that a baby boy had contracted COVID-19 after his 40-year-old mother had tested positive to the illness. Meanwhile, more than 160 Australians who spent 18 days aboard the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship have finally been given the all-clear to return home after 45 days away, including more than a month in quarantine. The evacuees said they had to reintroduce themselves on Thursday when they were allowed to take off their masks for the first time and did not recognise their fellow passengers. Couple Chris Peck and Vicki Presland say it was deflating after being evacuated by the federal government when they were told they would have to be in quarantine for another two weeks. “It took about an hour for me to get my brain into gear, then you go for it, put one foot in front of the other,” Ms Presland said. Chinese researcher Professor Zhang Boli claims the number of new infections in the virus’ original epicentre, Wuhan, will drop to zero when March comes to a close. In an interview with People’s Daily, he said almost all regions outside Hubei province – where Wuhan is the capital – had managed to halt the spread by the end of February. Professor Boli, who is part of a research team trying to prevent and control the outbreak, estimated other cities in Hubei will hit such a target by mid-March, based on data on how the outbreak has evolved, but did not give details. Mainland China had 139 new confirmed cases as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, bringing the total accumulated number of cases to 80,409. Authorities reported 119 new cases the previous day and 125 the day before that. Meanwhile, in the Middle East’s worst-affected country, Iran, all citizens have been urged to avoid using cash to prevent the virus from spreading. “Cash should be especially avoided, because bank notes and coins could also be a danger,” health minister Saeed Namaki told a press conference in Tehran while laying out a plan to fight the spread of the disease across the country. That included regularly disinfecting public places, including public transport and entrances to official buildings, as well as conducting tests on shoppers at the entrances to larger malls and in spot checks on highways. –with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Dubai sheikh intimidated wife and abducted daughters: UK court","date":"03-06-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/06\/dubai-sheikh-princess-haya\/","transcript":"A British court has found that the ruler of Dubai conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and ordered the abduction of two of his daughters, newly unsealed documents show. A judge at the High Court in London ruled that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, 70, “acted in a manner from the end of 2018 which has been aimed at intimidating and frightening” his ex-wife, Princess Haya, 45. Judge Andrew McFarlane said the sheikh “ordered and orchestrated” the abductions and forced return to Dubai of two of his adult daughters from another marriage: Sheikha Shamsa, then 19, in August 2000, and Sheikha Latifa in 2002 and again in 2018. The judge made the ruling in January but the sheikh fought to prevent it from being made public. The UK Supreme Court quashed that attempt on Thursday. The Dubai ruler and his ex-wife have been battling in a British court over the welfare of the two children they have together. The sheikh’s lawyers had sought the children’s return to Dubai, while Princess Haya asked for them to be made wards of the British court and stay in the UK. Princess Haya, daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan, moved to London last year and applied to the court for protective orders, using British laws intended to safeguard victims of forced marriage and domestic abuse.

The ruling immediately drew sharp rebuke from the United States, which has already imposed visa restrictions on Fatou Bensouda, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, and threatened further sanctions. “This is a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Washington DC, denouncing “ICC politicians”. Thursday’s appeal decision overturns a previous ruling. In April 2019, judges at the ICC rejected a request to open an investigation, stating that it was not likely to be able to serve justice. The judges stated then that too much time had passed and that the expectation was that Afghanistan would not co-operate, making it unlikely that an inquiry would be successful. Ms Bensouda is seeking to investigate possible torture, arbitrary killings and other war crimes in Afghanistan since 2003. The decision was quickly welcomed by many observers and activists focused on the war-ravaged country. “This is welcome news for Afghanistan and justice for victims of war,” the chairperson of Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission wrote on Twitter, praising those who submitted testimonies and advocated for the case. The prosecution would also look into soldiers and members of the CIA, and could also take in suspected secret detention centres outside Afghanistan. Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director for Human Rights Watch, welcomed the ruling, saying the ICC was signalling that justice is not to be denied.

Senator Warren had finished well behind the two front-runners on Tuesday in 14 states, including her home state of Massachusetts, leaving her path to the nomination virtually nonexistent. Her exit ensures that what was once hailed as the most diverse field of candidates in US history has narrowed to a choice between two white, septuagenarian men. Senator Warren, who still commands a loyal base of supporters, did not immediately endorse either of her rivals, saying she would decide at a later time whether to do so. Mr Biden, a 77-year-old moderate, and Senator Sanders, a 78-year-old liberal from Vermont, have emerged as the standard-bearers for the two major wings of the Democratic Party. Outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Thursday, Senator Warren spoke bluntly about her failure to find a middle ground between the party’s duelling factions. “I was told when I first got into this, there are two lanes,” she said. “I thought it was possible that wasn’t the case, and there was more room to run a different kind of campaign. Apparently that wasn’t the case.” And BTW , #ElizabethWarren was a tremendous candidate.  I admired her conduct, her platform, and her determination to drive corruption out of government.

Asked on Thursday about the role that gender played in the campaign, Senator Warren said it was a tricky issue for female candidates to address. “That is the trap question for every woman,” she said. “If you say, ‘Yeah, there was sexism in this race,’ everyone says, ‘Whiner!’ If you say, ‘No, there was no sexism,’ about a bazillion women say, ‘What planet do you live on?'” This broke me: Elizabeth Warren choking up while remembering her pinky promises to little girls pic.twitter.com\/6fyPCKgezV — marv 🗽 (@mrvndn) March 5, 2020 US Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii remains in the race, but has repeatedly failed to win even 1 per cent of the vote in primaries.

The South Australian senator has come under sustained attack on social media after it emerged she had offered a character reference and subsequently the man did not have a conviction recorded.

She had declared the matter a win for women standing up against bullying. According to the Canberra Star report, the December 23 dispute began when the victim asked her husband to peel some potatoes for Christmas lunch. He declined to do so before yelling at her and calling her “mentally unwell”. “The defendant used his body weight to pin (his victim) to the couch,” police facts say. “(She) attempted to kick the defendant in order to get him away. “The defendant slapped (the woman) with an open hand on the left side of the face. (She) felt immediate pain to her face.” The man appeared in the ACT Magistrates Court, where he pleaded guilty to the assault. In the letter to the court, seen by the Sydney Morning Herald, Ms Hanson-Young said it was entirely out of character. “It is true to say that without [his] care and advice over the past few years I would not have been as confident and supported in taking on the sexist and abusive behaviour I have been subjected to as a woman in the Australian Parliament,” she wrote. “As someone who works in politics, I understand precisely what reputation means in public life. “In my view, a criminal conviction would have a severe and unwarranted impact on his reputation and consequently on his work.” Her reference suggests the lobbyist is not linked to the Greens because it notes that despite “differing political philosophies” they had become close friends."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"News Corp, Nine accused of closing AAP to damage competitors","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/05\/news-corp-nine-aap-accusations\/","transcript":"Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp and fellow media giant Nine have been accused of closing news agency, Australian Associated Press, to damage their smaller competitors. After repeatedly asserting that unfair competition from tech companies  Google and Facebook brought about AAP’s demise, new reports indicate News Corp and Nine might have had a more cynical motive for closing the decades-old news agency and putting hundreds of staff out of work. AAP management announced on Tuesday that, after 85 years of servicing the Australian media industry, the news service would close on June 26. About 180 jobs will be lost from AAP’s editorial arm, with hundreds more expected from other divisions. On Thursday, The Guardian reported that AAP chairman Campbell Reid, who is also a News Corp executive, told AAP staff that Nine and News Corp were tired of subsidising a breaking news service for their competitors. Mr Reid was quoted as telling staff in AAP’s Melbourne bureau that News Corp would develop its own breaking news service. It has also been reported that Nine is considering a similar move. Mr Reid reportedly said that News Corp was “committed to the supply of breaking news”, adding “we don’t have to supply it for everybody else in Australia who’s telling us that they don’t want it”. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has not announced an investigation, but confirmed on Thursday it was looking into the closure. “The ACCC is aware of the announced closure of AAP and is keeping abreast of potential issues that may arise,” it said. A spokeswoman said it would need to find that competition would likely be lessened to raise concerns. The New Daily, The Guardian, The Daily Mail and the former Fairfax regional mastheads now controlled by Antony Catalano all rely on AAP for breaking news and photography. Former ACCC chairman Allan Fels told The New Daily that while it was unlikely a legal problem with AAP’s closure could be proved, it would diminish competition and was a “landmark moment in the history of Australian journalism”. Dr Fels said AAP has long formed the backbone of much of Australia’s journalism, particularly smaller newspapers, and was also quite an important ingredient for News Corp and Nine. “It covers things that often the major newspapers aren’t resourced to do and it provides material for countless smaller newspapers,” he said. “I’ve been saying for a while that public-interest journalism is shrinking as we speak. But this is a spectacular example.” Paul Hamra, managing director of The New Daily, said start-up media newsrooms with limited resources relied on AAP to help cover breaking news around the country. “As a customer of the service, no one thought to contact us to discuss options, such as increased syndication fees, restructured offerings or equity,” Mr Hamra said. “We might have paid more – so, I hear, might have other customers, which could have helped the AAP business model. But no one asked. “I get the impression News Corp and Nine just want to set up their own newswire service instead, with their own content, controlling more of the market and restricting access for new Australian journalism ventures. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance on Thursday said News Corp and Nine “must answer for the decision to shut AAP”. “News Corp and Nine said the reason for shutting down AAP was that it was no longer financially viable and had been damaged by the proliferation of free news on social media and digital content aggregators,” MEAA federal president Marcus Strom said. “However, today’s reports suggest a more sinister motive: The closure is designed to deliberately harm their print and online rivals who subscribe to AAP for news about politics, sport, business, courts and crime, and for breaking news. “The fact that they didn’t put AAP up for sale indicates News and Nine simply wanted AAP shut down.” The loss of the extensive news coverage provided by AAP means consumers around Australia will lose a trusted, reliable, accurate and impartial source of vital information. “The media bosses responsible for the decision to shut AAP should pledge to employ any AAP editorial staff who want to remain in journalism,” Strom said. Dr Fels, who is chairman of the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, said public-interest journalism was shrinking and AAP’s closure was a “spectacular example”. He said declining local journalism meant less court reporting and matters of concern to the local community, and called on the government to step in."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Canberra bus driver who dropped lost boy home was ‘just doing his job’","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/act\/2020\/03\/05\/canberra-bus-driver-dropped-lost-boy-home\/","transcript":"A Canberra bus driver has come to the rescue of a boy who ended up on the wrong route, dropping him home to his anxious parents.

The Prime Minister has also flagged a billion-dollar stimulus package to protect the economy from the prospect of a coronavirus recession, as well as a major taxpayer-funded advertising campaign to give families practical information about the threat. The nation’s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy made the grim prediction of millions of infected Australians at a press conference in Canberra on Thursday. But he cautioned the outbreak in Australia was under control and contained, compared to elsewhere in the world. “We are looking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks,” he said. “We think our health system is well able to cope with that, but we are making sure. The parameters have been very clear to us: That we need to be sure that we plan for every eventuality, and build capacity where we think it may be under pressure if we have one of the worst-case scenarios.” But Scott Morrison said he did not want to scare the community by releasing the government’s predictions of how many people will be infected. “We’ve been careful not to be speculative about this in the public domain,” he said. “What we have done all the way through this global health crisis, I think, to be very candid and up front and we will continue to do that. “But what we won’t do is be speculative, because we’re not in the position of creating unnecessary anxiety. But the modelling at this stage relies on a lot of data, some of which is being sourced from experiences we are seeing overseas, where you have to have a degree of scepticism about a lot of the assumptions.” Mr Morrison confirmed a new travel ban will be introduced for travellers from Korea, along with enhanced screening for people arriving from Italy. Professor Murphy also said there was no reason to panic-purchase toilet paper. “The most important thing, and I say this every time I talk to the media, is that any return traveller from any part of the world where there is a COVID-19 outbreak who develops symptoms should isolate and seek medical attention,” he said. “That is the most important way we can deal with and stop spread in Australia. “But at the moment, there is no reason to put a mask on when you are walking around the shops, there is no reason to stop going to football matches or community activities, there is no reason to denude the shelves of lavatory paper in the supermarkets. “We should continue a normal activity.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Thwarted by corruption', club threatens to sue over sports rorts","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/australian-politics\/2020\/03\/05\/sport-rorts-tennis-club-sue\/","transcript":"A Victorian tennis club may take legal action after missing out on $500,000 in the federal government’s “sports rorts” program, despite qualifying for the cash. The Beechworth Lawn Tennis Club in north-east Victoria says it has struggled for 20 years to upgrade its facilities and was devastated to miss out in the $100 million grants program. Through Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, it has written to the Australian Sports Commission demanding its application be reassessed. “We’ve just been thwarted by corruption at every turn. We worked hard for six weeks on the grant application and easily qualified,” club president Andy Carr said. The BLTC wanted $500,000 to rebuild its courts, which are in disrepair and do not meet Tennis Victoria’s standards. They have been out of action since 2018. But – despite being told its application met ASC criteria and had a merit score of 78 out of 100 – the club missed out. Its letter, sent through Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, follows further revelations on Wednesday about the Morrison government’s actions regarding the allocation of millions of dollars in sports funding as the May 2019 federal election was called. Sport Australia has admitted giving a Senate committee the wrong evidence about the timing of the final decision on the controversial $100 million grants program that funnelled money into projects on coalition-targeted seats. Under the caretaker conventions, governments are not supposed to make major decisions during an election period. Maurice Blackburn warned if the ASC refused to confirm it would carry out the reassessment by March 17, “Federal Court proceedings will be issued”. “A Federal Court challenge would be a test case about the legality of the sports rorts affair,” the firm said. “If the BLTC is successful in a legal challenge, the benefit is likely to flow through to all other clubs that should have received grants on merit.” The letter of demand accuses former sports minister Bridget McKenzie and Prime Minister Scott Morrison of seeking to maximise the prospect of the Coalition winning the federal election when deciding whether or not to grant applications. “That is a nakedly political consideration that is, as a matter of statutory interpretation, a completely irrelevant consideration for the Commission.” Mr Carr said club officials were devastated at missing out on a grant. “The club has dwindled in numbers because we haven’t got anywhere to play tennis,” he said. “People in the town have to drive for over 30 kilometres just to take their kids to [junior tennis].” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Worst-case' scenario involves millions of Australians hit with coronavirus","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/05\/coronavirus-travel-ban-korea\/","transcript":"Health authorities are preparing for a “worst-case scenario” of millions of Australians stricken with coronavirus as the outbreak of the deadly disease accelerates across the country. Chief health officer Brendan Murphy said health authorities across Australia were modelling any outbreak from the “most benign” upwards. “We need to be sure that we plan for every eventuality, and build capacity where we think it may be under-pressure if we have one of the worst-case scenarios,” he said on Thursday. “We are looking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks – and we think our health system is well able to cope with that, but we are making sure.” Australia so far has about 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Among them is an eight-month-old baby whose mother was diagnosed with the infection on Wednesday. Professor Murphy and Prime Minister Scott Morrison also said on Thursday that Australia would ban travellers from South Korea and introduce “enhanced screening” for those from Italy to deal with the escalating COVID-19 epidemic. The bans follow similar action relating to China and Iran. Korean visitors will be banned from 9pm on Thursday. Australian citizens and permanent residents returning from Korea will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days when they return home. Mr Morrison said travellers from Italy would be asked more questions at check-in and have their temperatures checked on arrival in Australia. Professor Murphy also repeated his view there was no reason for people to wear face masks on a daily basis, or to stock up on essentials such as toilet paper. “We should continue normal activity, we should watch the development of this and we will focus on any outbreaks and control,” he said. Health Minister Greg Hunt said the government had 20 million face masks stockpiled. It would continue to make them available to doctors, he said. Elsewhere, a group of young children was being screened for the virus on Thursday after it emerged they had visited a Sydney nursing home where an elderly woman died from the disease. About 17 children visited residents at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge at Macquarie Park on February 24. That was before one of the centre’s nurses, aged in her 50s, tested positive for coronavirus. A 95-year-old woman from the lodge has been confirmed as Australia’s second virus death. Two men, aged 82 and 70, are also infected. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said more cases were expected from the home. Lodge staff failed to turn up for work on Wednesday, after learning of the woman’s death. NSW Health was forced to scramble nurses to cover for them, leading to a spat with the federal government. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said he asked Mr Hunt for emergency funding to cover the cost of nursing staff. But he said he was told he would need to go through the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. “This is now a war, it’s a war with coronavirus,” he said. “We need to know that the federal government’s got our back, and if we make decisions that are nimble, in the interests of patients, in the interests of citizens, and it costs state taxpayers, then the federal government will back us on that funding.” The federal government also said on Thursday it would audit 100 aged-care homes across Australia to make sure they can protect their residents against the spread of coronavirus. Authorities have also revealed that two Sydney doctors who have COVID-19 attended the same medical workshop on February 18, along with about 70 other medical professionals. The doctors, from Ryde and Liverpool hospitals, are so far the only ones who are sick from that group, and 14 days have passed, giving authorities hope that no one else has been infected. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Cuts to domestic violence court support a 'tragedy'","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/people\/2020\/03\/05\/cuts-domestic-violence-support\/","transcript":"Support services for domestic violence survivors will be shut down from June in Victoria – a move the former head of the family violence royal commission has described as a “tragedy”. Court Network deploys more than 450 volunteers a year to support people in the Family Court in Victoria and Queensland. It costs $130,000 a year to operate, but will no longer be funded beyond June because of cuts to Victoria Legal Aid. Its services have already stopped operating in Queensland. “At a time when terrible cases of family violence are in the headlines almost every day, it is a tragedy that this cost-effective, valuable and humane service may not be available after June 2020,” said Marcia Neave, who leads the network and chaired the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence. In the inquiry’s final report, delivered to the Victorian government in 2016, Ms Neave recommended expanding support services. “They’re the volunteers who are in the court, who help people when they come in looking bewildered, or upset, or angry,” Ms Neave told Melbourne’s radio 3AW on Thursday. “People come in really distraught, not knowing where to go, sometimes frightened because their partner is there and there’s been violence between them. “The money is used for training and for support and supervision so they provide a good service.” The service was initially funded by the federal government, but that funding ended three years ago. Since then, the service has been caught in a dispute between the Commonwealth and the states about who should pay. The decision to halt funding comes just weeks after Australia was rocked when the former partner of Brisbane mother Hannah Clarke murdered her and their three children. After the murders, Ms Clarke’s family spoke out about her ex-husband’s controlling and abusive behaviour – and her fears for her own life. “She said to me only last week ‘Mum should I do a will? What happens to my babies if he kills me? Because he’ll go to jail for murder, who gets my children?’,” Ms Clarke’s mother Suzanne said. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 131 114 -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Diamond Princess evacuees leave Darwin after weeks in quarantine","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/03\/05\/cruise-ship-quarantine-ends\/","transcript":"Former Diamond Princess passengers Mytran and Kenneth Donnelly headed home to Sydney on Thursday after spending 32 days in isolation. The couple spent 18 days in lockdown on board the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess, and another 14 in a mining camp near Darwin. In total, it had been 45 days since they left NSW. Mrs Donnelly said the hardest part of the quarantine was missing the birth of their first grandson. “We’re home free, finally,” she said. The Diamond Princess captain let the Donnellys access the internet so they could see a video of the newest addition to their family shortly after he was born, and gave them a teddy bear for their grandson. “We’ll just be glad to go home and see the children,” Mr Donnelly said. “Looking forward to getting back to normal. I haven’t driven a car for 45 days.” The couple were also looking forward to taking off their face masks, which they said made Darwin’s humid temperatures feel hotter. Mr and Mrs Donnelly had nothing but praise for the staff on the cruise ship and at the Manigurr-ma residential village in Howard Springs. But they said they felt the federal government could have done more to bring Australians home sooner. Mr and Mrs Donnelly are two of about 150 Australians heading home today after a fortnight in quarantine in Howard Springs. Altogether, 45 people were tested at the camp. Eight of them tested positive for coronavirus. Those who tested positive in the centre were medically transferred to their home states, and one man later died in Perth. Australian Border Force Commander Colin Drysdale said guests were happy to be heading home, and praised the mission as a success. “There were almost 50,000 meals prepared, and nearly 1000 maintenance requests finalised,” he said. “There’s been, on average, 190 staff supporting the efforts on a daily basis here. “This is a day of joy for them as well.” Australian Medical Assistance Teams mission leader Abi Trewin said it was great to be able to see passengers and staff sit together without masks. “We’re very proud to see everyone leave today happy and healthy,” she said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus panic-buying may force GPs, dentists to shut their doors","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/05\/virus-doctors-dentists-masks\/","transcript":"Dentists and GPs say “critically low levels” of vital surgical supplies such as face masks – brought on by frenzied buying amid the coronavirus outbreak – might force them to shut practices. The Australian Dental Association said practices across the nation were expected to run out of masks within four weeks, because of the extraordinary demand brought on by COVID-19. “Without surgical masks, dentists cannot treat patients safely and we run the risk of people going without treatment,” ADA deputy chief Eithne Irving told the ABC. The association said Australia’s dental practices used millions of masks a month. New masks are used for each patient. Meanwhile, desperate GPs say they are resorting to shopping at Bunnings to buy face masks to guard against the virus because too few government supplies are getting to clinics and traditional stockists have sold out. Doctors are also relying on Twitter and Facebook to stay informed about the outbreak because, they say, official government communication is inconsistent and unclear. The risks to health workers have been highlighted after 40 staff from Sydney’s Ryde Hospital were ordered into home quarantine because of their interaction with a doctor later diagnosed with the virus. NSW Health is also tracing 30 doctors who have had contact with the 53-year-old, including 12 who had close contact. Some 24 nurses had contact with the doctor and of them 21 who had close contact. Authorities have contacted 21 of 37 patients. In addition, staff at a Sydney aged-care home have called in sick en masse. A 95-year-old woman at Dorothy Henderson Lodge died on Monday, becoming Australia’s second confirmed COVID-19 death. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said his department had to cobble together staff for the lodge, once it became clear existing workers wouldn’t be turning up, fearful of becoming infected themselves. Almost 50 people have tested positive for coronavirus across Australia, and the government has stepped up efforts to avoid outbreaks in aged-care facilities. Royal Australian College of GPs president Harry Nespolon said the incident with the infected doctor underlined the “fragility of the healthcare system”. “If we were to take 40 people out of every hospital, that’s a large amount of healthcare workers that won’t be available to take care of patients,” he told the ABC. “There just isn’t another 40 people just sitting around there waiting to take their place.” Dr Nespolon said GPs were not getting enough support, including equipment such as masks and gowns, to deal with an expected rush of patients and help under-pressure hospitals. “I’ve certainly heard of GPs going to Bunnings to try and buy masks,” he said. “We would rather that healthcare facilities had healthcare-standard masks and that we don’t have to resort to workarounds. “It just underlines the importance of the Government supplying the masks and other personal protection equipment, not only to general practitioners but also, for example, aged care facilities.” In late January, the government authorised the release of a million masks from the national medical stockpile, to be distributed to doctors and health workers via local primary health networks. But several GPs have told the ABC it has still been very difficult to get the masks. Suppliers are sold out, and masks from the national stockpile Melbourne GP Vyom Sharma told the ABC some GPs were essentially “rationing” masks to avoid running out before an influx of coronavirus cases. “Getting our hands on masks has been tricky, to say the least,” Dr Sharma said. “Just for one patient, we might have to go through four masks, and we’ve only got about 50 in our reserve. “We realised very early on that we’d have to source our own masks.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Virus outbreak reshaping work and play around the globe","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/05\/coronavirus-impact-globe\/","transcript":"Italy has closed all schools and universities and Iran has again cancelled Friday prayers as governments scramble to control the spread of coronavirus. With the virus now reported in more than 80 countries, governments around the world are instituting increasingly sweeping measures to insulate against the outbreak. Saudi Arabia has barred citizens from making Hajj – the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca – while Iran has cancelled Friday prayers for a second week. Leaders everywhere are pleading with citizens to put an end to the traditional symbol of mutual trust, the handshake. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also urged people to adopt the Indian greeting of “namaste,” with hands together, rather than a handshake. In Europe, the Italian government decreed on Wednesday (local time) soccer games and other sporting events will take place without fans until at least April 3. The club will play all its games in Italy for the next month behind closed doors. The decision, which covers all Serie A clubs, has been made in the wake of the recent Covid-19 – commonly referred to as coronavirus – outbreak, as a matter of public safety. #ASRoma — AS Roma English (@ASRomaEN) March 4, 2020  Italy is the epicentre of the continent’s coronavirus outbreak. More than 3000 people have been infected and at least 107 have died, the most of any country outside China. It has also closed schools for 8.4 million students until March 15, with at least four other countries – Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Iraq – taking similar action. “I know it’s a decision with an impact … I obviously want my students back in school as soon as possible,” said Education Minister Lucia Azzolina. With the disease ebbing in the place where it began, Italy, Iran and South Korea are confronting deadly, fast-growing clusters of the disease that account for about 80 per cent of new cases outside China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). #AskWHO on #COVID19 vs flu.

In the United States, the death toll has reached 11. Iran has reported 92 deaths among its more than 2900 cases, though many fear the outbreak is far bigger. Among the ill are dozens of members of the government. The Islamic republic has cancelled Friday prayers to avoid public gatherings. “The virus has no wings to fly,” said Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour. “We are the ones who transfer it to each other.” WHO said about 3.4 per cent of people infected with the COVID-19 virus globally have died, making it more lethal than the common flu. But that figure was met to skepticism, with scientists noting large numbers of mild cases have probably gone undetected or unreported. A study last week in the New England Journal of Medicine of data from more than 30 Chinese provinces estimated the death rate at 1.4 per cent. In Daegu, the South Korean city at the centre of that country’s outbreak, a shortage of hospital space means about 2300 patients are being cared for in other facilities while they await a hospital bed. Prime Minister Chung Se-Kyun has sought to assure his country, saying, “We will win the war against COVID-19.” South Korea reported 435 new infections Wednesday, down from 851 a day earlier. More than 5600 people in South Korea have contracted the virus and 32 have died. French soccer officials told players to simply disperse – without shaking hands – after lining up, and referees and coaches will no longer shake hands either.

The 50-year-old man is in custody and being questioned by police after the alleged assault at a Tamworth shopping centre on Thursday morning. The Northern Daily Leader reports police were called to a Big W in the shopping centre just after 10am, after reports a staff member and a customer had been assaulted by a man. The newspaper said the argument was over toilet rolls. Supermarket aisles across the country were again stripped of toilet paper on Thursday. There are also reports of panic-buying of other staples – including hand sanitiser, wipes, pasta and even condoms. Bulk warehouse Costco put limits on toilet paper, milk, eggs, rice and soap products this week after what managing director Patrick Noone described as an influx of customers. On Wednesday, Woolworths slapped a four-pack limit on customers panic-buying trolley loads of toilet paper. The move followed a confrontation at one supermarket in south-western Sydney, when one customer produced a knife, and a stampede at another outlet in Parramatta. Coles followed on Thursday, implementing its own four-pack online and in-store limit for toilet paper. “This will help us maintain stock levels in stores while our suppliers increase local production and our distribution centres increase deliveries,” a spokesperson said. Toilet paper producers have tried to allay fears, saying they have boosted production, while authorities – including Prime Minister Scott Morrison – have urged the public to remain calm. Manufacturer Kimberly-Clark took to Facebook on Wednesday to reassure customers. “We are working around the clock at our mill in South Australia to keep the supermarket shelves stocked with Kleenex Complete Clean toilet paper,” it said. “We won’t be running out anytime soon.”  Australia, don’t panic! We are working around the clock at our mill in South Australia to keep the supermarket shelves… Posted by Kleenex Bathroom Australia on Tuesday, March 3, 2020 Elsewhere, an accident with a semi-trailer on a Queensland highway endangered hundreds of rolls of toilet paper on Wednesday night. The toilet roll-laden truck burst into flames on Brisbane’s Gateway Motorway about 10pm on Wednesday. Police and fire crews were quickly on the scene. “This is not overly common, particularly around the city areas, but the main thing is no one got hurt tonight,” fire officer Justin Francis said. “We believe toilet paper is quite precious at the moment, so we’ve been able to save half the load on this particular truck.” The truck driver escaped the flaming truck without injury. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard described the panic about supermarket staples as “quite ridiculous”, reminding people that any coronavirus quarantine was only for 14 days. “We have amazing supply chains. Woolies, ALDI, Coles – they’re all getting stuff to us,” Mr Hazzard said on Wednesday. “If you have 14 days off, it’s not like you’re going to be there for six months. It’s 14 days. It’s just a bit silly.” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian also called for calm. “We should also go about our business and not panic – and that’s the strongest message we can send,” she said. Ms Berejiklian said there was no issue with toilet paper supply in NSW and the public should refrain from bulk buying. “People should just go about their daily business in terms of the products they purchase,” she said. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Flash flood warnings as deluge lashes Victoria","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/05\/victoria-nsw-heavy-rainfall\/","transcript":"The remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Esther brought a month’s worth of rain to Melbourne on Wednesday night, causing flooded roads and travel disruptions ahead of Thursday morning’s peak hour.

South Korea, Italy and Iran now account for 80 per cent of the new virus cases outside China, according to the World Health Organisation. Italy has taken a drastic step in its bid to stop the coronavirus from further spreading by announcing that it will be closing all schools and universities until March 15. Parents and guardians were issued letters informing them of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s decision which hopes to serve as a preventative measure. In Iran, which has one of the biggest outbreaks, President Hassan Rouhani confirmed COVID-19 has spread to almost all provinces and promised to ensure a “minimum” number of people died from the virus.

The study by an international team of scientists at World Weather Attribution found man-made climate change had increased the bushfire risk by 30 per cent due to a lack of rainfall and higher temperatures in 2019, compared with 30 years ago. “We’re very sure that is a definite number we can scientifically defend,” lead researcher Jan van Oldenborgh wrote. It comes just a day after Nationals Senator Matt Canavan criticised Australian scientists after questioning the CSIRO over whether it could prove climate change had played a role in this summer’s fire weather. CSIRO has said before that \"no studies explicitly attributing the Australian increase in fire weather to climate change have been performed.\" When I asked why this view wasn't included in a recent bushfires \"explainer\", they couldn't explain it. pic.twitter.com\/PejYYTRM4F — Matthew Canavan (@mattjcan) March 4, 2020 While the newly-released report is yet to be peer reviewed, its release is significant because it addresses specific attribution – that is, it demonstrates links between climate change and a particular disaster. Researchers wrote that the devastating early bushfire season was much greater than that predicted by traditional climate modelling. Australian heatwaves were also found to be 1-2 Celsius hotter and 10 times more likely to occur than in 1990. “We can therefore only conclude that anthropogenic climate change has made a hot week like the one in December 2019 more likely by at least a factor of two,” the study wrote. Further analysis released on Thursday shows a decade of insufficient political action on climate change means nations must now do four times the work to stop the planet warming 2  degrees above pre-industrial levels. To meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement, we either need to do four times the work or the same in one-third of the time, research led by Dr Niklas Höhne of the NewClimate Institute and first published in the science journal Nature has found. “The past decade of political failure on climate change has cost us all dear. It has shrunk the time left for action by two-thirds,” Dr Höhne said. “In 2010, the world thought it had 30 years to halve global emissions of greenhouse gases. Today, we know that this must happen in 10 years to minimise the effects of climate change.” The picture is bleak. And made worse by the fact the world is a long way off meeting the Paris requirements – we’re currently heading for 3 degrees of warming.  “The gap is so huge that governments, the private sector and communities need to switch into crisis mode, make their climate pledges more ambitious, and focus on early and aggressive action,” he wrote. “We do not have another 10 years.” By analysing all 10 editions of the annual Emissions Gap Report – which examines what countries have pledged to do, and what they’re actually doing – the group found global annual greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 14 per cent, quickly becoming a ticking time bomb. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required to meet the emissions levels for 2  degrees would have been around two per cent, per year, on average up to 2030. Instead, emissions increased. Consequently, the required cuts from 2020 are now more than seven per cent, per year, on average for 1.5  degrees (close to three per cent for 2  degrees). “Although many reports, scientists and policymakers continue to discuss rises of 2 degrees, it must be emphasised that, in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that warming of more than 1.5  degrees would be disastrous,” he wrote. Two degrees might not sound like a lot, but the consequences will be significant. We can expect more intense storms, searing heatwaves, severe bushfire seasons and longer droughts. If we don’t quickly reduce emissions, more than half the world’s beaches will be gone by 2100, and there will be mass extinction of animals and coral reefs. Climate Council senior researcher Tim Baxter said Australia was on the front line of climate change. “We know that at two degrees, the Great Barrier Reef will more or less not be a thing any more,” he said. “With two degrees, you’re talking about mass bleaching happening at the frequencies it’s unlikely to recover from. Even at 1.5 degrees, it’s getting difficult. “We know that sea levels will rise. There’s some uncertainty about how much, but we know when they rise there’s a bigger storm surge, so it goes further and further up the beach, so more homes are impacted. “What we can say with absolute certainty, is that with the recent drought, the fires, then floods, we’ve seen what climate change looks like, and we’re talking about one-degree warming now.” The consequences are alarming and Australia urgently needs to limit its contribution, Dr Höhne wrote. “Countries are not even on track to achieve their now plainly inadequate 2015 pledges. “Of the G20 countries, seven (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, South Africa and the United States) need to implement existing policy or roll out new measures.” Although challenging, there are signs of hope, the analysis showed. “There are lessons to be learnt from places such as Costa Rica, Shenzhen in China and Copenhagen that have made strides through the use of renewable energy and electrified transport,” Dr Höhne said. “The United Kingdom (together with 75 other parties) and California have at least set ambitious goals to become carbon neutral, which might send signals to industry even before supporting policies are implemented. “Meanwhile, 26 banks have stopped directly financing new coal-fired power plants.” Although it was clear from the science that Australia, the world’s 14th biggest emitter, was not doing enough federally – there is action coming out of the states and territories, Mr Baxter said. “Australia is one of the sunniest and one of the windiest countries on the planet. We are blessed with every resource needed for decarbonisation,” he said. “We have the solutions for at least 80 per cent, it’s just a matter of finding leadership that can bring that about. “It doesn’t have to come from the federal government, you’ve got states who are stepping up. They’re not quite doing it enough but … they’re taking steps.” In November, countries will meet in Glasgow for critical talks on limiting emissions and how they’re going to achieve the Paris Agreement."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Children could be carriers of COVID-19 without even knowing it","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/05\/children-coronavirus\/","transcript":"As the coronavirus spreads across the globe, Australians stockpile toilet paper and doctors run out of masks, parents are naturally worrying about what it could all mean for their kids. In Italy, authorities announced on Thursday morning (Australian time) that schools would be shut as the country tries to contain the rapid spread. None of the protective measures go that far in Australia – so far. But public health experts do have a warning: Children could be unknowingly spreading the novel coronavirus COVID-19 without showing any major symptoms. So far, not one child under the age of 10 has died from the killer virus – not even in China where the outbreak first began. Of more than 44,000 confirmed cases from China, only 416 (less than one per cent) were aged nine years or younger. In Australia, only one child has so far had confirmed COVID-19 infection. That’s unusual for a widespread sickness, with the usual expectation that children and the elderly would be among the most vulnerable. But although it’s too early to tell how exactly the virus is affecting children, infectious disease specialists have confirmed it could be stealthily travelling through them without detection. Associate Professor Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said respiratory viruses were already easily spread from children to their families and throughout schools. “Children could be a source of transmission,” Associate Professor Mackay told The New Daily. “Nothing is stopping them from getting infected, but they don’t seem to be getting as ill.” However, he also stressed there were too many unknowns about the behaviour of COVID-19 to confirm if that’s happening just yet. “On the other hand, because they’re not getting as ill they aren’t coughing and sneezing as much, they may not have much of a role in transmission,” Associate Professor Mackay said. He added the low number of sick children could be due to their “naive immune system”, whereas adults who have experienced coronavirus infections during their lives might experience a supercharged immune reaction.

That means no school camps or study courses outside of Australia. The Victorian, South Australian and Queensland governments haven’t followed suit just yet, but will assess international trips on a case-by-case basis. Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace confirmed to The New Daily she was aware of some schools changing or postponing overseas travel plans due to COVID-19. “At this stage no blanket ban has been imposed with regards to overseas school excursions,” Minister Grace told The New Daily. “Should the advice change to warrant a blanket ban, we will act accordingly.” If the coronavirus outbreak begins to spread rapidly throughout Australia, schools could be temporarily shut down. If that happens, classes will most likely be moved online. But before we panic and close schools across the country, Associate Professor Mackay said we first needed to find out what role children played in spreading the virus. “Shutting down schools would be a huge disruption to the whole community,” Associate Professor Mackay said. “Parents would need to take time out of work to look after their kids, and that would hurt the economy. “It would be a whole lot of waste if children don’t actually transmit (the virus) well.” Show your children how to wash their hands properly, and remind them to do it regularly during the day. That’s the advice from Associate Professor Asha Bowen, a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at Perth Children’s Hospital and infectious diseases researcher at the Telethon Kids Institute. “There have been cases of children who appear to be asymptomatic who have infected other people,” Associate Professor Bowen told The New Daily. “Simple hygiene measures remain our best strategy – that’s hand washing with soap and water, doing it regularly and doing it properly.” She said teaching children “cough etiquette” by showing them how to cough into their elbows instead of their hands would also help protect them from the virus. You should also get them vaccinated against the common flu, she said. It won’t work for COVID-19, but it will help protect children from getting sick during winter."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bettina Arndt misrepresenting men-tality of all the decent blokes around us","date":"03-05-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/05\/bettina-arndt-misrepresenting-decent-blokes\/","transcript":"Bettina Arndt should not be stripped of her membership of the Order of Australia because of her history of attacks on the rights of women, nor her minimisation of violence against them. After all, the controversial sex therapist did not receive the honour for her support of women. Her AM was bestowed in acknowledgement of “a significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men”. And it is on those grounds – specifically, that she has been an effective advocate for men – that Ms Arndt has failed utterly. That is why she does not deserve to be honoured. In February she congratulated a Queensland police officer for his “open mind” when he suggested, perhaps unintentionally, that a man who had murdered Hannah Clarke and the former couple’s three children by burning them alive may have been “driven too far”. Her praise for the officer, who later stood aside, was so callously inappropriate that the Senate voted in favour of a bipartisan motion to have her AM rescinded. Of the 38 male senators, only one – One Nation’s Senator Malcolm Roberts – voted against the motion. Although some weren’t present for the vote, it’s safe to assume the other 37 had no interest in, or need for, Ms Arndt’s style of advocacy. 37-1. As a sample of Australian men drawn from around the nation, that’s a fairly damning indictment. Where are all the men for whom Ms Arndt is supposedly advocating? If there are so few of them, as those numbers suggest, how can it be claimed that she is promoting “gender equity” by serving them? In the media, too, men have made it clear Ms Arndt does not speak for them. David Penberthy, a radio and newspaper commentator who is, by all accounts, a fairly blokey type, castigated Ms Arndt for taking “the minority of cases where divorces end particularly badly for men and conflat[ing] them to present a misleading but apparently broader truth”. “It points to a strange desire to simply be one of the boys, adored as she is by a certain species of elderly chap who thinks his life has been ruined by conniving harpies,” Penberthy wrote. Of course, politicians and journalists are relatively powerful people. They have the confidence to air their views and privileged space in which to do so. But what about the “average” man, the fellow in suburbia, the guy who’s a great co-worker, teammate and friend? Does he need Bettina Arndt telling Australia what he needs, or the sort of behaviour he thinks is acceptable? My mate Dave is one of those men. We’ve known each other for decades, since I was uni student and part-time McDonald’s manager and he was uni student and part-time cinema usher who’d occasionally drop by for a chat while cadging some free fries. For years, we stayed connected through written words alone. As Dave travelled around the world, he would compose epic group emails and, eventually, blog posts, recounting his adventures, heartbreaks, new loves and regular movie reviews. After that horrible day in Brisbane, when a mum lay dying beside a burning car that had trapped her babies, Dave wrote a long Facebook post to his many friends. “When I initially heard about it, I felt nauseous. Later: heartbroken, grief-stricken. Later: enraged. Then I ran that gamut again. Still running it,” he wrote. “The idea that a man might have been “driven too far”, I utterly despise that crap, taking responsibility away from that person for their actions … In a parallel world, there’s a version of me who didn’t manage to control himself one random time of many, and did something violent to a loved one. “My wife and I can both have extremely busy, often stressful days at work, only to arrive home and find things can be MORE stressful there. The kids might be fighting each other, misbehaving, trashing the joint, hungry, screaming. The house is already a bomb site. The air-con is broken, and it’s HOT. The laundry is overflowing from the laundry baskets and the bills are overflowing from the bill tray. “There are a dozen things we need to address; paying bills, chasing tradesmen, organising parties. But things are so intense and exhausting (and loud!), even trying to have a conversation about just one single issue or task can be fraught. “Frustration with the situation can turn into defensiveness with each other. Tempers can fray. Voices can rise…and rise again. I understand why and how people – men and women – get pushed to the edge. “I can see it in my mind’s eye. I can hear my frustrated, whiny voice becoming a louder, more belligerent voice. I can easily hear that belligerent voice becoming an enraged shout. I can easily see that shout becoming an imposing PHYSICAL threat. Becoming a shove. Or a grab. Or a slap. Or worse. “It’s possible. I know people who have gone down that route … And then it happens again. And again. It escalates. It becomes a pattern. It becomes quicker, easier, more seductive, each time. The shout becomes a shove. The shove becomes a slap. The slap becomes something worse. The something worse becomes a headline … “I think knowing I have that capacity is one reason I haven’t committed domestic violence. I learned to control my emotions. And in large part, I conquered them (except for my tears in Pixar movies. I never controlled those). That’s not to say I don’t ever FEEL anger. I do. I just don’t release that anger with aggression. “The Arndts of the world minimise the efforts of “good men” by giving scumbags a free pass and in many cases, celebrating them. “I would never call myself a Good Man but I know that I do hold myself to a higher standard than that. And I actually think that MOST men in this culture are probably as good as, or better than me.” Call them Good Men or just call them decent blokes. They’re out there doing their best every day. And they don’t need Bettina Arndt, or anyone else, lowering the standards for them. Journalist Christine Jackman is the newest columnist to join The New Daily.

It comes after the billionaire media mogul and former New York City mayor failed to win in any of the 14 states that cast votes on Super Tuesday. Securing victory only in American Samoa, a small outlying territory, Mr Bloomberg decided that Joe Biden had the “best shot” at defeating President Donald Trump in the November election. “Three months ago, I entered the race for president to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump – because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult,” Mr Bloomberg said in a statement. “After yesterday’s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible – and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists,” he said. Super Tuesday marked the 78-year-old’s first real test after he skipped earlier nominating contests. Mr Bloomberg underperformed in several states including Oklahoma, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee and parts of Texas. Originally seeking take on Mr Biden as the moderate front-runner, Mr Bloomberg is now working to elect the 2020 presidential candidate because he “fought for working people his whole life”. That’s despite spending his almost limitless wealth to defeat Mr Trump. It’s estimated he forked out about $500 million in total on his Democratic presidential bid. Mr Biden, 77, had a resurgence on Tuesday, winning at least nine states and setting up a two-way race between him and Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic party’s presidential nomination. Also rumoured to be weighing up the decision to drop out of the race is Elizabeth Warren after her campaign manager, Roger Lau wrote to staff on Thursday morning (Australian time), saying the Massachusetts senator is taking time to “assess the path forward”. It comes after she failed to win a single state on Tuesday. “All of us have worked for Elizabeth long enough to know that she isn’t a lifetime politician and doesn’t think like one. She’s going to take time right now to think through the right way to continue this fight,” the email read. “And there’s a lot at stake for this country and the millions of people who are falling further and further behind. This decision is in her hands, and it’s important that she has the time and space to consider what comes next.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Inappropriate’ decor and camera puts focus on FWC deputy Gerard Boyce","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/04\/fair-work-commission-gerard-boyce-figurines\/","transcript":"Fair Work Commission deputy president Gerard Boyce has been forced to remove ‘‘scantily-clad’’ and “erotic” figurines from his office and later installed a surveillance camera and a life-sized cutout of Donald Trump after the complaints. In startling evidence to Senate estimates, Fair Work general manager Bernadette O’Neill revealed that Mr Boyce’s decision to decorate his office with artworks was “inappropriate” but she could not recall if the figure’s breasts were exposed. “My recollection is one was a female figure and the other I am not sure was even human,” Ms O’Neill said. “Scantily clad is probably the way I think of it.” The busty figurines were handcrafted by Mr Boyce and described as an artistic “hobby” of the former barrister. The FWC has agreed to provide to Senate estimates photographic evidence of the erotic artworks. It is believed he had more than 10 and possibly 20 half-clothed female figurines. The New Daily has obtained an image of the Donald Trump cutout in his office, photographed by a FWC whistleblower.

Empty shelves and full trolleys are just fuelling the perception that we’re going to run out of loo rolls, thanks to the spread of coronavirus. Don’t worry about Woolworths enforcing a four pack-per-customer limit. Try not to buy into the tales of supermarket aisle stampedes as the new normal. Don’t set up watch on your porch to protect any deliveries from potential thieves. In a perfect storm of fear, misinformation and psychology, we’re creating an Emperor’s new clothes situation. Except in this case, everyone’s clothed and just copying each other’s shopping habits.  It’s tricky to pinpoint where, how or who started it, but all of a sudden, supermarket shelves have struggled to restock toilet paper as quick as people can buy it. Prime Minister Scott Morrison was even forced to address the issue on Tuesday, telling journalists at a COVID-19 press conference that he’d spoken to the major supermarkets to confirm there were no signs of a shortage on the horizon. Keep calm, Mr Morrison said, there’s plenty of rolls to go around. It all comes down to our brains, Deakin University marketing expert Michael Callaghan said. To fuel a particular kind of group-think consumer behaviour, Dr Callaghan told The New Daily, all you need is a rumour. “All you need to do is whisper something is going to be scarce,” Dr Callaghan said.

He explained: If we go to the supermarket, despite knowing what we need to get, we’re still peeking into others’ trolleys, to make sure we’re not missing out on something. “If you notice everybody’s got three big packs of toilet paper – even if you haven’t seen the news – you think it’s really cheap, or you think something bad’s going on,” he said. “Even the informed will start buying it. It’s that underlying FOMO.” FOMO – the fear of missing out – triggers our fundamental human urge to join the herd, or we’re at risk of experiencing an adversity.

Well, that was unexpected 🤯 pic.twitter.com\/izKA5rdPwB — Who Gives A Crap (@WhoGivesACrapTP) March 3, 2020 The supermarkets’ game plan behind toilet paper doesn’t help, as Associate Professor Gary Mortimer told The New Daily on Tuesday. Toilet paper – a bulky item – takes up a lot of shelf and storage space. So supermarkets don’t keep any more on site than they know is traditionally bought within a 48-hour turnaround. A couple of people buying a couple of extra packs makes the situation (or shelves in this case) look a lot dire than it really is – empty shelves are interpreted as a shortage, which equals panic buying. We’re getting toilet paper FOMO from all angles. If it’s not physically in the shop, it’s thrown at us on social media or traditional media. And it’s not just in Australia. The buy up is happening overseas, too – the US, Europe and even Japan, where bidets are at their most popular. (Coincidentally, 10 Daily has reported that Google searches in Australia for bidets have soared some 350 per cent in the past week.) As politicians and experts warned people to prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate for 14 days, should they start to display coronavirus symptoms or come into contact with someone with the virus, people heard that as “prepare for the end of days”, Dr Callaghan said. “Some people – idiots – got excited and decided they need to race out and stock up to have a year’s supply of toilet paper,” he said. “When you think about it, how long is the recommendation for self-quarantine? Fourteen days. That’s 14 days you might want to have enough supplies on hand for. But how many people are going to use 48 rolls of toilet paper in 14 days?” There’s no need to stockpile or panic about running out of toilet paper. Most of Australia’s toilet paper is produced in South Australia, and while the main companies have amped up their production levels slightly to cope with the demand, we’re assured all is well. The best thing we can do is just breathe, and buy what we need, experts from all sides of the situation have repeatedly said.

Because everyone’s buying up big now, companies are whittling down their storage levels. “But there’s only so many bottoms that need wiping,” Dr Callaghan said. “Soon, people won’t need to buy toilet paper because they’ve got 100 rolls stockpiled in their cupboard.

The Bushire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) was funded after the devastating Black Saturday fires in Victoria in 2009. It works with state emergency service agencies, universities and governments to help Australia better prepare itself for fire seasons, which are expected to become longer and hotter. But it runs out of federal funding after June next year, and the government has said it cannot have its funding extended under the legislation that governs CRCs. On Wednesday, Labor senator Kim Carr echoed calls from experts to provide long-term funding for the centre, arguing it was essential after the deadly summer bushfires. He told the ABC the government needed to use another funding source to keep the centre going in its current form. “We can’t get a more important research project, given what we have just come through,” Senator Carr said. “We have got this enormous threat to this country in terms of increasing numbers of bushfire days, increasing intensity in bushfires. “Surely, if anything brings home to this government just how serious the situation [is], then the summer we have just been through highlights that point.” Senator Carr asked bureaucrats in Senate estimates to explain why the Bushfire CRC had to be wound up “given it has been a fairly active time”. A federal government review of CRCs in 2015 recommended that funding for the centres should be limited to 10 years. “That review made 18 recommendations, they were all accepted by this government, … [including] there would be no extensions to CRCs, they would be limited to 10-year terms,” said David Wilson, a senior bureaucrat with the Department of Industry. The bushfire centre is slated to close on June 31, 2021. Mr Wilson said the CRCs were expected to transition into the corporate and education sectors and continue their work with universities or companies. Mr Wilson said the department recognised the Bushfire CRC had been “highly effective” in bringing together universities, state emergency services and federal government agencies to study fires and natural disasters. But the department told Senate estimates that despite the centre preparing to lose its federal funding, it had not slowed its research efforts, including a world-first study on the mental health of emergency service workers. The Department of Industry’s Jane Urquhart said the CRC had been in active conversations with the Government over future funding collaborations. “Those discussions are very active and future funding from the government would be a matter for consideration,” she said. The Minister for Emergency Management last year told the ABC a decision “not to fund” the centre had not been made."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Ex-WA treasurer faces court charged with domestic violence","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/wa\/2020\/03\/04\/troy-buswell-domestic-violence\/","transcript":"Former Western Australian treasurer Troy Buswell has faced court for the first time, charged with a string of domestic violence offences. Mr Buswell, whose political life was marred by scandals, is facing seven charges, including aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm and unlawful damage. It is alleged he was repeatedly violent towards his partner between April 2015 and December 2019 in the Perth suburbs of Subiaco and Southern River, and in the Vasse region south of the city, which used to be his electorate. One of the attacks is said to have occurred on Valentine’s Day in 2016. The damage charge relates to her door. Mr Buswell faced Perth Magistrates Court on Wednesday, speaking only to say he understood the charges. The 53-year-old is the chief executive of soil and mulch company Eclipse Soils. A spokesman said last month he had gone on leave “for health and family reasons”. Mr Buswell joined the WA parliament in 2005 but quit politics in 2014 after revelations he had a string of car crashes while returning home from a wedding, seemingly intoxicated. He was convicted of 11 traffic offences, fined, paid for damage and was disqualified from driving for one year. He was not charged with drink-driving because he did not have a breathalyser test.

Health authorities in NSW have confirmed the woman in her 50s is an aged-care worker at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in north-western Macquarie Park. She is the third person to be infected via human-to-human transmission in Australia, with all three cases in NSW. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the woman had contact with 13 lodge residents, two of whom subsequently reported respiratory symptoms. One of them, a 95-year-old woman, has since died. “Whether or not it was related to corona, we don’t know at this point,” Mr Hazzard said. The other residents are in isolation. Mr Hazzard said the worker had not recently travelled outside Australia, but began experiencing flu-like symptoms from about February 24. She was in a good condition in hospital, he said. NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant rejected the suggestion the Macquarie Park facility needed to be in full lockdown and said infection control staff visited on Tuesday night. She said the centre had already taken a “lot of steps” to raise infection control. The coronavirus has a death rate of up to 15 per cent for elderly sufferers, compared to children who seem to survive it. Australia’s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has told Senate estimates the majority of sufferers will “barely notice it”. Meanwhile, multiple patients and 40 staff from Ryde Hospital remain in quarantine after coming into contact with a 52-year-old doctor diagnosed with COVID-19. Dr Chant said the doctor had had contact with a “diverse range of patients”. The two workers are among six additional people to test positive for COVID-19 in NSW in the past 24 hours as cases have spiked across Australia. NSW now has 15 infections. NSW Health is also alerting passengers who were on five flights from Asia in the past week after two men in their 30s, a man in his 50s and two women in their 60s tested positive following their arrival in NSW. They travelled from Iran, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned the number of COVID-19 cases was likely to rise further in coming days. Victoria confirmed a 10th case of coronavirus on Wednesday. State Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said a man in his 30s became unwell on Sunday after returning to Victoria from Iran on February 26. In Queensland, a 26-year-old Logan man recently returned from Iran was the state’s 11th confirmed COVID-19 case. He is in isolation in the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane in a stable condition. South Australian confirmed its fourth case on Wednesday – a 40-year-old woman who recently travelled from Iran, via Kuala Lumpur. Her young child is also being tested for the virus. Tasmania also has its first case of confirmed COVID-19. The 40-year-old man, who tested positive after returning from Iran is in hospital in Launceston. Health authorities also have concerns about his visit to a local Woolworths before he went into quarantine. “The man did visit the supermarket after being provided with information about self-quarantine,” state public health director Mark Veitch said on Wednesday. Dr Veitch said the risk to other people in the supermarket was low. However, he said anyone who was at the supermarket when the man was there should visit their GP or a hospital if they felt unwell. The latest cases come as authorities pleaded with shoppers to stop hoarding toilet paper after supermarket shelves were emptied across Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians to “help each other” and lower general anxiety levels. “I can understand why people may be concerned,” he said. “But the advice is that’s not necessary.” Mr Morrison said he spoke to supermarket bosses on Wednesday about the panic-buying. “They’ve been putting things in place to ensure that they get those shelves stocked up again and all the rest of it,” he said. “People can just go about their business.

California has 415 delegates at stake, the biggest haul on the electoral map, while Texas comes in second with 261 delegates.  Mr Sanders’ campaign has long seen the nation’s most populous state as a critical early contest and has had droves of volunteers organising events across the state.

It was increasingly looking like a two-man race. The former vice president and the three-term senator took aim at each other in duelling victory speeches on Tuesday night. “People are talking about a revolution. We started a movement,” Mr Biden charged in Los Angeles, knocking one of Mr Sanders’ signature lines. Mr Sanders swiped at Mr Biden from a victory speech in Burlington, Vermont. “You cannot beat Trump with the same-old, same-old kind of politics,” Mr Sanders declared, ticking down a list of past policy differences with Mr Biden on Social Security, trade and military force. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); Meanwhile Michael Bloomberg and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii won their first delegates thanks to American Samoa. The island has six Democratic delegates and their caucus awarded five to Mr Bloomberg and one to Ms Gabbard, who hails from Hawaii. After gaining so little traction in Super Tuesday voting, Mr Bloomberg will reassess his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. According to TV ad spending data obtained by The Associated Press, Bloomberg spent nearly $US180 million on television advertising alone in the 14 Super Tuesday states as of this past weekend. In states like Virginia and Alabama, Bloomberg’s massive ad spending did little to stop Mr Biden from seizing victory. Bloomberg had spent more than $US12 million in Virginia, with 99 delegates at stake, since entering the race. In Alabama, Bloomberg spent more than $US6 million on television advertising, with more than $US1 million in the 10 days leading up to the election. He’s also been spending tens of millions on digital advertising, all guided by a secretive digital firm called Hawkfish that Mr Bloomberg himself founded last spring that provides the campaign with digital ad services, including “content creation, ad placement and analytics,” according to a campaign spokesperson. But the onslaught of ads seemed unable to make up for the damage inflicted by his opponents – and his own poor performance – during his first primary debate, in Las Vegas last month. It was a similarly disappointing day for Elizabeth Warren, who was defeated by Mr Biden and Mr Sanders in her home state of Massachusetts. The disappointing finish in the state she represents, and a weak showing in other Super Tuesday states, marked a striking collapse for the one-time darling of progressives. Massachusetts was considered a must-win state for Ms Warren, and election officials predicted high turnout for the Super Tuesday vote. Nearly 230,000 voters took advantage of early voting last week, the first time the state has allowed early voting in a presidential primary. -with AP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Virus warning for Iranian community","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/04\/coronavirus-iran-australia\/","transcript":"Australia’s health department may advise members of the Iranian community to avoid local Iranian New Year’s Celebrations due to the coronavirus.

Iran has the highest death toll in the world after China, the epicentre of the outbreak. Iran has reported 978 confirmed cases of the virus with 54 resulting deaths. Across the Middle East, there are more than 1150 cases of the new coronavirus, the majority of which are linked back to Iran. *Latest OS video* – on just what is happening with #coronavirus in Iran?

Health authorities in NSW have confirmed the woman in her 50s is an aged-care worker at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park. She is the third person to be infected via human-to-human transmission in Australia, with all three cases in NSW. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the woman had contact with 13 residents of the home, two of whom subsequently reported respiratory symptoms. One of those two residents, a 95-year-old woman, has died. “Whether or not it was related to corona, we don’t know at this point,” Mr Hazzard said. Eleven residents at the home are now in isolation. The coronavirus has a death rate of up to 15 per cent for elderly sufferers, compared to children who seem to survive it. Australia’s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has told Senate estimates the majority of sufferers will “barely notice it”. The horror scenario of a coronavirus being spread at an aged-care home has already been war-gamed by Australian authorities. There are plans to put aged-care facilities into quarantine lockdown, if necessary, to avoid the virus spreading further. The affected woman worked at a nursing home near Macquarie University in northern Sydney. Meanwhile, multiple patients and 40 staff from Ryde Hospital remain under quarantine after coming into contact with a 52-year-old doctor diagnosed with COVID-19. Victoria also confirmed a 10th case of coronavirus on Wednesday. State Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said a man in his 30s became unwell on Sunday after returning to Victoria from Iran on February 26. The latest cases come as authorities plead with shoppers to stop hoarding toilet paper. Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians to “help each other” and lower the anxiety levels. “Australians can go about their business. Unless you’ve been in an affected area – they’re the ones that shouldn’t then go and be at a place of mass gathering, or something like that,” he said. “But the rest of us, we just go on about our lives as normal. And I can understand why people may be concerned, and go to supermarkets, and do those sorts of things. But the advice is that’s not necessary.” Mr Morrison said he spoke to supermarket bosses on Wednesday about the panic-buying. “They’ve been putting things in place to ensure that they get those shelves stocked up again and all the rest of it,” he said. “It’s a serious issue, but we’re on top of it, as is the state government in New South Wales, and Queensland, and other places. And people can just go about their business. That is what you can do, most importantly to help the economy, to help each other, and to lower the anxiety levels.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Tenth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Victoria","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/2020\/03\/04\/tenth-coronavirus-victoria\/","transcript":"A tenth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Victoria. The state’s Health Minister Jenny Mikakos confirmed a man in his 30s became unwell on Sunday after returning from Iran on February 26. The diagnosis came after a man went to an emergency department following a conversation with a nurse on call. His positive test result confirmed late on Tuesday. He has been in self-isolation at home after being told by the nurse and hospital that he may have the condition and has since reported being almost symptom-free. Ms Mikakos noted the development highlights how young people are able to recover from the condition at home in a relatively quick period of time. Victoria is yet to have a case of local transmission of the virus. The minister has also echoed Premier Daniel Andrews’ sentiment on Tuesday that people don’t need to stockpile goods amid fears over the virus. “We want people to go about living their lives normally.

The explanation didn’t wash with Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, who said the government had spent months hiding information about handouts before the 2019 federal election. “This is like pulling teeth,” he told ABC radio on Wednesday. Mr Albanese said the Prime Minister was “up to his neck” in the sports rorts affair and accused him of misleading parliament. “I want him to actually treat the Parliament seriously and to tell the truth and to say what the involvement of his office was,” he said. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Sport Australia admitted giving incorrect evidence to a Senate committee about the timing of the final decision on the Morrison government’s “sports rorts” program. And a minister revealed staff from Mr Morrison’s office visited him late on Tuesday to talk about his appearance in a Senate committee investigating the issue on Wednesday. Sport Australia originally told a Senate hearing that then-sports minister Bridget McKenzie sent it the final list of projects for funding under the controversial $100 million community sport grants program on April 11, 2019 – about 20 minutes after the federal election was called. But, on Monday, the audit office told senators that list changed more than three hours later. A second final version was sent to Sport Australia at 12.43pm. On Wednesday, Labor frontbencher Katy Gallagher confronted Sport Australia chief operating officer Luke McCann about the discrepancy. “Your evidence on that day was clearly not correct, was it?” she said. “No senator,” he replied. “On the day we took an undertaking within the committee to answer the question, I received a message from my office that indicated it was 8.46 [am]. “In hindsight, we should have taken that on notice and done a more thorough search.” Mr McCann’s team found the later emails during a search over the weekend and let him know mid-morning on Monday. He read the note early on Tuesday – but was still to correct the record of his evidence on Wednesday. Nor did he bring copies of the April 11 emails to the hearing on Wednesday. “It is very convenient that you’ve appeared today without these key documents, Mr McCann. Are you withholding information from this committee?” Senator Gallagher said. Ms McCann denied that and described the updated information as “a change in attachment not a change in brief”. Labor is pursuing the question of the timing of Senator McKenzie’s approval of the grants because under the caretaker conventions governments are not supposed to make major decisions during an election period. Mr McCann said Sport Australia had taken advice from the health department’s legal team about caretaker rules. He met Sport Minister Richard Colbeck on Tuesday to discuss the Wednesday estimates appearance. Senator Colbeck also revealed two of Mr Morrison’s staffers came to his office on Tuesday night to discuss the grants program. “There was a clear understanding that there was a difference in the evidence provided by Sport Australia and the ANAO and that would have to be resolved,” he said. Senator Gallagher asked if he had advised the PM’s staff of this. “They were already aware of it,” he said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Brazil pummelled by deadly torrential rains and landslides","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/04\/brazil-landslides-rain\/","transcript":"A storm that lashed Brazil’s southeastern coast has caused landslides and killed at least 18 people, with dozens more missing.

In one of the more unusual burglaries officers are investigating this week, a persistent thief spent nearly three hours trying to hook an expensive piece of jewellery from a mannequin in a city shop.

NSW Health confirmed the woman had not travelled abroad recently and contracted the virus from another carrier, bringing the total number of infections statewide to 15. It comes as two more people in NSW tested positive to COVID-19 overnight, adding to the four others who were diagnosed in the past 24 hours. A NSW Health spokesperson described the recent increase of cases as “rapid”. Details have also been released of the five Sydney-bound flights which had passengers who were later confirmed as having contracted the virus, including a man from Iran who tested positive overnight. Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned the number of cases is likely to go up in the next few days. “What is scary on this situation is that the vaccine is not yet developed but we ask everybody to stay calm, to go about business and to stay updated the NSW health website is giving our citizens in NSW timely information,” she told Nine’s Today Show on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old male doctor who tested positive Monday afternoon after contracting the virus from a patient is in a stable condition at Westmead Hospital. The health worker is “going quite well”, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told the Nine Network on Tuesday. NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said he had worked at Ryde Hospital and had been in contact with a “diverse range of patients”. Thirteen doctors, 23 nurses and four other health workers have been identified as close contacts of the doctor and are in home isolation. A further eight patients of the doctor are showing no symptoms, while 29 other patients identified as casual contacts are being chased up. The coronavirus has spread to Ukraine, Morocco and Indonesia as global infections surge past 92,000 and the death toll exceeds 3100. The number of cases in Italy, alone, jumped to 2502 from 2036 the previous day, resulting in a 22-per-cent spike in infections. Of the total, 79 patients have died and 160 have recovered from the virus. Some 1263 people are in hospital, including 229 under intensive care, while 1000 have mild symptoms or none at all and are expected to shake off the virus under isolation at home. Meanwhile, a coughing Pope Francis, who canceled his attendance at a week-long Lenten retreat because of a cold, has been confirmed as not suffering from “symptoms related to other pathologies”, spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement. About 3.4 per cent of reported coronavirus patients have died, World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. As a percentage, seasonal flu, which infects hundreds of thousands each year worldwide, kills far fewer. But the coronavirus outbreak could be controlled, he said. “To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained.” President Donald Trump said he was considering suspending travel to “badly affected” counties. “We don’t want to do that, but we’re looking at other countries and we’re being very stringent,” he said. “We’re watching Italy very closely, South Korea very closely, even Japan very closely, and we’ll make the right determination at the right time.” Mr Trump promised to donate his salary from the last quarter of 2019 to the Department of Health and Human Services which has been working on controlling the spread.

Your credit card is costing us freedom","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/04\/garry-linnell-cash-ban\/","transcript":"They were wearing dark clothes and sunglasses when they walked into our home with a canvas bag containing more than $15,000 in cash. It was time to make the deal. We tried some small talk, but their English was terrible and they didn’t like to make eye contact. International university students, we figured, with a rich daddy back home paying the bills. So we sat with them at the dining table in silence. Good thing, too. Hard enough counting hundreds of crisp bank notes without being distracted by meaningless conversation. It took more than half an hour and a couple of recounts. But the money was right. We shook hands and took them into the garage. Within minutes they were gone. We were cashed up and they had themselves a decent second-hand car. Got a problem with that? Our government does. It wants to pass legislation banning cash transactions of more than $10,000, with penalties including two-year jail sentences and fines of $25,000 for a first offence. The proposed law, which at this stage is being opposed by the cross-bench but crucially supported by Labor, is the culmination of a lengthy taskforce investigation into Australia’s estimated $50 billion black economy. It also happens to be a breathtaking intrusion into our privacy, our civil liberties and our right to do what we like with our money. Of course, if you happen to be a part of that wonderfully compliant majority of Australians, then you have already swallowed the argument put forward by supporters of this crackdown. In case you haven’t heard it or are one of those rare people who have never had a tradie cut his fee for a cash payment, undisclosed cash transactions are robbing ordinary Australians of a “fair go”. Those who are not paying their share of tax are undermining the collection of the GST. As a result, government services ranging from assistance payments to road repairs are severely affected. Now that is a sound and reasonable argument, although it does ignore a fair amount of evidence that much of the cash from this shadow world eventually trickles back into the regular economy. And if you think your tradesman shaving $50 off his bill if you pay him cash is costing this country billions, you’re sadly mistaken. Most are too busy drowning in a sea of paperwork and red tape and trying to collect overdue payments – often from much larger companies that consistently refuse to pay their bills until the last possible moment. But who doesn’t hate a tax cheat when most of us have spent our working lives handing over unreasonably high levels of our income to provide the facilities demanded by an advanced western society? The justification for this proposed legislation falls apart when you consider the sheer hypocrisy at play. This is a country where an endless number of multinational corporations continually fleece billions of dollars from the economy – money that might have added another wing to your local hospital or fixed that dangerous pothole at the end of your street. But reforming our outdated and unfair tax system, or even clamping down on the intricate tax avoidance and minimisation schemes of Google, Facebook and that ever-growing gang of white collar thieves, is far too hard for the small-change politicians who run this country. If they promised to trace the trillions of dollars being digitally funnelled into countless shell companies around the world by cyber criminals, instead of treating all of us with the same suspicion reserved for drug czars and dope-running bikie gangs, then perhaps we might excuse this latest intrusion into our private lives. But why attempt such a big and daunting task when you can simply apply an absurd and petty cap of $10,000 on all cash transactions in this country and give the banks another free kick? Last week the Queen of the Tin Foil Hat Brigade, Pauline Hanson, said she was opposed to such “unbelievable and controlling legislation”. This is one of those rare moments when she is right. The Army of the Compliant support the government’s proposed crackdown on paying cash by arguing that fewer and fewer Australians are using cash. No one can dispute that. According to the Reserve Bank, cash payments in this country decreased by almost half in the decade to 2016 and that rate has only quickened in the past four years. We live in a tap-and-go society, where most of us pay our bills with a wave of our mobile phones. I can’t remember the time I carried more than $50 in my wallet. Might have been that evening five years ago when we sold that car we no longer wanted. But that is beside the point. This is a country where cash – your hard-earned cash – remains legal tender. I have an 80-year-old relative who refuses to have a credit or debit card. He only ever uses cash, which he withdraws on his fortnightly visit to the bank. He has never transferred money online – never will – and he likes it that way. So while paper money continues to circulate, the notion of restricting a law-abiding individual’s right to choose how they use it is nothing short of appalling. Might be time to update our national anthem. Australia is certainly no longer young. And for all our toil, we are no longer going to be free to choose how to spend our wealth.

Mr Biden, Michael Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and underdog Tulsi Gabbard remain in the race to take on Mr Trump in November’s election. So far, Ms Gabbard has not secured a single pledged delegate in any of the first four Democratic primary races, nor has she polled enough to appear on stage for a debate.

Candidates need at least 1991 pledged delegates to win the Democratic nomination in the first round of voting at the party’s nominating convention in June. About one-third of all pledged delegates will be decided on Tuesday alone. Early indications were the candidate with the best chance of doing that is Senator Sanders, who is leading in the polls. But if the election of Mr Trump in 2016 has taught us anything about American politics, it’s that anything is possible. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Scientists work around the clock but coronavirus vaccine will take a year","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/04\/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline\/","transcript":"The race is on to fast-track an injection that could protect Australian doctors from patients sick with coronavirus. In one of the first signs that COVID-19 is being spread on Australian soil, rather than people returning from overseas holidays, a 53-year-old doctor from Sydney’s west was diagnosed with the deadly virus. It’s not known exactly how he caught it, but health professionals believe it was most likely transmitted when he was seeing patients. The news has further spurred on scientists in Victoria and Queensland, who are working in separate teams on multiple experiments to discover a vaccine. They are racing around the clock to develop not just a regular vaccine that can be given to children in the future, but one that will keep front-line health workers safe. Doherty Institute director Professor Sharon Lewin said the temporary protection – known as a ‘passive vaccine’ – used antibodies from people who had recovered from the virus to keep our GPs and nurses safe. “What it does is trick your immune system, so you’re protected if you’re exposed,” Professor Lewin said. “Passive use of antibodies could feasibly protect you from an infection, but it will only last weeks or months. So it would be useful for health care workers.” In trials, a drug used to treat HIV – Kaletra – and a newer one developed to treat Ebola – Remdesivir – have shown promising signs against the virus. But the vaccine will take at least a year to develop, meaning the cases of COVID-19 will likely have died down by the time it is ready. Developing a vaccine is still vital as the virus is likely to enter our regular cocktail of seasonal viruses, as swine flu did. “We need to prepare for that to happen,” Professor Lewin said. “At the moment we’re engaged in public management, quarantining, quick extradition – these are all things we can do well, but many other countries, low- and middle-income countries, will struggle. The most effective way to treat this is to prevent infections. “And even if it’s all over, we’ll have very important information that could be used in the future. “It’s still an experimental approach. One year is our goal. We’re hoping we’ll get there.” The short answer: Safety. The danger of distributing an ineffective vaccine, or worse a harmful one is not worth rushing onto shelves in a frantic effort to beat COVID-19. Professor Ben Cowie, an infectious disease specialist at the Peter Doherty Institute, said all vaccines had to undergo a series of tests before they were deemed safe – no matter how urgently they were needed. First, a vaccine had to pass ethical oversight tests, government safety assessments and animal testing studies before it was trialled on healthy humans, he said. After that, the vaccine needs to pass a series of approvals before it is tested again using pre-clinical and clinical trials. “This process takes months to years, not a week,” Professor Cowie said. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); “If the vaccine is not effective, that’s a big problem. But if it’s harmful, then it could undermine people’s faith in vaccination in general.” He said, “fraudulent science” spread by anti-vaxxers was already a big problem. Last year, the US had its biggest measles outbreak in 25 years, despite the contagious disease being declared eliminated in 2000. The number of cases was highest in communities with low vaccination rates. Like COVID-19, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began in China. It is also believed to have come from bats. From 2002 to 2003, the deadly pneumonia-like disease threw the world into chaos, claiming the lives of nearly 800 people in multiple countries and infecting thousands more. As the epidemic spread to more and more countries, scientists worked furiously to deliver a vaccine. But before they had an opportunity to finish the job, the disease declined and started behaving more like a seasonal flu. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https:\/\/e.infogram.com\/js\/dist\/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); No cases of SARS have been reported since 2003. So what happened? After SARS peaked, the disease stabilised and entered a “steady state” in the same way that swine flu did in 2009 and the Hong Kong flu of the 1960s. Now, they are known as common flu. “Coronaviruses – all of which probably came from animals in our past –  enter that endemic steady state,” Professor Cowie said. “But prior to that, there is a period of time when COVID-19 will achieve a pandemic level of transmission and a substantial proportion of the population will be affected. “The most likely outcome is that COVID-19 will spread worldwide then will probably become of the viruses that causes a common cough or cold at wintertime as other coronaviruses have.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Swinger couple given record WA child abuse jail sentence","date":"03-04-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/04\/swinger-couple-child-abuse-jail\/","transcript":"WARNING: This story contains graphic content that some readers may find upsetting A pedophile couple who drugged and abused their young children, sometimes during swingers’ sex sessions that were recorded, have been handed the longest jail sentences ever imposed in WA for child sex offences. The 41-year-old mother of the children was given a sentence of 28 years, while her 47-year-old partner was given 26 years in prison. The couple, who cannot be named to protect the identity of their victims, pleaded guilty to a string of offences, some of which cannot be reported at this time. The District Court was told the couple, who were members of the swingers’ scene, were in a de facto relationship, but the woman’s two young children regarded the man as their father and called him “dad”. The woman was also a prostitute and worked from the family home. She will have to serve 26 years and he must serve 24 years before they will be eligible for release on parole. The couple’s crimes came to light in 2018 when a member of the public found a memory card containing two recordings in a short-term rental property and handed it in to police. The recordings, which were previously described by a judge as “depravity of the highest order”, showed the couple and other adult men repeatedly sexually abusing the woman’s daughter, who was then aged about eight. The discovery led to the girl disclosing to police that she and her younger brother had been subjected to repeated abuse by their parents. She was also forced to take part in sex sessions with other adults, including two separate occasions involving women she said were named “Claire” and “Jody”. The sessions usually started with the watching of pornographic movies and sometimes involved the girl and her brother being given a “stupefying substance”, which it was believed was methylamphetamine. The District Court was told the abuse started when the girl was aged about five and her brother three, and lasted for about four years. The girl, who is now in her teens and watched Tuesday’s proceedings via video link in another location, said the first time it happened was after she had a nightmare and went to her parents’ bedroom seeking comfort. Another occasion was on her seventh birthday, when the court was told the man said to her he “had a surprise” for her. She was then abused by him, her mother and two other adult males. As well as abusing his two stepchildren, the man admitted repeatedly molesting the two daughters he had from a previous relationship. That abuse also happened when those girls were aged between four and seven. Judge Bruce Goetze described the couple’s crimes as “horrendous”, “depraved” and “perverted”, saying the couple had shown no regard “whatsoever” for their victims. He said the recording of the then eight-year-old girl indicated she was familiar with what was happening. “[The girl] is seen to be completely submissive. She was completely aware of what was going to happen and completely submissive,” he said. “She was wholly corrupted into accepting this horrendous conduct as being normal. It is not. It is depraved and perverted.” Judge Goezte said the crimes were an enormous breach of trust, as the couple had allowed other adults to offend against the children when, as their parents, they should have been protecting and caring for them. Victim impact statements were provided by the man’s two biological daughters, one of whom said she felt “guilty” because, if the crimes against her had been dealt with, the man may not have gone on to commit the offences against his stepchildren. But the judge said the victims should feel no shame nor guilt. “They deserve our sympathy and respect for having emerged from the offending,” he said. “They can hold their heads up high and be proud of themselves for their achievements.” –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Excessive secrecy’ question riles PM Scott Morrison","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/03\/leigh-sales-pm-scott-morrison-7-30\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison has clashed with the ABC’s Leigh Sales during a testy interview in which she questioned his “excessive secrecy” over his trip to Hawaii, the sports rorts affair and his links with Hillsong Pastor Brian Houston.

Sales asked if his secrecy was a problem with voters. “Back to the trust question. You want Australians to trust you. Does this excessive secrecy help that?” Sales asked. “I don’t accept the assertion you are putting to me. You are making accusations … Like the Labor Party does,” the Prime Minister said. “I just gave three examples.

In relation to one of those matters I could have been more candid at the time about it. I wish I was. Frankly, it wasn’t a big deal,” he said. When Sales tried to get him to answer a question again and said sorry when she pressed the point, the Prime Minister offered an acid response. “No, you can interrupt,” he replied. \"The National Audit Office reviewed this matter, made recommendations and we adopted all of them and the minister resigned.\" – Prime Minister @ScottMorrisonMP on the sports grants saga. #abc730 #auspol pic.twitter.com\/ZpqLMoUMxs — abc730 (@abc730) March 3, 2020 Earlier, he told 2GB’s Ben Fordham that Pastor Houston’s name was put forward and he didn’t know what the controversy was about. “I’ve known Brian for a long time and Hillsong Church has a very big network of churches all across the United States and the ministry when it comes to the music, and so many other things have been very big – it’s probably the single largest church organisation that is known in the United States,” Mr Morrison said. “So, Brian Houston actually turned up to the White House a few months later, at the invitation directly of the White House. “On that occasion, we put forward a number of names that included Brian, but not everybody whose names we put forward were invited. “So I’m not quite sure what the accusation is about that.” .@leighsales: \"How is it possible that you don't have an economic centrepiece beyond a slogan for jobs and growth?\"Prime Minister @ScottMorrisonMP: \"Well I completely reject that.\"#abc730 #auspol pic.twitter.com\/oZVwrR75sa — abc730 (@abc730) March 3, 2020 Fordham then said it was relevant because Pastor Houston was under police investigation over his handling of allegations of sex abuse involving his father, Frank Houston.

And that’s what I think, that’s where the matter rests.” In September, The New Daily revealed that Mr Houston remains under police investigation for failing to report his father’s sexual abuse of children. NSW Police has confirmed that Pastor Houston remains the subject of a probe over his handling of sex crimes committed by his father. In July, NSW police confirmed, “the matter continues to be investigated by officers attached to The Hills Police Area Command”. “No further comment will be made while the investigation is ongoing,” police said. One victim, Brett Sengstock, has previously told 60 Minutes that Frank Houston climbed into his bed for five years until he was 12 and it felt “like he was murdered”. Frank Houston confessed to the crimes after his son confronted him, but Brian Houston is accused of not reporting the matter to police. Frank Houston, the founder of the Hillsong Church, was censured by the Royal Commission into the Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. “We are satisfied that, in 1999 and 2000, Pastor Brian Houston and the national executive of the Assemblies of God in Australia did not refer the allegations of child sexual abuse against Mr Frank Houston to the police,” the commissioners wrote in their report. “We consider that a conflict of interest first arose when Pastor Brian Houston decided to respond to the allegations by confronting his father while simultaneously maintaining his roles as national president (of the Assemblies of God in Australia) and senior pastor. “The commissioners express the view that the NSW executive failed to appoint a contact person for the complainant, interview the complainant, have the state or national executive interview the alleged perpetrator, or record any of the steps it took.” At the time of the original reports, the PM’s office did not deny the claim but noted that an official invitation to the state dinner was at the discretion of the White House. At a press conference at the White House, Mr Morrison refused to comment on whether he had sought to include him on the invitation list. “I don’t comment on gossip, honestly,” Mr Morrison said. “It’s all gossip. I think I’ve answered the question.” Brian Houston, founder of the multibillion-dollar pentecostal Hillsong Church, told The New Daily that he never discussed the prospect of going to the White House with “the Prime Minister, or anyone else”. “Hillsong Church received no inquiry from any party as to my details or availability,” he said. “As far as I’m concerned, this is baseless rumour and totally false news. “It is extremely disappointing that media outlets spread these unfounded rumours, and attempts to link this untrue story to the royal commission are unconscionable.” Frank Houston is accused of abusing up to nine boys in Australia and New Zealand."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"PM urges banks to pass on rate cuts, shoppers clear supermarket shelves","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/2020\/03\/03\/scott-morrison-banks-coronavirus\/","transcript":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged the big banks to “do the right thing” after the Reserve Bank announced an emergency interest rate cut to protect the economy from the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank moved quickly to pass on the rate cut to home-owners after the RBA cut official interest rates by 0.25 per cent. The RBA has slashed the official cash rate to a record low of 0.5 per cent. Tuesday’s cut will save $40 a month for the holder of a $300,000 mortgage. The Prime Minister urged banks to “do their bit” to support Australians face the economic threat as he revealed he was working with supermarkets to deal with panic buying of non-perishables. “There is no doubt that if the bank were to take a decision today on cash rates that the government would absolutely expect the four big banks to come to the table and to do their bit in supporting Australians as we go through the impact of the coronavirus,” he said. “I don’t see it as any different to what Qantas did when we called out to Qantas and we said, we need your help. We need to get some people out of China. We need to get some people out of Japan. And Qantas showed up. “I would expect [the banks] would do the right thing by those Australians who are looking to see any support that the Reserve Bank would be seeking to provide at this time.” Tuesday’s rate cut follows the first human-to-human transmission of the virus in Australia, involving a western Sydney doctor. Earlier, Attorney-General Christian Porter flagged using tough biosecurity laws to detain suspected coronavirus sufferers to fight the spread of the infection. Under existing laws, the government already has the power to detain people infected with the virus. Mr Porter said the public should prepare for those laws to be activated. “It is likely that the laws will get used on a larger scale and it is very likely that Australians will encounter practices and instructions and circumstances that they have not had to encounter before,” he told ABC Radio National on Tuesday. “There could be the declaration of what are called human health response zones, and that could mean there are specific requirements for screening measures for people going in and out of such a zone.” Mr Hunt said the search was on for anyone who might have come in contact with Australians who have contracted the virus. “They’re now conducting what’s called a full-contact tracing. Contact tracing means that, as it sounds, they’re reaching out, working through all of the people that the individual has been in contact with, which is what we’ve done with all of the Australian cases,” he said. “There are now 33 Australian cases and an initial 15 from Wuhan or associated with Wuhan, all of whom cleared the virus, 10 from the Diamond Princess – six of those 10 have cleared the virus and have returned home. “Very sadly, of course, we’ve lost James Kwan, a 78-year-old man from Western Australia, and now we have the eight cases that have emerged in the last week within the community – seven from Iran and this one case of the health worker in NSW. More than 10,000 tests for coronavirus have been conducted in Australia for the 33 positive results. Mr Hunt urged Australians to remain calm and said there was no need to stockpile food or medical supplies. “As a nation, as a community, we’re all in this together,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘A great loss’: AAP Newswire to shut in June after owners decide no longer sustainable | The New Daily","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/03\/aap-newswire-close-june\/","transcript":"Australia’s AAP Newswire will close after 85 years of supplying content to national and global newspapers, broadcast outlets and digital editions.

Jaymes Todd was ordered to serve at least 35 years behind bars for the murder of the 22-year-old in a Melbourne park in 2018, but faces the prospect of never getting out of jail. He’s challenging the life sentence in Victoria’s Court of Appeal, arguing it is excessive. Justice Stephen Kaye sentenced him last year, describing his attack on Ms Dixon as “pure and unmitigated evil”. Ms Dixon had spent the night at a comedy club in the city and was close to home when she was raped and murdered by Todd in Carlton North’s Princes Park. He had stalked her for more than an hour before attacking her close to her home. “This was a serious crime, a dreadful crime. It required very stern punishment,” Justice Phillip Priest said on Tuesday. Todd is appearing by videolink from prison, where he is being held in protective custody. His lawyer Daniel Gurvich QC said he accepted the enormity of Todd’s crimes warranted long sentences, but not as long as what he received. “The crimes committed were heinous and horrific, and there’ll be no attempts to minimise the seriousness,” he said. He’s argued there are eight mitigating factors that should have resulted in a shorter sentence, including the fact Todd was only 19 at the time of the killing. He had also pleaded guilty, made admissions to police, had an otherwise good character and experienced disadvantage during his upbringing. Todd has been diagnosed with a mild form of autism and has been in protective custody since his arrest, Mr Gurvich added. Todd has also been diagnosed with a sexual sadism disorder, which Justice David Beach said was a “potent” indicator of a person’s likelihood of reoffending. There is no known effective treatment for the disorder. Mr Gurvich challenged Justice Beach’s claim it would be speculation to say there might be some treatment developed in the future. “It would be sheer speculation to say that there would not, sheer speculation to say he would reoffend in the same or similar way in 35, 40 or 50 years,” he said. “Nobody should be punished for offences they might commit in the future.” Brendan Kissane QC said prosecutors had argued at sentencing that a shorter sentence could be imposed and that remained true. “It’s not the prosecutor’s task to impose sentences, it’s the judge’s task. He rejected that submission, he rejected it in no uncertain terms,” he said.

Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said authorities were trying to trace all those the man had had contact with since returning to Brisbane. In Melbourne, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews warned Australia’s current containment strategy for coronavirus would eventually have to be modified. “If we get to what many believe to be an inevitable pandemic phase – so where containment no longer works and we finish up with more and more transmission at a local level – we’ll have tens of thousands of people who will need care,” Mr Andrews said on Tuesday. “Some will be able to get that care in primary care settings, some may need because of underlying conditions or the severity of their case, they’ll need to be admitted to hospitals. “That’s why we’re creating additional space, doing that detailed planning work, so that the inevitable large number of people who will be presenting to hospitals who wouldn’t normally be there can have every confidence that they’ll get the very best care possible.” On Tuesday afternoon, Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged people to “go about their lives” as Australia’s chief medical officer Dr Brendan Murphy said there was no reason to “panic buy”. “I am looking forward to getting to places of mass gathering, particularly if it involves my football team playing, or going to kids’ concerts or doing any of these things,” Mr Morrison said. “Australians should continue to go about their lives and our normal way and just exercise commonsense.” Professor Murphy said the small number of COVID-19 cases in Australia was controlled. “The community can be reassured that there is no reason to change normal behaviours, no reason to go and panic by and do things that are unnecessary,” he said. “We are working very closely as a unified health system to deal with this issue.” Some students are bypassing the ban on people from China entering Australia by quarantining themselves for a fortnight in third countries before coming to Australia. Student One CEO Tim Weston said the accommodation service was working with more than 150 students who were still in China and had put off bookings. “We anticipate a very small number may arrive having spent 14 or more days outside of China in another country,” he said. “However, we anticipate that the vast majority will arrive once the ban is lifted.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Biden gains pace as Democrat rivals quit race for president","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/us-news\/2020\/03\/03\/amy-klobuchar-quits\/","transcript":"Joe Biden’s Democratic presidential bid has picked up steam, with the former US vice-president set to pick up the endorsements of two former 2020 rivals: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Ms Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, will become the third 2020 candidate in as many days to drop out of the race when she announces the suspension of her campaign in Dallas on Monday night (local time), where she will also publicly back Mr Biden, an aide said. Mr Buttigieg, a former Indiana mayor who ended his White House bid on Sunday, also plans to endorse Mr Biden in Dallas, a top adviser said. “The Klobuchar campaign confirms the Senator is flying to Dallas to join Vice-President Biden at his rally tonight, where she will suspend her campaign and endorse the Vice-President,” a campaign aide told Reuters in a text message. Mr Biden is fresh off a resounding victory in Saturday’s South Carolina primary and aiming for a strong showing on Super Tuesday against Senator Bernie Sanders, the national front-runner and a democratic socialist from Vermont. The Super Tuesday contests offer the biggest one-day haul of the 1991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination at its national convention in July, with about 1357 delegates up for grabs. Fourteen states – California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Vermont, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina and Maine – as well as American Samoa and Democrats living abroad cast ballots on Tuesday. Billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg will make his ballot-box debut on Super Tuesday. He has been betting that the hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money he has poured into his campaign will allow him to make up for not competing in the first four early-voting states. Five candidates – Mr Biden, Mr Bloomberg, Mr Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard – remain in the running for the nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November’s election. The numbers have already whittled down from more than 20 earlier in the race. Mr Bloomberg and Mr Biden have emerged as the main contenders for the votes of moderate Democrats, while Mr Sanders is the progressive front-runner nationally. Mr Biden’s high-stakes triumph in South Carolina, where his campaign had said his popularity with black voters would propel him to victory after early disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, helped see off the competition. In addition to Ms Klobuchar and Mr Buttigieg, billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer also gave up his campaign on Saturday after a third-place finish in the Southern state in which he had invested most heavily. But it was not immediately clear who would immediately benefit from their departures. A Morning Consult poll taken on February 23-27, for example, before Mr Buttigieg exited the race, showed that 21 per cent of his supporters named Mr Sanders as their second choice, 19 per cent picked Mr Biden, another 19 per cent chose Ms Warren and 17 per cent favoured Mr Bloomberg. Mr Biden still lags his rivals in spending and organisation in Super Tuesday states and beyond. His campaign said on Sunday it had raised more than $10 million in the preceding two days. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Benjamin Netanyahu claims win in Israeli election as exit polls show parliamentary majority | The New Daily","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/03\/benjamin-netanyahu-claims-win-in-israeli-election-as-exit-polls-show-parliamentary-majority\/","transcript":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared victory in Israel’s third election in less than a year after television exit polls showed him just a seat short of a governing majority in parliament. A win for Netanyahu, 70, after inconclusive ballots in April and September, would be testimony to the political durability of Israel’s longest-serving leader, who fought the latest campaign under the shadow of a looming corruption trial. It would also pave the way for the right-wing Netanyahu to make good on his pledge to annex, after the election, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, and the region’s Jordan Valley, under a peace plan presented by US President Donald Trump. Palestinians have rejected the proposal, saying it was killing their dream of establishing a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel’s three main TV channels projected in exit polls that Netanyahu’s rightist Likud and like-minded parties would capture 60 of parliament’s 120-seats, just one short of a majority, in Monday’s vote. In an updated exit poll, Israel’s Channel 13 dropped the figure to 59. During an acrimonious campaign which focused more on character than on policy, right-wing and religious parties had pledged to join a Likud-led coalition government. But if the 60-seat projection held true, after actual results later on Tuesday, Netanyahu would still have to enlist other allies in coalition negotiations. A Likud spokesman said the prime minister would deliver a late-night victory speech at the party’s election headquarters in Tel Aviv. Ahead of the address, Netanyahu wrote on Twitter: “We won thanks to our belief in our path and thanks to the people of Israel.” Netanyahu’s main challenger, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, stopped short of conceding defeat in his own posting on Twitter, telling supporters he would “continue to fight for the right path, for you.” The exit polls showed Likud taking between 36 and 37 parliamentary seats to 32 or 33 for Blue and White – a gap that would make it far harder for Gantz to find a path to putting together a governing coalition. In the previous election, in September, Blue and White edged past Likud, taking 33 seats to its rival’s 32, but Gantz, like Netanyahu, was unable to put together a ruling coalition. Anshel Pfeffer, who wrote a biography of Netanyahu, said on the website of the left-wing Haaretz newspaper that a win for the veteran politician would be a “stunning comeback” for a man “who doesn’t lie down after a setback”."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Supervisors to monitor national childcare service buses after boy's death | The New Daily","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/qld\/2020\/03\/03\/childcare-death-buses-resume\/","transcript":"Supervisors will be brought in to monitor a national childcare service’s buses and centres two weeks after a three-year-old boy was found dead after being left in a minibus in far north Queensland. From Tuesday, additional safety measures will be introduced at Goodstart Early Learning centres across the country after two staff were charged with manslaughter over the boy’s death at Edmonton, Cairns. Two staff have been charged with manslaughter as a result of the death and both have been sacked by the company. A supervisor will sit at the back of Goodstart Early Learning buses and there will be an additional “checker” at childcare centres to do a sweep of the bus after the company reviewed its policies and procedures after the tragedy. In addition, the staff member, who acts as the bus supervisor, is required to sit at the rear of the vehicle for the entire journey. The checker is a centre-based staff member who meets, greets and checks a vehicle on its arrival. While bus services have resumed, the kindergarten has yet to reopen. “The Edmonton centre remains closed at the moment,” a Goodstart Early Learning Centre representative said. “The bus services which have resumed are across the entire national Goodstart service at centres which offer pick up and drop off services. “Both staff involved in the incident had their employment terminated following the charges which were laid.” Goodstart Early Learning CEO Julia Davidson said the company had apologised to the boy’s family and was still trying to fathom what occurred in Cairns. “This makes the events in Edmonton all the more bewildering. We don’t know why a senior staff member – who had received significant training and recent reminders about bus safety – apparently disregarded procedures,” she said. “As was noted in court, rigorous policies and procedures around bus transport were in place at Edmonton. “We had very strong procedures in place and now we are moving to strengthen them even further.” She said there had been a number of incidents with Goodstart buses in recent years, after which additional safety measures were also introduced. Bus driver Michael Glen Lewis and childcare worker, Dionne Beatrice Grills, have been charged with manslaughter over the death. They were both bailed last week on the condition neither contact co-workers, each other or the victim’s family. Lewis was ordered to surrender his passport and not come within 100m of an international point of departure. Their charges will again be mentioned in the Cairns Magistrates Court on March 18. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australian coronavirus patients can be detained under biosecurity laws","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/03\/australian-coronavirus-detained\/","transcript":"Attorney-General Christian Porter has flagged using tough biosecurity laws to detain suspected coronavirus sufferers to fight the spread of the infection. The announcement follows the first human-to-human transmission of the virus in Australia, involving a western Sydney doctor. Under existing laws, the government already has the power to detain people infected with the virus. Mr Porter said the public should prepare for those laws to be activated. “It is likely that the laws will get used on a larger scale and it is very likely that Australians will encounter practices and instructions and circumstances that they have not had to encounter before,” he told ABC Radio National on Tuesday. “There could be the declaration of what are called human health response zones, and that could mean there are specific requirements for screening measures for people going in and out of such a zone.” Earlier, Health Minister Greg Hunt said the government saw no immediate need to ban mass gatherings, including the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne (on March 15) or coming AFL matches. Mr Hunt said the search was on for anyone who might have come in contact with Australians who have contracted the virus. “They’re now conducting what’s called a full-contact tracing. Contact tracing means that, as it sounds, they’re reaching out, working through all of the people that the individual has been in contact with, which is what we’ve done with all of the Australian cases,” he said. “There are now 33 Australian cases and an initial 15 from Wuhan or associated with Wuhan, all of whom cleared the virus, 10 from the Diamond Princess – six of those 10 have cleared the virus and have returned home. “Very sadly, of course, we’ve lost James Kwan, a 78-year-old man from Western Australia, and now we have the eight cases that have emerged in the last week within the community – seven from Iran and this one case of the health worker in NSW. More than 10,000 tests for coronavirus have been conducted in Australia for the 33 positive results. Mr Hunt urged Australians to remain calm and said there was no need to stockpile food or medical supplies. “As a nation, as a community, we’re all in this together,” he said. “It is also about taking care of each other, and that includes how we buy and how we shop. Not trying to hoard, not trying to have more than is required, to make sure that we’re being careful in our personal hygiene, and caring in our conduct towards others.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Projects got tick for 'sports rorts' funding hours after PM called election","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/australian-politics\/2020\/03\/03\/sports-rorts-election-approval\/","transcript":"The list of projects to be funded under the Coalition’s controversial sport grants program was changed by the Morrison government just hours after the 2019 election was called, Parliament has heard. Labor is using every opportunity during Senate estimates to grill the Government and senior public servants over the management of the pre-election grants process. The revelations from a Senate committee late on Monday increase pressure on the Coalition over the $100 million sporting infrastructure scheme. The National Audit Office’s scathing report into the program in January found it was politically biased. Auditors revealed worthy applications were binned in favour of projects in politically important seats. The committee heard last-minute changes took place on April 11, 2019 – the day Scott Morrison called the election and both houses of Parliament were dissolved. Sport Australia received a final version of a spreadsheet of projects for approval at 12.43pm, more than four hours after Parliament was shut down. The update added nine projects, and removed one. The Prime Minister’s Office was sent the same spreadsheet eight minutes earlier. The now-infamous colour-coded spreadsheet linked clubs that should receive funding with the electorate they were in. These changes were seemingly made after 8.46am that same day, when an earlier version of the spreadsheet had been sent to Sport Australia. The government had gone into caretaker mode at 8.30am. Labor senator Katy Gallagher told AM the government should explain why changes were made to what was considered the final approved list. “The more evidence we get, the more we ask questions, the murkier and murkier this gets,” she said. Under decades-old caretaker conventions, governments should not make important decisions after calling the election. Senator Gallagher said there were questions about whether lists should have been altered after Parliament had been prorogued. She also wants to know what say the Prime Minister had in the decision-making process. “Funds were being reallocated and moved after caretaker began, and with the hands of the Prime Minister and the ministers all over it,” Senator Gallagher said. Australian National Audit Office executive Brian Boyd said emails were exchanged between the office of then-sports minister Bridget McKenzie and the Prime Minister’s Office on April 10 and April 11. “There were responses both that day and into the following day as well as sorting out what the final list of approved projects would look like,” Mr Boyd said. “When I referred to one project coming out and one project coming in, in terms of the 8.46am version, that was at the request of the Prime Minister’s Office.” Mr Boyd said there was no evidence the PMO was behind the last set of changes to the spreadsheet. A document giving official approval for round three of the Community Sport Infrastructure Program grants, signed by Senator McKenzie, was dated April 4. The government has pointed to that date to insist it did not breach caretaker conventions. Labor has accused the Minister of deliberately backdating the decision."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Sydney Trains boss apologises after morning of commuter chaos","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/2020\/03\/03\/circular-quay-train-derail\/","transcript":"The head of Sydney Trains has apologised to furious commuters after yet another morning of chaos on public transport in the city. Thousands of commuters were left stranded or searching for alternative ways to get to work after a maintenance vehicle derailed between Circular Quay and Wynyard on Tuesday morning. In the resulting chaos, passengers had to leave trains and platforms and find alternative routes, including the city’s light rail network. Many were delayed on their morning journey by about an hour. “While it might not look like much, the vehicle came off the tracks in a really awkward position and location, which meant that conventional jacks were not able to re-rail the vehicle quickly,” Sydney Trains said in a later statement. “While the work was being carried out, we could only use one track where we ordinarily use two. This led to some congestion. However, we were able to divert around the incident.”  The minor derailment of a small work vehicle at Circular Quay this morning has caused disruption for customers… Posted by Sydney Trains on Monday, March 2, 2020 The maintenance vehicle was removed by 7.20am, but the damage had already been done. The resulting backlog took hours to clear. Sydney Trains boss Stewart Mills said about 130 services were affected by the morning derailment, although few were cancelled. Throughout the rest of Tuesday morning, he said, it had been a “complicated recovery” for the public transport network. Mr Mills apologised for the delays, describing a string of recent disruptions across the train network as “unprecedented”. “We’ve had some really difficult, exceptional circumstances over the last month,” he said. “Whether it’s exceptional record heat, to the storms, that is just unprecedented over the network.” The worst delays on Tuesday were from western Sydney, the North Shore and to the airport on the T2 Inner West and Leppington, T3 Bankstown and T8 Airport and South Line services. Commuters took to social media to vent their frustration as services were cancelled or delayed. Christopher Freeman wrote: “Why does Sydney Trains keep having incidents that require commuters to “make alternative arrangements”? What? Should we all buy cars and drive everywhere? I rely on public transport”. Another said: “I couldn’t do it this morning. I couldn’t get on that train knowing that I might be spending the next three hours trapped in a metal tube with hundreds of furious people”.  The ABC reported that the price of ride share apps surged in the morning chaos. One commuter reported being quoted a fare of $85 for the nine-kilometre journey from Petersham to Martin Place. Sydney Trains said later that services were expected to be back to normal in time for the afternoon peak. However, trains were delayed on some lines later in the day because of trespassers."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Harry and Meghan to reunite with William and Kate before Megxit","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/royal\/2020\/03\/03\/harry-meghan-final-outing\/","transcript":"Buckingham Palace has released more details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s final public engagement before they quit as senior royals at the end of March.

The World Health Organisation has reported nine times more COVID-19 cases outside China than inside China over the past day, with epidemics in Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan their greatest concern. It comes after Australian efforts to reduce the spread of the virus on home soil suffered a blow, with NSW recording the first person-to-person transmissions. The sister of an infected man who had recently returned from Iran and a health worker – both in Sydney – were confirmed on Monday as having the first locally-acquired infections. It prompted New South Wales’ Health Minister Brad Hazzard to suggest residents stop shaking hands with others and instead greet people with a “pat on the back”. These two cases, along with Tasmania’s first positive, brought the nation’s confirmed cases to 33. It follows the death of WA retiree James Kwan who contracted the virus after quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise shop. Meanwhile, China reported 206 cases of COVID-19 on Monday (Australian time) – the lowest since January 22, with just eight cases reported outside Hubei province. Outside China, there were 8739 new cases of infection in 61 countries, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news briefing on Tuesday morning (Australian time). Globally there have been 90,284 infections and 3085 deaths as of early Tuesday morning, with some countries receiving their first cases on Monday. “We are in uncharted territory – we have never seen before a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission but at the same time which can also be contained with the right measures,” Dr Ghebreyesus said. There is some good news, however – more than 130 countries have not yet detected any cases of COVID-19. “Our message to all countries is: this is not a one-way street. We can push this virus back. Your actions now will determine the course of the outbreak in your country,” Dr Ghebreyesus said. He urged all people to adhere to the advice by local health authorities and experts. For residents in NSW, that may mean no shaking of hands as NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard on Monday urged people to instead opt for a pat on the back. “No hand-shaking,” he said. “It’s very automatic but don’t do it.” Attorney-General Christian Porter said the government could bar people and large groups from attending public places and authorities would be able to quarantine an entire building. In a situation where the coronavirus outbreak intensified, world GDP growth could halve from 2.9 per cent in November to 1.5 per cent as stock markets plunge across the world, triggering fears of a global recession. That was the warning from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. “The main message from this downside scenario is that it would put many countries into a recession, which is why we are urging measures to be taken in the affected areas as quickly as possible,” OECD chief economist Laurence Boone told the BBC. His comments came after Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday said he would meet with Reserve Bank heads to discuss the impact on the economy. “This is a health crisis, not a financial crisis, but it is a health crisis with very significant economic implications,” Mr Morrison told parliament. The global economy could still recover to 3.3 per cent growth next year if outbreaks were contained and reached a mild level, the OECD predicted. The Australian market on Monday closed down almost one per cent, which was a vast improvement on the dive of more than three per cent in previous trading. Efforts in Australia will now focus on quickly isolating newly-infected people and dissuading or banning Australians from heading to virus hotspots. Italy, Iran and South Korea are among the countries the government will keep a close eye on. People returning from those countries will need to monitor their health for 14 days after their arrival. Iran joined mainland China as the two countries from where arrivals will be denied entry for 14 days, except for citizens and permanent residents. The federal government will also look at strict new powers under biosecurity laws which could be used to detain people with the virus. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"South Korea's coronavirus-riddled church has Australian links","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/03\/south-korea-cult-coronavirus-australians\/","transcript":"The controversial South Korean church facing criminal charges over the rapid spread of COVID-19 among its members has a strong following in Australia, a Melbourne cult specialist has confirmed. The city government of Seoul has asked prosecutors to charge 12 leaders of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, including its founder Lee Man-hee, 88. The leaders are accused of murder, causing injury, and failing to prevent the spread of an infectious disease after thousands of their followers were found to be carrying the virus. In the early hours of Tuesday (Australian time), Mr Lee knelt on the floor and bowed during a press conference in which he apologised for one church member spreading the sickness, calling the epidemic a “great calamity”. “We did our best but were not able to stop the spread of the virus,” he said. The mea culpa marked a shift in the messaging about the church’s culpability. Just last week Mr Lee was blaming “evil” for the virus epidemic, telling a congregation the sickness was the work of “the evil who got jealous of Shincheonji’s rapid growth”. In the largest outbreak outside China, by Tuesday morning (Australian time) South Korea had recorded 26 deaths and reported another 599 infections, taking its tally to 4335 . It follows the nation’s biggest daily jump on Saturday. Most of the country’s cases have been linked back to the secretive Shincheonji Church. The nation’s death toll is likely to increase after nearly 9000 of the 230,000 church members interviewed by authorities reported symptoms of the coronavirus. The church’s strict rule that members must never miss a service, even if they feel sick, has been blamed for South Korea’s rapid outbreak. Fury over the secretive Christian sect’s poor handling of the outbreak has prompted more than a million people in South Korea to sign a petition calling for the church to be disbanded. But shutting it down won’t be easy. The church boasts about 200,000 followers, hundreds of whom live in foreign countries like Australia. Raphael Aron, director of Cults Consulting Australia, provides counselling to families who have lost loved ones to cults. His Melbourne-based organisation deals with more people recruited from Shincheonji Church than any other Asian group. “We’re seeing an increasing number of people connected to Shincheonji who have become totally and completely alienated from their families,” Mr Aron told The New Daily. “They might come to Australia on an exchange program, enrol at uni, then suddenly one of them has disappeared.” Shincheonji Church members are known to suddenly vanish after receiving mysterious text messages, often not returning until four or five o’clock in the morning, Mr Aron said. He said the church’s leaders needed to be held accountable for the rapid spread of COVID-19 among their followers. “Was it because of their general code of secrecy, or did they truly believe that prayer was the answer?” Mr Aron said. Acknowledging the anger felt by South Koreans over the church’s negligence, he also urged people to treat Shincheonji members with respect. “There is a very human side to cults and it’s really important to understand that,” he said. “We mustn’t demonise them.” Humans are incredibly social creatures and we all need to feel like we belong in order to survive. Shane Satterley, a PhD candidate at Griffith University specialising in terrorism and radicalisation, said people typically joined cults when they were experiencing an “identity crisis”. “These people are searching for meaning, for their old identity to be scrapped, so they’re drifting around with open eyes for anything to come along,” Mr Satterley told The New Daily. “When the wrong charismatic leader comes along with an ideology that makes sense to them, they can find it appealing.” People suffering drug and alcohol abuse, strained relationships or the death of a loved one were particularly vulnerable to being sucked in, he said. He added South Korea could be suffering an identity crisis of its own, which may explain why an estimated two million South Koreans are reportedly involved with a fringe church. “When there are times of political unrest or rapid change, then you start to see some fringe groups begin to emerge,” he said. Mr Aron said there was “a lot of fear and insecurity about what’s happening between north and south (Korea), and the world in general”. “All that fear contributes to a desire to have a living master, a philosophy that is concrete and defined to take away the uncertainty,” he said. “It feeds into that incredibly strong human trait that we have to belong, to be a part of something.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Michael Pascoe goes back over the maths on government grant rorts","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/03\/michael-pascoe-liberal-grants-costs\/","transcript":"I was lazy. I stopped counting politically rorted federal grant programs when I got to $1.1 billion. I should have kept going to reach $8.1 billion. That’s the total for 11 federal programs that have serious question marks – or worse – over their ethics, probity and basic governance. That’s $8.1 billion of taxpayers’ money at the disposal of politicians who can’t be trusted not to use it for pork barrelling their way into government. It makes Clive Palmer’s $83 million anti-Labor campaign look cheap. In fairness, not all of that $8.1 billion has been spent – yet – and not all of it rorted. But having watched the Morrison government so comprehensively raid the public purse, there’s no reason to believe they would spend the rest more responsibly. Now, when Australia is facing a potential financial crisis courtesy of the coronavirus, Scott Morrison is only sloganeering about possible “targeted, modest and scalable” financial assistance for the economy. Mr Morrison’s office, the Cabinet Expenditure Review Committee and the Liberal Party’s campaign headquarters have proven to be adept at the targeted and scalable use of public money to get re-elected, but there was nothing modest about it. When I added up a little over $1.1 billion in rorted programs last month, I was only trying to make a point about an inconsequential Liberal senator’s complaint about the size of the ABC’s annual budget. That’s why I stopped. But the rorts and rackets have kept rolling in over the past week or so, demanding a full accounting. The score so far: These last two don’t discriminate. MPs of all stripes get to play with taxpayers funds here – $150,000 for each program in each of our 151 electorates. Your local MP has to invite or endorse applications – the sort of structural corruption you would perhaps expect in the wilder parts of the Papua New Guinea political system. The $8000 for a sailing club barbecue in Scott Morrison’s electorate is as good an example as any of federal politicians local big-noting with taxpayers funds. It’s tacky, it stinks. It’s not what a federal government should be doing. This invites a bigger question about these political acts of noblesse oblige – politicians are too busy trying to buy elections to consider what principles might be involved in making free with other people’s money. For example, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack was delighted to open the new Sunshine Beach Surf Club in the electorate of Barnaby Joyce’s little mate, Llew O’Brien. With the help of $2.5 million from the taxpayer, the club has built a flash bar, restaurant and event centre on its brilliant site overlooking the Sunshine surf. Oh yes, there are better facilities for the life savers, cadets and nippers as well. The previous bar and restaurant were more modest, very much Sunshine rather than neighbouring Noosa, yet still a fine spot. I wonder how other bars, restaurants and events centres in the area feel about having to compete with such generously government-funded opposition? That should be particularly galling for the Coalition’s IPA “small government” faction. The best thing the Adventures of Bridget McKenzie could achieve is a re-think of federal government’s responsibilities. The “they all do it” excuse isn’t good enough any more. There are things that urgently need federal money – an increased Newstart allowance, social housing – that should take precedence over pork barrelling."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Angus Taylor says police probes into falsified letter were 'pretty thorough',","date":"03-03-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/03\/angus-taylor-police-probes\/","transcript":"Energy Minister Angus Taylor says preliminary investigations by both the NSW and Federal Police into his office’s distribution of a falsified Sydney council document were “pretty thorough” and have “finalised” the matter. The Australian Federal Police spent around six weeks “considering” whether to launch a formal investigation into the forgery of the document, which massively inflated the City of Sydney’s travel expenses on a page that appeared to be from the council’s annual report. But last month AFP dropped the matter, saying it was “unlikely” further inquiries would produce enough evidence to substantiate a Commonwealth offence. “Two police forces have looked at this. It’s been pretty thorough. It went over months, as you know,” Mr Taylor told ABC TV’s 7.30. The investigation was handed to the AFP in December after first being referred to the NSW Police. The falsified document was used as the basis for a scathing letter from Mr Taylor to Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore, which blasted the council for spending $15 million on international and domestic flights in a single year. The letter was leaked to the Daily Telegraph. The real figures were significantly lower, at around $6000. The AFP has confirmed it did not speak with either Mr Taylor or Ms Moore as it considered whether to proceed with a formal investigation. While Mr Taylor has apologised publicly to Ms Moore for distributing information that was false, the story of exactly how the falsified document came to exist has not been revealed. Asked if he stood by previous claims that his office downloaded the incorrect figures from the council’s website on September 9, Mr Taylor said he did. “My statements on this have been clear from the start,” he said. Mr Taylor’s office has not released the full version of the document it claims it downloaded on that day. The City of Sydney has released internal metadata that appears to show there has only ever been a single, correct version of the report on its website. Asked to explain the inconsistencies, Mr Taylor said the two police forces had “access to all that information” and had both “considered and closed this matter”. “Two police forces had a look at this. That’s about as independent as you can get,” he said. In Senate Estimates on Monday, AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw was asked by a Greens senator why his organisation did not speak with either Mr Taylor or Ms Moore. Mr Kershaw said the AFP did not “operate like that”. He also ruled out the investigation being reopened in the future. “The matter is finalised, full stop,” he said. The AFP had to take a number of other questions on notice, meaning they will be answered in writing at a later date. Those questions related to whether the AFP had considered public data from Google Analytics or the City of Sydney metadata. The agency was also asked if it had interviewed the council’s staff, Daily Telegraph journalists, environment department officials or anyone from Mr Taylor’s office. –ABC"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Top Iranian official dies as country’s virus toll rises to 66","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/02\/iran-official-dies-coronavirus\/","transcript":"A member of a council that advises Iran’s supreme leader has died after falling sick from the new coronavirus, becoming the first top official to succumb to the illness that is affecting members of the Islamic Republic’s leadership. The death of Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi came as Iran announced the virus had killed 66 people among 1501 confirmed cases in the country. Iran has the highest death toll in the world after China, the epicentre of the outbreak. Mr Mirmohammadi died at a Tehran hospital of the virus, state radio said. He was 71. The council advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as settles disputes between the supreme leader and parliament. His death comes as other top officials have contracted the virus in Iran, which has the highest death toll in the world after China, the epicentre of the outbreak. Those sick include Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, state media reported. Also sick is Iraj Harirchi, the head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who tried to downplay the virus before falling ill. Iran has reported 978 confirmed cases of the new virus with 54 deaths from the illness it causes, called COVID-19. Across the wider Mideast, there are more than 1150 cases of the new coronavirus, the majority of which are linked back to Iran. Experts worry Iran’s percentage of deaths to infections, around 5.5 per cent, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be much higher than current figures show. Trying to stem the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Iran on Monday held an online-only briefing by its Foreign Ministry. Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi opened the online news conference addressing the outbreak, dismissing an offer of help for Iran by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “We neither count on such help, nor are we ready to accept verbal help,” Mr Mousavi said. He added Iran has always been “suspicious” about America’s intentions and accused the US government of trying to weaken Iranians’ spirits over the outbreak. The British Embassy, meanwhile, has begun evacuations over the virus. “Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain,” the British Foreign Office said. “In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.” Iran has closed schools and universities to stop the spread of the virus, but major Shiite shrines have remained open despite civilian authorities calling for them to be closed. The holy cities of Mashhad and Qom in particular, both home to shrines, have been hard hit by the virus. Shiites often touch and kiss shrines as a sign of their faith. Authorities have been cleaning the shrines with disinfectants. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Embracing Instagram over 50, fashionistas defy pressure to be 'invisible'","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/02\/new-york-winter-nightmare-ice-houses\/","transcript":"Until a few years ago, Melbourne mother of two Lou Forbes made fun of her kids for the time they spent on Instagram. But as she approached 50, she was drawn to the increasingly popular social media platform after she contemplated going grey. “I’d been dying my hair since, I think, about the age of 15 or 16 and I was starting to get sick of it and it was costing a lot,” Lou says. “It took me three goes and I looked to Instagram for inspiration to spur me on and get me through.” Lou started her Instagram account @silversista soon after, and said she was blown away by the response she received from her first posts. The 51-year-old actor said she was surprised by how much she enjoyed engaging with the medium and the positive feedback gave her confidence to continue. She progressed from posting headshots from behind to artistic nudes. “With that confidence, I started experimenting with the photos and say, ‘Hey kids, take a photo of mum’, or organising my own shoots.” Lou said she joined Instagram to look for inspiration, and suddenly she was inspiring others. “Supposedly, I was becoming one of the inspirations for other people, and I didn’t know what to do with it in the beginning,” she says. “I think there’s a great sisterhood and the camaraderie and the support to make a statement about women our age not being invisible – that we are positive, that we’re still allowed to be sexy and we don’t have to be stereotyped to be sitting in a corner knitting booties.” When Lesley Crawford wanted to learn about Instagram, she decided to embark on a project: She decided to buy no new clothes for a year, and document it daily. “That was my Instagram tutorial,” Lesley says. Her age has never felt relevant – it’s just a state of mind, she says. Her account, @lesleyhasmanyhats, now has more than 7,000 followers. In 2019, advertising giant WPP conducted an online survey of 2500 Australians aged 50 to 79. The results suggest Australians over 50 spend 27 hours a week on the internet, and three-quarters regularly research and buy products online. Nearly 95 per cent of respondents over 50 said they did not like the way organisations and marketers communicated to them. Lou says women over 50 don’t want to be misrepresented, and companies are doing themselves a disservice by not representing their true market in their media and advertising. Gill Walker, who runs a communications consultancy in Melbourne helping companies market to the over-50 market, says older women are commonly made to feel invisible. But, she says, with 75 per cent of wealth in Australia managed by those over 45, it makes business sense for companies to target older Australians. “When we talk to them, they feel as though they’ve become invisible and that what they’ve achieved in life isn’t recognised, [nor] that they still have a lot to contribute,” she says. “We find the, sort of, two camps. “There’s the people that love the old audience and do quite well. “Then there’s the mass marketers who exclude the old audience and very rarely would they put faces of older people in their advertising and their promotions.” But there’s been a shift in the right direction in the past decade, she says. “We’re seeing celebrities that play roles, and documentaries and dramas where the female is successful and smart and clever, not a dowdy, old, frumpy granny.” Sydney-based antique jewellery dealer Sarah Jane Adams has attracted a huge following since she first posted to Instagram five years ago. The 64-year-old has two Instagram profiles — one related to her business @saramaijewels, and a personal account @mywrinklesaremystripes. She says the first account, which has 187,000 followers, was set up as a platform to talk about her antique jewellery and the inspiration behind it, rather than to sell it. “I don’t believe in selling sh-t to the masses as an antique jewellery dealer.” Her personal account, which has more than 25,000 followers, was created in response to somebody trying to sell her a “particular type of wonder cream” for her face. She found it offensive. “I thought, now I’m actually really happy with my wrinkles and my stripes and my white hair and my ageing body.” Sarah Jane knows many people and companies primarily see Instagram as a marketing tool. But she sees the platform’s potential power in helping women of all ages accept themselves as they are. “My ultimate message is one that’s come to me later, which is to really help empower women – not all old women, but women of all ages – to accept themselves. “Stop mucking with your face. Stop doing this stuff which basically makes you all look the same. “Look after yourself as best you can. Keep yourself healthy. Keep yourself fresh. Live life to the max and just enjoy life.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"PM Scott Morrison trembles on the brink of stimulus","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/02\/scott-morrison-rba-stimulus\/","transcript":"For well over a year now the Morrison government has ignored the pleas of the Reserve Bank to get serious about stimulating the economy. The consequences of this disengagement from a situation deteriorating before their very eyes on a monthly basis are about to get very painful for the Prime Minister and his treasurer. The Reserve Bank has run out of the capacity to help, with its emergency interest rate cuts already well below the levels during the Global Financial Crisis 12 years ago. The market is split on whether the board at its Tuesday meeting will lower the rate from its historic low level of 0.75 per cent. If it does there is a consensus among leading economists that it won’t do much to get things moving. Analysis by Michael Pascoe in The New Daily is that if business is not investing now it has nothing much to do with the cost of borrowing but with “deteriorating corporate investment confidence”. The RBA may edge closer to zero rates, which in itself is evidence of an economy woefully underperforming despite the boast of Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in Parliament that the International Monetary Fund in January found it is doing better than the United States, Canada. Japan, Germany and France. Up until now Mr Morrison has been captive of the Liberals‘ overblown political attacks on the Rudd\/Swan Labor government’s stimulus that in the GFC saved Australia from recession, business failures and  job losses. Labor was reckless and extravagant is the oft-repeated mantra. The Prime Minister was not quite so brazen as he announced he was working on a “response plan” to the coronavirus that would be revealed in the “not too distant future”. Note as he “trembles to action” as one wit observed, Mr Morrison – who ignored the calls of the RBA, business, the unions and the opposition for the past 12 months to do something – is now claiming the “unforeseen shock” of the coronavirus is the reason for his change of tack. He revealed he and the treasurer had been in discussions with the Reserve Governor on Monday morning to “talk through the impact” of the virus on Australia and the global economy. This prompted speculation that a rate cut is more likely, if for no other reason to signal all the levers are being pulled. Mr Morrison said he’ll be focusing “on ensuring we keep Australians in jobs, we keep business in business, and we keep investment flowing”. So targeted stimulus is on the way, the treasurer insists it won’t be reckless, but the real concern in government ranks is that it won’t work. The collapse in Mr Morrison’s credibility over summer is thought by some to be a real obstacle. Wayne Swan, who was named as the Finance Minister of the Year in 2011 for his GFC stimulus, says tax cuts won’t work. He says “they need specific measures to get people to spend more rather than save”. Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says there are a range of things they could do: Lift Newstart, which would flow directly into the struggling retail sector, have a wages policy, bring forward part of their tax cuts, and have a tax break for business investment. But what is particularly ominous for the government that boasted better economic management credentials and a “back in black” budget surplus is the collapse in China’s manufacturing output. Our biggest trading partner could be heading for a recession with new export orders collapsing, buying levels plummeting, and employment contracting. If our biggest customer is hurting, there is no escape for Australia.

Accusing former sports minister Bridget McKenzie of backdating a document to allow funding to flow to marginal seats after the federal election was called, Senator Wong told Parliament it was “probably a criminal offence”. “I put to you that Senator McKenzie backdated the brief,” Senator Wong said to Finance Minister Mathias Cormann on Monday. Senator Cormann labelled the claims an “outrageous allegation”. “Just because you make an outrageous allegation against a senator doesn’t make it true,” Senator Cormann said. The New Daily has contacted Senator McKenzie’s office for comment and a clear denial the documents were backdated. The claims centre on the fact that Senator McKenzie emailed Prime Minister Scott Morrison on April 10, 2019, outlining the sports grants she intended to approve under the $100 program. However, the next day, she sent correspondence to Sport Australia claiming grants were finalised on April 4. Asked again if the documents were backdated, Senator Cormann replied, “To my knowledge, absolutely not.” Senator McKenzie was forced to quit the front bench after she was found to have broken ministerial rules by not declaring potential conflicts of interest relating to gun club memberships. At one point in Monday’s hearings, Senator Wong said: “The extent to which you are covering up is corrupt. It is corrupt. The extent to which you are covering up this sports rort is corrupt. “You know what we are asking about but you are hiding this information because it shows that the Prime Minister is up to his neck in this corrupt sports rorts program.” But Senator Cormann accused Labor of dialling up the outrage to get on the news. “That is outrageous. You are trying to get on the television. Quite frankly that is a ridiculous assertion,” Senator Cormann said. It also emerged on Monday that there is only one permanent member of the committee that decided Senator McKenzie’s fate as a minister – Mr Morrison. “I ask, can he confirm that he is the only permanent member of the cabinet office policy committee?” Labor leader Anthony Albanese asked in question time. “Is there a lot of disagreement in this committee and are the meeting of this committee held in the prime minister’s head? Isn’t this just an abuse of the cabinet, designed to hide government documents?” The Prime Minister replied that several senior ministers attended the policy committee, by invitation. “I can confirm that the government’s committee of cabinet regularly has attending its meetings myself, the Attorney-General, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer,” he said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australia records first case of person-to-person coronavirus transmission","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/02\/coronavirus-spread-australia\/","transcript":"Australia’s first case of COVID-19 human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard and NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed at a media conference on Monday afternoon that a patient transferred the coronavirus to a health worker, believed to be a doctor. Mr Hazzard said he was informed just after 3pm of test results that indicated an increase of another three people being diagnosed with novel coronavirus in the state to nine. More worrying, two of those cases had not travelled overseas recently, which Mr Hazzard said indicated a high likelihood of person-to-person transmission on New South Wales soil. One was a 41-year-old woman quarantined at Westmead hospital. She has been identified as the sister of a 43-year-old man, who started to show symptoms 24 hours after returning from Iran on Saturday. The woman had not travelled overseas. The second was a 53-year-old health worker, who had previously returned two negative tests but tested positive on Monday afternoon. He is in a stable condition in intensive care. Mr Hazzard suggested it would be prudent not to shake hands when greeting friends and family, and instead pat them on the back. A similar cautious approach should be taken with kissing, as he said we need to be cautious but not alarmed. “If you have been anywhere in a public space, you should be washing your hands before doing anything, especially touching your face,” Mr Hazzard said. “I won’t be changing anything that I do.” The news comes as health and aged-care workers returning to Australia from Italy and South Korea have been told to stay home from work amid growing fears they might infect vulnerable populations with coronavirus. “As a healthcare worker, or as a residential aged-care worker, you should not attend your regular work for 14 days,” Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday. “That is an additional level of protection, which has been advised by the chief health and medical officers and accepted by the Australian government.” It comes as Tasmania recorded its first case of confirmed coronavirus on Monday. State authorities confirmed a 40-year-old man had tested positive after travelling from Iran to Launceston via Malaysia and Melbourne. Also on Monday, the NSW government ordered schools to cancel any overseas trips planned for the first term, as preparations for a potential coronavirus pandemic are ramped up. The COVID-19 outbreak has surged in South Korea and Italy in recent days, prompting the federal government to upgrade its travel advice for Italy. Australians intending to travel there have been told to exercise a high degree of caution across the entire country, and to reconsider the need to travel to 10 virus-affected towns in Italy’s north. Late on Monday afternoon, Reuters reported that Indonesia had its first confirmed cases of COVID-19. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said two patients were in an unnamed hospital – the first confirmed cases in the world’s fourth most populous country. On Monday, passengers on two flights into Sydney and Melbourne were urged to go to doctors or hospital emergency departments to be tested for the virus after travellers on both planes were confirmed with infection. The affected flights are Qatar Airways QR908 into Sydney on February 23 and Malindo Air flight OD177 into Melbourne on February 28. Victorian authorities are particularly worried about the Malindo Air flight, because they do not have the manifest of passengers on board. A woman in her 30s who was returning from Iran and boarded the flight in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is in quarantine after testing positive to COVID-19. Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton said authorities wanted all passengers who had sat in the same row or rows either side of her to self-quarantine – but they did not have the flight manifest to contact them. He said the Commonwealth was trying to provide the manifest “as urgently as they possibly can”. NSW Health also fears for passengers on QR908 who were sitting near a woman confirmed as the state’s sixth coronavirus case. The woman, who is in her 50s, flew from Iran to Sydney via Qatar. Her symptoms began within 24 hours of landing, but she did not visit hospital until six days later. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said affected passengers were being contacted and told to self-isolate for 14 days. Another man in his 40s who returned from Iran on a separate flight into Sydney is also in isolation after testing positive. The latest emergency comes as Queensland health authorities contacted up to 40 customers of a 63-year-old Gold Coast beautician who returned from Iran and tested positive to the virus. Australia has banned arrivals from Iran, but not two other major hotspots, Italy and South Korea. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the Iran outbreak was considered high risk, and the travel ban was considered an effective strategy to slow the spread of the disease. “It is no longer possible to absolutely prevent new cases coming in, given the increasing changes in epidemiology around the country,” he said. “Even though we have a relatively low travel volume from Iran we have had these four cases … that is why Iran has been a particularly special case.” Australia has so far recorded 29 infections. Among them was Perth man James Kwan, 78, who died on the weekend after contracting the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Tragically, in his final hours his wife, who also has the virus, and his relatives were unable to be by his bedside. WA Premier Mark McGowan said Mr Kwan spent his final moments alone because he was quarantined, according to news.com.au. “It would have been awful, they couldn’t go in and touch him or hold his hand – it would have been so tragically sad,” Mr McGown said. “You don’t want to leave this world without someone holding your hand.” Globally, 89,000 people have tested positive to the virus and as of Monday afternoon, the death toll was 3039. The Australian Medical Association has urged people not to panic-buy after pictures of bare supermarket shelves began circulating online. “There is an enormous amount of misinformation and almost fear,” the AMA vice president Tony Bartone has told the ABC. “There’s no reason to go out and panic buy almost bunker-level materials.” Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned on Monday further bans could be futile in the face of the escalating emergency. “You get to a position where you just can’t contain that by closing borders, or closing routes from particular countries. That’s the stage we’re at at the moment,” Mr Dutton told Sky News. “We can’t just close down every flight, every movement across our borders. We need to be realistic about the fact we’re a trading nation.” Mr Dutton insisted he had confidence in advice from the World Health Organisation, which is yet to declare a pandemic. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Hospital patient burned after fire starts in surgical theatre","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/vic\/melbourne\/2020\/03\/02\/hospital-patient-burned-fire\/","transcript":"A 72-year-old woman has suffered burns after a fire ignited while she was undergoing a procedure in a Melbourne hospital surgical theatre.

Mr Buttigieg is heading back to South Bend where he will give a speech suspending his campaign, the aide said, following a fourth-place finish in Saturday’s South Carolina primary. CNN political correspondent John Avlon took to social media after the announcement, saying “Mayor Pete’s” decision to get out “deserves respect”. “Even Mayor Pete’s decision to get out before Super Tuesday – where he could’ve added delegates – deserves respect. “Because it’s a concession to reality rather than in service to his ego. He was crowding the center lane and decided to put defeating Donald Trump first,” he wrote. A former graduate of Harvard College and Oxford University, Mr Buttigieg served as South Bend mayor from 2012 to 2020. The announcement comes as Democratic candidate Joe Biden received an outpouring of black voter support in a convincing victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary, resurrecting his faltering White House bid and giving the former vice president a chance to claim he is the moderate alternative to front-runner Bernie Sanders. The decisive win on Saturday gives Mr Biden a burst of momentum in the Democratic race to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, which broadens quickly with Super Tuesday (March 3 local time) primaries in 14 states in three days that will award one-third of the available national delegates. It was the first presidential primary win ever for Mr Biden, who is making his third run at the White House. He immediately took aim at Mr Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist whose surging campaign and calls for a political revolution have rattled a Democratic establishment worried he is too far left to beat Mr Trump in November. “Democrats want a nominee who is a Democrat,” Mr Biden told cheering supporters in Columbia, South Carolina, in a jab at Mr Sanders. “Win big or lose, that’s the choice. Most Americans don’t want the promise of a revolution. They want more than promises they want results.” The polls showed Mr Biden – vice president under former President Barack Obama – with 61 per cent of African-American support to Mr Sanders’ 17 per cent. Mr Biden must now hope a flurry of media attention and his name recognition will help him in Super Tuesday states, where Mr Sanders’ prolific fundraising helped him build bigger organisations and broadcast far more advertisements. Mr Sanders leads opinion polls in delegate-rich California, where three million early votes have already been cast. Mr Biden and all of the other Democratic contenders also will face competition for the first time on Super Tuesday from billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has blanketed the country with half a billion dollars in advertising. Bloomberg skipped the first four state primaries. But at least five states – Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Virginia – have big blocs of African-American voters that could help Mr Biden make a comeback. Mr Biden’s dominance in South Carolina raised questions about the continued viability of most of the other contenders. Afghanistan veteran Pete Buttigieg was among those including Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar who all were well behind in the state. With 99 per cent of the precincts reporting, Mr Biden had 49 per cent of the vote and Mr Sanders was a distant second with 20 per cent, according to official state results. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer had 11 per cent and all of the other contenders were well behind with single digits. As the vote count rolled in on Saturday night, Mr Steyer, who had spent heavily in South Carolina to court African-American voters, ended his presidential bid as it emerged he was coming in a distant third. Mr Biden desperately needed a win after poor showings in the first two nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and a second-place finish in Nevada. He had viewed South Carolina, where his popularity among the state’s big bloc of black voters proved decisive, as his firewall against disaster. The resounding margin could slow the momentum of Mr Sanders, who had grown stronger with each contest, finishing in a virtual tie for first in Iowa with Mr Buttigieg, before notching wins in New Hampshire and Nevada. Mr Biden, a mainstream Democrat with decades of experience on the US political stage, was powered in South Carolina by support from a broad range of voters, including men and women, black and white, middle-aged and old, those with and without college degrees, independent, liberal and conservative, exit polls showed. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"AFP did not interview Angus Taylor over forged travel documents","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/australian-politics\/2020\/03\/02\/angus-taylor-federal-police-travel\/","transcript":"Australian Federal Police did not interview Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore during an investigation into alleged doctored documents Energy Minister Angus Taylor used to attack her. AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw confirmed that Ms Moore was not spoken to before his officers abandoned their investigation into the falsified travel figures. “The mayor was not interviewed,” Mr Kershaw told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday. On February 19, Commissioner Kershaw confirmed Mr Taylor was also not interviewed, telling the National Press Club he was “not aware that the minister was interviewed, or even offered an interview”. “We’ve been pretty clear in the decision-making process that we came to, not being able to substantiate any offences being committed,” he said. On February 6, the AFP dropped its inquiry into the travel claims, saying it had found no evidence Mr Taylor was involved in falsifying information. “The AFP assessment of this matter identified there is no evidence to indicate the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction was involved in falsifying information,” an AFP spokesperson said at the time. “The low level of harm and the apology made by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction to the Lord Mayor of Sydney, along with the significant level of resources required to investigate were also factored into the decision not to pursue this matter. “The AFP now considers this matter finalised.” Earlier on Monday, Labor senator Kristina Keneally repeatedly questioned why Ms Moore was not interviewed before the AFP decided the allegations presented a “low level of ongoing harm”. “The lord mayor is the victim, if you will, in this circumstance,” Senator Keneally said. “How do you make a determination of harm and a decision not to continue an investigation without speaking to the victim of the alleged crime?” Mr Kershaw said the decision was objective and considered. “That’s a matter again for the decision-makers and they have made that decision on the materials available to them at the time,” he said. “That was what was referred to us by the NSW Police.” The furore began after Mr Taylor wrote to Ms Moore on September 30, chastising the City of Sydney for “unnecessary air travel”. His letter cited the council’s “most recent annual report”, which he said showed it had spent $1.7 million on international travel and $14.2 million on domestic travel. But, Mr Taylor’s figures were wildly at odds with the council’s actual annual report for 2017\/18, which listed domestic transport, accommodation and travelling expenses at $4206.32 and overseas travel at $1727.77. The minister apologised to Ms Moore but has not said where the numbers came from. On Monday, Greens senator Nick McKim asked whether the AFP had considered ringing Mr Taylor to ask whether he had forged the City of Sydney travel figures. “Isn’t that the first thing you’d do?” Senator McKim said. Mr Kershaw laughed off the question. “No, we don’t operate like that,” the commissioner said. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus shutdown leads to clearer skies over China","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/asia-news\/2020\/03\/02\/nasa-virus-pollution-china\/","transcript":"Satellite images have shown a dramatic decline in pollution levels over China, which is “at least partly” due to the crippling economic slowdown following the outbreak of the new coronavirus, NASA says. Images from NASA and the European Space Agency show levels of nitrogen dioxide – a noxious gas emitted by motor vehicles and industrial facilities – plummeted in February compared to January, before authorities imposed lockdown measures. NASA scientists said the reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels was first apparent near Wuhan, where the COVID-19 outbreak began. It then spread across the country. The US space agency noted the decline coincided with transport and business restrictions, and as millions of people went into quarantine. “This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,” Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA, said. The NASA pictures came as a private survey showed China’s factories were dealt a devastating blow in February as the coronavirus epidemic triggered the sharpest contraction in business activity on record. The Caixin\/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index tumbled to 40.3 in February, the lowest level since the survey began in 2004. The headline number was even worse than the depths of the financial crisis in 2008-09. The PMI findings were backed by an equally grim official survey released on Saturday, which showed the steepest contraction on record. The survey showed factory production and new orders collapsing to the worst levels on record, while employment also took a heavy blow. There was no respite for exporters either, with new export orders sinking at one of the sharpest rates in the series history. Meanwhile, NASA said scientists had previously observed gradual declines in nitrogen dioxide levels during the GFC, and more localised reductions during the Beijing Olympics the same year. China’s Lunar New Year celebrations in February have been linked to such decreases in pollution levels in the past. Levels normally rebound once the celebrations are over. “This year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,” Dr Liu said. “I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimise spread of the virus.”   China has recorded 79,826 cases of the novel coronavirus since the outbreak began in December and 3038 people have died from COVID-19 worldwide, most of them in China. The disease is spreading rapidly around the globe, with more than 60 countries now confirming infections. In response to signs of the deepening economic damage, Beijing has rolled out a support measures to help businesses stay afloat. But in the short run, analysts expect the epidemic to deal a sharp blow to growth. Many are forecasting a severe downturn in the first quarter. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Armed police storm pub after stand-off with burglars","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/crime-news\/2020\/03\/02\/westmeadows-tavern-siege\/","transcript":"Heavily-armed tactical police who stormed a pub in Melbourne’s north after reports armed gunmen were holed up inside, have revealed the alleged offenders escaped a police cordon hours earlier. Police were called to the Westmeadows Tavern on Ardlie Street, about 20 kilometres north of Melbourne CBD just after 5am on Monday following reports of two people inside the venue with at least one of the offenders armed who confronted workers. Victoria Police Inspector Anthony Brown said it was a “violent and traumatising” experience for one worker when “she was confronted by them with a firearm”. He said she was held against her will but managed to escape and ran into the arms of police. A siege then ensued between the police and the alleged offenders for five hours. Inspector Brown said that when police arrived they set up a cordon around the pub. “As you can imagine its quite a hectic scene, and unfolding, the [police] presence you see here this afternoon and throughout the morning is because we were unsure whether or not the offenders were still inside the premises. “I am quite comfortable at this stage the offenders have managed to escape the scene prior to police setting up the cordon. He said police were unsure as to whether the offenders had slipped past the cordon: “We were unsure whether they had done that and thats why we got the specialist resources out here…to make sure that they weren’t still inside and possibly had slipped through”. Police eventually stormed into the pub at 10am and gave the all-clear at 2pm. He was asked to why it took police several hours, he said the building was old and police were searching “cracks and crevices”. When asked whether it was embarrassing the armed offenders seemed to get through the police cordon, Inspector Brown replied: “I am not saying that they have got through the police cordon, the cordon was about to be established. “Clearly they got out in the meantime,” he said. Seven news reporter Paul Dowsley had earlier told 3AW Radio at 7am there were “a lot” of police on the scene. “The police vehicle is right up close lighting up the windows and they’re through the loudspeaker saying ‘come out without anything in your hands.” “Police are sending the special operations group so they would have some real reason to believe that there are people inside.” The Victoria Police dog squad was on the scene and people were asked to avoid the area. No one else was in the building, a Victoria Police spokesperson said. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Chinese research vessel tracked in waters near Christmas Island","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/02\/chinese-research-vessel-christmas-island\/","transcript":"A high-tech Chinese research vessel has been detected mapping strategically important waters off the Western Australian coast where submarines are known to regularly transit. In January and February, officials closely tracked the movements of the oceanographic ship as it conducted deepwater surveys in the Indian Ocean near Christmas Island and the Australian mainland. An Australian Border Force spokesperson told the ABC it was aware of the Chinese vessel’s presence and confirmed it had stayed within international waters. “The Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Defence are aware that the Chinese oceanographic ship Xiang Yang Hong 01 [is off] the coast of Western Australia,” the spokesperson said. “The vessel has not entered the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone other than for a direct transit through the AEEZ when transiting past Christmas Island.” One Defence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Xiang Yang Hong 01 was “undoubtedly” mapping waters regularly used by Australian submarines heading to and from the strategically important South China Sea. “Beijing is keen to know as much as it can about the water, about these submarine routes, and it would also be wanting to test and monitor the Australian response to the presence of a high-tech Chinese vessel that’s loitering off its coast,” the official told the ABC. The official also noted the Chinese vessel spent a considerable amount of time in waters not far from Naval Communication Station Harold E Holt, just north of the town of Exmouth. At the same time the Xiang Yang Hong 01 was detected off Western Australia’s coast, the Virginia-class fast-attack submarine USS Texas arrived at HMAS Stirling naval base outside Perth, for a scheduled port visit. According to the US Naval War College, the Xiang Yang Hong 01 was commissioned in 2016 for, among other things, “comprehensive observation in the field of military oceanography”. In 2018, the Xiang Yang Hong 01 was found to be operating illegally within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Palau, prompting the tiny western Pacific nation to demand China remove the research vessel. Last year, the ABC revealed two other high-tech Chinese ships were mapping waters close to Papua New Guinea where the US and Australia had just begun upgrading a naval base on Manus Island. The deepwater Chinese scientific surveys are part of Beijing’s unprecedented oceanographic research of the Western Pacific, in an area experts believe could be crucial in any future maritime conflict with the US. At the time, China’s Foreign Ministry insisted its rapidly expanding oceanographic mapping activities were all conducted within international law and helping global scientific understanding. “China’s oceanographic, scientific research in the Western Pacific is totally in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and made contributions to maritime scientific study,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told the ABC in April."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Turkey downs Syrian planes in Idlib as refugees flood borders","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/02\/turkey-downs-syrian-planes\/","transcript":"Turkey has shot down two Syrian warplanes over Idlib and struck a military airport well beyond its frontlines in a sharp escalation of its military operations following the death of dozens of Turkish soldiers last week. Syrian TV released a video showing soldiers watching as the Syrian pilots used their parachutes to land in a field nearby. The broadcaster reported that the four pilots had landed safely. Turkey, which backs opposition forces in Idlib, said it had also targeted Syrian air defence systems and dozens of tanks. Ankara has ramped up its attacks, including drone strikes, against the Russian-backed Syrian forces since Thursday, when 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike by Damascus. It has already deployed thousands of troops and military vehicles in northwest Syria’s Idlib province in the last month to stem advances by Syrian Government forces which have displaced 1 million people close to Turkey’s southern border. Already hosting 3.6 million Syrian refugees, Ankara is determined to prevent any further influx from Syria. It has also let migrants cross its borders into the European Union, in an apparent effort to press for EU support in tackling the Syria crisis. Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said earlier on Sunday that in the last four days Turkish forces destroyed eight helicopters, 103 tanks, 72 howitzers, rocket launchers, a drone and six air defence systems. Mr Akar said 2,212 Syrian fighters had been “neutralised”. He dubbed Turkey’s operation, its fourth incursion in Syria in four years, “Operation Spring Shield”. In response, Syria’s army said it shot down three Turkish drones and warned it would take down any aircraft breaching the air space over the northwest, which has been controlled for years by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s main ally Russia. Despite the warning, Turkey downed two Syrian warplanes on Sunday, while Turkey’s state-owned Anadolu agency said the Turkish military had targeted and rendered Nayrab Airport unusable, west of Aleppo city. Turkey-backed opposition commanders also said Kuweires Airport, east of Nayrab, had been bombed since midnight. Both airports are well inside Syrian Government controlled territory, marking a significant expansion of Ankara’s targets. The fighting has risked drawing Russia and Turkey, who cooperated for years to contain the fighting despite backing rival sides in Syria’s nine-year war, into direct conflict. Thousands of migrants and refugees massed at Turkey’s western frontier on Sunday, trying to enter Greece by land and sea after Turkey said its borders were open to those hoping to head to Europe. A Turkish official said the fighting in Idlib was directly linked to Turkey’s decision to open the gates for refugees to Europe. He said Ankara had changed its focus to preparing for the possibility of new arrivals from Syria “instead of preventing refugees who intend to migrate to Europe”. “Europe and others must take robust action to address this monumental challenge,” said Fahrettin Altun, the communications director for Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “We can’t be expected to do this on our own.” On the Greek-Turkish land border, Greek army and police patrols used tear gas and stun grenades to thwart attempts overnight by thousands to push into the country. Under a 6 billion euro ($10.24 billion) deal in 2016, Turkey agreed to stem the tide of refugees to Europe in return for financial aid, after more than a million people entered Europe in 2015. It has since accused the EU of failing to honour the agreement, and Mr Erdogan has frequently threatened to allow refugees into Europe unless more international support was provided. Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, as well as many others from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The country shares a frontier with Greece and Bulgaria, both European Union members. -with wires"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"James Kwan identified as first Australian to die from COVID-19","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/02\/james-kwan-coronavirus-fatality\/","transcript":"Retired Perth businessman James Kwan has been named as Australia’s first coronavirus fatality. Tourism pioneer Mr Kwan, 78, was holidaying with his wife Theresa aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship when he tested positive for coronavirus. He died from the infection in the early hours of Sunday morning at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth after several days in their intensive care ward. “My husband passed away peacefully knowing that his family loved him,” Mrs Kwan said in a statement from hospital. Mrs Kwan remains in a stable condition after she, too, was confirmed to have contracted the virus last week. “As the numbers rise the deaths also rise,” Australia’s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly told ABC radio on Monday. “Although, we must remember that over 80 per cent of the people that get this infection, it’s relatively mild.” Mr Kwan’s death comes as the number of countries hit by the coronavirus climbed past 60, with infections and deaths mounting around the globe. As of early Monday morning, more than 87,508 people worldwide had been infected, and 2990 had died of COVID-19. A Melbourne woman who tested positive on Sunday after returning from Iran is the ninth confirmed case of coronavirus in Victoria. NSW health authorities also confirmed the state’s fifth and six cases on the weekend as a man in his 40s and a woman in her 50s, both of whom had returned to Sydney from Iran. The woman flew back to Sydney via Qatar, arriving on Sunday February 23 on Qatar Airways Flight QR 908. The man diagnosed arrived in Sydney from Iran on February 22 but did not show any symptoms until two days later and was taken to hospital. In Queensland, a 63-year-old Gold Coast beautician was confirmed as having the virus on Saturday after she arrived home from Iran last week. On Sunday, the Morrison government banned flights to and from Iran amid concerns over the number of cases that can be traced back to the country. Australian authorities believe Iran’s official virus figures are almost certainly underestimated, while the BBC’s Farsi service claims the death toll could be more than four times as high. Iran’s health ministry has denied a cover-up. The retired travel agent helped grow Perth’s inbound tourist numbers after he established Wel-Travel in 1988. A close friend who did not want to be identified said Mr Kwan’s death was “really tragic” as he and his 79-year-old wife were “very much a hand-in-glove couple”. “Wherever James was, Theresa was there to support him in the family business,” the friend told The Australian. Mr Kwan was also a respected board member of the Australian Tourism Export Council. Its managing director Peter Shelley said, “James was always smiling, and he gave a lot of time to the industry”. “He broke a lot of new ground in the inbound tourism area, moving into places like Malaysia, China and Indonesia early on. It’s partly on his shoulders that an industry dedicated to bringing in international tourists has grown,” Mr Shelley told The Australian. Prime minister Scott Morrison also expressed his condolences to Mr Kwan’s family, saying he was “very saddened” by the news. Am very saddened at the death of an elderly Australian man from Perth, who contracted COVID-19 and we evacuated from the Diamond Princess in Japan. We join his family and friends in mourning his passing. COVID-19 is especially more severe for older people with other frailties. — Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) March 1, 2020 Mr Kwan’s body could not defend itself against the virus as his immune response was most likely weakened due to the effects of ageing and the fact he would have suffered from other chronic conditions like many others in their late 70s, Chief Health Officer Dr Andrew Robertson said. He added that the man’s death didn’t come as a surprise to doctors as it’s known COVID-19 can start off relatively mild before it progresses. “It’s often the second week where people will deteriorate and get significant viral pneumonia,” Dr Robertson said, insisting there was no community risk as the man had been in isolation ever since he was diagnosed. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the Morrison government has a national coronavirus plan with health authorities anticipating more cases. In Italy, the number of people infected with coronavirus rose 40 per cent to 1576 in 24 hours. Another five infected people have died, bringing the number of deaths in Italy to 34. China, where the outbreak began two months ago, on Sunday reported a slight uptick in new cases over the past 24 hours to 573, the first time in five days that the number exceeded 500. South Korea reported 210 additional cases and two more deaths from the virus, raising its totals to 3736 cases and 20 fatalities. Iran’s death toll climbed to 54 as the number of confirmed cases jumped overnight by more than half, to 978 people. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and 385 new cases. Iraq’s Health Ministry announced the discovery of six more cases on Sunday, raising the total to 19 – all Iran-linked. In the Czech Republic, three cases were reported, including a US citizen who was studying in Milan and had travelled to the Czech Republic on a tourist trip. British health authorities said the number of people confirmed as infected rose by 12, bringing the country’s tally to 35, with one death. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bill Shorten’s Labor Party dirt unit: The secrets of Choppergate","date":"","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/02\/bill-shorten-choppergate-party-animals\/","transcript":""},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Claremont killings: DNA difficulties and what led police to Bradley Edwards","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/crime-news\/2020\/03\/02\/claremont-serial-killer-dna\/","transcript":"Former telco worker Bradley Robert Edwards stands trial for the Claremont serial killings, but it’s the methods of DNA scientists that are coming under scrutiny in Perth’s Supreme Court. It was the DNA of an “unknown male” found on a murder victim’s body that led police to arrest Edwards in 2016. How that DNA got there is now the focus of the trial, which has so far heard the testimony of 170 witnesses and is expected to last another four months. The Claremont serial killings shook the community of Perth between 1996 and 1997. Secretary Sarah Spiers, 18, childcare worker Jane Rimmer, 23, and lawyer Ciara Glennon, 27, all disappeared after a night out in affluent Claremont. Ms Rimmer’s and Ms Glennon’s bodies were found in bushland weeks after their respective disappearances, with cuts to their throats and defensive wounds on their arms. Investigators found no evidence of sexual assault. Ms Spiers’ body has never been found. Here, The New Daily explains how the DNA was obtained in Australia’s longest running and most expensive investigation, and why that evidence has become a focal point in a trial that continues to grip Perth. Twelve years into the Claremont investigation, WA Police made a breakthrough with the discovery of male DNA in debris under Ms Glennon’s fingernails. The DNA was discovered in 2008 by scientists in a specialised London lab, which used an advanced method called Low Copy Number analysis (LCN) not available in Perth at the time. The sample was marked as “Unknown male 4”. “We don’t have the sensitivity to detect just a single copy of DNA, so we ‘photocopy’ it up in a process called PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction],” explained Perth forensic scientist and former crime scene investigator Brendan Chapman. “It’s like boosting the signal. We do that copying process around 28 times in a normal test. With LCN we repeat that process up to as many as 35 times.” It was through that amplification that a DNA profile was gleaned. And in a stunning twist, the sample matched DNA found from intimate swabs taken from a teenager who was abducted in a Claremont park and brutally raped at Perth’s Karrakatta Cemetery in 1995 – the year before the murders began. “The DNA is packaged up in cells and in one cell is the entire genome – over three billion pieces of DNA sequence,” Mr Chapman said. “Most of the DNA is identical to any other person’s DNA. So we look at 21 short regions in today’s testing. “Those areas are chosen because they differ hugely between every person on the planet.” Now armed with the DNA of a suspect, police looked at cold cases to determine if the killer might have committed prior offences. In one cold case from 1988, an 18-year-old woman had been attacked in bed at her family home at Huntingdale, in Perth’s south-east. The woman, who was not sexually assaulted, screamed for her dad and the intruder fled, leaving behind a kimono, which he had taken from a clothes line. Semen was found on the garment, which yielded the same “unknown male” DNA. Though the case was 32 years old, the DNA was preserved. “DNA is packaged in the cell, and when a sample is kept dry and in the dark it can maintain for decades,” said Mr Chapman, a senior lecturer in forensic science at Perth’s Murdoch University. “That’s why you see forensic officers walking out from crime scenes with brown paper bags. If there is any moisture, the bag allows it to breathe.” In the end, however, it was a simpler science that finally gave police a name. At the time of the Huntingdale attack there had been other reports of a prowler, and in one case they found fingerprints at a home. Police ran the cold case prints through a database and finally got a match: allegedly, they were that of Bradley Robert Edwards. His fingerprints were on file because he had been convicted of a common assault against a woman in 1990. What followed was an undercover operation to get Edwards’ DNA. When he went to the movies, he discarded an empty Sprite bottle outside the theatre, and police swooped in and retrieved it from the bin. DNA was extracted and allegedly matched the DNA of the “unknown male”. Edwards was arrested. In a stunning twist before the trial last year, Edwards pleaded guilty to the rape and home attack, but pleaded not guilty to the murders. Edwards’ defence team argues that the debris taken from Ms Glennon’s fingernails was affected by cross-contamination in the lab during the investigation process (Edwards’ DNA had been in the lab since the rape in 1995). Edwards’ lawyer Paul Yovich has grilled in court many scientists who worked at Perth’s PathWest lab, where the DNA was examined, about their practices. Mr Yovich has also suggested that Edwards may have been in the lab, due to the fact he was a Telstra technician who mostly worked for the telco’s government clients. “If your practices are good, the chance of contamination should be very small,” said Mr Chapman, who consults on cold cases. “But people are human and by nature can make mistakes. “A modern DNA lab will do everything to mitigate every opportunity for contamination, with the aim to get that chance to as close to zero as possible.” Is the contaminated DNA theory enough for the defence to create ‘reasonable doubt’? The trial continues."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"How Bill Shorten’s dirt unit claimed Bronwyn Bishop and Sussan Ley","date":"03-02-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/02\/bill-shorten-dirt-unit-bronwyn-bishop-choppergate-sussan-ley\/","transcript":"Bill Shorten’s ‘dirt unit’ secretly orchestrated the downfall of Speaker Bronwyn Bishop in the Choppergate scandal and the demise of former Health Minister Sussan Ley by leaking a dossier of travel records to newspaper outlets to engineer a political crisis. Leaked emails have laid bare the political research unit’s success in triggering two of the biggest scandals to rock the Abbott and Turnbull government, which weakened Tony Abbott’s leadership and also sparked a major review of travel rules. But the research unit also examined Greens leader Richard Di Natale’s use of au pairs to care for his children, and former High Court judge Dyson Heydon’s appearance at a Liberal Party fundraiser. They were revelations that prompted calls for his resignation from the royal commission into unions. The emails are revealed in a new book, Party Animals, examining the Labor Party’s seven wilderness years in Opposition and the 2019 election loss. The book reveals that for six years, Mr Shorten’s office was running one of the most methodical, relentless and successful investigative journalism units in Australia. But rather than journalists, it was political staffers who prepared the material, which also targeted Mr Di Natale’s payment of au pairs and the man who led the royal commission into unions, Dyson Heydon. The Labor staffer who spotted Ms Bishop’s helicopter ride to Geelong was Ben Foster. After Ms Bishop lost her preselection and left Parliament, Mr Foster posed standing next to Ms Bishop’s official photograph as Speaker in Parliament House, raising his eyebrows and clutching a box of champagne. After examining the parliamentary travel records for VIP flights, Mr Foster saw her $5000 trip from Melbourne to Geelong and it struck him immediately as unusual. He emailed the office at 6.46pm on Thursday, June 25, 2015 in correspondence titled: Subject: Bronnie got a charter from Melbourne to GEELONG. Ryan Liddell, Mr Shorten’s press secretary, who later became his chief of staff replied, “That is ripe for the papers thank you very much.” The morning after the first story was published, Andrew Moore, a Labor staffer in the media unit, sent around the clips of ‘Hair Force One’ to outbreaks of spontaneous joy in the office. ‘Yarn going off on Herald Sun Facebook page and website!’ Shawn Lambert emailed. ‘Real good gear,’ said Mr Foster, who was most admiring of the sub-editor’s headline. Another veteran journalist turned Labor staffer Stephen Spencer, who had run the media unit under Simon Crean’s leadership but now worked for Penny Wong, trawled Twitter for evidence of Ms Bishop’s trip to Geelong. He found it, spotting photographs of Bishop’s arrival at the golf course in a helicopter. Treasurer Joe Hockey would later admit it ‘didn’t pass the sniff test’, an extravagant 75-kilometre journey helicopter ride for a distance that thousands of daily commuters would complete in their cars. It was the first of many quiet successes for the Shorten office, which helped to topple Mr Abbott and build a mythology within Labor that played into a growing sense of invincibility before the 2019 election. In 2016, Labor turned its attention to the Greens. They discovered Mr Di Natale had failed for more than a year to declare the family farm in Victoria’s Otway Ranges. A staffer in Anthony Albanese’s office, Mat Jose, then googled the maiden name of Di Natale’s wife, Lucy Quarterman. What came up was an ad of her searching for an au pair. It suggested the family was paying an au pair just $150 a week, including free rent and board. Sharing the love with Fairfax this time around, the research was provided to The Age and Sydney Morning Herald. The stories distressed Mr Di Natale and his wife. The next big hit was then health minister Sussan Ley in the summer of 2017. After a freedom of information request revealed Ms Ley had spent $12,000 to charter a VIP jet to the Gold Coast for an afternoon meeting at the Pharmacy Guild conference, the Labor Party again swung into action. Mr Shorten’s office had a paid subscription to RP Data, a property data firm that provides access to ownership data across Australia. The office had requested an RP Data subscription after the debacle involving former Victorian Labor frontbencher David Feeney failing to disclose a $2 million investment property in Northcote, which he claimed he’d forgotten he owned. ALP secretary George Wright had signed off on the subscription, which cost several thousand dollars, to ensure the Labor Party knew what houses its MPs owned. Simply by punching ‘Sussan Penelope Ley’ into the database, the fact she had bought a property on the Gold Coast immediately came up, including the sale date. The Labor Party then examined her travel records to discover if she was on any taxpayer-funded flights on the day she bought the property. By lunchtime on January 3, Shorten’s press secretary Sarah Michael was emailing a Herald Sun journalist, breaking down the extensive findings of the research. ‘RP Data records show Sussan Ley bought a property on Main Beach in Queensland on 9 May 2015,’ she wrote. ‘On 9 May 2015 she claimed travel allowance for her and her husband in Main Beach, Queensland under the guise of “minister – official business”.’ The total cost to fly her and her husband to buy the property was $3949.15. Labor’s dossier on Ms Ley ran to 27 pages. The dossier, obtained by The New Daily, forensically breaks down the travel allowance she had claimed including every flight she had taken to the Gold Coast and her COMCAR usage on those days. Later in the day, Mr Shorten’s office discussed whether to provide a comment from a Labor spokesman in the story. “This story will splash across all the states,” a staffer wrote. “Front pages all round so well done! One caveat they just got word which could be bull that a prominent AFL star may have overdosed in hospital in which case they’ll hold coz they want it on the front page. If it’s not true it’ll run tomorrow in the Tele, courier, Hun [Herald Sun] etc on the front page.” Gerard Richardson, Mr Shorten’s senior press secretary, again stressed the importance of no Labor quotes in the first story so it didn’t look like an ALP stitch-up. “Let’s leave it, but word up Keogh for tomorrow,” he said. Ms Ley confirmed to the Herald Sun the property was bought during the trip, which she declared was for “official business”. In March, the findings of the inquiry concluded she had breached the rules just once. The sole breach was using a COMCAR to take her from her hotel to the $800,000 apartment she bought, a five-minute journey. Claims she broke the rules by visiting the Gold Coast on New Year’s Eve and piloting a plane were dismissed on the grounds she could prove official business on those days. “I simply table the outcome of the investigation, as I said I would, and in doing so allow people to draw their own conclusions,” Ms Ley told Parliament. ‘Regardless of these facts, the public impression was cast.” Research units gathering damaging material on political enemies are hardly the domain of Labor alone. During the federal campaign, the Liberal Party’s negative research unit effectively weaponised Mr Shorten’s attendance at the wedding of Chinese donor Huang Xiangmo by sending photographs and video to journalists. John Macgowan, a former Liberal staffer seconded to the unit, reveals in Party Animals it was the Liberal Party that obtained the video of Mr Shorten at the wedding. “Remember, right at the beginning of the campaign, that donation scandal was sparking off?” Mr Macgowan said. “That night, we had video on TV of Huang Xiangmo’s wedding with Shorten sitting there.”  Where did they obtain the damning vision? Mr Macgowan confirms it was from all the other Liberals who attended. “There was a whole table of Liberals there,’ he laughs. “Stuff like that, we were trying to do that every day. “The real fights happen down on the ground, but you don’t want people turning on the 6pm news seeing your guy getting smashed.” Mr Macgowan also confirmed his involvement with the leak of the NSW Labor leader Michael Daley video where he complained about Asians taking young Australians’ jobs. “Our young children will flee and who are they being replaced with? They are being replaced by young people from typically Asia with PhDs,” Mr Daley said in the video. The leaked video destroyed Labor’s campaign in the March 2019 state election. It was filmed by an out-of-work journalist Daniel Pizarro, who never received a cent for the footage. “One of the kids in one of the ministers’ offices – I don’t know how he found it, but he made a meme,” Macgowan said. “I rang him up and said, “How the f–k did you find that?” We found it when it had 40 views [on YouTube].” The video was taken down before it was leaked with devastating effect during the NSW state election.

Theodor Seuss Geisel wrote more than 60 books under the pen name Dr Seuss, selling more than 600 million copies worldwide in more than 20 languages. His birthday, March 2, 1904, is the annual date for National Read Across America Day, a nationwide initiative to promote reading. Mr Geisel’s work includes childhood classics such as The Cat in the Hat (1957), Greens Eggs and Ham (1960) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (1957). His quirky stories, told through rhyming couplets and accompanied by his colourful illustrations, were famously popular among children. From encouraging readers to try new foods in Green Eggs and Ham, to promoting diversity and inclusion with How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Mr Geisel’s books were a positive force for good during the political turmoil of the 20th century. During World War II, Mr Geisel took a break from writing children’s stories to illustrate political cartoons and produce animation films for the United States Army. A Democrat and supporter of President Franklin D Roosevelt, Mr Geisel  urged action against the Nazi’s far-right political ideology before and after the US entered the war. Once the war was over, he returned to writing and published some of his best-known books, such as If I Ran the Zoo (1950) and Horton Hears a Who! (1955). Horton Hears a Who! is understood to be an allegory for the American post-war occupation of Japan. The story promotes a lesson of equality and includes the quote: “A person’s a person, no matter how small”. Mr Geisel’s last book, Oh, the Places You’ll Go, was published in 1990. Many of his witty quotes became so popular they are still used widely today. Quotes such as, “Don’t cry because it’s over. Smile because it happened”, are known to feature at graduation ceremonies and funerals. Other favourites include: “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” Dr Seuss died in 1991 at the age of 87."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Uyghurs for sale': New report exposes forced labour beyond Xinjiang","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/01\/uyghurs-forced-labour-aspi\/","transcript":"The Chinese government has secretly transferred thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minority citizens from Xinjiang to factories across the country, according to a new report that implicates brands including Apple, BMW, Google, Nike and Samsung. At least 80,000 Uyghurs have been transferred out of Xinjiang and are working under conditions that “strongly suggest forced labour” at factories across China, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute report said. These factories supply scores of well-known global brands spanning the technology, clothing and automotive sectors. The report identified 83 foreign and Chinese companies “directly or indirectly benefiting from the use of Uyghur workers outside Xinjiang through potentially abusive labour transfer programs as recently as 2019”, with some brands linked to multiple factories. One factory where Uyghur workers were sent in July 2019 listed CRRC – a Chinese state-owned rail manufacturer currently building trains in Melbourne, Australia – among its customers. The brands named in the report were: ASPI gave the companies a chance to respond to the allegations prior to the report’s publication. Adidas, Bosch and Panasonic said they had no direct contracts with the suppliers. But none of the companies were able to completely rule out a link further down their supply chain. However, American clothing brand Abercrombie & Fitch told The New Daily that it had cut dies with suppliers suspected of using forced labour independently of the ASPI report. An Abercrombie & Fitch spokesman said the firm had stopped sourcing from one of the factories named by ASPI as a supplier following a “regular review” last year. “In 2019, as part of our regular review of our global supply chain, we decided to stop sourcing from this spinner from 2020 onwards for any of our company’s brands; we formally instructed our vendor not to source any material from this spinner,” a statement by the firm said. Abercrombie & Fitch “does not believe” it sources from either of the two other factories named by ASPI as its suppliers, the spokesman said. “As a company, we are committed to ensuring our products are only made in safe and responsible facilities, and we believe that business should only be conducted with honesty and respect for the dignity and rights of all people.” Titled Uyghurs for sale: Re-education, forced labour and surveillance beyond Xinjiang, the report was written by researchers from ASPI’s International Cyber Policy Centre. Lead author Vicky Xiuzhong Xu said the findings show that forced Uyghur labour “is now a global problem”. Global brands “all have in common” a supply chain that “appears to be tainted by forced and surveilled labour”, Ms Xu said. “At no stage can we forget this forced and surveilled labour is coming from one of the most repressed regions of the world, where huge parts of the population remain under active surveillance, house arrest or arbitrary detention,” she said. China has already attracted “international condemnation for its network of extrajudicial ‘re-education camps’ in Xinjiang”, but the research exposes “a new phase in China’s social re-engineering campaign targeting minority citizens”, the report said. Ms Xu warned that companies using forced Uyghur labour in their supply chains could “find themselves in breach of international and domestic anti-modern slavery laws”. Between 2017 and 2019 at least 80,000 Uyghur workers were transferred out of Xinjiang and assigned to factories through labour transfer programs under a central government policy known as ‘Xinjiang Aid’, the ASPI report said. The estimated figure is “conservative and the actual figure is likely to be far higher”, it said. The transfers from Xinjiang to factories in eastern and central China have continued in 2020, despite much of the country remaining in lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The practice marks a new phase of China’s crackdown on the Uyghur and other Turkic minorities, following official claims that detained minorities had been freed, the researchers said. Some factories appear to be using Uyghur workers sent directly from ‘re-education’ camps, they found. Cases of “disturbing forced labour practices” were outlined in the report, but the researchers said it was “impossible to confirm whether all employment transfers from Xinjiang are forced”. Uyghur workers transferred from Xinjiang face harsh conditions and strict surveillance, the report said. “In factories far away from home, they typically live in segregated dormitories, undergo organised Mandarin and ideological training outside working hours, are subject to constant surveillance, and are forbidden from participating in religious observances,” it said. Chinese authorities and factory bosses manage these Uyghur workers by ‘tracking’ them both physically and electronically. One provincial government document obtained by the researchers described a central database that extracts information from a WeChat group, and an unnamed smartphone app that tracks the movements and activities of each worker. The report also revealed that Chinese government officials and private brokers were paid a price per head for workers on the labour assignments."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Fear mongering’ Jason Wood in strife for ‘disgusting’ Asian markets post","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/03\/01\/jason-wood-asian-markets\/","transcript":"‘Disgusting’ Asian markets selling bats are to blame for the coronavirus, according to multicultural affairs minister Jason Wood.

The swearing-in capped a week of turmoil that began with Mahathir’s resignation in an apparent bid to consolidate power, but ended with him sidelined and complaining of betrayal after decades dominating Malaysian politics. Muhyiddin’s appointment was announced by King Abdullah of Pahang on Saturday afternoon. Though the monarchy is largely ceremonial, the king can name a prime minister who he thinks “likely” to command a majority in parliament, which in practice usually reflects election results. In turn, Mahathir and the Pakatan Harapan\/Alliance of Hope coalition that made up the previous government published a list of 114 parliamentarians who they said backed Mahathir, two more than the number needed for a majority. Mahathir on Sunday described the the appointment of Muhyiddin as “strange” and said the king refused to entertain his claim of majority support. Dozens of MPs who support Mahathir met in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday morning as Mahathir told a press conference that he feels betrayed by Muhyiddin. The pair set up their now-split Bersatu party ahead of 2018 elections. “He was working on this for a long time and now he has succeeded,” Mahathir said. The anointing of Muhyiddin, a 73 year old who has been a parliamentarian since 1978 and was deputy prime minister to disgraced former premier Najib Razak, comes after a fraught and intrigue-laden week marred by shifting alliances. Mahathir said on Sunday that Muhyiddin would face an immediate vote of no-confidence when Malaysia’s parliament reconvenes on March 9. – with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bernie bruised as Biden roars back into contention with South Carolina primary win | The New Daily Joe Biden roars back with South Carolina primary win","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/us-news\/2020\/03\/01\/biden-wins-south-carolina-primary\/","transcript":"Joe Biden has scored a convincing victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary, riding a wave of African American support and ending progressive rival Bernie Sanders’ winning streak. The victory on Saturday came at a a crucial moment in Biden’s 2020 bid as he bounced back from underwhelming performances in the first three contests and headed into “Super Tuesday”, when voters in 14 states go to the polls and about a third of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination are at stake. Biden hopes the South Carolina victory will be enough to establish him as the clear alternative to Sanders as the race quickly shifts nationwide. Standing in Biden’s way, in addition to Sanders, is former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, one of the world’s richest men, who has spent more than half a billion dollars courting voters in dozens of states yet to vote. The South Carolina primary was the first major test of the candidates’ appeal among black voters. And while it gave the 77-year-old Biden a win when he most needed it, he must still prove that he has the financial and organisational resources to dramatically expand his campaign in the next 72 hours. He will also be under pressure to rely on his decades-long relationships with party leaders to create a new sense of inevitability around his candidacy. Even before news of Biden’s win was declared, Bloomberg announced his own plan to deliver a three-minute prime-time address on Sunday night on two television networks. He didn’t say how much he paid for the airtime, which is unprecedented in recent decades. And Sanders was already peeking ahead to Super Tuesday, betting he can amass an insurmountable delegate lead at that point. After two consecutive victories and a tie for the lead in Iowa, the 78-year-old Vermont senator’s confidence is surging. Sanders was spending the lead-up to Super Tuesday campaigning in the home states of two major Democratic rivals, betting he can score a double knockout blow – or at least limit the size of their victories. In a power play, Sanders hosted a midday rally on Saturday in downtown Boston, campaigning in the heart of liberal ally Elizabeth Warren’s political turf. Addressing a crowd of thousands on the Boston Common, Sanders said his success in the Democratic primary means “the establishment is getting very nervous” – but he never predicted victory in South Carolina. On the eve of Super Tuesday, Sanders will host a concert in Minnesota, where home-state Sen. Amy Klobuchar is looking for her first win. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Australia confirms first coronavirus death as Western Australian man dies","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/03\/01\/australia-first-coronavirus-death\/","transcript":"A passenger evacuated from the Diamond Princess has become the first Australian to die from a coronavirus infection, Western Australian health officials have confirmed. The 78-year-old man, whose name has not been released, passed away in the early hours of Sunday morning. His wife is also being treated for the coronavirus and remains in hospital, where her condition is listed as satisfactory. She had originally tested negative for the strain but became ill and was taken to hospital in Perth late last week. Australian hospitals are bracing for an increase in cases and the federal government has enacted an emergency plan pre-empting that the World Health Organisation will declare the flu-like virus at pandemic levels. As of Sunday afternoon, there were 27 cases of the virus across the nation with 86,983 people infected globally and 2978 have died. The elderly WA couple were among 164 Australians taken from the cruise ship which, until recent spikes in cases in South Korea and Iran, had been the site of the highest number of outbreaks outside China. On Saturday, a man who had also been on board Diamond Princess became the first UK man to die of the virus. He was one of four British passengers who had been kept in Japan after contracting the sickness during their time on board. Meanwhile, as the virus spreads with increasing speed around the world, suspicion that Iran’s coronavirus infection rate is much higher than reported has prompted a swift Australian travel ban, effective from Sunday, March 1. The secretive country has the highest official death toll outside Hubei and is now the highest risk outside China. But it is denying accusations of a cover-up. In Queensland, a beauty salon worker has been confirmed to have the sickness after returning from a trip to Iran. Authorities are trying to track down any clients who may have visited the Hair Plus salon at Australia Fair at Southport. The state’s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, said on Sunday that a number of people who’d had their hair done at the salon had been assessed at Gold Coast University Hospital. None were unwell. She said anyone who had been overseas in the past two weeks and “have become unwell” should see their GP amid the coronavirus crisis. “None of the staff are at increased risk and do not need home quarantine,” Ms Young said. “They didn’t have that sustained 15-minute exposure that is regarded for close contact.” She said the beautician at the Hair Plus salon only developed the symptoms on Thursday afternoon and had immediately reported her concerns to her employer. The woman returned to Australia from Iran on February 24. “I’ve got no concerns about the people who were on the plane with that lady who returned from Iran because she was thoroughly well and she only developed full symptoms at 3pm on Thursday,” she said. “I’m very, very comfortable that there is no risk for anyone on the plane she travelled back to Australia with.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Harvey Weinstein hits rock bottom in guarded NYC hospital cell | The New Daily Harvey Weinstein hits rock bottom in NYC hospital cell","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/celebrity\/2020\/03\/01\/harvey-weinstein-hits-rock-bottom-in-guarded-nyc-hospital-cell\/","transcript":"Harvey Weinstein is going “stir crazy, just staring at the emptiness” as he waits  under guard in a New York City hospital to begin his sentence for sexual assault and rape, a spokesman says.. The disgraced Hollywood producer was admitted late on Monday to a Bellevue Hospital unit for inmates, hours after a Manhattan jury found him guilty of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping former aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. He had been en route to New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex when he was diverted to Bellevue. Media reports said he suffered chest pain or heart palpitations. Engelmayer noted that Weinstein also suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. His conviction was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, which inspired women to hold hundreds of powerful men to account for sexual misconduct. He is due to be sentenced on March 11. Weinstein’s spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said he spent about an hour and a half with him at the hospital on Friday reflecting on the case and what the future holds for Weinstein, who faces up to 29 years in prison. His lawyers plan to appeal the verdict. He is also charged with sexual assault in Los Angeles. “It’s scaring him,” Engelmayer said in an interview. “I think he’s melancholy. He’s very, very low right now.” Far from the mansion he called home and luxury hotel suites that were his hunting ground,  Weinstein’s current accommodation is a spartan room with a bed, stainless steel toilet with no seat and large windows. Guards are stationed outside the door. Weinstein is allowed to make limited phone calls from a common area, the former producer’s spokesman said. “He doesn’t like being left alone,” Engelmayer said. “When no one’s there, he said he’s just staring at the four walls. He can go stir crazy just staring at the emptiness.” Engelmayer’s description contrasted with defence lawyer Arthur Aidala’s portrayal of his 67-year-old client after he visited him at the hospital on Tuesday. Aidala said Weinstein appeared “upbeat” and “in pretty good spirits”. More than 80 women have accused the producer of sexual misconduct, which he has denied, insisting any and all sexual encounters were consensual. Actress Ellen Barkin, a friend of Weinstein accuser Annabella Sciorra, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday: “He is in a private suite in Bellevue hospital. This is not what the jury had in mind.” Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents some of Weinstein’s accusers, questioned if he was receiving special treatment instead of being treated at the Rikers infirmary. A spokesman for the New York City Department of Correction said only that he was in their custody and that “health care is provided as appropriate.” – with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Kiwi super fund renounces all fossil-fuel investments | The New Daily Kiwi super fund renounces all fossil-fuel investments","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/science\/environment\/2020\/03\/01\/nz-super-fund-drops-fossil-fuels\/","transcript":"The New Zealand government is ring-fencing billions of dollars from fossil fuels investment, effectively divesting much of the country’s superannuation scheme. Advocates are urging the Australian government to do the same, following a worldwide trend towards divestment. On Sunday, Commerce Minister Kris Faafoi announced the country’s ‘KiwiSaver’ accounts would be going green. From next year, default funds will no longer be able include ‘fossil fuel production’ companies in their portfolios. “This reflects the Government’s commitment to addressing the impacts of climate change and transitioning to a low-emissions economy,” Mr Faafoi said. “It also makes sense for the funds themselves, given that there is a risk of investing in stranded assets as the world moves to reduce emissions.” KiwiSaver is New Zealand’s superannuation-style scheme, in which Kiwis are encouraged to put a fraction of their income in a savings deposit, which is then topped by employers and the government. The decision will impact the 690,000 Kiwis remaining with their default provider, which each invest somewhere between 0.49 per cent and 2.4 per cent of their portfolio in fossil fuels. At the end of 2019, there were 2.9 million KiwiSaver accounts in total, with a total value of $NZ59 billion ($A56.5 billion). New Zealand has already changed the rules on its $NZ47 billion ($A45 billion) Superannuation Fund, which supports the country’s pension system. That decision, in 2017, removed more than $NZ3 billion ($A2.9 billion) from fossil fuel-related stocks “without negatively affecting performance” according to Mr Faafoi. “Moving away from investments in fossil fuels doesn’t have to mean lower returns.” Simon Sheikh, chief executive officer of Future Super, Australia’s first fossil fuel-free super fund, said the decision would safeguard the investments of New Zealanders. “They’ve taken a moral stand but also an important risk stand,” he said. “The decision is going to protect New Zealand savers, and it’s the same sort of protection that Australians should be looking for.” With around $A12.2 trillion in funds worldwide that have pledged to sell out of fossil fuel assets, Mr Shiekh said the Australian government should change its own settings to do similarly. “It makes sense because the vast majority of Australian superannuation savers don’t want to invest in fossil fuels but they unwittingly do,” he said. “The government has been rather unconcerned … but regulators have all expressed strong concerns about the impact that climate change on Australia’s financial systems.” The New Zealand Greens, part of the coalition government run by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, claimed the decision as a “big Green win”. The opposition National party attacked the decision, with finance spokesman Paul Goldsmith saying the government was “tinkering around the edges and indulging in virtue signalling”. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"US troops to withdraw from Afghanistan in historic peace deal","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/01\/usa-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan\/","transcript":"US troops will start withdrawing from Afghanistan immediately, US President Donald Trump says, following the signing a peace deal with the Taliban. The historic deal if upheld could bring an end to America’s ‘longest-fought war’. The ‘Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan’ was signed in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday and witnessed by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr Trump on Sunday told reporters that American troops would begin leaving Afghanistan. “Today. They will start immediately,” Mr Trump said at the White House, in response to a question about a withdrawal. “No one should be criticising this deal, after 19 years,” he said, referring to the length of the US involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan. Acknowledging a military stalemate after nearly two decades of conflict, the US signed the peace agreement with the Taliban to end America’s longest war and bring US troops home after they invaded in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The historic deal, signed by chief negotiators from the two sides and witnessed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could see the withdrawal of all American and allied forces in the next 14 months and allow Mr Trump to keep a key campaign pledge to extract the US from “endless wars.” But it could also easily unravel, particularly if the Taliban fail to meet their commitments. At the White House, Mr Trump told reporters the US deserves credit for having helped Afghanistan take a step toward peace. He spoke cautiously of the deal’s prospects for success and cautioned the Taliban against violating their commitments. “We think we’ll be successful in the end,” he said, referring to all-Afghan peace talks and a final US exit. He said he will be “meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not-too-distant future,” and described the group as “tired of war.” He did not say where or why he plans to meet with Taliban leaders. He said he thinks they are serious about the deal they signed but warned that if it fails, the US could restart combat. “If bad things happen, we’ll go back” in with military firepower, Mr Trump said. Mr Pompeo was similarly cautious. “Today, we are realistic. We are seizing the best opportunity for peace in a generation,” Mr Pompeo said in the Qatari capital of Doha. “Today, we are restrained. We recognise that America shouldn’t fight in perpetuity in the graveyard of empires if we can help Afghans forge peace.” Under the agreement, the US would draw its forces down to 8600 from 13,000 in the next three-to-four months, with the remaining US forces withdrawing in 14 months. The complete pullout would depend on the Taliban meeting their commitments to prevent terrorism, including specific obligations to renounce al-Qaeda and prevent that group or others from using Afghan soil to plot attacks on the US or its allies. The deal sets the stage for intra-Afghan peace talks to begin around March 10, with the aim of negotiating a permanent cease-fire and a power-sharing agreement between rival Afghan groups. It’s perhaps the most complicated and difficult phase of the plan. It does not, however, tie America’s withdrawal to any specific outcome from the all Afghan talks, according to US officials. Mr Pompeo said that “the chapter of American history on the Taliban is written in blood” and stressed that while the road ahead would be difficult, the deal represented “the best opportunity for peace in a generation.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Boris Johnson announces engagement - and baby on the way","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/01\/boris-johnson-baby\/","transcript":"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds have announced they are expecting a baby and are engaged. “The Prime Minister and Miss Symonds are very pleased to announce their engagement and that they are expecting a baby in the early summer,” a spokesperson for the couple said on Saturday. Ms Johnson, 55, and Ms Symonds, 31, made history as the first unmarried couple to officially live together in Downing Street when they moved in to the official prime minister’s residence last year. Ms Symonds, a conservationist and former Conservative Party communications chief, first found herself making headlines when she was romantically linked to Johnson earlier in 2019. But her association with Mr Johnson dates back to when she worked on his successful re-election bid at City Hall in 2012. An early summer birth would suggest the new arrival was conceived during the Autumn, around the time the October 31 Brexit deadline was extended. The new arrival will be the third baby born to a serving British prime minister in recent history. Tony Blair’s wife Cherie gave birth to son Leo in May 2000, three years after her husband’s first election victory. Conservative prime minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha welcomed daughter Florence Rose Endellion Cameron into the world in 2010, three months after Cameron had formed a coalition government. Mr Johnson separated from his second wife Marina Wheeler in 2018 after marrying in 1993 and having four children. Mr Johnson’s marriage to first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen was annulled in 1993. In 2013 it emerged Mr Johnson had fathered a daughter during an adulterous liaison while he was London mayor in 2009.

Crowds were down on last year with an estimated 200,000 attending the parade on Oxford Street, compared to 300,000 last year. More than 12,600 participants marched at this year’s parade on almost 200 floats. Festivities began with an Aboriginal smoking ceremony and Welcome to Country by Graham Simms, wearing a glamorous gold sequenced dress. As they always do, the Dykes On Bikes kicked off the parade proper with more than 150 bikes revving and tooting their way down Oxford Street. Among the crowd were Federal Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, Sydney City councillor Christine Forster and her wife Virginia Edwards, and ABC chair Ita Buttrose. Ms Forster said this was the first year she and her wife had not marched in the parade. “It’s the first time we’ve actually seen the Dykes on Bikes — that was really fun,” she said. “It’s always a terrific moment for Sydney. It brings so much colour and life and positivity to the city. “We have had a pretty tough few months in Australia with bushfires and coronavirus and this is a good news event.” The 78ers, who marched in Sydney’s first Mardi Gras 42 years ago, drew huge cheers from the crowd. As did Perth-based suicide prevention charity Haka for Life, which did the haka down the parade route while offering supportive words to those who may be suffering depression. But some of the loudest cheers were for NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) and their emergency services counterparts who have been battling blazes for months. RFS volunteer Samara Moat, from North Rocks, said she was having an amazing time at her first Mardi Gras. “It’s been absolutely fantastic to let our hair down,” she said. Fire and Rescue NSW Assistant Commissioner Paul McGuigan said the event had been wonderful after a busy year and the crowd had been right behind them. “We get fantastic support every year but this year is really special,” he said. “It’s a really nice way to celebrate what’s been a challenging year with the whole community coming together.” British pop star Dua Lipa briefly joined the parade, dancing and posing for photos with marchers from Surf Life Saving Australia as her song One Kiss blasted on the speakers. Sam Smith also made a brief appearance marching to their song Tonight before heading into the VIP area. Marchers also danced to Whitney Houston, Lizzo, Kylie Minogue and Abba. Labor’s Kristina Keneally and Penny Wong joined the Rainbow Labor float. Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore rode in a convertible with Alex Greenwich for the City of Sydney’s float. About 60 ABC employees marched in the organisation’s first Mardi Gras float, including managing director David Anderson and News Breakfast weatherman Nate Byrne. In an apparent protest, a group of marchers wearing navy blue jumpsuits with the words “Department of Homo Affairs” across the back, along with others donning giant Scott Morrison masks, attempted to block the Liberal Party float behind it. Police intervened to drag one member of the group from the parade. It is believed the group were not on the official Mardi Gras line up. Drag king Guy Alias said it was his second time at Mardi Gras, having come out “a little later in life”. “Mardi Gras means absolute pride, joy and acceptance — just being loved for who you are and a complete excuse to be fabulous,” he said. Jack Williams from Naisda Dance College on the Central Coast took part in the smoking ceremony. The 20-year-old said he considered Mardi Gras to be a celebration of his ability to overcome adversity earlier in his life. “I grew up in foster care and it was pretty harsh. I got tossed around a couple of homes because they found out I was gay,” Mr Williams said. “It’s an achievement to say I can do this, I can be me and not worry anymore. “Mardi Gras is Christmas, it’s the Oscars, it’s Halloween, it’s my birthday all rolled into one. “It’s the greatest night to be someone like me.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Highest risk outside China': Australia enacts Iran travel ban","date":"03-01-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/03\/01\/coronavirus-iran-travel-ban\/","transcript":"A passenger evacuated from the Diamond Princess has become the first Australian to die from the disease, Western Australian health officials have confirmed.

Cases of the virus from Iran are already spreading to a number of countries, including Australia, where NSW authorities on Sunday confirmed the state’s fifth confirmed case of the disease, and New Zealand, despite no direct flights and a relatively low number of travellers from the Middle Eastern nation. At the centre of the the latest NSW diagnosis is male in his 40s who arrived in Sydney from Iran on February 22 and didn’t develop symptoms of COVID-19 until two days later. He was tested on February 28 after coming in contact with an unknown number of people and was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Saturday, NSW Health said in a statement. The man has relatively minor symptoms and has been taken to Westmead Hospital. A Gold Coast beautician who returned from Iran become Australia’s latest victim on Saturday and authorities are racing to track down 40 of her customers. The World Health Organisation is also scrambling to get its officials into Iran as the Islamic State’s health ministry revealed it was preparing for the possibility of “tens of thousands” needing testing for coronavirus. It comes as the USA recorded its first death of a patient in Washington state – a woman in her 50s with a high medical risk. Iran Health Ministry spokesman spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 43 people had died amid 593 confirmed cases but denied claims of a cover-up. However, his acknowledgement of the number of people potentially wanting testing shows how concerned Iran is over the virus, especially after days of officials downplaying it. Mr Jahanpour also urged people not to attend funerals of the dead, as a mass gathering could help spread the virus. From Sunday, Australians are advised not to travel to Iran and foreigners coming from Iran will be banned from entering Australia. Health Minister Greg Hunt said the ban was prompted by the high death rate in Iran. “They have the highest death rate … outside of Hubei,” he told reporters in Melbourne on Saturday. “There is likely at this stage a high level of undetected cases, and therefore those cases won’t be intercepted or identified on departure from Iran.” While world leaders have generally urged calm as the disease spreads, epidemiologists’ greatest fear is that the world is poised to see a repeat of the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed as many as 100 million.  The 63-year-old Gold Coast woman whose coronavirus was undetected on leaving Iran returned to Australia on Monday, but began feeling ill on Thursday while at work. She saw up to 40 people at the Hair Plus salon at Australia Fair at Southport. Queensland’s chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young said because most of the contact the woman had with each customer was less than 15 minutes, the risk she had passed on the virus was “incredibly low”. Health officials were in the process of contacting customers and anyone who visited the salon from 11am on Thursday was urged to contact Gold Coast University Hospital. The latest restrictions for Iran are now consistent with those in place for China. It comes just days after the government extended the ban on people coming from China for a further week. Under the new restrictions, Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family who’ve travelled to Iran will be required to self isolate. Foreign nationals who are in Iran will be banned from entering Australia for 14 days, from the time they have left or travelled through the country. There are now 85,153 coronavirus cases worldwide and 2922 reported deaths across 58 countries.New outbreaks have been confirmed in Iceland, New Zealand and Mexico. So far 25 people in Australia have been diagnosed and all have been cleared. The Perth victim was among nine trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, with the other eight being treated in their home states. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said it’s likely Australia will continue to see more cases. “It’s very unlikely we can prevent further cases coming into Australia, but the case in Queensland has been well followed up,” he told reporters. “Our aim at the moment is to detect any cases we see over coming weeks and contain them as much as possible to delay the spread of this virus in Australia.” Elderly people, particularly those aged over 80, as well as those with health issues like diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease are most at risk of developing Covid-19. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"This is how people are rebuilding their lives after the bushfires","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/02\/29\/bushfires-south-arm-rebuild\/","transcript":"Along a dirt road in the middle of the Nambucca valley, 515kms from Sydney an old ute, beat up on one side, disrupts the dust as it cruises along. The soft rumble of the old engine, tyres on gravel – it’s the only sound for miles. It’s the start of January and it’s stifling hot. It’s been three weeks since the fire came through South Arm. The bush is black on black. Green shoots are yet to emerge. Every few minutes the ute passes a burnt-out tractor, a shed still standing, the remains of somebody’s home. Normally, this is cattle country. Now, a sea of ash. Beck Beverly drives with her friend Tara to farms too far out to get reception. People are living in tents, relying on the bottled water she brings them. There’s free water in town, but that’s an hour drive for some and petrol is in short supply. She does the meet and greet, checks on their health and offloads the supplies. Then they drive to the next property. The daily repetition was all they could do to help people survive. Now, looking back on those first three weeks, she said could see the stages of grief on their faces. “We met quite a few people. By week three you could see the shock had started to fade the reality was setting in,” she said. “People were isolated, they didn’t have food or water. So we piled my ute full, made care packs of food and toiletries, and drove to each property that was impacted. We did that for three weeks.” South Arm is a small community with just over 230 residents. The closest town, Nambucca Heads, sits on the coast 40 minutes away. “We lost 61 homes, and we lost double that in what they call non-council approved houses. They were homes, they just didn’t have approval. So about 120 households.” Since January, Beck’s been running the town hall like a drop-in centre. People can get water, food, connect to the internet, and a tent if they need. On Friday’s they provide a lunch. “I realised we needed something in the community to bring us together,” Beck said. “For farming communities to lose hope, it’s pretty dire. They’re a resilient bunch usually. This fire was catastrophic and it comes off the back of the worst drought we’ve been in,” she added.  After losing her home, Pauline Taylor stayed with friends for the first few weeks until she got a tent to set up in the paddock. “For seven weeks we moved every two days, between about three people,” Pauline said. “That’s a big strain because you’re trying not leave a footprint. You don’t want to be a burden to people who are giving their house to you. “I have been in my paddock ever since.” For weeks she was showering and charging her phone at the town hall. After almost a month, two ladies donated a caravan to Pauline. “I pretended it was a holiday for a bit, but after three weeks I got over the wind. I won’t say it’s been easy, it’s been difficult. Being on bottled water and only having a bucket.” Pauline had to delay going back to work – cleaning up, dealing with insurance and working out the next steps became a full-time job. “You’re learning as you go. There’s grants from the charities, you’ve got to find paperwork, the bill with your address, and something saying it’s all burnt down,” Pauline said. “I understand there are charlatans who claim things, but it makes it difficult for the people who are legitimate,” she said. Pauline’s getting through it, slowly. She faced the caravan away from the rubble of her home so she wasn’t reminded of it. At night she watches the sunset. “You have to be patient. There’s a lot of people in the same situation and that’s been an unexpected benefit. I’ve met people I didn’t know existed. There are lots of tears, men included, but there’s a lot of laughing.” One of those people is Carol. She had always lived close by, but the pair had never spoken. In the aftermath, the shared grief of losing their homes has brought them together. Carol, and her husband Troy, have reception on their property but they had no warning, no text message from the NSW Rural Fire Service to say they were under threat. Troy tried to stay and fight, but the fire was out of control. “It was an old machinery shed we had turned into a house,” said Carol. “It was steel. We thought it would be fine, we didn’t expect a complete and utter wipeout,” she said. “There were no mirrors, there was nothing. It was like it went ‘poof’. Yeah, that was quite confronting.” Carol said her neighbours lost their house, and aren’t coming back: “It wasn’t a normal bushfire”. They’re fighting with their insurance provider. They’re asking for full coverage, because they had full loss. The insurer doesn’t want to play ball, she said. But Carol said the hardest part was reporting again and again that you’ve lost everything. Managing re-building not just your home, but your life. “Everyone wants the information again. The council, disaster clinic, Red Cross, Salvos, Rapid Relief Team, Blazeaid. You make six calls to one and you’re back at the beginning,” she said. “The rules change, they can change between morning and afternoon. “I struggled initially because I like to be organised, it was mayhem, but my partner struggled because he thought it was his fault we lost everything. “I’m much better these days. We’re moving forward without a lot of help.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Getty Awards: The compelling photographs that defined 2019","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/29\/getty-awards-2019\/","transcript":"A woman screaming at police, a prime minister showing compassion and the Pope visiting Thailand. These are the some of the award-winning images that encapsulated 2019. After analysing hundreds of images taken across the Asia Pacific, judges have announced the top photographs that defined a moment or a movement last year. Cassie Trotter, Getty Images’ head of editorial in the Asia-Pacific, said judges would usually look for two main skills when assessing an entry: ability and creativity. “It’s a really tough competition,” Ms Trotter told The New Daily. “Can the photographer work with long lens? Short lens? How do they work with the light, with the subject? We like to reward a different eye.” The Best News Picture of the Year was awarded to Laurel Chor for her image of a woman screaming at police officers in Hong Kong during the pro-democracy protests. The political and social unrest in Hong Kong was the “biggest sustained story” of 2019, Ms Trotter said. “That image of a woman screaming at police … that image encapsulated it. “It gives you the feeling that the people aren’t happy.” In second place for Best News Picture of the Year was a photograph of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern embracing a Muslim worshipper after a right-wing extremist opened fire and killed more than 50 mosque-goers in Christchurch. Ms Trotter said the image, captured by Wellington-based photographer Hagen Hopkins outside Kilbirnie mosque, was a “stand-out” in the eyes of the judges. “Capturing something like that is an art,” she said. “He didn’t have time to go, ‘Is the background perfect?’ Instead he thought ‘I’m going to get down lower, I’m going to get to the level of the people, trying not to disturb… I need to be here for this, I want this to capture what I’m feeling’.” The powerful image has been painted on a silo in Brunswick in inner-city Melbourne. The third Best News Photograph of the Year was awarded to American journalist Paula Bronstein for her image of Pope Francis visiting young Catholics in Thailand. “This photograph demonstrates access and years of experience,” Ms Trotter said. “Knowing the Pope is coming, you could stand in front, or shoot from the side, but this photographer thought, ‘I could get above and shoot from an angle’. “There’s just something about it, the hands reaching in, and the shape it creates.” Other award-winning photographs include an image of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam, a woman wearing an Australian-themed hat at Oaks Day in Melbourne, and Nick Allbrook of the band Pond performing at the Splendour in the Grass music festival."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"The bushfires' hidden aftermath: Surging risk of domestic abuse","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/29\/bushfires-domestic-violence\/","transcript":"Deciding to leave an abusive partner is known to be one of the most dangerous times for domestic violence victims. But after a bushfire, violent perpetrators have even more reason to suspect their partner will divorce them or end their relationship as the loss of property, animals or other valuables means there is less binding them together. That’s the warning from psychologist Lyn Bender, who says depression and stress can lead to anger, and result in out-of-control behaviour. It would come as a surprise if a genuinely loving partner became abusive, she said. “What we know about the history of violent acts is there are different kinds of control, contempt and rage that have been operating.” Abuse doesn’t always translate into physical violence, Ms Bender stressed. “If the man wanted to control a woman he doesn’t even have to hit her, he just has to instill the fear that he could.” Researchers in 2013 concluded the “unmistakable” finding that domestic violence had increased after Black Saturday in February 2009. All 30 female interview subjects from the worst-hit areas spoke of increased community or domestic violence. Of these, 17 women had been personally and badly affected, nine of whom experienced no violence before the fires and seven subjects having enjoyed settled and happy relationships.  Clinical psychologist Ruth Nelson said people who have done the work to notice when their stress is building and how to manage that will be better equipped to cope and know when to seek help. But if they don’t have those skills and there already are “so many pieces of stress falling into your life”, natural disasters can “push you from coping with what’s happening in your life to not coping”, Ms Nelson said. “Those beliefs that you hold about being entitled to blame someone else and being entitled to take out your anger on someone physically weaker, someone who you can have power and control over … starts to be revealed (and) it spills out in the home in intimate partner violence.” Nicole Beecroft’s home and everything in it including some animals were lost on Black Saturday in February 2009. She and her husband were traumatised and in shock but their relationship never became volatile – far from it, actually. They both respected each other’s strengths and weaknesses when it came to rebuilding. “I’m not getting involved in what I don’t understand and he does, and he’s not getting involved in what he doesn’t understand and I do,” Ms Beecroft said. Despite having a frugal mindset, the couple respected each other’s decision to fork out however much on whatever they thought was valuable and worth the expense. “I just believe that if he thinks spending x-amount of dollars on a particular thing is reasonable then it’s reasonable for him and so my reasoning isn’t better than his reasoning,” Ms Beecroft said. As for needing support, they took it in turns. “I would be a bit more vulnerable then he’d prop me up and he’d be a bit more vulnerable and I’d prop him up. It’s almost like we would draw on strength to help the other person.” Psychologist Ruth Nelson says:"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus puts 100,000 tourism jobs on the line","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/02\/29\/coronavirus-tourism-blowout\/","transcript":"The impact of coronavirus threat isn’t just eating up the budget surplus, it will cost the tourism industry $4 billion and up to 133,200 jobs, new data shows. The outbreak will mean 1.8 million fewer tourists on our shores between January and June, with the monthly hit to the industry around $2 billion, modelling from the Tourism and Transport Forum (TTF) reveals. The jaw-dropping estimate comes after the Australian Tourism Export Council revealed in January that the number of bookings was already down by 10 to 20 per cent because of the bushfires – meaning the nation could easily loose more than $6.5 billion by the end of June. In short, it’s a bad time for tourism. By comparing the spread of coronavirus to the SARS outbreak, the TTF estimated between 99,000 and 133,200 people in the tourism industry could lose their jobs. And TTF CEO Margy Osmond said it would only get worse. “What we are facing is a contracted visitor economy with significant losses across international visitation, tourism spend and employment in 2020 and beyond,” Ms Osmond said. “When you look at SARS, there were 29 countries affected over nine months. Our current situation is 29 countries over eight weeks and counting. Not to mention 79,000 cases-plus for coronavirus, compared to 8098 for SARS,” she added. Ms Osmond said while the COVID-19 outbreak was yet to be classified as a pandemic, the [federal] Treasurer had already indicated the economic impact will be greater than the bushfires and it will play-out more broadly across the Australian economy. “What is unique about tourism is that we have been directly in the firing line for both crises,” she said. The affects of the bushfires, and now tightening travel bans, are being felt across the country. On the Gold Coast hinterland Robyn Fortescue, who runs a bed and breakfast overlooking the Scenic Rim and the Great Dividing Range, told The New Daily her business was still feeling the fallout from the bushfire season. “We don’t know what the long term effects of all this are going to be. It’s very new territory,” she said. “We’re pretty quiet, but I generally find February is a quieter month so it’s hard to tell… Our forward bookings are not great.” After the fires, Ms Fortescue said, climate change had become a concern for many in the local tourism industry. “We do have concerns …t extremes in temperature are not healthy for tourism obviously,” she said. “People come here for the weather as much as the ambience. If they’re surrounded by smoke or checking the weather constantly, it’s not a healthy thing in the industry.” Desperate to cushion some of the blow from the two events, Tourism Australia launched a $40 million campaign, ‘There’s still nothing like Australia’ to lure back British and Asian tourists. Federal Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham said the campaign would help deal with the “double whammy” of bushfires and the impact of the virus. “This targeted campaign activity in some of our key markets is about getting the message out there quickly that Australia is open for business and is a still hugely popular and safe destination to visit that offers amazing experiences,” Senator Birmingham said. But the message might soon get overshadowed by news out of Queensland, where Australia’s premier tourist destination is at risk of a wide-spread outbreak of coral bleaching. A concerning cocktail of clear skies, weak tides and above-average ocean temperatures are coming together on the Great Barrier Reef, raising concerns it may be hit with a mass bleaching event in the coming weeks. Macquarie University’s Professor Lesley Hughes has studied the impact of climate change on the tourism industry and said a major bleaching event following hot on the heels of the fires and coronavirus would devastate the industry. “A lot of tourists aren’t here because of the coronavirus. But thinking more long term, if we do get a bad bleaching event this season it’s simply adding to the feeling international and nationally that the Reef is done for,” she said. Although the coronavirus has meant fewer tourists on our beaches, the on-going concern climate change-driven disasters and global perceptions of Australia’s natural wonders. “Nobody visits Australia to see the Opera House,” Professor Hughes said. “If you look at the top reasons tourists come it’s the Reef, our beaches, our wildlife. “The many photos of burnt koalas, I think that will have an impact. A lot of tourism is driven by perception as well as actuality. So that’s important.” Climate Councillor Professor Will Steffen agreed, saying this season’s fires are just a taste of things to come. “The tourism industry will definitely be worse in the future,” he said. “There’s a big lag built into the climate system. If we could cut emissions to zero tomorrow, we would still get rising temperatures for a couple of decades."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Intrigue reigns in Malaysia as PM Mahathir is axed as his own party's leader | The New Daily Intrigue reigns in Malaysia as PM axed by own party","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/asia-news\/2020\/02\/29\/malaysias-mahathir-axed-by-own-party\/","transcript":"Fresh layers of confusion have been piled on Malaysia’s tempestuous politics, with the country’s 94-year-old interim Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad removed as chairman of his own Bersatu party on Saturday. It’s the latest twist in a week-long struggle for control of one of Asia’s wealthier economies. Mahathir had announced on Saturday morning that he had regained the backing of the Pakatan Harapan\/Alliance of Hope coalition. He had broken with the coalition on Monday when unexpectedly resigning as prime minister. However, Bersatu party president Muhyiddin Yassin said he was replacing Mahathir as chairman. Other party members disputed the attempted takeover. On Friday Muhyiddin emerged as front-runner to become prime minister. Various party statements gave him the backing of 95 parliamentarians, putting him ahead of rival Anwar Ibrahim’s 92 in the race to reach the majority of 112 votes needed. Mahathir had appeared to rule himself out returning as leader earlier in the week amid a breach with his former allies, including Anwar, who was previously promised the top job in a handover due to take place sometime in 2020. Muhyiddin is counting on the support of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the party of former premier Najib Razak who is now on trial on charges of looting hundreds of millions of dollars of public money. However, both Mahathir and the alliance had stated that they would not allow UMNO back into government. – with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Jacinda Ardern 'mauled' Morrison over Kiwi crims: Labor MP | The New Daily Labor MP: Jacinda Ardern 'mauled' Morrison over Kiwi crims","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/29\/jacinda-ardern-mauled-morrison-over-kiwi-crims-labor-mp\/","transcript":"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s swipe at Prime Minister Scott Morrison over Australia’s deportation laws for criminals has been likened to a rugby maul between the two countries during a Bledisloe Cup match. Ms Ardern used a media conference on an official visit on Friday, alongside Mr Morrison to deliver a blunt message on the policy, which has seen about 2000 people sent back to New Zealand. “Australia is well within its rights to deport individuals who break your laws. New Zealand does the same. But we have a simple request – send back Kiwis, genuine Kiwis,” she said. “Do not deport your people and your problems.” Labor frontbencher Jason Clare said the relationship is clearly under stress at the moment. “I haven’t seen Australia so badly mauled by New Zealand since the last time we played the All Blacks,” Mr Clare quipped during an interview with ABC television on Saturday. “This was pretty awful stuff.” But he understood Mr Morrison’s argument that if you are a criminal born in another country and you serve jail time in Australia, you should go back to the country that you were born in. “Regardless of whether that’s New Zealand or whether it is on the other side of the world,” he said. Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski didn’t think it was the most effective way for Ms Ardern to deliver her message. “I think there was an amount of political grandstanding involved in what she did,” he told ABC television. “I don’t think it is helpful either to the relationship for Australia and New Zealand or the policy outcomes that she is seeking to achieve.” -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Queensland authorities track 40 customers treated by beautician | The New Daily","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/29\/coronavirus-cases-rise-queensland-beautician\/","transcript":"There are fears up to 40 people may have been exposed to coronavirus after a Gold Coast beautician tested positive. It brings the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia to 25 – nine of them in Queensland — as the World Heath Organisation raised the risk of the spread of the disease to “very high”. The 63-year-old beautician, who recently returned from Iran, is in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital after becoming ill on Thursday while treating customers at the Hair Plus salon in the Australia Fair shopping centre at Southport. Queensland health authorities are trying to track down dozens of clients who had facial treatments in sessions lasting less than 15 minutes and may have been exposed the virus. “She saw a number of clients each for brief interactions, so we believe the risk is incredibly low,” Dr Young said. “Because as soon as she had her first symptom – and she is a highly intelligent, very sensitive lady – she spoke to her manager and she went home and she went to Gold Coast University Hospital to get tested. “She did everything perfectly, you couldn’t have asked more of her. “She came back from Iran, she was perfectly well on the flight back into Australia and up to the Gold Coast, and then a couple of day later she developed some symptoms.” Dr Young urged anyone who attended the Hair Plus salon at Australia Fair at Southport from 11am on Thursday to come forward. Dr Young said there was no need for anyone who was at the shopping centre at the same time, to be concerned. “We’ve got no concerns about her flight,” Dr Young said. “We’ve got no concerns about that first day, it’s only on Thursday when she developed symptoms. “There is no need to have any concerns prior to that. “But we know we will be seeing an epidemic here in Queensland eventually. “We’d like to contain the virus, as we have been, for as long as possible and I believe that we’re doing that very effectively at the moment.” Health minister Steven Miles also reassured Queenslanders the Covid-19 virus remained contained across the state, despite the latest development. There are now nine confirmed cases in the state. Meanwhile, a 79-year-old west Australian woman has tested positive after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. According to Johns Hopkins University’s realtime heat map, there are 85,176 cases world wide and 2919 reported deaths. “The continuing increase in the number of cases and number of affected countries over the last few days are clearly of concern,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe said in Geneva. He said that 24 COVID-19 cases have now been exported from Italy, now the worst-hit country in Europe, to 14 countries and that 97 cases have been exported from Iran to 11 countries. The UN health agency had previously labelled the global risk as “high” but still short of calling it a pandemic. The Australian government is already putting in place plans to tackle a pandemic. In particular, it is looking at how aged care facilities could be locked down in the case of a coronavirus outbreak. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says while some countries such as Japan are looking at closing schools, there is no need to do that in Australia based on current medical advice. However, the virus known as COVID-19 affects the elderly more. “The bigger impact would be in things like aged care facilities, the ability to lock those down, and to have the right care and support to those who are working in those places,” Mr Morrison said on Friday. Health ministers who met in Melbourne on Friday agreed the Commonwealth would take the lead on an aged care advanced planning process. “Those who are elderly or those who have difficulties with their immune system are most at risk and that is why they are absolute top priority,” federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said. Aged care providers received a letter this week from Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy outlining the need for them to have emergency plans in place. Federal opposition frontbencher Jason Clare said the government is doing the right thing even though the WHO has yet to declare a pandemic. “They have followed the advice of the chief medical officer … they have followed the advice of the experts,” Mr Clare told ABC television on Saturday. Meanwhile, South Korea has reported 594 new cases of coronavirus, a big rise bringing the total to 2931, the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Of the 594 new cases, 476 occurred in Daegu, 300 kilometres south-east of Seoul, and 60 were reported in neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, news agency Yonhap reported. Many of the country’s cases have been linked to the Shincheonji church in Daegu. Experts expect the number of confirmed cases to rise further, as authorities test some 210,000 members of the church, Yonhap said. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"As of the last day of February 2020, there are 85,176 coronavirus cases and 2919 deaths | The New Daily","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/galleries\/coronavirus-50-countries-pandemic-2919-deaths\/","transcript":""},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Turkey to let Syrian refugees into Europe | The New Daily","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/02\/29\/turkey-to-let-syrian-refugees-into-europe\/","transcript":"Refugees in Turkey are headed towards European frontiers after the borders had been thrown open, a response to the escalating war in Syria where 33 Turkish soldiers were killed by Russian-backed Syrian government troops. Moscow and Ankara traded blame over Thursday’s strike in northwest Syria, the deadliest attack on Turkish forces in nearly 30 years. The UN Security Council called an emergency meeting to avert open conflict between Russia and NATO member Turkey. US President Donald Trump, in a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, condemned the attack and reaffirmed Washington’s support for Ankara’s efforts to avert a humanitarian disaster in Syria. The two leaders also said Syria and Russia must halt their offensives in northwest Syria, White House spokesman Judd Deere said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described it as “one of the most alarming moments” of the nine-year-old Syrian war. “The most pressing need is an immediate ceasefire before the situation gets entirely out of control,” Guterres told reporters in New York. Turkey’s neighbours Greece and Bulgaria, both European Union member states, vowed not to admit the migrants and reinforced their borders following Ankara’s threat to reopen the frontier. It was closed under an accord between Turkey and the European Union that halted the 2015-16 migration crisis when more than a million people crossed into Europe by foot. As news of Thursday’s strike emerged, a senior Turkish official told Reuters the government had decided, effective immediately, not to stop Syrian refugees from reaching Europe “by land or sea,” and that police and border guards had been stood down. Within hours hundreds of migrants, some wearing face masks in an apparent attempt to guard against the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the world, began arriving on the European frontier in the early morning light. “We heard about it on the television,” said Afghan migrant Sahin Nebizade, 16, in a group packed into taxis on the outskirts of Istanbul. At the Pazarkule border post with Greece, scores of migrants faced barbed wire fences and smoke grenades. Some stuck in the no-man’s land between the two countries tried to return to the Turkish side, only to be turned back by Turkish authorities.  The EU said that Ankara had made no formal announcement of any change in policy at the border. Inside Syria, there was ample evidence of the renewed fighting that has caused perhaps the worst humanitarian crisis of the conflict. A million civilians have been displaced since December inside Syria near the Turkish border in desperate winter conditions. Turkey, already home to 3.7 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot take more. Syria’s civil war has worsened dramatically in recent months despite largely vanishing from Western countries’ agendas. Government forces, backed by Russian air power, have launched a major assault to capture the northwest, the last remaining territory held by rebels backed by Turkey. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Coronavirus triggers national medical stockpile as COVID-19 threat intensifies | The New Daily","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/29\/coronavirus-national-medical-stockpile\/","transcript":"It could be any warehouse in Australia. In fact, you may travel past it every day and not even know. In multiple secret locations across Australia, about $100 million worth of medical supplies – including 20 million masks, antibiotics, vaccines and equipment such as basic hand sanitisers – is sitting on huge pallets wrapped in plastic, ready to be deployed. It has been gradually accumulated over more than a decade in case of a bioterrorist attack, medical emergencies or pandemics. It’s known as the National Medical Stockpile (NMS). And with coronavirus almost certain to be declared a pandemic, according to the Prime Minister, the stockpile is now, according to health authorities, set to become a critical element of the response to COVID-19 – its first major use in more than a decade. States and territories request access to the stockpile – which is described by the Department of Health as a “strategic reserve of pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment” – with final approval given by chief medical officer Brendan Murphy. So far during the coronavirus epidemic, more than 1.4 million surgical masks have been handed to GPs, health workers, pharmacists, and government agencies dealing with “at-risk or high-risk individuals at the border”. Some stock is pre-positioned in the states and territories to ensure more rapid access to products in emergency situations, a Department of Health spokeswoman said. The equipment is held in various nondescript warehouse locations across Australia, each one kept secret and under tight security because of concerns of terrorist attack. Last month, Health Minister Greg Hunt gave a rare insight into the warehouses, posting a photo on social media that showed hundreds of pallets of face masks stacked up over five levels. Since the coronavirus became a worldwide medical emergency, the Federal Government has been building up its supplies. In January, Mr Hunt said they had 12 million facemasks. Yesterday he revealed they had 20 million in storage. “We are well stocked,” he said on Friday. “The priority is obviously in protecting the frontline clinicians and we will work with states and territories and primary health networks or whatever bodies to make sure that supplies are delivered to where they are needed. “We do have strong supply chains. As part of our job, that is one of the items that was a specific Commonwealth action item.” There is no vaccine, but some drugs, such as antiviral medicine remdesivir, have been shown to help. However, Mr Hunt gave no indication that the Federal Government had been stocking up on remdesivir, or any other drugs. The last high-profile use of the stockpile came during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. More than 900,000 courses of antivirals, valued at about $29 million, were deployed, with 2.1 million pieces of personal protective equipment also handed out. Experts have raised concerns over gaps in the supply chain as Chinese factories remain closed because of the COVID-19 threat. According to the World Health Organisation, China makes up about 20 per cent of the global output of active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, some experts contest that figure and have gone as far as to describe China as having a “global choke-hold” on the chemical components that make up key pharmaceutical ingredients. UNSW global biosecurity professor Raina MacIntyre said Australia “will see an impact” in supplies of some medical equipment and drugs in the general public. “We have just-in-time economies where we don’t have huge stockpiles that’ll keep us going for months and months,” she said. “It is possible that patients will be affected by shortages, there might be very specific drugs that are made only in China or solely in China.” “Although, China is gradually opening up factories and trying to get back to business as normal.” Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone said there were “some reports” of certain medications and masks not being available. “One of the key sources of supply is obviously the Chinese manufacturing sector and clearly they are confronting their own issues regarding logistical supply,” he said. On Friday, the president of the Royal Australian College of GPs, Harry Nespolon, said GPs urgently needed more protective equipment – including goggles and protective suits – so they could safely assess people who might have coronavirus. Reports have already emerged of people panic-buying masks this week, following on from earlier panic-buying when the virus first came to light. Over the past 15 years, the total investment in the NMS has been about $900 million. According to the Department of Health, about 80 per cent of the stockpile’s value was tied up in pharmaceuticals, including antivirals such as Tamiflu and Relenza. A 2014 auditor-general’s report – one of the few publicly-available documents online about the NMS – found as antivirals typically lasted for seven to 10 years, the “significant cost” of the NMS came because most drugs had to be thrown out. It also holds a limited supply of “highly specialised drugs” which, in an emergency, may not be available elsewhere in the Australian pharmaceutical supply system. In 2014, it said 14 per cent of items were related to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence including “responses to anthrax and human influenza pandemics”."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Prince Harry and Bon Jovi record together at Abbey Road","date":"02-29-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/02\/29\/prince-harry-bon-jovi-song\/","transcript":"Prince Harry is back in London and definitely not on official royal duties as he hung out with veteran rocker Jon Bon Jovi at London’s famous Abbey Road studios for the day. Greeting Bon Jovi, 57, on the steps of the studio with a warm handshake on Thursday local time, Harry was all smiles, sharing a joke and a chat with the American singer-songwriter before venturing inside for a day in the recording studio. A far cry from the wilderness in Canada, the pair worked on a new version of Bon Jovi’s song Unbroken for the Invictus Games and watched on as the Invictus Games Choir performed. Harry’s official Instagram account posted a video of Bon Jovi cueing him to begin singing as the pair stood in front of a microphone in the studios, which were used by The Beatles and inspired the title of the band’s 1969 album Abbey Road. The video posted on Friday ended as Harry and Bon Jovi, both wearing headphones, appeared to be starting to sing. “I said I’ll give it a shot… Stay tuned for more to come later,” Harry posted.

Testing, testing🎙… • Recorded inside Abbey Road Studios, home to The Beatles and other music legends, The Duke of Sussex joins Jon Bon Jovi and the Invictus Games Choir for a special live session in aid of the Invictus Games Foundation. The song being played, called ‘Unbroken’, was created by Jon Bon Jovi to shine a spotlight on those veterans living with Post Traumatic Stress Injury (PTSI), to honour their service and acknowledge the strength of the Armed Forces community. The Duke and JBJ are both strong supporters of the military community, with The Duke founding the Invictus Games in 2014. The Invictus Games Choir, made up of wounded, injured and sick veterans and serving personnel from all services and different ranks of the UK Armed Forces, have come together to use the power of music to aid their recovery.

Mexico announced its first two cases of the deadly respiratory illness as coronavirus took hold in the highly populated Latin American region and officials confirmed a growing number of discharged patients testing positive again after being cleared of the virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has raised the global threat level from “high” to “very high” as hopes of a quick economic recovery were shattered by the share market’s worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008. There are now more than 50 countries with the virus, with the worst affected remaining China which reported its lowest daily increase in cases for a month, with 328 new infections (from 78,800 total cases and 2800 deaths). Other countries account for about three-quarters of new infections with the worst-affected including South Korea, reporting 571 new cases on Friday, Japan (931 infections and 10 deaths) and Italy (650 infections and 15 deaths). Suspicions have been raised that Iran’s official death toll of 34 could be up to six times higher. Another two cases have been confirmed in Australia: A 63-year-old woman on the Gold Coast who had recently returned from Iran and a 79-year-old female West Australian cruise passenger from the Diamond Princess. Fears are growing that the epidemic may be even harder to eradicate as it emerges that patients who had recovered from COVID-19 are testing positive again, even weeks after quarantine. Japan and China have reported examples of people who had been given the all clear and released from quarantine later testing positive. One case involved a Japanese tour bus guide and another was a man in China whose follow-up test 10 days after returning home was positive. The ABC reported as many as 14 per cent of cases in China are recovered patients, citing a disease expert in China’s Guangdong province. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said experts were looking very carefully into an apparent increasing number of cases of re-infection. Explanations include infected people not developing immunity, the virus being able to remain dormant in its victims or testing discrepancies. Scientists are also investigating the possibility of coronavirus spreading to pets after a dog tested “weak positive” in Hong Kong. The animal, owned by a coronavirus patient, has been quarantined after examinations of its nasal and oral samples however the dog did not show symptoms. Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said it would conduct further tests to confirm if the dog had been infected with the virus or if the samples were the result of environmental contamination. “At present, the AFCD does not have evidence that pet animals can be infected … or can be a source of infection to people,” it said in a statement. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said his organisation was not underestimating the outbreak risk. “That is why we said today the global risk is very high,” he told reporters in Geneva. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple or all countries “is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while”. The Mexican government has confirmed the first two cases of the novel coronavirus, with the cases linked to travel from Italy. A 35-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the state of Sinaloa tested positive for the potentially deadly virus after having travelled to Italy, health official Hugo Lopez-Gatell said on Friday. The men are showing only slight symptoms and have been placed in isolation, he said. Latin America’s first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in Brazil on Wednesday and there are suspected cases in at least 10 other countries in the region. Switzerland joined countries banning big events to try to curb the epidemic, forcing cancellation of next week’s Geneva international car show – one of the industry’s most important gatherings. China’s three biggest airlines restored some international flights and the Shanghai fashion show, initially postponed, went ahead online. But as the outbreak eases in China, it is surging elsewhere. Mongolia, which has yet to confirm a case, placed its president, Battulga Khaltmaa, in quarantine as a precaution after he returned from a trip to China, state media reported. In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, some governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings to try to halt the flu-like disease. US President Donald Trump’s administration was considering invoking special powers to expand production of protective gear which is in short supply globally. The head of the WHO’s emergency programme, Mike Ryan, said Iran’s outbreak may be worse than realised – its toll of 34 dead is the highest outside China. Tedros said he expected a WHO team to be in Iran by Sunday or Monday. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Delays ahead: Shortage of apprentices set to slow down our cities","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/28\/decline-apprenticeships\/","transcript":"Traffic jams, housing shortages and building faults could worsen in coming years unless more Australians take on trade apprenticeships. The looming skills shortage comes as more school-leavers choose university, travel or other jobs over trades such as plumbing or carpentry. Between September 2013 and March 2019, the number of apprentices and trainees in Australia fell by more than 30 per cent, according to data from the Department for Education, Skills and Employment. The drop-off in aspiring tradies comes as plumbers, carpenters, plasterers and bricklayers are needed in almost every state and territory. Builders Collective Australia’s national president Phil Dwyer called the skills shortage in construction “a disaster”. “Our apprenticeship intake is the worst it’s ever been,” Mr Dwyer told The New Daily. “We need more government funding for training and incentives for employers to take on apprentices, because otherwise people aren’t going to take them on.” A 2019 report revealed the federal government had underspent its budget for TAFE, training and apprenticeships by almost $1 billion over the past five years. Mr Dwyer said the skills shortage meant more trades were being filled by inexperienced people. As a result, the building companies in charge of projects end up copping the backlash when outsourced jobs aren’t done properly, he said. “When something goes wrong, even though it’s not their fault – it could be a job done by a waterproofer – that business is put on a knife-edge as to whether they’ll survive,” Mr Dwyer said. Sophie Renton, a research director at Sydney firm McCrindle, said the skills shortage in construction was “concerning” because more workers are needed to build roads and buildings to accommodate our growing population. Australia’s population is projected to grow from 25.5 million people to about 30 million in 2030, she said. “We need to get our cities ready so they don’t slow to congestion,” Ms Renton told The New Daily. “Otherwise the infrastructure that’s required for our population growth will slow or stagnate, and everyone will feel those effects.” Government labour market analyses predict the construction industry will boom over the next three years, alongside healthcare, social assistance, education, and professional, scientific and technical services like accounting or architecture. But Ms Renton said it was going to be a challenge to keep up with the increased demand for new buildings and roads without skilled tradies. “We’ll be creating a bottleneck where there are jobs that need to be done, but not enough workers to do it,” she said. “Projects are either going to get more expensive, because companies will try and pay people more to try and attract them, or we’ll have more skilled migration or engage short-term contractors.” Gone are the days when school-leavers would choose one career path and stick with it for decades, Ms Renton said. Research from McCrindle shows Generation Z – people born between 1995 and 2012 – are expected to have about 18 different jobs across six careers during their lifetimes. Almost half of ‘baby boomers’ will most likely stay with their current boss for the next two years, compared to just 20 per cent of Gen Zs, the research shows. In 1959, average tenure across all ages and industries was 15 years, while today average tenure is just under three years. Ms Renton said part of the reason was the “increased breadth of possibility” for young people. “With less coming into the apprenticeship model, there are so many more options for young people – there’s uni, VET, a gap year, going to work then coming back as a mature age student, or working overseas,” she said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bug-out bag ready? Australia's 'preppers' set to go bush","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/02\/28\/coronavirus-australian-preppers\/","transcript":"In Hong Kong, they’re stealing toilet paper. In Milan there’s been a rush on protective masks. Supermarket shelves are emptying in Singapore, and in the US they’re telling people to prepare, ‘but please, don’t be alarmed’. Pandemic panic is sweeping the world faster than the COVID-19 virus that’s causing it. And while people around the globe are for the first time talking about stockpiling emergency supplies, some Australians have quietly been preparing for global collapse for years. Meet the ‘preppers’. Jim Greer, an IT worker from Perth, fully expects the world to suffer a societal collapse. Coronavirus, climate change, the death of democracy; he’s not sure where it will come from, but he knows he’s prepared. “Basically I’ve always got enough stock for three months at a time, and that’s to keep the family going on basic stuff like pastas and rice – things like that,” Mr Greer told The New Daily. Mr Greer proudly calls himself a ‘prepper’. And while some might laugh at his beliefs, his skill set is admittedly impressive. He boasts he can take his family – his partner and children aged 11, 9, 2, and 8-months-old – into the bush and live for as long as they need. No bottled water, no electricity, no petrol. While he admits many ‘might frown at my lifestyle’, he’s also noticed a lot more people talking about prepping since the coronavirus outbreak. “There’s defiantly a lot more people talking about it,” he said. “Possibly soon, by the end of the month there’ll be widespread panic.” “(If coronavirus breaks out) I just won’t be here. I won’t put myself in the situation where I’m going to need a mask, or hand sanitisers and things like that.” Mel, a geography teacher and also from Perth, was encouraged by her father, a federal policeman, to prep since she was young. “He was the one who started the whole prepper thing [for me],” she said. “His idea was: ‘What if somebody threatened to poison the water supply and everyone buys the bottled water off the shelves?’ Everybody should have at least a few days in their water tank.” Mel now runs courses in how to prep properly for an emergency. While she says it’s wise to prep for virus outbreaks, the present panic is completely overblown. “Prepping is built out of fear. They’re afraid the governments won’t look after them,” she said. “We’ve had the bushfires and a lot of leaders weren’t great leaders, and they weren’t saying ‘Hey, we’ll save you’ but instead, ‘Hey, I’m in Hawaii’. “First we had drought, and we ignored the drought, now we’ve got the coronavirus. “The science indicates there’s no way this thing is going to kill us, but I think that people have become fearful because they don’t trust the government will save them.” Mel said people should understand that it is “very hard to catch the virus” and that Australia is “a First World nation and we’ve got a tiny population … it’s almost irresponsible how we’ve scared people”. To a certain extent, prepping is in Mr Greer’s blood. Before he started working with computers he was in the navy, and went on to live with the Anangu Luritja people of central Australia, who he says taught him how to track animals and make spears and boomerangs. Most preppers have a ‘bug-out-bag’, a light-weight kit that can keep them alive for 72 hours, but Mr Greer has a full truck. When ‘inevitable’ collapse comes, he’ll be ready with dirt bikes, fishing rods, packets of pasta and enough fuel to get him 1200km away from large populations. “Once you’re out and about you start learning to only cook what you need to cook. You soon stop wasting food,” Mr Greer said.  “I carry a heap of vegetable seeds … I could move and just start growing a garden straight away. I would be self-sufficient in a couple of weeks.” Good prepping is not about stocking up on goods from a shop, but making sure you have a way to grow it or get it, he said. Filtering water instead of buying it, growing your own food – that sort of thing. A lot of it, though, is about giving up creature comforts. Mr Greer said a lot of essential items were forgotten by uneducated preppers, including toilet paper. Mel has a very different philosophy. She said being a female in the often male-dominated prepper community gives her a different approach to survivalism. “Guys want to bug out, whereas I think the girl approach is saying ‘I don’t want to go into a bunker with a bloke and a cheese sandwich’. “All the girls will get together and make preserves and think about things like ‘how I’m going to make a latte if there’s no electricity’. For her, prepping is about building useful skills, so if a collapse occurred she could share, swap, or barter. “In my garden I grow a whole heap of things,” she said. “Recently there might have been a tobacco plant,” she admits. “Personally I wouldn’t be using it, but in an end-of-world scenario, it’s good to have things you can trade. Mel also tried growing her own coffee plants, but found the process of producing the potentially valuable beans “frustrating”. “For a year you grow a miserable handful of berries, I have to take it more seriously,” she said. “There are all these people out there who have skills, we’ve got to get them all together.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"The Ferguson Report: Dutton forces far-left and far-right together","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/02\/28\/ferguson-report-conversion-therapy\/","transcript":"GAY CONVERSION THERAPIST SECRETLY A GAY CONVERSION THERAPIST As the Morrison Government struggles with outlawing gay conversion therapy, one man has realised he is a gay conversion therapist. “I realised I think about gay conversion frequently, especially at bedtime.

A man in shorts and long white socks said, “The Bible chapter Leviticus also condemns tattoos and clipping your sideburns. So, we have created Hipster-conversion therapies. A converted converter said, “Most hipsters are in denial of being a hipster. So sad. Quinoa is not mentioned in the Bible, but why take the chance?” BARNABY JOYCE BACK TO NORMAL A parliamentary battle of wits occurred between Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon and Barnaby Joyce’s Barnaby Joyce. They went from rapier wits to another kind of wits. Fitzgibbon tried to say he “is going to reach out” to primary producers using a blunt metal object. A red-faced Mr Joyce delicately opined that this was “a load of pig manure”. Coincidentally, Joyce, Fitzgibbon and pig manure are all regarded as leadership material. DOUBLE OR DUTTON Peter Dutton has promised “far-right” and “far-left” extremists will be forced to the “far-centre”. Mr Dutton’s pledge came after ASIO boss Mike Burgess said right-wing radicals regularly meet to salute Nazi flags, praise Hitler and discuss why they can’t meet nice girls. Far-left extremists are easier to spot due to their habit of supergluing themselves to the road for no effect. Dutton noticed the growing threat of right-wing extremism when his agents reported an increase in toothless pale men of inferior Anglo origin.

The trick, as described by the infamous political strategist Niccolò Machiavelli, is to “never waste the opportunity offered by a good crisis.” Or as British PM Winston Churchill once said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” In this case, PM Morrison pulled off a clever ‘look over there!’ moment by using the coronavirus crisis – announcing that the Government had decided not to wait for the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare that the virus had become a global pandemic, instead formally activating its own pandemic emergency response plan. As expected, this ‘leadership initiative’ by the Morrison Government became the lead story on the nightly news broadcasts and newspaper front pages the following morning. Some reporters and commentators even suggested the decision to move before the rest of the world showed the PM had learned from the bushfires that he should not wait for others before taking action. There might be some truth in that observation, but there is also no avoiding the fact that the timing of the announcement neatly turned a very bad political week into a moderately good one for the Government – at least according to the very limited amount of news that unengaged voters tend to consume. The week had started with beet-faced Barnaby Joyce bellowing in front of the cameras during a faux confrontation with Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon over the threat that a net zero emissions target would pose to flatulent cattle. It got worse when Treasurer Josh Frydenberg had to start walking back his and the PM’s boastful claim to have ‘delivered’ a surplus in the 2020 budget, which is a feat of twisting the time-space continuum that would impress even Doctor Who. After years of taunting Labor’s former treasurer, Wayne Swan, for making a similar mistake during the Rudd and Gillard years, our former Liberal Treasurer, now Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and his successor, Josh Frydenberg, were treated to merciless ragging by Labor’s economic team for admitting to this ‘failure’ in economic management. In truth, just as the unpredictable Global Financial Crisis shattered Treasurer Swan’s promise of a budget surplus, so have the unpredictable drought, bushfires and coronavirus destroyed any chance for the one promised by Treasurer Frydenberg. And then there were the ongoing sports rorts revelations, which have increasingly implicated the Prime Minister’s office with each new fact. Not to mention the additional ‘grant schemes’ that have been uncovered as little more than election-promise slush funds. Then there is the unofficial stoush that continues to roil within the Coalition over climate action (see Barnaby bellowing, above). All in all, it was a week from which the Government should have emerged looking dishevelled, bruised and somewhat humiliated. Instead, it came out looking like a hero. Coalition strategists must be kicking themselves that they had to waste such a good announcement in a week when Newspoll wasn’t in the field. It should be said that to point out the PM’s sleight of hand is not to downplay the seriousness of the coronavirus threat or the importance of the action being taken to protect Australians from it. At least the impending crisis is real, not one confected simply to deflect attention like the 16-flag press conferences held by a previous prime minister to breathlessly announce that an asylum seeker boat was intercepted last month, or some such. However, given the import of the other issues that unfolded this week, Scott Morrison should expect the positive reviews from his pandemic announcement to last only a few days. Next week will bring a fresh round of parliamentary scrutiny and redoubled efforts to bring the Government to account."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Do not deport your problems': NZ PM's blunt message to Morrison","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/2020\/02\/28\/jacinda-ardern-deport-criminals-nz\/","transcript":"New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has delivered a blunt message to Scott Morrison about Australia’s “corrosive” criminal deportation policy. Standing right beside the PM at a media conference in Sydney on Friday, Ms Ardern said the policy – under which 2000 people have been forcibly sent back to New Zealand – was causing unintended hardship. “Australia is well within its rights to deport individuals who break your laws. New Zealand does the same. But we have a simple request – send back Kiwis, genuine Kiwis.” “Do not deport your people and your problems.” Ms Ardern said many of the deportees returned to New Zealand identified “on any common sense test” as Australian. “Just a few weeks ago I met a woman who moved to Australia, not much older than one year old,” she said. “She told me she had no connection to our country, but had three children in Australia. “She was in a crisis centre, having returned to a country she did not feel was her own.” The NZ leader also pleaded with the Morrison government to give more rights to New Zealanders working in Australia, including the ability to work as public servants or access the national disability insurance scheme. “Evidence shows that the vast majority are providing a net benefit to Australia. They earn more, they are more likely to be employed, and they pay more tax than their Aussie-born counterparts,” she said. “They are Australia’s best migrants. “But rather than them being given security to keep contributing and return, their rights are being eroded.” Mr Morrison said Australia’s deportation policy was clear. “We deport non-citizens who have committed crimes in Australia against our community,” he said. “This policy is applied not specific to one country, but to any country whose citizens are here.” New Zealand has repeatedly complained about Australia’s policy of deporting non-citizens who have been convicted of serious crimes. In some instances, Kiwis have been returned home after living most of their lives in Australia, and have little connection to New Zealand. Among them was the ex-bike boss father of AFL gun Dustin Martin. Shane Martin had lived in Australia for 30 years prior to his 2017 deportation, but had amassed serious criminal charges – including trafficking of ecstasy and being armed with intent. He tried to return to Australia earlier in 2020 but was returned to New Zealand within a day. At their meeting on Friday, Ms Ardern and Mr Morrison also discussed the coronavirus, greater cooperation on indigenous issues, trade and security. Left out of the talks were their conflicting stances on climate change. Australia has been widely condemned for worshipping fossil fuels, while New Zealand leads the way in climate action in the Pacific. Despite the divide, the leaders were able to agree that the strong and supportive relationship between the nations was a source of great comfort in recent times. “The last 12 months has, if nothing else, demonstrated just how close New Zealand and Australia are,” Ms Ardern said. “Whether it’s the fires in Australia, and the hundreds of personnel that have gone from New Zealand to Australia to support them, or Whakaari White Island, or coronavirus, we’ve had plenty of examples … where we have been extraordinarily close.” Ms Ardern also met NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Governor-General David Hurley while in Sydney. She returns to Auckland on Friday night. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"WA patient in 'serious condition' as Australia moves to emergency footing","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/02\/28\/coronavirus-emergency-pandemic\/","transcript":"One of the Australians diagnosed with coronavirus is in a serious condition, Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed on Friday. Mr Morrison told Sydney radio 2GB that there were 15 cases of the potentially deadly virus in Australia, and a further eight from the Diamond Princess cruise. “One of these is in a more serious condition in WA, we learnt today,” he said. “But in the rest of the community we can go about our business.” The man and his wife were among 164 Australians evacuated from the Diamond Princess. WA Today reported late on Friday afternoon that the 78-year-old man’s wife had also tested positive to COVID-19, after earlier testing negative. WA media say the husband has been moved to intensive care at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth. Hospital staff say he is in a serious but stable condition and was moved as a precaution. No Australians have yet died from COVID-19. Confirmation of the WA man’s condition came just hours after the Prime Minister activated an emergency response plan to handle an anticipated pandemic – making Australia the first country in the world to go to emergency footing. So far, 23 Australians have been diagnosed with coronavirus. But health authorities are bracing for a much wider outbreak as the lethal virus wreaks havoc across the world. State and territory health ministers met in Melbourne on Friday to thrash out the details of the pandemic plan. It will include sweeping powers for governments if an outbreak occurs, such as shutting schools, isolating aged-care facilities and an economic stimulus package. It will also allow authorities to stockpile medicines and hospitals to set up special containment wards. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said elderly people with weak immune systems remained at greatest risk from COVID-19. Mr Hunt also urged people not to stock up on face masks – as many of the supplies came from China, which is still the subject of travel bans. “We’re working on the rings-of-containment approach,” he said on Friday afternoon. The country has about 20 million masks in its national medical stockpile, Mr Hunt said. Nonetheless, “no one should go around wearing and wasting face masks”, chief medical officer professor Brendan Murphy said. “While we are preparing and we are realistic about what might come in the future weeks, we are not in a situation where anyone needs to be concerned,” he said. Dr Murphy said it was “very likely” more cases of COVID-19 would start to emerge in Australia in coming weeks. The emergency response plan was a way for health authorities “to be prepared for all eventualities”. “We are not wanting the community to panic,” he said. Friday’s COAG meeting of health ministers came as the World Health Organisation said the coronavirus outbreak had reached a “decisive point” and urged countries to redouble efforts to contain its spread. The virus now affects 47 countries, has killed more than 2800 people and infected more than 82,500. Nigeria confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on Friday – the first in sub-Saharan Africa. New Zealand also confirmed its first case. Under Australia’s pandemic response plan, travellers will face extra measures at airports and ports to test to potential symptoms of the deadly virus. “As this spreads we are going to have to monitor the hotspots around the world for coronavirus and overlay that with travel patterns,” Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram told Sky News. “It’s hard to travel directly to Australia so that gives us some choke points that we can focus on.” -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Quaden's family donate to local charities after declining crowdfunding Disneyland trip | The New Daily","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/02\/28\/family-of-bullied-murri-boy-to-donate-to-local-charities-after-declining-crowdfunding-disneyland-trip\/","transcript":"The family of a Murri boy will donate more than $600,000 to local charities after declining a crowdfunding trip to Disneyland. Young Quaden Bayles, 9, who was born with Achondroplasia, the most common form of Dwarfism, was visibly distressed in a Facebook video his mother posted last week after he had been bullied earlier that day. In it, he was in tears and wanted to kill himself: “Give me a knife—I want to kill myself”, he said. His mother Yarraka decided to share the video to show what her son had endured since he was three years old. American comedian Brad Williams, who also is a dwarf, set up a GoFundMe page on February 21, attracting almost $720,000 from 20,000 global donations for a trip to Disneyland. He wrote: “The bullying was so severe … I’m setting up this GoFundMe to let Quaden know that bullying will not be tolerated, and that he is a wonderful human being who deserves joy. I want to fly Quaden and his mother to America, get them a nice hotel, and bring them to Disneyland”. However, Quaden’s Aunty Mundanara Bayles told NITV News that “while it’s a touching example of goodwill, the family will skip the all-expenses paid trip as they want to focus on the bigger issues at play”. “What kid wouldn’t want to go to Disneyland, especially if you have lived Quaden’s life. To escape to anywhere that is fun that doesn’t remind him of his day to day challenges,” she said. “But my sister said ‘you know what, let’s get back to the real issue’. This little fella has been bullied. How many suicides, black or white, in our society have happened due to bullying.” “We want the money to go to community organisations that really need it. They know what the money should be spent on, So as much as we want to go to Disneyland, I think our community would far off benefit from that.” “We need to come together and work out how to make sure young people like Quaden don’t have to deal with what they have been dealing with,” Ms Bayles said. “We’ve had seven kids at the Murri School in Brisbane, where I am on the board, take their lives in the last ten years,” she told NITV News. Mr Williams announced on Friday that about $100,000 will be donated to six local charities with the remainder going towards “a fund for future medical and support expenses for Quaden”. The charities Born This Way Foundation, STOMP Out Bullying, Dolly’s Dream, Dwarfism Awareness Australia, Gallang Place and Balunu Healing Foundation are the likely recipients. The rest of the crowdfunding will go towards direct medical help, education, accommodation costs, food to feed the family, and for donating to any additional charities of their choosing. “I have been in close communication with Quaden’s family and fully respect their needs and the needs of Australian First Nations people who are experiencing bullying and discrimination at extremely high rates. “Because of this, I’ve decided that the donations will be best served going to charities focused on helping individuals affected by bullying and discrimination,” he wrote.  Meanwhile, Yarraka Bayles is pushing for a new law called Quaden’s Law to be introduced into state and national school curriculums. “We discussed a care plan for Quaden if\/when he chooses to return to school, or when we feel the time is right. We are working with the school to introduce an educational tools for schools package around disability awareness, diversity and inclusion,” she told NITV. “It went okay … They were all very supportive in helping to move forward.” Since Quaden’s story, he has gone from despair to “high spirits” as the family continued to just get on with their lives, according to Ms Bayles. “It’s a bit overwhelming but we are doing good considering. It’s pretty full on but we are strong enough to get through especially with all the mobs support and unconditional love,” she told NITV News. “Quaden is ok. He is spinning out a bit, we just have to protect our boy as best we can. We’ve got a good team around us now.” His Aunty said: “He’s just an amazing kid that’s larger than life.” -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Minister's spreadsheet a 'surprise' to Sport Australia boss","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/politics\/australian-politics\/2020\/02\/28\/sports-rorts-spreadsheet\/","transcript":"Former Sport Australia boss Kate Palmer has told a Senate inquiry she was surprised to see the colour-coded spreadsheet of approved sports grants produced by former minister Bridget McKenzie’s office. Ms Palmer said the first time she saw the spreadsheet was when it was handed to her as she walked into a parliamentary grilling in 2019 – prompting a late-night phone hook-up between public servants. Senator McKenzie’s office was criticised in an audit of the $100 million grants program overseen by Sport Australia for running a parallel assessment process biased towards Coalition-held and target seats in the lead-up to the 2019 federal election. The auditor-general revealed the then-sports minister’s office created dozens of versions of a spreadsheet between October 2018 and April 2019 that colour-coded grant applications according to which political party held their electorate. Ms Palmer, who was chief executive of Sport Australia until late January, told senators on Friday that she was aware Senator McKenzie’s office had its own assessment process, but she first saw the colour-coded document in April 2019. She could not recall the exact date. She was so surprised by the colour coding that she sought a meeting with the secretary of the health department, which oversees Sport Australia, and her organisation’s board chair that night. Health department officials later said that was likely to have been April 5, 2019. But the health department boss, Glenys Beauchamp, has destroyed all her records of that meeting because Friday is her last day as a public servant. “I saw a coloured spreadsheet put under my face just as I was entering Senate estimates – that’s the only spreadsheet I saw,” Ms Palmer told the inquiry into the affair. “I did not read the spreadsheet, I just … glanced at it and then stood up and walked into Senate estimates.” Ms Palmer later discussed the spreadsheet with Ms Beauchamp and Sport Australia chair John Wylie – and asked what do do about it. Sport Australia then provided that spreadsheet to the auditors, who had already begun examining the program. Ms Beauchamp described the phone hook-up with Ms Palmer and Mr Wylie as an “ad hoc meeting”. She agreed she would have taken notes. Asked where they were, she said: “It’s interesting you should say that because it’s my last day in the public service and I have destroyed all of my notebooks and notes.” Senators were incredulous at the news. Ms Beauchamp said it was her practice to make “scratchings … of things that I might have to follow up on” and translate anything that needed to be put on the official record into email or discussions with colleagues. “I should not have notebooks and things as a private citizen after midnight tonight,” she said. Ultimately, 73 per cent of the projects given money were not among those recommended by Sport Australia. Ms Palmer said the program’s design meant she knew the minister would ultimately decide which sporting clubs got money. The minister “had a much broader understanding of the program or what she’s trying to achieve”, she said. “We fulfilled our responsibility very professionally and it was fair and sound, and – I think – undertaken in good faith and our people did a terrific job of that,” she said. The committee heard on Thursday that Sport Australia had twice warned Senator McKenzie’s office of the risks of its separate assessment of grants. It also emerged on Thursday that Senator McKenzie’s office emailed through a final round of approved grants after the May 2019 federal election was called, and after the Morrison government had entered the caretaker period. The Senate inquiry has also been told there were 136 emails about the controversial grants program between the Prime Minister’s office and Senator McKenzie’s. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has continued to deny any wrongdoing in allocating the grants. On Friday, he denied any breach of caretaker conventions. “That’s not true … that’s not actually true,” he told the ABC. “[The committee] heard it was authorised on the 4th of April 2019. That’s what the testimony from Sports Australia was. It was signed on the 4th of April 2019 – that was the authorisation of the brief that went on that matter. So the suggestion it was signed at some time later, there is no basis for that.” Senator McKenzie was forced to quit after a review by the PM’s chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, found she had broken ministerial rules by not declaring potential conflicts of interest relating to gun club memberships. However, Mr Gaetjens found no evidence of pork-barrelling in seats targeted by the Coalition in the May 2019 election. Mr Morrison has repeatedly refused to release that report. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"One dead, nine injured after car ploughs into coffee shop","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/state\/nsw\/sydney\/2020\/02\/28\/north-epping-car-shop\/","transcript":"A woman has died and nine others have been injured after a car driven by an 89-year-old ploughed into a cafe in Sydney’s north-west on Friday morning. The group of 10 women were sitting outside Cafe Si:Zac on Malton Road in North Epping about 10am on Friday, when a car drove through a garden and into their table. Police said the group had just finished the morning school drop-off at North Epping Public School, and were meeting to catch up over coffee. NSW Ambulance superintendent Steve Vaughan said the scene outside the cafe was “absolutely frantic” and paramedics had done all they could. “The scene was absolutely frantic for emergency services – there was carnage everywhere when we arrived,” Mr Vaughan said. A 40-year-old woman was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital in a critical condition. She died soon after. Nine others were treated at the scene, with four of them taken to hospital in a stable condition. Detective Inspector Mark Christie said the situation was “just awful”. “It was obviously a horrendous and chaotic scene,” he told the ABC. “This appears to be quite a close-knit community, it’s just a small local cafe at a local shopping centre. I imagine a lot of people would know each other.” Inspector Christie said the 89-year-old driver had been taken to Ryde Hospital for mandatory testing and would be interviewed later. “It appears he has pulled into the parking spot and then there’s been some sort of collision after that. But we don’t know the circumstances yet, they’re still under investigation,” he said. “It’s a very tragic set of circumstances that have occurred here today.” The NSW Police crash investigation unit remained on the scene on Friday afternoon as investigations continued. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Are you real?': Putin pressed over use of body doubles","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/people\/2020\/02\/28\/vladimir-putin-body-doubles\/","transcript":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has admitted he was offered the use of a body double for public appearances, but says he declined the offer. Mr Putin – a 67-year-old former KGB agent who has dominated Russian politics for more than two decades – said the offer was made in the early 2000s, for security reasons when Russia was fighting a war against separatists in Chechnya. It is not the first time Mr Putin has been asked about whether he uses a body double – or even a small army of them. One of the more elaborate theories compares photographs of Mr Putin over the years, claiming to have identified several individuals posing as him. The idea has also been fuelled by numerous “action man” photos of the Russian leader riding horses and going hunting – all the while looking remarkably trim for a man in his 60s. This week, in an interview with TASS news agency, journalist Andrei Vandenko showed Mr Putin a list of popular Internet searches purportedly associated with his name, one entitled “Putin body double evidence”. “Are you real?” Vandenko asked. “Yes,” said Mr Putin, going on to denying using lookalikes for public appearances. He said he had turned down all such offers. “I declined these body doubles. This [the offer] was during the most difficult periods of the fight against terrorism,” Mr Putin said, adding that he was referring to the beginning of the 2000s.  Mr Putin didn’t elaborate on his motives for rejecting the suggestion to use body doubles. In the same interview, he also reaffirmed his opposition to mobile phones. Mr Putin said he does not have a personal mobile, and feels “more comfortable” relying on protected communications – although he sometimes used aides’ phones. -with agencies"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘Mass casualties’: Syria air strike kills 33 Turkish soldiers | The New Daily","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/02\/28\/syria-air-strike-kills-turkish-soldiers\/","transcript":"At least 33 Turkish solders have been killed in an air strike by Syrian government forces in Syria’s northwestern Idlib region. Governor of the southeastern Turkish province of Hatay, Rahmi Dogan, said the death toll from the strike was initially nine soldiers. He later confirmed 29 Turkish solders died in the attack but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the figure at 34 solders dead. On Saturday (AEDT) the official number killed was 33. He says a further 39 injured were being treated in Turkish hospitals. The deaths mark a serious escalation in the direct conflict between Turkish and Russia-backed Syrian forces that has been waged since early February. According to the latest reports in the New York Times, the attack could “dramatically shift the course of the Syrian war”.  Posted by Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Thursday, February 27, 2020 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called an emergency security meeting in Ankara, broadcaster NTV reported. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu spoke to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg by telephone, according to state-run Anadolu news agency. The Times reported a convoy traveling to resupply one of 12 Turkish posts set up a year ago came under attack and then the post itself was bombed, a Turkish-backed Syrian official part of the fighting force in Idlib province told the paper in an interview. “No Syrian fighters were hurt in the bombing. The resupply convoy and the post were solely Turkish,” he said. Fighting continued earlier throughout the week when Turkish-backed Syrian fighters captured the town of Saraqib on the main M5 highway through the province on Wednesday, and on Thursday were engaged in fierce battles further south. The casualties mark the largest death toll for Turkey in a single day since Ankara first intervened in Syria in 2016. At least 43 have now been killed in Idlib since the start of February. The latest air strike came after a Russian delegation spent two days in Ankara for talks with Turkish officials on the situation in Idlib, where a Syrian government offensive has sent hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing towards the Turkish border. Assad now controls almost the entire southern part of Idlib province after capturing more than 20 villages on Thursday, state media and opposition activists said. It is part of a weeks-long campaign backed by Russian air power into Syria’s last rebel stronghold. Thousands of Turkish soldiers are deployed inside rebel-controlled areas of Idlib province, which is dominated by al-Qaeda-linked militants. The incident came as a senior Turkish official told Reuters the government would no longer stop Syrian refugees reaching Europe. In anticipation of the imminent arrival of refugees from Idlib, Turkish police, coast guard and border security officials have been ordered to stand down on refugees’ land and sea crossings, the official said. Turkey hosts about 3.7 million Syrian refugees. Under a deal agreed in 2016, the European Union has provided billions of euros in aid in return for Ankara agreeing to stem the influx of migrants into Europe. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Farmers wait for Government's $100 million water to flow months after drought deal announced | The New Daily","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/28\/farmers-drought-water-deal\/","transcript":"Months after paying for much-needed water, farmers in the southern Murray-Darling Basin are waiting for the Federal Government’s Water for Fodder program to deliver. Only 800 among the thousands who applied were granted access to the program which was supposed to deliver water to grow feed for drought-affected livestock. Water was to flow from early December and so far just 26 of the promised 100 gigalitres have been delivered to farms. Some irrigators who have received it said it was too late to get in a summer fodder crop. The water was promised at a heavily discounted rate to irrigators after the Federal Government struck a $100 million deal with South Australia to ramp up its desalination plant to provide water for Adelaide. That, in turn, allowed South Australia to leave water in the Murray River so that irrigators upstream, many who had not had access to water for two years, could use it on their farms. The irrigators had to promise to use the water to grow crops for livestock after drought decimated fodder supplies across Australia’s east coast. Stuart Schifferle, an irrigator on the West Corurgan system at Berrigan in southern New South Wales, is still waiting for his Water for Fodder allocation to arrive. He is one of at least 30 farmers in southern NSW successful in the Water for Fodder ballot, but who cannot get the water on farm because of a lack of water in the irrigation channels to deliver it. “It’s very frustrating. We’ve paid for the water, it’s all paid for, [we’re] happy to buy the water but we need to be able to get it,” Mr Schifferle said. He said 3000 megalitres were required to deliver the water to the 21 farmers waiting for their Water for Fodder in his district. “Most farmers are pretty easy going, but I think there’s a few blokes hanging their hat on getting a bit of water because they desperately need a bit,” he said. “I think they’re very disappointed the way it’s turned out.” A further nine irrigators in the nearby Moira Irrigation District are waiting for their fodder water to be delivered. A Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment spokeswoman said Moira would acquire the water it needed to deliver Water for Fodder, and that West Corurgan was “discussing options with its members”. “As a condition of participation in the program, applicants were required to agree that they were able to pay for and receive the water,” she said. Federal Water Minister Keith Pitt has told the ABC that 100GL of water will be delivered under the program. “My very strong view is we’ll deliver exactly what we said we would and that’s 100GL in the Water for Fodder program,” Mr Pitt said. South Australia’s Water Minister David Speirs said the extent of his state’s contribution would depend on a review of the first 40GL which must be delivered by the end of the financial year. “The release of a further 60GL is subject to a review which will take into account the effectiveness of the first round, water availability in the Basin, and South Australia’s water security,” Mr Speirs said. Under the Water for Fodder program, $89 million will be provided by the Federal Government for the direct running of the desalination plant and a further $10 million will fund a South Australian drought initiative. The energy-intensive desalination plant was little used before it ramped up production on December 2. It is now producing up to 300ML of water per day. In southern NSW, Blighty sheep and cropping farmer Brett Frost has not received any irrigation water for two years. “The ground’s dry and there’s cracks everywhere,” Mr Frost said of his farm. But he decided not to apply for the Water for Fodder program because he did not think 50ML was enough water to make a difference on his farm. “One splash of water over a paddock isn’t going to make the feed grow,” Mr Frost said. “It’s a ‘feel good’ thing from the Government’s point of view, they can put out their media and everyone in the cities thinks they’re doing their best to get something out there.” In Victoria, Kyabram irrigator Gino D’Augello said the oversubscribed ballot had created some division in his community. “‘Why did you get it and I didn’t’ is very much something that’s out there at the moment,” he said. Mr D’Augello’s application was approved and he said he was grateful to be a part of the program. But he lamented the late delivery of water — almost two months after his application was approved — as a missed opportunity. Mr D’Augello believed he could have harvested more fodder had the water arrived earlier. The Government offered the water at $100 per megalitre, which Mr D’Augello described as a “huge” saving, given it would cost $700\/ML on the temporary market for his district. There have been 14 applications for the Water for Fodder program approved from South Australia, 499 from Victoria, and 287 from NSW. While 26GL has been delivered to date, a Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment spokeswoman said “paperwork for another 7.65GL has been approved and sent to South Australia for processing and transfer”. In the meantime, Mr Schifferle waits to see if his water will arrive. “It’s pretty crazy, water is running down the river past everyone and out to sea and then comes back, we pump the salt out of it and sell it back to us. It’s just crazy,” Mr Schifferle said. “If you were telling that story to someone in England they’d think you’re mad.” A review of the Water for Fodder program is expected to be open for public comment soon."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"ABC won't appeal Federal Court ruling that found AFP raids on public broadcaster valid | The New Daily","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/28\/abc-federal-court-raids-appeal\/","transcript":"The ABC has announced it will not appeal a Federal Court ruling that found a police warrant used to raid its Sydney headquarters was valid. Australian Federal Police officers raided the public broadcaster’s Ultimo office in June last year. Police searched for computer files associated with a number of reports known as the Afghan files. The 2017 stories centred on the alleged war crimes of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, which were based on leaked documents from the Defence Department. Officers seized 124 files on two USB sticks. The ABC challenged the validity of the warrant in the Australian Federal Court, arguing it was “legally unreasonable”. The case was dismissed last Monday, and the ABC was ordered to pay the legal costs of all parties involved. In a statement, the ABC’s managing director David Anderson said the decision was a blow to media freedom, but that the broadcaster could not litigate its way to “reforming fundamentally bad laws”. “This outcome demonstrates the urgent need for law reform to ensure professional journalism and whistleblowers are appropriately protected,” Mr Anderson said. He said Australia was not up to the standard of other western democracies when it came to the protection of whistleblowers and public interest journalism. “All Australians should be highly concerned at this outcome, the position the ABC has been put in and what this means for all journalists and the public’s right to know.” ABC chairwoman Ita Buttrose challenged the nation’s leaders’ commitment to a transparent democracy. “If our elected representatives in Canberra truly believe in Australia as a transparent democracy, it’s time for them to show leadership and take action,” Ms Buttrose said. “Supporting media freedom doesn’t mean making allowance for journalists to break the law — it means having laws that allow journalists to safely do reporting in the public interest.” She said no-one wanted Australia to be a “secretive state” where reporters and whistleblowers faced prosecution for stories the public had a right to know.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been helping London’s Metropolitan Police with security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex “intermittently” since November, when the couple began a six-week holiday in Canada, according to a statement from Canada’s Office of the Minister of Public Safety. Thursday’s statement is the first public confirmation that Canadians have picked up at least part of the tab for the couple’s security – estimated to cost millions of dollars a year. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced repeated questions about who would pay for the Sussexes security if they remained in Canada. Harry and Meghan stunned the British royal family in early January with their announcement that they were quitting to gain freedom from intense media scrutiny and to become financially independent. The couple, who will step down as senior royals at the end of March, said they intended to split their lives between Britain and North America. In an agreement struck with the Queen, they will no longer use the word “royal” or their HRH titles. The deal will be reviewed in a year. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex choosing to re-locate to Canada on a part-time basis presented our government with a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances,” Canada’s federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Thursday (local time). “The RCMP has been engaged with officials in the UK from the very beginning regarding security considerations. As the duke and duchess are currently recognised as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as needed basis.” However, “the assistance will cease in the coming weeks, in keeping with their change in status”, the minister’s office said. The couple made it clear in a statement on their website that they expect security arrangements to continue. “It is agreed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son,” it said. However, it said no further details were available as they were classified. Prince Harry is in Britain this week beginning his final round of engagements for the royal family. Meghan is expected to join him at some of those engagements.

Scientists reported that the blast came from a black hole in a cluster of galaxies 390 million light years away. The explosion was so large it carved out a crater in the hot gas that could hold 15 Milky Ways, lead author Simona Giacintucci of the Naval Research Laboratory said. It’s five times bigger than the previous record-holder. Astronomers used NASA’s Chandra X-Ray Observatory to make the discovery, along with a European space observatory and ground telescopes in Australia and India. They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the centre contains a colossal black hole. Black holes don’t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy. The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas. The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity. The blast is believed to be over by now – there are no signs of jets currently shooting from the black hole. More observations are needed in other wavelengths to better understand what occurred, according to the team. The findings appeared in the Astrophysical Journal."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Key topic off the agenda at Ardern-Morrison meeting","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/02\/28\/jacinta-ardern-scott-morrison-meeting\/","transcript":"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern won’t raise climate change when she meets with Scott Morrison in Sydney but will push for a change in Canberra’s position on forced deportations. Ms Ardern is scheduled to hold talks with Mr Morrison in the harbour city on Friday after briefly meeting with NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian in the morning. The NZ prime minister speaks with Mr Morrison more than any other leader to the point where her officials often joke they don’t need to do any work “because we often just resolve things directly”. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t issues of contention, Ms Ardern acknowledged ahead of Thursday’s flight across the Tasman Sea. New Zealand is held up as a great ally on climate issues in the Pacific while Australia is criticised for promoting fossil fuels. The divide is such that Ms Ardern – who has enshrined into law a pathway to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 – says she won’t bother to raise the topic in Sydney. She has pledged to discuss the “corrosive” issue of deportations which has seen hundreds of New Zealanders, some with limited links to their country of birth, deported from Australia after committing serious crimes. One of the most high-profile cases involves AFL star Dustin Martin’s father who was deported to New Zealand after living in Australia for 20 years because of his links to the Rebels bikie club. Canberra has been unrelenting when it comes to the policy and New Zealand is realistic as to whether any concessions may be forthcoming.

Covid-19 also had “pandemic potential” and could “get out of control” if countries did not act to contain it, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he urged a redoubling of efforts to contain its spread. The WHO warning came as 11 European countries confirmed infections, with a number of them traced to the sudden outbreak in Italy where even the Pope had to cancel a religious service after coming down with flu-like symptoms. More than 82,500 people have been infected by coronavirus worldwide and the death toll has reached 2810 as of Friday morning (Australian time). “This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,” Dr Ghebreyesus said. “If you act aggressively now, you can contain this virus, you can prevent people getting sick, you can save lives.” Dr Ghebreyesus used Italy, which has the most infections outside Asia, as an example to show the virus could spread to anywhere. “No country should assume it won’t get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,” he said. “And I even say if you take Italy, a member of the G7, it was really a surprise. So even many other developed countries you also see some surprises, should expect some surprises.” As Italy struggles to contain the rapid outbreak, recording 528 cases of infection so far, Pope Francis had to cancel a planned religious service due to a “slight ailment,” the Vatican said. Pope Francis, aged 83, was supposed to lead a Lenten service with priests from the Rome diocese in the Basilica of St John’s in Lateran, roughly a 6km drive southeast of St Peter’s Square. Instead, he “preferred to stay in the vicinity of Santa Marta”, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement. On Wednesday, as he held his weekly audience and later led an Ash Wednesday service, he displayed the symptoms of a cold, with a coarse voice and frequent coughing. It came amid widespread anxiety in Italy about the spread of the pneumonia-like coronavirus, which is mostly affecting northern regions and not Rome. Schools, universities, cinemas and Milans famous La Scala opera house have been closed and several public events cancelled. Eleven towns at the centre of the outbreak, home to a total of 55,000 people, have been quarantined. There are fears that the outbreak may tip Italy into economic recession. Yet to report a single coronavirus case, Saudi Arabia has banned foreign pilgrims from entering the kingdom to visit Islam’s holiest sites. The unprecedented decision could disrupt the plans of millions of faithful ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and as the annual hajj pilgrimage looms. In a statement, Saudi’s foreign ministry also said tourist visas from around two dozen countries would be suspended. WHO officials said they were working closely with organisers of the Tokyo Olympic Games this year and did not believe any decision would be taken soon on whether to hold the event starting in July as planned. Separately, US stock markets fell sharply again on Friday (Australian time), in what is set to be one of the worst weeks for investors since the 2008 financial crisis. All three of the major stock indexes experienced a 10 per cent decline from their recent high-water mark and fell into correction territory, with investors fearing the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world economy. Australia’s state health ministers will gather in Melbourne on Friday to discuss how Australia will respond to the declaration of a global coronavirus pandemic. -with AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Julian Assange to stay in dock during hearing","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/world\/2020\/02\/28\/julian-assange-to-stay-in-dock\/","transcript":"Julian Assange’s father has slammed a British judge’s refusal to let the WikiLeaks founder sit with his lawyers at his extradition hearing in London. Australian John Shipton says his son is experiencing “psychological torture” as he bids against US extradition in Woolwich Crown Court. He says District Judge Vanessa Baraitser denying Assange’s request to leave the dock and sit with his lawyers in the court is “another failure of due process”. “You see that this ends up as a continuance of the psychological torture of Julian that’s continued (to be) ramped up over 10 years,” Mr Shipton said. “So the beginning of the week saw Julian strip-searched three (sic) times, handcuffed nine (sic) times, put in five different holding cells and his court reports and court work confiscated by prison authorities. “Ending the week, as we’ve explained, (there was) refusal of the judge to allow him to move out of the glass box into the body of the court so he could be equally armed as due process requires.” Judge Baraitser ruled that Assange didn’t need leave the dock and it was “proportionate and sensible” for him to privately speak with his lawyers in the holding cells. The judge was prepared to allow regular stoppages so he could do that even if the three-week hearing stretched out to six weeks. “If that results from the current three weeks for which they are listed stretching to a much longer period then I am very happy to accommodate that,” Judge Baraitser said. Defence barrister Mark Summers earlier argued that defendants are still in custody of the court even if they weren’t physically in “that glass cabinet”. “One can be in custody even if one is out wandering in the concourse, enjoying the delights of the court canteen,” Mr Summers said. WikiLeaks editor Kristinn Hrafnsson claimed the ruling was written before the application had even been made, indicating Assange wouldn’t get a fair trial. “And I am absolutely outraged,” Hrafnsson said outside court. “Even in America accused murders sit beside their lawyers in the courtroom without shackles.” Assange has been charged in the US with 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act and one of conspiring to commit computer intrusion over the leaking and publishing of thousands of classified US diplomatic and military files in 2010. The charges carry a total sentence of 175 years’ imprisonment. -AAP"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"How our COVID-19 pandemic action plan will work","date":"02-28-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/02\/28\/covid-19-pandemic-plan\/","transcript":"Scott Morrison has activated a ­pandemic plan, warning the coronavirus is “very much upon us” as Australia prepares to open fever clinics, plan protocols for schools and aged-care homes, and stockpile medical supplies and masks. As experts warn that the spread of the coronavirus will soon be impossible to contain across the globe, the Prime Minister urged Australians to remain calm but outlined the measures that will be enacted if required. The National Security Committee met for three hours on Thursday. “What has occurred … in the last 24 hours or so … is that the rate of transmission of the virus outside of China is fundamentally changing the way we need to now look at how this issue is being managed here in Australia,” Mr Morrison said. “So while the WHO is yet to declare the nature of the coronavirus and it’s moved towards a pandemic phase, we believe that the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us. “As a result, as a government, we need to take the steps necessary to prepare.” Mr Morrison stressed these measures were being adopted out of an “abundance of caution” given that there were no signs yet of the coronavirus being spread in Australia. According to health authorities, all of the current cases in Australia were from overseas contact. They include 15 cases that have come from Wuhan and have now been cleared, and eight other cases that were imported from those who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. “There are no other cases here in Australia and there has been no community transmission, as [chief medical officer] Dr [Brendan] Murphy would say, here in Australia,” Mr Morrison said. As Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Thursday that all schools would close from Monday until April to help contain the virus, Mr Morrison said Australia was preparing a response plan if it is required. But there’s no suggestion yet Australia will close schools, given there is no sign yet of community transmission. “In relation to schools, I’ve tasked the Minister for Education to engage with the education ministers from the states and territories,” Mr Morrison said. “I want to stress – and I’m sure Dr Kelly [Dr Paul Kelly, Australia’s deputy chief medical officer] will reinforce this point – there is no evidence before us that children are in any greater risk as a result of what has occurred more recently. “But we do believe to take care of our kids, that we need an even greater abundance of caution to ensure that should the coronavirus move to a very extreme level or there is any particular risk that is associated with children, particularly those attending school, that we have the preparedness and the arrangements in place with states and territories.” Mr Morrison said he was confident the states were already well advanced with plans. Dr Kelly stressed that for most people, the virus caused very mild symptoms. But the focus needed to be on those that it could kill. “I would stress that for 80 per cent of people, it’s a mild illness and so we’re preparing for all eventualities in terms of when it may or may not come to Australia, how many people might get infected and … very importantly … to really concentrate on what we can do to decrease the number of cases coming and spreading through our community,” Dr Kelly said. Another issue to be considered is the stockpiling of masks, which “are the most useful for this particular issue,’” Dr Kelly said. One option under consideration by state and federal health ministers on Friday was fever clinics to manage high-risk sufferers, including the elderly. “Coronavirus was already on the agenda but as a consequence of this we have sent out inquiries to all of them to fill the items which we want to look at,” Health Minister Greg Hunt said. “Supply chain management, to make sure that there’s surge capacity if required … in our hospitals and our medical facilities, the preparedness of state health systems, preparedness of critical medicines – they’re all the things that we now move towards.” The PM said there was no need at this stage to panic and stop mass gatherings of people, such as AFL games, to stop the spread of the disease. “There is no need for us to be moving towards not having mass gatherings of people,” Mr Morrison said. “You can still go to the football. You can still go to the cricket. You can still go and play with your friends down the street. You can go off to the concert and you can go out for a Chinese meal. “You can do all of these things because Australia has acted quickly. Australia has got ahead of this at this point in time. “But to stay ahead of it, we need to now elevate our response to this next phase.” Australia’s ageing population is a significant risk factor to be managed by health authorities because seniors are more likely to die from the flu-like virus. Dr Paul Kelly said this week that in a worst-case scenario family visits would be banned, patients would be isolated and end-of-life planning would be encouraged. Australia has twice the number of over-65s as China (as a proportion of the population) and the lesson of the Diamond Princess outbreak was that the bulk of the deaths were in the over-80 age group. Mr Morrison has previously rejected Labor calls for economic stimulus to protect Australia from a recession as the global impact of the virus grows. There are already warnings it will hit Australian universities and the overseas student market. “We are quite aware of where the virus is impacting in particular sectors more than others,” he said. “Obviously, in the travel sector it’s having a very big impact, in the education sector, but … the impact of supply chain breakdowns, not just now between Australia and China but in a broader global pandemic stage, would also be quite relevant. “We’re aware, particularly in the export industry, in the marine sector … especially in North Queensland, but these problems are presenting in many other places and Treasury is doing that work now and the Treasurer [Josh Frydenberg] will be leading a response to that.” The Prime Minister also confirmed the travel ban for China, which is being monitored on a weekly basis, will continue for another. Quarantine powers were activated on January 21."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"‘External pressure’ won’t affect Order of Australia Council call on Arndt","date":"02-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/02\/27\/order-of-australia-council-bettina-arndt-shane-stone\/","transcript":"Sex therapist Bettina Arndt’s legion of critics have been warned to back off by former Liberal Party president and the chair of the Order of Australia awards, Shane Stone, because “external pressure or lobbying” will not determine if her award is rescinded. Despite the Coalition and the Labor Party joining in the Senate to support a bipartisan motion calling for the council to strip Ms Arndt of her award, Mr Stone’s first public comments on the controversy have struck a defiant note. But it also sends a message to Ms Arndt’s supporters too, who she has also urged to bombard MPs and the council with letters of support. The Governor-General and the Order of Australia Council has received hundreds of letters complaining about Ms Arndt after she angered critics by backing calls for police to keep an open mind on whether killer dad Rowan Baxter, who burned alive his wife and three children, had been “driven too far”. But Mr Stone said the council would consider the matter in the normal, methodical way. Mr Stone is a former Northern Territory chief minister and Liberal Party president who famously wrote the “mean, tricky and out of touch” memo on the challenges the Howard government faced in 2001, before it leaked to the media. “There is a standard process when consideration is given to terminating an appointment or cancelling an award in the Order of Australia. This is followed in all cases,” Mr Stone said. “In practice, the Governor-General does not act on any matter relating to the Order of Australia other than on the advice of the council. “The council, which comprises representatives of each state and territory and community representatives, will consider the correspondence that it has received in a methodical way. “It is important to note that the council’s consideration of any individual matter is based on factual information and not by external pressure or lobbying.” Mr Stone declined to give a timeframe for the considerations. “At the conclusion of our consideration, the council will inform the member of the outcome,” Mr Stone said."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Red Symons reflects on his Skyhooks debut compared to Zoe Caldwell","date":"02-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/2020\/02\/27\/red-symons-skyhooks\/","transcript":"The first time I ever appeared with the Skyhooks, the entire audience rose to their feet. The long day had been occupied mostly by performers with flutes and guitars playing soothing lift music while the audience sat on the open floor of the hall and maidens swayed and babies frolicked. We were the last act on the bill and the only one to close the curtain. As we started assertively playing, the curtain opened to reveal drag and make-up. Those sitting on the floor at the front stood first to see this odd and demanding spectacle. The people immediately behind them stood to see what had been obscured by those who had stood in front of them. This ripple went back through the crowd such that the entire audience rose to their feet. We were barely into the first few bars of the song so I cannot claim it as an appreciation of our achievements. It was not a standing ovation. They were just answering the question, “What’s all the fuss about?” I was once given an enormously instructive account of how the Australian actor – who has recently moved on to that great Green Room in the everafter – Dame Zoe Caldwell precipitated a standing ovation. Given that, as a stage performer she focused her “instrument”, her being, on extracting the broth of emotion from the bones of the script, it makes sense that the curtain call, the bow at the end of the show, should be the peak of her finely honed craft. Let me take you behind the curtain. In the lead role she would have been preceded by the supporting (euphemism for lesser) actors. Everyone but you is on stage having received their polite smattering of thanks and appreciation. You are the last and only one left. Waiting in the wings, your moment has arrived. With shuffling steps, your body bent, your head bowed, drained and exhausted from the tour de force of giving your all to the treasured audience, you present yourself to the arena. With the last remaining dregs of energy and an effort of will you lift your head to drink them in. They were invisible, imaginary and non-existent, behind the fourth wall, for the entire performance that went before. You feel, for the first time, the love that is rippling from the room and lapping at the stage. It infuses your body with renewed will, purpose and the hint of a smile. You straighten your body, straighten your neck, raise your eyes. Your shuffling, exhausted feet step forward with renewed vigour. Your pace quickens as you move from your entrance in the wings to front and centre of the stage for that biggest and final-est of moments. Not too quickly now. As you advance, your eye seeks contact, starting at the highest and most distant balcony, with each and every individual member of the audience. Along each row and down, and down, you arrive at the foot of the stage staring, arms length away, at your most devoted fan, sitting in the middle of the front row. You meet and lock their gaze and suddenly … you stamp your foot and throw your arms upwards into the air. Your most devoted fan, sensing both terror and a full stop, rises to their feet in a standing ovation. The audience behind them, their view suddenly obscured, stand to see what the fuss is all about. Anybody left sitting, stands to avoid drawing unwanted attention. I employed this technique for a number of years in a musical theatre show. On not a single occasion did I receive a standing ovation. I can only conclude that the late Dame Zoe Caldwell was doing something worthwhile and memorable in the show leading up to that curtain call. I shall now stand in appreciation of her. Red Symons is a musician of the 1970s, TV vaudevillian of the 80s and 90s, radio voice of the new millennium and a sprinkled condiment in the theatre and print."},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"Bearded men, your facial fluff won’t save you from coronavirus","date":"02-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/life\/wellbeing\/2020\/02\/27\/beard-kinds-mask-cdc\/","transcript":"Bad news for blokes who love their facial hair: Your moustache might mean the difference between sickness and health.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the move late on Thursday. “Based on the expert medical advice we have received, there is every indication that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus,” he said. “As a result we have agreed today and initiated the information of the coronavirus and emergency response plan.” The plan means the government can move quickly if the World Health Organisation declares the escalating outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, as is expected within days. As part of the new plan, the government has extended the travel ban on people coming from China for a further week. The new ban will end on March 7. “We believe the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us and as a result as a government we need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic,” Mr Morrison said. The emergency plan includes preparations for extra controls at airports and ports, further quarantine measures and detailing how schools should react to any widespread outbreak. “There is no evidence before us that children are at any greater risk,” Mr Morrison said. “But we do believe, to take care of our kids, that we needed an even greater abundance of caution to ensure that should the coronavirus move to a extreme level … that we have the preparedness and arrangements in place.” The federal government’s move comes as more than 82,000 cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed around the world. They include the first diagnosed case in the US of a patient who has no travel pattern related to COVID-19, nor any contact with anyone who has. Mainland China still accounts for the vast number of cases, and deaths, but the outbreak is now spreading faster outside China than inside it. There are more recent outbreaks of growing concern in Italy, Iran, France, Germany and Brazil. Despite the extended measures, Mr Morrison maintained the outbreak was well under control in Australia. “There is no need for us to be moving to having mass gatherings of people stop,” he said. “You can go to the football and the cricket, and play with your friends down the street, you can go out for a Chinese meal,” he said. “You can do all of these things because Australia has acted quickly, Australia has got ahead of this at this point in time.

In evidence to Senate estimates on Thursday, Sport Australia confirmed it received an email from then sports minister Bridget McKenzie’s office at 8.46am on the day the 2019 election was called. It outlined which projects should be funded. Traditionally, a government avoids making major policy decisions during the caretaker period, until the result of an election is known. Labor Senator Katy Gallagher noted that the government went into caretaker mode at 8.30am on April 11, 2019. “When was the Parliament dissolved on that day? You aware of that?” she said on Thursday. “I’m of the understanding it’s at 8.30am or about that time. So if you received it at 8.46am, we’re actually in caretaker at that point in time.” Caretaker provisions are a convention observed by both sides of politics but approving a project after the election was called does not mean the decision or the approval was illegal or void. According to evidence at Senate estimates, the brief was signed on April 4, 2019 – before the May 18 election was called. But that raised questions from Labor about whether it had been backdated, given correspondence with the Prime Minister’s office on April 10. “We know that on the 10th of April [there was] interaction between the minister and the Prime Minister over approval for round three,” Senator Gallagher said. “Then on the 11th of April, the signed brief was returned. And we know that Sport Australia didn’t receive that brief until the 11th of April at 8.46am. It would be very useful to find out when that approval brief was sent to the minister’s office. So the brief was signed off on the 4th of April, is that according to your records?” Later, in question time, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese seized on the revelations. “Sport Australia has given evidence to the Senate they received the backdated brief from the Government, approving sports rorts projects for funding at 8.46am on the day the election was called,” he said. “Given the House was dissolved at 8.30am that day, why did the Prime Minister breach caretaker conventions by spending tens of millions of dollars on sports rorts on the day he called the election?” But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he did not agree with the claim the paperwork was backdated. “The testimony today from Sport Australia was that they received a brief from Senator McKenzie dated 4 April, 2019. It was authorised by the minister on 4 April, 2019,” he said. “There was no authorisation provided by me as Prime Minister on the projects. Those authorisations were provided on 4 April, according to the approval of the brief by Senator McKenzie, on that date, as advised by Sport Australia” Earlier, Australian Sports Commission chair John Wylie said Senator McKenzie had broad powers to approve projects under the program guidelines. “It was … ultimately the minister’s prerogative to make decisions as the minister saw fit,” he said. “Our organisation did raise risks with the minister through that email and other communication that identified the risks in making decisions independently or differently from the merit-based assessment that came from our organisation. “But that was the basis in which this program was established under the program guidelines.”"},{"source":"The New Daily","title":"'Milestone' settlement in firefighting foam class actions","date":"02-27-2020","url":"https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2020\/02\/27\/pfas-class-action-settlement\/","transcript":"An “in-principle” settlement has been reached between the Australian government and residents of three communities who had their groundwater contaminated by toxic firefighting foams used at defence bases until the early 2000s. Residents from Williamtown in NSW, Oakey in Queensland and Katherine in the Northern Territory had each brought class actions, which contended that the Department of Defence was liable for depressed land values and business outlooks. The groundwater was found to be contaminated in each community, following the widespread use of per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – chemicals that do not breakdown and instead bio-accumulate in soil – which were widely used in firefighting foams at defence bases. Authorities overseas, including the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have found PFOA and PFOS chemicals (a type of PFAS) can cause reproductive and developmental, liver and kidney, and immunological effects in laboratory animals. In a joint statement from the Minister for Defence, Linda Reynolds, and the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Darren Chester, the government said the parties were finalising the confidential terms of a settlement. “The Australian Government has reached an in-principle agreement to settle three Federal Court of Australia class actions relating to per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances,” the statement said. “These terms are confidential and are subject to formal consideration and approval by the Federal Court of Australia.” The three communities were represented by Shine Lawyers, who commissioned celebrity American activist Erin Brockovich to publicly lobby on their behalf. There are still hundreds more sites across Australia that have been contaminated by the toxic chemical compounds. The statement also said the Department of Defence would continue to engage with the communities and recognised the “difficult journey for many people over the past few years”. “The government remains committed to concluding the environmental investigations into PFAS contamination on and near defence facilities across Australia, and to the ongoing monitoring and engagement with communities once investigations are complete,” the statement said."}]
