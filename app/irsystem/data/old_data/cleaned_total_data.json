But no significant associations emerged for overall stroke risk and water temperature.\n\nCHECK OUT: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\nAfter excluding those participants who developed cardiovascular disease within 5 or 10 years of the start of the study, the associations found weren\u2019t quite as strong, but nevertheless still remained statistically significant.\n\nThis is an observational study, and as such, can\u2019t establish cause, added to which changes in bathing frequency weren\u2019t tracked during the monitoring period. The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch Farmer Use His Tractor to Plow Massive Tribute to Healthcare Workers into His Field", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/farmer-plows-tribute-to-nhs-workers-into-his-field/", "date": "2020-4-8", "transcript": "A talented farmer has created his own heartwarming tribute to the British National Health System (NHS) by using his tractor to plough a giant rainbow into one of his fields.\n\n33-year-old Jack Pantall used an aerial drone camera connected to his phone in order to map out the huge image of the NHS logo and the \u201cStay Safe\u201d rainbow in appreciation for Britain\u2019s healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe massive image measures in at 60 meters (196 feet) tall and 152 meters (500 feet) wide on his farm near Staunton-on-Wye in Herefordshire.\n\nPantall also managed to capture drone footage of himself creating the masterpiece, which took just 16 minutes to complete.\n\nMORE: New Jersey Teens Take Matters into Their Own Hands to Help First Responders and Small Businesses Amidst COVID-19 Crisis\n\nThe dad-of-two said he wanted to show his support for all of the NHS heroes\u2014particularly since his 31-year-old brother Harry is a paramedic and his sister-in-law works as a doctor.\n\n\u201cI had one field left I could use before my spring planting finished so I decided to do it as soon as a I could,\u201d said Pantall. \u201cMy brother and I had been thinking about it and we saw some other people showing their appreciation in different ways. He said, \u2018yeah why not let\u2019s do it\u2019.\n\n\u201cSomeone else in Exeter had done #NHS into some corn so we were thinking of something more original. My brother suggested putting the Stay Safe rainbow over the top. We decided to give it a go and the worst-case scenario was that it wouldn\u2019t come out right.\n\n\u201cThankfully, however, it did. It turned out beautifully.\n\n\u201cMy drone connects to my phone so I was watching my phone screen \u2026 to see how it was coming out while I was doing it,\u201d Pantall recalled. \u201cSo the video you\u2019re watching is how I was able to draw it.\n\nLOOK: College Student Has Been Sewing Free Face Masks For Communicating With Hearing-Impaired Folks\n\n\u201cI was driving around trying to get it done in a hurry because the drone battery only lasts about 20 minutes and I had to be relatively quick on it,\u201d he added. \u201cI managed to complete it in about 16 minutes, which was just in time, really.\u201d\n\nThe rainbow has become a symbol of support for people wanting to show solidarity with health workers on the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cMy gesture was just something we thought that we could do down at the field. It\u2019s just us showing a small amount of appreciation,\u201d says Pantall. \u201cAt the very least it brings a smile to people\u2019s faces and makes them know we are thinking of them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to broadcasting his message of support to NHS workers, Pantall has also set up a JustGiving page to support hospital staffers\u2014and he hopes his stunt can help raise money and spirits.\n\n\u201cThe NHS workers are the main ones we must thank because they\u2019re right in amongst it,\u201d said Pantall. \u201cIt was all just to say a massive thank you to them.\n\nMORE: Man Uses His Savings to Fill Up Gas Tanks For Dozens of Nurses Heading to Nearby Hospital\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got various friends who live next to us who are all nurses, resuscitation nurses, so they are in the mix of it.

Additional datasets from Worldometer show that yesterday marked the lowest number of new cases since March 17th\u2014roughly half of the nation\u2019s peak number of new cases which was recorded on March 21st. After several consecutive days of decline, April 5th also marked the lowest number of Italian deaths since March 19th.\n\nMeanwhile, less than two weeks after New Zealand enacted strict nationwide lockdowns, the nation reports that they have not only flattened their curve of cases, they have \u201csquashed it\u201d.\n\nOn the US front, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says that the number of deaths statewide fell for the first time and remained flat for new days, raising hopes for a flattened curve. New hospital admissions also fell across the state from 1,427 on April 2nd to 358 on April 5th, according to Market Watch.\n\nMORE: Hotels Are Opening Up Free Rooms to Healthcare Workers Battling the COVID-19 Outbreaks\n\nFurthermore, Cuomo added that 75% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the state have been discharged.\n\nWorldometer goes on to confirm that the number of collective new cases and deaths in the US have actually fallen since April 3rd which affirms evidence that social restrictions have been effective in curbing COVID-19.\n\nAlthough national responders are still anxiously anticipating new problems posed by the pandemic during the coming weeks, the nation\u2019s most influential statistical model has predicted that there may be fewer shortages of medical equipment\u2014and fewer deaths\u2014than we may have previously thought.\n\nCHECK OUT: Researchers Have Found a Way to Sterilize and Reuse Face Masks During Pandemic\n\nWhile authorities remain vigilant in the face of cautious optimism, weather reports are showing positive environmental progress as well.\n\nFollowing similar reports in China and the US, air pollution is continuing to plummet in countries with social restrictions, such as the UK and India.

The researchers are optimistic the second trial will prove to be similarly effective in treating people whose condition hasn\u2019t improved with medication, talk therapy, or other forms of electromagnetic stimulation.\n\nThe treatment is called Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy\u2014or SAINT. It is a form of transcranial magnetic stimulation, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of depression. The researchers reported that the therapy improves on current FDA-approved protocols by increasing the number of magnetic pulses, speeding up the pace of the treatment, and targeting the pulses according to each individual\u2019s neurocircuitry.\n\nBefore undergoing the therapy, all 21 study participants were severely depressed, according to several diagnostic tests for depression. Afterward, 19 of them scored within the non-depressed range. Although all of the participants had suicidal thoughts before the therapy, none of them reported having suicidal thoughts after treatment. All 21 participants had previously not experienced improvements with medications, FDA-approved transcranial magnetic stimulation or electroconvulsive therapy.\n\nRELATED: Exciting New Study Shows That Zapping the Brain \u2018Acutely\u2019 Relieves Symptoms of Depression\n\nThe only side effects of the new therapy were fatigue and some discomfort during treatment, the study reported. The results were published yesterday on April 6th in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a therapy for treatment-resistant depression that\u2019s broken 55% remission rates in open-label testing,\u201d said Nolan Williams, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and a senior author of the study. \u201cElectroconvulsive therapy is thought to be the gold standard, but it has only an average 48% remission rate in treatment-resistant depression. No one expected these kinds of results.\u201d\n\nCalming the brain chatter\n\nWhen 60-year-old Deirdre Lehman woke up the morning of June 30th, 2018, she said she was hit by \u201ca tsunami of darkness.\u201d Lehman had struggled with bipolar disorder all her adult life, but with medications and psychotherapy, her mood had been stable for 15 years.\n\nCHECK OUT: FDA Grants \u2018Breakthrough\u2019 Status to Psilocybin Mushroom Therapy for Untreatable Depression\n\n\u201cThere was a constant chattering in my brain: It was my own voice talking about depression, agony, hopelessness,\u201d she said. \u201cI told my husband, \u2018I\u2019m going down and I\u2019m heading toward suicide.\u2019 There seemed to be no other option.\u201d\n\nLehman\u2019s psychiatrist had heard of the SAINT study and referred her to Stanford. After researchers pinpointed the spot in her brain that would benefit from stimulation, Lehman underwent the therapy.\n\n\u201cBy the third round, the chatter started to ease,\u201d she said. \u201cBy lunch, I could look my husband in the eye. With each session, the chatter got less and less until it was completely quiet.\n\n\u201cThat was the most peace there\u2019s been in my brain since I was 16 and started down the path to bipolar disorder.\u201d\n\nLISTEN: Neuroscientists Discover a Song That Reduces Anxiety By 65%\n\nIn transcranial magnetic stimulation, electric currents from a magnetic coil placed on the scalp excite a region of the brain implicated in depression. The treatment, as approved by the FDA, requires six weeks of once-daily sessions. Only about half of patients who undergo this treatment improve, and only about a third experience remission from depression.\n\nStanford researchers hypothesized that some modifications to transcranial magnetic stimulation could improve its effectiveness. Studies had suggested that a stronger dose, of 1,800 pulses per session instead of 600, would be more effective. The researchers were cautiously optimistic of the safety of the treatment, as that dose of stimulation had been used without harm in other forms of brain stimulation for neurological disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nCHECK OUT: Watching Birds Near Your Home is Good For Your Mental Health\n\nOther studies suggested that accelerating the treatment would help relieve patients\u2019 depression more rapidly. With SAINT, study participants underwent 10 sessions per day of 10-minute treatments, with 50-minute breaks in between. After a day of therapy, Lehman\u2019s mood score indicated she was no longer depressed; it took up to five days for other participants. On average, three days of the therapy were enough for participants to have relief from depression.\n\n\u201cThe less treatment-resistant participants are, the longer the treatment lasts,\u201d said postdoctoral scholar Eleanor Cole, a lead author of the study.\n\nStrengthening a weak connection\n\nThe researchers also conjectured that targeting the stimulation more precisely would improve the treatment\u2019s effectiveness. In transcranial magnetic stimulation, the treatment is aimed at the location where most people\u2019s dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lies. This region regulates executive functions, such as selecting appropriate memories and inhibiting inappropriate responses.\n\nFor SAINT, the researchers used magnetic-resonance imaging of brain activity to locate not only the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but a particular subregion within it. They pinpointed the subregion in each participant that has a relationship with the subgenual cingulate, a part of brain that is overactive in people experiencing depression.\n\nMORE: Next Time You\u2019re Feeling Stressed or Anxious, This Study Says You Should Play Tetris\n\nIn people who are depressed, the connection between the two regions is weak, and the subgenual cingulate becomes overactive, said Keith Sudheimer, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and a senior author of the study. Stimulating the subregion of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reduces activity in the subgenual cingulate, he said.\n\nTo test safety, the researchers evaluated the participants\u2019 cognitive function before and after treatment. They found no negative side effects; in fact, they discovered that the participants\u2019 ability to switch between mental tasks and to solve problems had improved\u2014a typical outcome for people who are no longer depressed.\n\nRELATED: Managing Your Gut Bacteria Shown to Alleviate Anxiety, Says New Research\n\nOne month after the therapy, 60% of participants were still in remission from depression. Follow-up studies are underway to determine the duration of the antidepressant effects.\n\nThe researchers plan to study the effectiveness of SAINT on other conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction, and autism spectrum disorders.\n\n\u2018Resilient and stable\u2019\n\nThe depression Lehman woke up to almost two years ago was the worst episode she had ever experienced. Today, she said, she is happy and calm.\n\nSince undergoing SAINT treatment, she has completed a bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of California-Santa Barbara; she had dropped out as a young woman when her bipolar symptoms overwhelmed her studies.\n\n\u201cI used to cry over the slightest thing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when bad things happen now, I\u2019m just resilient and stable. I\u2019m in a much more peaceful state of mind, able to enjoy the positive things in life with the energy to get things done.\u201d\n\nReprinted from Stanford University\n\nTreat Your Friends To The Positivity By Sharing The Good News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch Matthew McConaughey Cheer Nursing Home Residents With Rousing Games of Virtual Bingo", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/matthew-mcconaughey-cheers-nursing-home-residents-with-virtual-bingo/", "date": "2020-4-7", "transcript": "Since seniors have been shown to be particularly susceptible to the risks of COVID-19, nursing homes all over the world are taking extra care to keep their elderly residents safe in isolation.\n\nWith few activities to keep them occupied, the old Texan residents from The Enclave at Round Rock Senior Living have been waiting out the quarantine in boredom.\n\nLuckily, Hollywood A-lister and Texas native Matthew McConaughey offered to help keep them entertained earlier this week.\n\nWATCH: TGIF\u2014Quarantined Dad\u2019s Endearing Video Shows What It\u2019s Like Working From Home With a Toddler\n\nAlthough The Enclave residents have been trying to get McConaughey to visit their nursing home for several months now, the actor respected the rules of social distancing by hosting some rousing games of bingo over a video livestream.\n\nWith his wife and kids watching in delight, McConaughey called out the numbers to the seniors on the conference call until one of the residents got a bingo.

This shift in market forces will be a much more powerful catalyst for change than the activism that, to give credit where credit is due, made these shifts possible\u2014and it\u2019s high time too.\n\nCHECK OUT: The Guys Who Sell Ocean Plastic Bracelets Are Closing in on 8 Million Pounds of Waste Pulled From the Sea\n\nThe recent meeting of the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left many activists entirely unsatisfied, and many countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, are still pouring money into coal and natural gas-fired plants. Governments have much less interest in a changing climate than, for instance, insurance companies might. Larry Fink knows this, and is pushing a lot of money into goading governments and companies to rethink the future\u2014taking devastating floods and fires, and uncertainty, into the lexicon of their decision-making.\n\nPlant Some Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Bill Gates is Now Building Factories to Produce 7 of the Most Promising COVID-19 Vaccines", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bill-gates-building-factories-for-7-most-promising-covid-vaccines/", "date": "2020-4-6", "transcript": "Bill Gates has just announced that he and his foundation are accelerating the COVID-19 response effort by building factories for all seven of the most promising vaccines currently in development\u2014even though only one or two of them will likely be produced.\n\nGates discussed the initiative during his at-home interview with The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah this week.\n\n\u201cBecause our foundation has such deep expertise in infectious diseases, we\u2019ve thought about the epidemic, we did fund some things to be more prepared, like a vaccine effort,\u201d Gates said. \u201cOur early money can accelerate things.\u201d\n\nDespite how building factories for all seven vaccines in development will likely waste billions of dollars in construction costs, Gates says that having facilities ready for any one of the treatments will likely end up saving thousands of lives in the long run.\n\nRELATED: NBA Players Recovered From COVID-19 Are Donating Plasma to Clinical Trials Helping Sick Patients\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019ll end up picking at most two of them, we\u2019re going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we don\u2019t waste time in serially saying, \u2018OK, which vaccine works?\u2019 and then building the factory,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an op-ed that was published in The Washington Post last week, Gates added: \u201cTo bring the disease to an end, we\u2019ll need a safe and effective vaccine. If we do everything right, we could have one in less than 18 months\u2014about the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed.\n\n\u201cWe can start now by building the facilities where these vaccines will be made. Because many of the top candidates are made using unique equipment, we\u2019ll have to build facilities for each of them, knowing that some won\u2019t get used. Private companies can\u2019t take that kind of risk, but the federal government can. It\u2019s a great sign that the administration made deals this week with at least two companies to prepare for vaccine manufacturing. I hope more deals will follow.\n\nMORE: Reports Find Social Restrictions Are Working to Curb New COVID-19 Cases From Italy to Seattle\n\n\u201cIn 2015, I urged world leaders in a TED talk to prepare for a pandemic the same way they prepare for war\u2014by running simulations to find the cracks in the system.

He hopes to become the first North American to ever complete this type of journey using only a sextant, almanac, pen, paper, and logbook for navigation.\n\nCoincidentally, Bert already has become, literally, the safest person on the planet, bobbing about at sea on a voyage planned long before the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nAt the time of this writing, April 1, Bert was nearing Australia, two-thirds of the way through his journey.

A critical mass of CCS participants uploading information though the app, launched on March 26th could help data-crunching researchers gain insight into how the virus is spreading and identify ways to predict and reduce the number of new infections, according to Gregory Marcus, professor in the Department of Medicine at UCSF and a co-leader of CCS.\n\nBased around a smartphone app, information on the study can be accessed via the Eureka signup website (if prompted, enter the study key: covid) or by texting \u201cCOVID\u201d to 41411.\n\nMarcus said the researchers\u2019 hope is for the new study to \u201cgo viral\u201d\u2014in a good way\u2014with a goal to ultimately enroll more than 1 million individuals around the world.\n\nRELATED: From Italy to Seattle, Reports Find Social Restrictions Are Working to Curb New COVID-19 Cases\n\n\u201cWe are asking each participant to share the link to recruit at least five others,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that the number of people signing up for this scientific study and contributing their data can increase exponentially, faster than the disease itself.\u201d To illustrate this hoped-for exponential growth, the researchers plan to create and share a data visualization that maps enrollment in CCS in real time, which Marcus hopes will show study participation outpacing the global spread of the virus.\n\nWith widespread social distancing in place, and with quarantine and isolation for some, public health studies can be challenging, Marcus said\u2014but all that\u2019s needed to join CCS is the link and a smartphone to download the mobile phone-based app. Once enrolled, participants will be asked to complete an initial 10- to 15-minute survey about their health and daily habits. Follow-up questions, delivered by push notification or text message on an ongoing basis, are expected to require five to 15 minutes per week.\n\nParticipants will be also given the option of providing nearly continuous geolocation (GPS) data, and soon, additional data from Fitbit or other Bluetooth-enabled biomonitoring devices, including blood pressure, weight, blood oxygen levels, body temperature, exercise and sleep.\n\nCHECK OUT: After the UK Told James Dyson It Needed 10,000 Ventilators, He Invented One in Just 10 Days\u2014And is Donating 5,000\n\nIn the long term, the collective participation of committed individuals in CCS will help identify behaviors, influences and factors that increase or decrease the risk of infection or that affect outcomes after infection, Marcus said. The greater the number of participants, the greater the likelihood of statistically valid findings emerging from the study.\n\nCCS springs from a project called the Health eHeart Study which Marcus launched in 2013 to harness online and mobile advances in order to collect and analyze cardiovascular information from study participants, using not only surveys, but also smartphone apps, portable blood pressure cuffs and electrocardiogram smartphone cases.\n\nThe experience gained through Health eHeart helped the UCSF team compete successfully when the National Institutes of Health sought to establish a national center for mobile health research. The result is Eureka, a mobile-app-focused health research platform that offers personnel and infrastructure, including cloud-based databases that can handle very dense data from millions of participants, to enable researchers to get studies up and running quickly.\n\nMORE: Researchers Have Found a Way to Sterilize and Reuse Face Masks During Pandemic\n\nHaving already hosted 28 studies by various research teams on Eureka, the UCSF researchers decided to launch CCS on the platform. To stretch beyond cardiology-focused research they enlisted UCSF colleagues from a variety of medical and research specialties to contribute ideas about survey questions and study parameters.\n\n\u201cWe are like a company that during wartime switches from making cars to making tanks,\u201d Marcus said.\n\nHealth eHeart already has nearly 250,000 participants, and spans more than 80 countries worldwide. They are accustomed to taking part in research, sharing personal medical information and being pinged with questions, and they all have been asked to be among the first to join the new CCS project, and to invite others.\n\nLOOK: JOANN Stores are Handing Out Free Fabric Supplies at Curbside to Anyone Sewing Face Masks at Home\n\nWith cell phones become essentially ubiquitous only in recent years, it is still early days for mobile health studies, Marcus said, but CCS has the potential to be the largest-ever prospective epidemiological study of infectious disease, perhaps of any disease. In prospective studies information is collected in real time, instead of relying solely on retrospective memory and other information that can be gathered about past events. In general, prospective studies are considered more likely than retrospective studies to correctly identify associations between variables and risks.\n\n\u201cSocial distancing keeps many protected,\u201d Marcus said, \u201cbut joining together to contribute data will help us beat this thing.\u201d\n\nReprinted from the University of California San Francisco\n\nMultiply The Good News By Sharing This With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Online Conference April 14-16 Using Covid-19 Crisis to Fix the World", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/online-conference-april-14-16-using-covid-19-crisis-to-fix-the-world/", "date": "2020-4-3", "transcript": "\u201cI cannot think of another time in the last million years when our species has been united against a common enemy,\u201d said David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School genetics professor, in an interview with Peter Diamandis.\n\nWe are all stuck at home.

Today, investing in coal projects is more expensive\u2014across all world energy markets\u2014than renewables. In as little as 10 years, it will be cheaper to build renewables than to run coal power resources, much less build new ones.\n\nHow much more expensive? Right now, the report estimates that the cost of operating and investing in coal\u2014not in Europe, but in the U.S., India, and China\u2014is about 50% more expensive than renewables. By 2030, that number doubles to 100% assuming market forces remain constant rather than intensify, which they are likely to do.\n\nLOOK: Toronto Garbage Trucks Will Soon Be Powered by Biogas From the Very Food Scraps That They Collect\n\n\u201cThe market is driving the low-carbon energy transition, but governments aren\u2019t listening,\u201d writes Matt Gray, co-head of power and utilities for Carbon Tracker, and co-author of a new global economic report about coal investments entitled \u201cHow to Waste Half a Trillion Dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cRenewables are outcompeting coal around the world and proposed coal investments risk becoming stranded assets which could lock in high-cost coal power for decades.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the number of countries in which it is cheaper in invest and operate renewable energy assets could make someone optimistic about the future since most underdeveloped Asian energy markets, as well as the three biggest coal consumers on earth, would all save money switching to renewables, according to this helpful infographic from the report.\n\nHowever, many of these countries still have nationally-planned coal power projects either in early investment stages, or already in production.\n\nMORE: Construction Begins On First Ever Commercial Plastics-to-Fuel Factory in the US\n\nAs repeatedly demonstrated by the national debt of the US government, a stranded asset is manageable for most nations, but insufferable for a private firm that is unable to borrow more dollars every year than they invest.\n\nIt is an economic term for an asset\u2014like a coal plant\u2014which will cease to generate returns even before the end of its economic life. These carbon-heavy facilities not only have a slow rate of return and open the door for market competition from renewables, they also are becoming more expensive to invest in, build, and operate, than they are to make returns for those investors.\n\nThat is partially why free market economic forces are working where many governments are failing; it costs a lot of money to build electricity-generating resources, and since banks and financial institutions are the largest funders of energy projects, they simply aren\u2019t willing to finance coal power projects, choosing instead to invest in solar and wind resources.\n\nVietnam: a Greenhouse Government\n\nThe government of Vietnam is currently considering backing away from 15 gigawatts of proposed coal power as financial constraints make it a harder to build new plants, which it wants to do in order to increase economic development.\n\nThe proposed projects would allocate 50% of energy production to coal-fired plants, but an end to the deal would see it drop to 37%, with others like hydroelectric and gas remaining stable, and renewable energy swooping in to cheaply meet the demand and fill the gap in supply.\n\nMuch of the nation\u2019s energy projects are funded by investors in other coal-fired East Asian nations like Japan and South Korea, as well as powerhouse lender Singapore. After a recent aligning of principles with EU nations to restrict coal financing, however, many coal projects in Vietnam will be left stagnating with the government\u2019s only options being to either finish the projects with taxpayer money or listen to market forces and move into cleaner energy production.\n\nCHECK OUT: Instead of Burning Coal, New Fuel Emits Zero Harmful Emissions\u2014and It\u2019s Made From Sewage\n\nOn the other hand, private sector giants like Sir Christopher Hohn, who is the billionaire hedge fund manager and co-founder of the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), threatened to sue British banks Barclays, Standard Chartered, and HSBC over the financing of new coal projects.\n\n\u201cCoal is the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally and the risks of its continued use in the power sector are not being adequately addressed by regulators and the financial system,\u201d he said in a statement on the CIFF website.\n\nIrresistible Market Forces\n\nA high price of carbon and significant investment in renewable energy has created a very unfriendly market for coal in the EU, while \u201cHow to Waste Half a Trillion Dollars\u201d finds that today, even big coal consumers like China, India, and the U.S. are on the right path and \u201cnot far behind\u201d the EU in terms of renewable energy investments.\n\n\u201cThe report finds that market forces will drive coal power out of existence in deregulated markets, where renewable energy developers will take advantage of the growing price gap,\u201d reads the report summary on Carbon Tracker\u2019s website. Across the world, 6,700 coal plants produce 2,045 gigawatts of energy, and another 1,000 or so accounting for another 500gw are in early stages of production or investment.\n\nAs the cost of investment, production, and operation of coal plants continues to increase as market forces push investors further and further towards renewables, hundreds of billions of dollars in energy markets the world over will become available at a lower cost, and coal could become twice as expensive, and begin to rapidly vanish\u2014even in large coal-consuming countries like China and India, within just 20 years.\n\nCHECK OUT: After Five Years of Drought, Kenyan Region Finally Gets Clean Water Thanks to Solar-Powered Saltwater Plant\n\nA report from Reuters found that coal power generation fell worldwide by 3% in 2019, while wind and solar power contributed 270 more terawatts, or an additional 15%, to grids. The research went on to illustrate how this growth would be needed every year for 15 years in order to meet the Paris Agreement targets. The power generation would have to continue to fall from 3% to 11% to prevent 1.5 degrees celsius of warming\u2014the rough estimate of wiggle room needed to avoid the worst effects of global climate change.\n\nMoney talks\u2014and if coal production will rise from from 50% to 100% in the U.S., India, and 60% to 100% in China, in just ten years, it means that far from unlimited growth targets being met for investors, coal barons will have to cope with a 5% yearly rise in capital requirements, as well as any future blows coal might be forced to absorb such as carbon taxes, coal embargoes, and other brutish legislative measures.\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "TGIF: Quarantined Dad\u2019s Endearing Video Shows What It\u2019s Like Working From Home With a Toddler", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/quarantined-dads-video-shows-what-its-like-working-from-home/", "date": "2020-4-3", "transcript": "As millions of adult employees around the world start working from home during the COVID-19 shutdowns, this devoted dad took an adorable video of his average social distancing day on the job\u2014and the resulting footage is pretty darn sweet.\n\n(WATCH the video below)\n\nBe Sure And Share The Cute Clip With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "On Her 86th Birthday, Check Out the Jane Goodall Documentary Trailer We Can All Use Right Now: \u2018The Hope\u2019", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/jane-goodall-documentary-trailer-we-can-all-use-right-now/", "date": "2020-4-3", "transcript": "This week, National Geographic released the trailer for a new documentary about the incredible life of scientist and activist Jane Goodall\u2014and it is already shaping up to be a much-needed lesson in global optimism.\n\nThe 2-hour documentary Jane Goodall: The Hope is set to premiere on Nat Geo, Nat Geo WILD and Nat Geo Mundo on Earth Day (April 22nd).\n\nThe invigorating trailer offers a glimpse at how the film will celebrate the 60-year career of the activist and how she is still working tirelessly to promote a message of hope for the earth.\n\nRELATED: Adults Are Describing Their Reactions to the New Mr. Rogers Documentary\u2014And It\u2019s Incredibly Sweet\n\n\u201cAt age 26, Jane Goodall\u2019s discovery that chimpanzees make and use tools shook the foundations of modern science and redefined the relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom,\u201d reads the trailer summary. \u201cIn 1977, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute to inspire hope through action around the world and for generations to come.\n\n\u201cToday, Jane is an author, advocate and public speaker, traveling an average 300 days per year sharing her reasons for hope and message that we can each make a difference to create a better world for all, every single day.\u201d\n\nIf you need any other reason to celebrate the conservationist\u2019s achievements, today (April 3rd) is also her 86th birthday.\n\n(WATCH the heartening trailer below)\n\nPreserve The Positivity By Sharing This With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "This Diligent Dog Has Been Delivering Groceries, Meals, and Mail to Senior Neighbor in Quarantine", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dog-delivers-groceries-meals-to-senior-neighbor-in-quarantine/", "date": "2020-4-2", "transcript": "This sweet golden retriever is showing that dogs aren\u2019t just man\u2019s best friend\u2014they\u2019re also man\u2019s best neighbor, too.\n\n71-year-old Renee Hellman is just one of many Colorado residents who have isolated themselves in their homes for fear of risking exposure to the novel coronavirus.

While there were steep losses in marine biodiversity throughout the 20th century, population losses have slowed and in some places bounced back in the first two decades of the 21st century.\n\nRELATED: For First Time Ever, Scientists Identify How Many Trees to Plant and Where to Plant Them to Stop Climate Crisis\n\nCo-author of the study, Professor Callum Roberts from the Department of Environment and Geography at the University of York, said: \u201cThe success of many marine conservation projects in recent years illustrates how we can make a real difference to life in our oceans if we apply the lessons learnt from them at scale and with urgency.\n\n\u201cOver-fishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration. We now have the skills and expertise to be able to restore vital marine habitats such as oyster reefs, mangrove swamps and salt marshes\u2014which keep our seas clean, our coasts protected and provide food to support entire ecosystems.\u201d\n\n\u201cScience gives us reason to be optimistic about the future of our oceans,\u201d Roberts added.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe review states that the recovery rate of marine life can be accelerated to achieve substantial recovery within two to three decades for most components of marine ecosystems, if climate change is tackled and efficient interventions are deployed at large scale.\n\nMORE: One Million \u2018Wonder Plant\u2019 Seedlings Are Planted in Wales to Fight Climate Crisis\u2014and Create Healthy Seas\n\nThe researchers have identified nine components integral to rebuilding marine life, saltmarshes, mangroves, seagrass, coral reefs, kelp, oyster reefs, fisheries, megafauna and the deep-sea.\n\nThe report identifies specific actions within the broad themes of protecting species, harvesting wisely, protecting spaces, restoring habitats, reducing pollution, and the mitigation of climate change.\n\nThe actions recommended include identified opportunities, benefits, possible roadblocks and remedial actions.

Given the name hemolithin, the unearthly protein contains iron and lithium.\n\nWhile single and even chains of amino-acids have been found in space before, this is the first time that they have been organized into what could be considered a complete protein. More exciting is that the chemical structure of this extraterrestrial protein is not found in proteins on earth.\n\nLOOK: \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 New Photos of the Sun\u2019s Surface Are Being Hailed as Landmark Achievement for Science\n\nTo ensure the protein discovered on the meteorite didn\u2019t come from earthly contaminants, the researchers measured the ratio between deuterium/hydrogen, which is similar to carbon dating and helps contextualize the origins of materials.\n\nThe results revealed \u201cvery high extraterrestrial D/H ratios,\u201d according to the study, and according to a report from Vice, this suggests the protein could have come from a period before the solar system coalesced\u2014in the proto-solar disc or even earlier\u2014in clouds of molecular dust that existed before our sun was born.\n\nRELATED: Teen Discovered New Planet 6.9 Times Bigger Than Earth Just Days into NASA Internship\n\n\u201cAt this point, we need other scientists to employ our careful methods to repeat our results,\u201d said study co-author Julie McGeoch, a molecular biologist at Harvard University, who said her team is waiting for their published paper to be replicated and sent through peer-review.\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating and, unfortunately, most complicated aspect of the discovery is the strange reaction hemolithin has in water. Studying these water-protein reactions led McGeoch to try to determine whether reactions between the two in interstellar dust clouds could have played a role in the formation of our solar system (see her corresponding paper).\n\nDown here on earth, the same splitting of molecules from water into hydrogen and oxygen would have played a major role in the creation for habitable conditions for life to arise, suggesting that extraterrestrial proteins like hemolithin might have triggered these reactions on earth.\n\nCHECK OUT: Scientists Detect Tone Pattern in the Ringing of a Newborn Black Hole for the First Time, Proving Einstein Right Again\n\nMcGeoch noted that: \u201cIf true, this could be a chemical energy source, which is the most important ingredient for a biochemical process leading on to life.\u201d\n\nMcGeoch is planning to plow forward studying these reactions, acknowledging that the protein, or any protein\u2019s, potential role in the formation of the solar system or otherwise is merely speculation at this point; but for the first time, short of a cell arriving on a meteorite, we have confirmed the off-world presence of at least one major building block to organic life, as well as the possibility of beginning to understand mechanisms that might lead to a planet becoming suitable for it.\n\nBe Sure And Share The Exciting News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026 (Photo by Tom Hall, CC license)", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Happy 60th Birthday to Madagascar!

However, as the cfDNA can come from other types of cells as well, it can be difficult to pinpoint cfDNA that comes from tumors. The blood test reported in this study analyses chemical changes to the DNA called \u201cmethylation\u201d that usually control gene expression. Abnormal methylation patterns and the resulting changes in gene expression can contribute to tumor growth, so these signals in cfDNA have the potential to detect and localize cancer.\n\nThe blood test targets approximately one million of the 30 million methylation sites in the human genome. A machine learning classifier (an algorithm) was used to predict the presence of cancer and the type of cancer based on the patterns of methylation in the cfDNA shed by tumors. The classifier was trained using a methylation database of cancer and non-cancer signals in cfDNA. The database is believed to be the largest in the world and is owned by the California-based company involved in this research, GRAIL, Inc..\n\nSenior author of the paper and President of US Oncology Dr. Michael Seiden said: \u201cOur earlier research showed that the methylation approach outperformed both whole genome and targeted sequencing in the detection of multiple deadly cancer types across all clinical stages, and in identifying the tissue of origin.

In all of more than 50 cancer types, the corresponding rates were 18%, 43%, 81% and 93%, respectively.\n\nLOOK: Scientist Who Helped Develop Breakthrough Ovarian Cancer Treatment Donates All $1.2 Million in Profits\n\nThe test was also consistent between the training and validation sets in its ability to identify the tissue where cancer had originated, with an accuracy of 93% in the validation set.\n\nDr. Seiden said: \u201cThese data support the ability of this targeted methylation test to meet what we believe are the fundamental requirements for a multi-cancer early detection blood test that could be used for population-level screening: the ability to detect multiple deadly cancer types with a single test that has a very low false positive rate, and the ability to identify where in the body the cancer is located with high accuracy to help healthcare providers to direct next steps for diagnosis and care.\n\n\u201cConsidering the burden of cancer in our society, it is important that we continue to explore the possibility that this test might intercept cancers at an earlier stage and, by extension, potentially reduce deaths from cancers for which screening is either not available or has poor adherence. To our knowledge, this is the largest clinical genomics study, in participants with and without cancer, to develop and validate a blood test for early detection of multiple cancers.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Husband-Wife Duo Has Developed \u2018Gene and Cell Therapy\u2019 Cancer Vaccine Now Being Tested on Patients\n\nThe study is funded by GRAIL, the maker of the blood test. Researchers are continuing to validate the test in large, prospective studies in the USA (STRIVE and PATHFINDER studies) and the UK (SUMMIT study), and to examine its feasibility for screening populations.\n\nA strength of the CCGA study is that it includes more than 15,000 participants from 142 clinics in North America, ensuring results are generalizable to a diverse population. The ongoing studies are assessing the test\u2019s performance in even broader populations. Limitations include: all the participants with cancer had already been diagnosed with cancer (e.g. via screening or patients presenting with symptoms); the study was not designed to establish the test\u2019s impact on death from cancer or other causes; at the time of this analysis, not all patients had been followed for a year, which is needed to ensure their non-cancer status was accurate; and some inaccuracy occurred in the detection of the tissue of origin for cancers that are driven by the human papilloma virus (HPV), such as cancers of the cervix, anus, and head and neck\u2014this information is being used to improve the test\u2019s performance.\n\nEditor-in-chief of Annals of Oncology, Professor Fabrice Andr\u00e9, said: \u201cThis is a landmark study and a first step toward the development of easy-to-perform screening tools. Earlier detection of more than 50% of cancers could save millions of lives every year worldwide and could dramatically reduce morbidity induced by aggressive treatments.\n\n\u201cWhile numbers are still small, the performance of this new technology is particularly intriguing in pancreatic cancer, for which mortality rates are very high because it is usually diagnosed when it\u2019s at an advanced stage.\u201d\n\nReprinted from European Society for Medical Oncology\n\nTreat Your Friends To A Daily Dose Of Good News By Sharing This To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Disheartened by News Reports, Caf\u00e9 Owner Withdraws $10,000 in Cash to Give Away to Unemployed Strangers", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/australian-cafe-owner-gives-away-10k-in-cash-to-unemployed-strangers/", "date": "2020-3-30", "transcript": "A 62-year-old Australian caf\u00e9 owner has been affectionately nicknamed \u201cGenerous Pete\u201d after he spent his afternoon handing out $100 bills to people left unemployed by the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nDespite how Pete Darmos had been forced to close his restaurant in Melbourne amidst the outbreaks, he felt inspired to share his financial fortune with his community last week after watching a particularly emotional news segment about the lines of people queuing up outside of social security offices across the city.\n\nRather than twiddle his thumbs at home, Darmos rushed to the bank, withdrew $10,000 in cash, and handed out each of the $100 notes to the people standing in line at the nearby Centrelink location in Box Hill.\n\nRELATED: Restaurant Flooded With Business After Launching an \u2018Adopt a Doc or Nurse\u2019 Catering Service\n\n\u201cI started at the back of the queue and then basically handed everybody a $100 note,\u201d he told 7 News. \u201cThere were tears and disbelief. $100 is not a lot of money, but four or five bags of food meant a lot to these people.\u201d\n\nDarmos later told reporters that although he had initially wanted to keep his identity anonymous, he now hopes that news of his good deed will inspire other people to show some compassion to their neighbors during these turbulent times.\n\nThis is just one of many positive stories and updates that are coming out of the COVID-19 news coverage this week.

Science like this was in large part responsible for the World Economic Forum\u2019s launch of the Trillion Trees vision.\n\nBecause they store immense amounts of carbon in their submerged root systems, mangroves and other bodies of coastal vegetation are some of our planet\u2019s most important ecosystems. They help filter river mud runoff from entering the sea, while absorbing the brunt of tidal waves and tsunamis. And they also provide some of the most valuable habitat for near-shore wildlife including birds, insects, invertebrates, crustaceans, reptiles, fish, and even monkeys.\n\nMORE: First Drone Project of Its Kind in Canada is Aiming to Plant 1 Billion Trees by 2028\n\nIn a video interview with BBC, Haidar described how the original mangrove forest in Southern Senegal was disrupted in the 80s and 90s as the nation began to build roads which diverted or ended the flow of rivers. \u201cAt the time there were no environmental impact studies, of course.\u201d\n\nNext came the lumbermen who clear-cut the coastal mangroves.

What mysterious antics they get up to when they\u2019re prowling around the great outdoors? And will we ever understand the inner mysteries of the noble cat mind?\n\nIn an effort to answer these ancient questions, which have plagued the minds of cat-fanciers since the time of the Pharaohs, one team of scientists launched an initiative to track the movements of our feline friends and glean some insight into their outdoor lives.\n\nThe Cat Tracker Project is simple in concept: find out where cats go and what they do. Founded by researchers from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, the team placed GPS collars on the cats of willing volunteers.\n\nAfter tracking the movements and behavior of nearly 1,000 cats across four countries and analyzing the data for six years, the results are in\u2014and some of the findings come as a bit of a shock.\n\nLOOK: This Epic Pirate Cat Has Spent Her Whole Life Sailing the Ocean\n\n\u201cI was surprised at how little these cats moved,\u201d lead project author Roland Kays told National Geographic. \u201cMost of them spent all their time within 100 meters [330 feet] of their yard.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that all cats were layabouts, however. National Geographic\u2019s Jonathan Losos goes on to note: \u201cSeven percent covered more than 25 acres, and several cats had enormous ranges. The record-setter was Penny, a young female from the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand, who roamed over the hills behind her house, covering an area greater than three square miles.\u201d\n\nThen there was Max, a neutered tomcat from England who walked from his home village of St. Newlyn East all the way to Trevilson\u2014over a mile\u2014and back for no apparent reason. Max made this trek twice in the six days he was tracked, leaving his human as mystified as the researchers.\n\nRELATED: Missing Cat Finally Reunited With Owner After It Was Found Wandering the Streets 1,400 Miles Away\n\nIf you have an outdoor cat, reading some of these anecdotes might confirm something you\u2019ve long suspected: that the inner machinations of a cat\u2019s mind are an unknowable enigma\u2014a felicitous riddle whose answer they themselves might not possess.\n\nOn the other hand, don\u2019t let the tales of adventurous ramblers worry you\u2014the study found that the vast majority of cats are, simply put, \u201cuniversally lazy\u201d, according to Kays. Aloof though their personalities may seem, chances are our furry companions are strolling just outside our own backyards, and not farther.\n\nHowever, the Cat Tracker Project doesn\u2019t end there. If have you ever wanted to understand your cat\u2019s personality, the project\u2019s website explains: \u201cWith help from our colleagues at Discovery Circle in Australia, we know that there are 5 overarching traits in feline personality, aptly named the \u2018Feline Five\u2019. They consist of Skittishness, Outgoingness, Spontaneity, Dominance and Friendliness. The results are calculated on a scale, showing how much your cat exhibits characteristics in each of the Feline Five traits.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Man Who Loves Cats Transforms Home into Feline Playland\u2014And You Can Too (For Charity)\n\nThe Cat Tracker Project also has a branch of their work that studies how much pet cats hunt local birds and mammals for sport. By analyzing hair and food samples from participants, researchers can learn about whether a particular cat is \u201csnacking beyond the food bowl\u201d. While this might seem merely like an unsavory side-effect of cat ownership, recent research actually indicates that free-ranging domestic cats in the United States alone kill up to 4 billion birds and 22 billion mammals each year. That could be over three times the population of human beings on planet Earth!\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the staggering number of birds killed by pet cats has led an intrepid kitty-owner to take action. In 2018, GNN covered a story about a cat mom named Nancy Brennan who had become increasingly frustrated by how many birds regularly fell prey to her pet cat George\u2014and she became determined to stop him from hunting birds by any means necessary.\n\nUpon reading an article about how birds tend to take notice of bright colors, Brennan created a rainbow kitty collar for George to wear. Its vibrant hues alerted nearby birds to the cat\u2019s presence, and shortly after, she was delighted to find that George had stopped killing birds.\n\nMORE: Frozen Cat That Was Found Unresponsive, Buried in Snow Makes Miraculous Recovery\n\nHer \u201cBirds Be Safe\u201d collar ended up being so anecdotally effective for other pet owners that an ornithologist and professor at St. Lawrence University, S.K. Wilson, decided to run a 12-week scientific study on its success. Wilson\u2019s study proved that cats killed 19 times fewer birds when wearing one of Brennan\u2019s bright collars. The study brought a flood of new traffic to Brennan\u2019s collar-selling site, which now distributes its bird-saving devices to cat parents all across the world\u2014not to mention the stylish flair that the collars give their cats.\n\nYou can read the full story of George and the Birds Be Safe collars by clicking here\u2014otherwise, if you are interested in volunteering your own feline friend to participate in the Cat Tracker Project, be sure and visit their website for more information.\n\n(WATCH the 2014 Nat Geo video on The Cat Tracker Project below) \u2013 Feature Photo by Nat Geo\n\nBe Sure And Share This Pawesome Story With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "These New Solar-Pavement Driveways Made of Plastic Bottles Can Power the Average Household", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/solar-driveways-made-from-pet-can-power-average-household/", "date": "2020-4-9", "transcript": "Solar panel driveways may soon be powering all our households with clean electricity thanks to this Budapest-based startup.\n\nFor the last five years, Platio Solar has been developing new ways of implementing solar technology into urban spaces\u2014and one of their latest developments is a residential solar paneled driveway made out of recycled plastic bottles.\n\nAccording to a video that was published by the company last week, the solar system is the first to generate power from the pavement of a residential household.\n\nLOOK: Company Collects 80% of City\u2019s Recyclable Plastics and Turns It All into Lumber\n\nEach \u201cPlatio Solar Paver\u201d is made from 400 polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles\u2014one of the most common forms of consumer plastic.

Many times, I have read how people feel good after they help someone through volunteering, or even holding a door open\u2014and I\u2019ve felt it myself.\n\nIf persuaded to explain why it feels good, it is clear that helping someone else (or simply witnessing kindness) sets off a series of changes in the brain similarly to the release of endorphins, the internal opiates. Spiritually, of course, helping someone is the right thing to do. The biological connection between my spiritual understanding and how I feel suggests that nature has wired me to do so; my body is reinforcing/rewarding these \u201cright things\u201d with pleasurable sensations. Similarly, the receiver also feels good because he or she has been acknowledged or valued.\n\nActs of kindness therefore create meaningful connections between people. It is part of what I have called the \u201ckindness-connection cycle\u201d, in which acts of kindness connect the giver and receiver to one another.\n\nThe focus of this class is the last arc of the kindness-connection cycle, which states that meaningful connection increases kindness in turn. The central idea is that when we truly understand how each of our lives is intertwined with so many others, kindness, compassion, and collaboration flow much more naturally.\n\nRELATED: Why We Should Practice Forest Bathing and How to Get the Benefits of \u2018Forest Medicine\u2019\n\nAlthough we are unique individuals, our lives are part of a dynamic and vibrant larger network. What each of us does in that network influences many others and vice versa\u2014i.e., we are in this together.\n\nThere are many different examples of how we are connected to each other, such as being connected through economics, interpersonal interactions, workplace, community, family, etc.\n\nOne overlooked aspect of being connected to each other, however, is the common biology that we share. For example, blood courses through our arteries and veins before being filtered by the kidneys and pumped by a heart which beats approximately 100,000 times every day.\n\nThere are many other systems that, with slight variation, function the same way in healthy people, such as the regulation of blood sugar, blood pressure, and immune responses \u2013 and although we may differ in outward appearance (height, body, facial shape, or skin color), our bodies still generally work the same way.\n\nMORE: Instead of \u2018We Are What We Eat,\u2019 the Science of Kindness Says \u2018We Are What We See\u2019 in Daily Life\n\nBeyond the systems that we have in common, we also actively share our biological lives with each other. Let\u2019s focus on oxygen, one of the most abundant elements on the planet that is absolutely critical for our survival. Inhaled oxygen (O2) is required to use calories and convert them into energy fuel for our cells; this process then produces carbon dioxide (CO2) which we exhale as a byproduct. Life is not possible without oxygen.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that you and I are hiking a trail in the woods and we stop to admire a vista. Much of the oxygen we are inhaling is probably produced by the trees and plant life\u2014yet how did the tree make oxygen? As other hikers have gone through the forest, the trees\u2014powered by sunlight\u2014absorb the carbon dioxide that is exhaled by the hikers so they can transform it into cellulose. O2 is then released from the CO2 that the trees have absorbed, thus continuing the oxygen cycle between the hikers and the trees.\n\nThis means that the oxygen I breathe in to survive was used by someone else in the past to help them live as well\u2014and it will also be used by someone else in the future.\n\nCHECK OUT: Man\u2019s Cancer is Healed After Doing Random Acts of Kindness for a Year\n\nAs oxygen is constantly being recycled, and each person needs about 500 liters of oxygen each day, multiple authors have speculated on how we may have inhaled the same oxygen molecules as Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., or any other historical figure.\n\nThe bottom line: all of our lives depend on sharing, and this sharing extends across time.\n\nThis example also illustrates how we are critically connected to trees and nature. Without plant life, oxygen wouldn\u2019t be produced and carbon dioxide wouldn\u2019t be cleared\u2014and since roughly half of the oxygen on Earth comes from phytoplankton in the oceans, this means that our oxygen-dependent lives are also tied to the sea. Phytoplankton, in turn, depend on waste and motion from larger sea creatures\u2014such as whales.\n\nMORE: It\u2019s Random Acts of Kindness Week \u2013 The Health Benefits of Being Kind and Ideas for Rocking It\n\nWhen something disrupts these cycles, like deforestation or whale hunting, we share in the problems that follow. When we protect and nourish them, however, we honor their significance and are rewarded for it.\n\nWhat goes around, comes around. Life is much more about cycles rather than straight lines. Oxygen is just one of many examples that, by the nature of our shared biology, we are connected to one another. The same is true for nitrogen, water, iron, and a host of other biologically essential factors that are recycled by other life forms. This gets more complex once we include the interactions of insects and animals that are necessary to keep the fabric of our interwoven network healthy and vibrant.\n\nSo what does this teach us? It tells us that our lives are more intimately connected than we might ever have thought. On a basic level, it teaches that sharing (kindness and cooperation) is actively required for living beings to survive.\n\nRELATED: How to Follow Negative News Without Getting Depressed\n\nBeyond that, we are deeply connected by the oxygen cycle in a reciprocating, cooperative way. Without trees and greenery, we would not survive\u2014and as those systems depend on carbon dioxide to survive, we sustain them in turn. Short-sighted selfishness that overuses or abuses a component of the cycle will come back around to affect us.\n\nBut the cycle is fragile; without us doing the right thing to responsibly maintain our part of a mutually nourishing cycle, it can fail. Doing the right thing honors two principles: being kind to and respecting the roles of other members of the cycle, and being kind to ourselves to sustain our own well being.\n\nThe eminent conservationist John Muir wrote: \u201cWhen one tugs at a single thing in nature, you find it attached to the rest of the world.\u201d That is, we are all connected.\n\nInterested in learning more about the science of kindness and its role in your life?

Not only has the treaty spurred healing of the ozone layer, it\u2019s also driving recent changes in Southern Hemisphere air circulation patterns,\u201d said lead author Antara Banerjee, a CIRES Visiting Fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder who works in the Chemical Sciences Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThe ozone hole, discovered in 1985, has been forming every spring in the atmosphere high over Antarctica. Ozone depletion cools the air, strengthening the winds of the polar vortex and affecting winds all the way down to the lowest layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Ultimately, ozone depletion has shifted the midlatitude jet stream and the dry regions at the edge of the tropics toward the South Pole.\n\nLOOK: \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 New Photos of the Sun\u2019s Surface Are Being Hailed as Landmark Achievement for Science\n\nPrevious studies have linked these circulation trends to weather changes in the Southern Hemisphere, especially rainfall over South America, East Africa, and Australia, and to changes in ocean currents and salinity.\n\nThe Montreal Protocol of 1987 phased out production of ozone-destroying substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Beginning around 2000, concentrations of those chemicals in the stratosphere started to decline and the ozone hole began to recover. In this study, Banerjee and her co-authors have shown that around the year 2000, the circulation of the Southern Hemisphere also stopped expanding polewards\u2014a pause or slight reversal of the earlier trends.\n\n\u201cThe challenge in this study was proving our hypothesis that ozone recovery is in fact driving these atmospheric circulation changes and it isn\u2019t just a coincidence,\u201d Banerjee said.\n\nTo do that, the researchers used a two-step statistical technique called detection and attribution: detecting whether certain patterns of observed wind changes are unlikely to be due to natural variability alone and, if so, whether the changes can be attributed to human-caused factors, such as emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals and CO2.\n\nRELATED: Scientists Detect Tone Pattern in the Ringing of a Newborn Black Hole for the First Time, Proving Einstein Right Again\n\nUsing computer simulations, the researchers first determined that the observed pause in circulation trends couldn\u2019t be explained by natural shifts in winds alone. Next, they isolated the effects of ozone and greenhouse gases separately.\n\nThey showed that while rising CO2 emissions have continued expanding the near-surface circulation (including the jet stream) polewards, only the ozone changes could explain the pause in circulation trends. Prior to 2000, both ozone depletion and rising CO2 levels pushed the near-surface circulation poleward. Since 2000, CO2 has continued to push this circulation poleward, balancing the opposing effect of the ozone recovery.\n\n\u201cIdentifying the ozone-driven pause in circulation trends in real-world observations confirms, for the first time, what the scientific ozone community has long predicted from theory,\u201d said John Fyfe, a scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada and one of the paper\u2019s co-authors.\n\nMORE: NASA Happily Reports the Earth is Greener, With More Trees Than 20 Years Ago\u2013and It\u2019s Thanks to China, India\n\nWith ozone recovering and CO2 levels continuing to climb, the future is less certain, including for those Southern Hemisphere regions whose weather is affected by the jet stream and those at the edge of the dry regions.\n\n\u201cWe term this a \u2018pause\u2019 because the poleward circulation trends might resume, stay flat, or reverse,\u201d Banerjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s the tug of war between the opposing effects of ozone recovery and rising greenhouse gases that will determine future trends.\u201d\n\nHowever, a 2018 report from the United Nations says that the infamous hole in the ozone layer could be totally healed by the 2060s\u2014and in some areas of the world, it could be as soon as 2030.\n\nReprinted from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch the Heartwarming Moment Residents of Senior Home Sing \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 to Relatives From the Window", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-senior-home-residents-sing-que-sera-sera-to-relatives/", "date": "2020-3-26", "transcript": "This is the heartwarming moment that a group of English care home residents broke into song to entertain their visiting relatives who were listening from the other side of the facility\u2019s glass windows.\n\nThe footage from the Elizabeth House in Benfleet, Essex shows a dozen seniors with dementia singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as they wave bouquets of daffodils to their family members\u2014all while maintaining a safe social distance from opposite sides of the care home\u2019s window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lovely thing to see,\u201d said 52-year-old staff member Gill Petters. \u201cWe usually have singers in, but that is all on hold now what with the coronavirus.\n\nRELATED: Pop Star Grieving His Own Loss Helps 83-Year-Old Widower Check Off Bucket List After Wife\u2019s Death\n\n\u201cWe had to think of different ways to engage and entertain the residents so we set up a choir last week.

According to CNN, the mask design has already been downloaded from their website more than 2,000 times.\n\nSimilarly in Montana, Billings Clinic neurosurgeon Dusty Richardson developed a design for a reusable 3D-printed surgical mask so that he and his fellow community members could donate the masks to their local healthcare workers. He has also made the blueprints and assembly instructions available online for free so his fellow 3D-printing enthusiasts can make their own.\n\nThis is just one of many positive stories and updates that are coming out of the COVID-19 news coverage this week.

In North Carolina, a textile mill is gearing up to start making 10 million masks per week. A number of international fashion companies have also redirected their manufacturing teams to produce face masks as well.\n\nMultiple businesses and schools have donated their recently rediscovered face mask treasure troves to hospitals in need. Other major tech companies such as Facebook and Apple are donating millions of masks and medical supplies to US healthcare facilities. Chinese companies are passing on their own stashes of face masks to European countries newly impacted by the virus. Taiwan is reportedly donating 100,000 masks to the United States.\n\nEven medical TV shows have donated their medical supply props to North American hospitals in need.\n\n3) As American Cities Close Up Amidst Outbreaks, Pollution Plummets\n\nThe United States is now benefiting from the same environmental silver lining to the pandemics as China and Italy: as cities encourage self-isolation, air pollution is plummeting.\n\nOver the course of the last few weeks, satellite imaging has revealed significant reductions in air pollution\u2014particularly across California, Seattle, and New York City.\n\nAccording to CNN, environmental scientists are estimating that the improvement in air quality could collectively save as many as 75,000 people from dying prematurely.\n\n4) As Physicians Worry About Potential Ventilator Shortages, Researchers Develop Several Low-Cost Solutions\n\nIn a stroke of genius, one scientist from the University of Minnesota says he went \u201cfull-on MacGyver\u201d to build a makeshift ventilator in a matter of hours. Although his team has revised his design over the course of several prototypes with the hopes of eventually submitting it for FDA approval, he says that the inexpensive ventilator is one that he \u201cwould be comfortable with someone [using to] take care of me in an ICU or in an operating room.\u201d\n\nThe compassionate medical research continues in Italy as a pair of engineers have taken it upon themselves to 3D-print free respirator parts for their local hospitals. As of last week, the Isinnova startup engineers told Forbes that they had successfully printed more than 100 parts.\n\nMeanwhile, MIT scientists are publishing open-source instructions and research on how to build inexpensive ventilators.\n\n\u201cWe are releasing this material with the intent to provide those with the ability to make or manufacture ventilators, the tools needed to do so in a manner that seeks to ensure patient safety,\u201d they wrote. \u201cClinicians viewing this site can provide input and expertise and report on their efforts to help their patients.\u201d\n\n5) Communities and Countries Opening Up New Lanes of Free Entertainment for the Masses\n\nIn addition to Italians singing songs and playing music together from their balconies, homeowners have begun projecting classic films onto building fronts for the neighbors to enjoy.\n\nAs a means of keeping self-isolated people amused during global shutdowns, many online services have made their services free to the public as well.\n\nFor starters, Amazon has unlocked more than 40 new children\u2019s shows for all of their customers to watch for free, regardless of Prime membership. Audiobook platform Audible has also released a number of free audiobooks for users to stream from their devices.\n\n\u201cFor as long as schools are closed, we\u2019re open. Starting today, kids everywhere can instantly stream an incredible collection of stories, including titles across six different languages, that will help them continue dreaming, learning, and just being kids,\u201d reads the Audible website. \u201cAll stories are free to stream on your desktop, laptop, phone or tablet. Explore the collection, select a title and start listening.

Once we removed all the casino equipment and furniture from the casino area, that became another large vacant space, and then with any business we had an entire administrative area with cubicles and offices that became perfect for their offices to move in.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Finally, a Native Californian Tribe Has Land To Call Their Own\n\nAlong with Hollywood\u2019s enduring love of western films, Camel Rock and the Tesque Pueblo Nation are looking to take advantage of a filming boom in New Mexico, with recent successes behind shows like Breaking Bad luring more projects to the area.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t realize it but this area looks like a lot of places in the world\u2026especially the Middle-East, with the mountains and how rugged it is,\u201d Brown added, explaining the Tribe\u2019s thinking.\n\nNetflix even made Albuquerque its U.S. production hub, purchasing Albuquerque Studios as part of a plan to spend $100 million in filming and production for original material in the state over the next 10 years.\n\nMORE: One of Largest Native American Tribes Just Voted to End Their 100-Year Dependency on Coal\n\nPueblo of Tesuque Governor Robert Mora, Sr. said that he hopes the economic benefit from the studio will go toward much-needed healthcare projects for the Tribe, such as a universal coverage option.\n\n\u201cThe other thing I\u2019m hoping is that one of the big film companies will find a good home here so they\u2019re not searching for locations.

The bill moves to transition Virginia\u2019s energy economy to 100% renewables by 2050\u2014one of Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s campaign pledges.\n\nThe two affected power companies, Dominion Energy and American Electric Power, have until 2045 to retire electric generation powered by fuels that emit carbon dioxide as a byproduct.\n\nCompanies that fail to meet these 100% renewable timelines will have to pay a deficiency tax or purchase carbon offset certificates.\n\nRELATED: Scientists Develop Exciting New Way to Produce Hydrogen Fuel That\u2019s Safe, Cheap, and Ultra-Efficient\n\nTo try and safeguard workers from being laid off due to these deficiency costs, or to provide opportunities for workers who do lose their jobs, the VCEA would take some of the deficiency payments and deposit them into a fund that would finance new training programs for a renewable energy workforce for the modern grid.\n\n\u201cBeginning in 2026 and every three years thereafter, the Commission is required to adjust the required energy efficiency goals for the successive three years,\u201d reads the legislation. Efficiency is part of the VCEA plan to reduce power costs for middle and low-income houses in the state, which legislators hope will amount to $3,500 dollars in savings over 30 years.\n\nFurthermore, monthly rate caps of 6% for power will be placed on low-income earners and families as part of the Percentage of Income Payment Program that will help ensure the grid transition doesn\u2019t burn the pockets of Virginia\u2019s most financially vulnerable.\n\nLOOK: Toronto Garbage Trucks Will Soon Be Powered by Biogas From the Very Food Scraps That They Collect\n\nThe VCEA wants to expand consumer ownership and decentralization of the grid by encouraging more rooftop PV solar panels. This will help speed the transition to 100% renewable by reducing grid demands and increasing grid robustness.\n\nThe reason rooftop solar can contribute to these goals is by allowing homeowners to generate some of the power they need, while sending the rest into the grid. Each time a new house is powered by solar panels, more renewable energy is available to everyone else in the grid, representing something similar to the Social Security welfare system, but for electricity.\n\nCHECK OUT: California Governor Attacks Crisis of Homelessness by Donating Nearly 300 State-Owned Buildings For Shelters\n\nThis has the added benefit of increasing grid durability, since there will be many-fold more generators of power for plants to draw from decreasing the chance that things like natural disasters\u2014the 2011 Virginia earthquake, for example\u2014will topple the grid and knock out power for everyone.\n\nAccording to Lake Research Partners, 73% of Virginians want state lawmakers to move towards advanced energy investments outlined within the VCEA, and it makes good economic sense for the average family in one of the union\u2019s wealthiest states.\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch Resourceful Man Use Flying Drone to Walk His Dog During COVID-19 Lockdowns", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/man-uses-flying-drone-to-walk-his-dog-during-lockdowns/", "date": "2020-3-23", "transcript": "A particularly resourceful dog owner in Cyprus has come up with an ingenious way of walking his pup while still staying inside during the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nVakis Demetriou posted a video to Facebook last week depicting his happy canine companion taking a stroll through the streets of Limassol with his leash carried by a flying drone.\n\nSince Demetriou uploaded the video to social media last week, it has been viewed more than a million times.\n\nThe devoted dog dad hopes that his video will help to lift the spirits of internet users during the turbulence of the pandemic\u2014and remind people to stay home until the virus is under control.\n\n\u201cStay home safe,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut don\u2019t forget your dog\u2019s happiness\u2026\u201d\n\n(WATCH the video below)\n\nBe Sure And Share This Pawesome Story Of Ingenuity With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "From Terrifying to Terrific: Man Redesigns MRI Machine to Delight Children Instead of Scare Them", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/terrifying-terrific-man-redesigns-medical-machine-delight-children-instead-scare/", "date": "2020-3-20", "transcript": "Hospitals can be scary places for children to endure even without leaving the hallways\u2014those MRI scanners, however, could make it into a real nightmare.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging tests and CT scans require children to lie still on a metal bed for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, and the machines usually make loud noises that frighten young patients. Anywhere from 80 to 95% of patients under the age of nine require sedation in order to undergo the ordeal.\n\nFor industrial designer Doug Dietz, witnessing the trauma of the young patients was more than he could bear.

It tolerates drought and foot traffic from kids and volleyball games, without needing large amounts of fertilizer or much watering at all. It is thick and luscious, and it turns the color of straw in the winter.\n\nTherefore, if you want to save water and still keep your lawn healthy, select a species of grass native to your region, as they will be most resilient to changes in temperature and moisture.\n\nRELATED: Want to Help Bees? Leave the Dandelions Alone This Spring\n\nAlternatively, you can try planting grass species that evolved in regions that receive very little water. In Arizona, residents of Phoenix who prefer a green lawn use midiron grass or Bermuda grass species. The Arizona capital regularly sees temperatures in triple digits, and gets a measly 8 inches of rain a year so drought tolerant grasses help residents save water. Kentucky blue grass is another variety that\u2019s good\u2014especially for seasonal climates that also occasionally suffer droughts.\n\n2) Take advantage of the most biologically-diverse organisms in the US\u2014flowering plants.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to create a healthy garden that you don\u2019t have to water often, the U.S. has 18,000 species of native plants, 16,500 of which will flower during the year. Take advantage of this natural diversity and specialization and find which flowers are native to your area with a simple Google search.\n\nFlowering plants have evolved to deal with the challenges of the climate they live in, so not only will they be more resistant to local weather patterns, but more favorable to local species of bees and other pollinators!\n\n3) If you already have foreign plant species in your yard that need water, plant some trees!\n\nIn USDA-backed research looking at the limits of utilizing trees for energy efficiencies, researchers found that one large mature tree shading a house can have a \u201cnet cooling effect of 10 room-sized air conditioners operating 20 hours a day,\u201d and can save 20 to 50% of the energy used to cool your home. Furthermore, in winter the effect is much the same\u2014by dispersing chilly winds with its branches, large sheltering trees can help reduce your heating costs.\n\nCHECK OUT: After His Brother Gave Up Gardening, Man Designs Tabletop Gardens for People in Wheelchairs\n\nIf these shade tree benefits can be achieved on a home, why not also a garden? If the species you are growing in a pot or in your lawn do well in partial sunlight, consider shading them with a tree, the lack of evaporation from the sun\u2019s heat or from blustery winds will reduce the amount of water they lose.\n\n4) Get smart with your watering habits.\n\nSaving money and local water resources can be as easy as getting a little smarter with your lawn watering habits. For starters, avoid watering your lawn from 12 noon to 6 pm\u2014the hottest time of the day. Instead, get up around 6 to 8AM, or do so at night. This will prevent the water you use from drying out in the sun and wind.\n\nLOOK: No Green Thumb? This Adorable Planter Can Display Your Houseplant\u2019s Needs and Feelings on a Screen\n\nOther than that, adjust your sprinkler head so it doesn\u2019t hit the sidewalk, and mow your lawn often. Grass that\u2019s allowed to grow too tall begins to focus its energy elsewhere, resulting in stunted growth and room for weeds to grow. Finally, be careful not to over-water your lawn, as most only need 1 inch per week, spread over a 2-3 days.\n\n5) Collect the water that nature gives you.\n\nRather than always using the water that comes from the pipes, water that falls from the sky costs nothing and doesn\u2019t deplete any local aquifers. In an area where it does rain sparingly, purchase a rain barrel to collect rain that\u2019s not falling on your lawn or garden to water them with later.\n\nMany cities and counties will pay you to buy a rain barrel or simply distribute one for you if you ask. Check your local regulations and see if they have a rain barrel program. If they offer you a rebate or tax credit for purchasing one go out and buy a pressurized rain barrel system with a cistern or other cool features\u2014it\u2019s on the state\u2019s dime anyway.\n\n6) Install a drip irrigation system.\n\nThis kind of delivery mechanism for your lawn irrigates the roots of the grass directly, rather than relying on the water to come down through the earth. Less water therefore is needed to nourish your lawn because less is wasted from evaporation. While you could hire a contractor to install a drip irrigation system, it makes for an interesting DIY project over a weekend.\n\nPlant These Helpful Hints on Your Friends With Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch These Self-Isolating Seniors Stave Off Boredom by Playing Life-Sized \u2018Hungry, Hungry Hippos\u2019", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-seniors-play-real-life-hungry-hungry-hippos/", "date": "2020-3-24", "transcript": "As a means of staving off self-isolation boredom, these delighted seniors and their nursing home caretakers played a game of real-life Hungry, Hungry Hippos.\n\nIn a video that was published by the Bryn Celyn Care Home in Maesteg, Wales last week, four elderly women in wheelchairs were filmed giggling away as they were rolled around a room similarly to the classic children\u2019s game.\n\nLOOK: Two-Legged Dog Named \u2018Lieutenant Dan\u2019 is Vying to Be the Next Cadbury Bunny\n\nInstead of using hippo mouths to capture the plastic balls, however, the women brandished baskets on sticks\u2014and the results are pretty amusing.\n\n\u201cResidents really enjoyed playing a new game today: Hungry Hippos.

These deep root systems also secure the soil and prevent erosion which can degrade local waterways and shorelines.\n\nThe forests will also provide habitat for endangered iconic Welsh animals, like the black grouse, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel, and the magnificent capercaillie.\n\n\u201cThe National Forest will be a Wales-wide asset, and communities across the country will be able to take part,\u201d said Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government Hannah Blythyn.\n\nThe inspiration for the project was drawn from a hiking trail that attracts millions of tourists every year called the Wales Coast Path\u2014and the maps will be drawn up over the coming months by businesses, landowners, and other interested parties.\n\nRELATED: Epic New 3,700 Mile Trail Across America Will Allow Cyclists and Hikers to Travel From Coast to Coast\n\n\u00a35 million ($5.7 million) has been allocated to complete the project, while another \u00a310 million will go towards accompanied tree-planting programs through the Glastir farm grants program.\n\nThe Glastir Grants are one of a number of pieces of legislation meant to put a stop to diminishing natural wilderness, resources, and wildlife in the country while also attempting to modernize the agricultural sector in the face of a changing climate.\n\nFarmers can apply for Glastir grants if they undertake tree-planting operations, or projects that prevent flooding, secure and regenerate soil quality or wildlife, or improve the farming and husbandry standards for domesticated animals and plants\u2014and even when they restore heritage tourism opportunities.\n\nRELATED: Scientists Use Recycled Sewage Water to Grow 500-Acre Forest in the Middle of Egyptian Desert\n\nGetting Underway\n\nMr. Drakeford visited Gnoll Country Park in Neath, where the UK\u2019s Woodland Trust is currently creating the largest new woodland in the charity\u2019s history called the Brynau Wood, saying it will be an \u201camazing place for people to enjoy healthy outdoor exercise\u201d as well as a mark towards a \u201chealthier, more resilient environment\u201d.\n\nThis is just one of a handful of large-scale projects aimed at restoring or protecting Welsh wilderness. Last week, work began on planting 1 million seagrass seeds off the Welsh coast in order to restore Welsh seagrass beds\u2014a coastal marine plant that soaks up many times more carbon than trees.\n\n\u201cWhile the plan to create a National Forest for Wales is a Welsh government initiative, the Woodland Trust is very much in support of this,\u201d Rory Francis, Communications Officer at Woodland Trust told GNN. \u201cWe were actually working to promote the idea even before the Welsh government and the First Minister personally, adopted the idea.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Man Succeeds Where Government Fails\u2014He Planted a Forest in the Middle of a Cold Desert\n\nBrynau Wood is not Woodland Trust\u2019s first foray into Welsh forests.

But for up to 20% of people with the tick-borne illness, the antibiotics don\u2019t work, and lingering symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue and cognitive impairment can continue for years\u2014sometimes indefinitely.\n\nA new Stanford Medicine study in lab dishes and mice provides evidence that the drug azlocillin completely kills off the disease-causing bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi at the onset of the illness. The study suggests it could also be effective for treating patients infected with drug-tolerant bacteria that may cause lingering symptoms.\n\n\u201cThis compound is just amazing,\u201d said Dr. Jayakumar Rajadas, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory at the Stanford School of Medicine. \u201cIt clears the infection without a lot of side effects. We are hoping to repurpose it as an oral treatment for Lyme disease.\u201d\n\nRajadas is the senior author of the study, which was published online earlier this month in Scientific Reports. The lead author is research associate Dr. Venkata Raveendra Pothineni.\n\nRELATED: THC Holds Promise As Possible First-of-Kind Treatment for Women With Endometriosis: Study\n\n\u201cWe have been screening potential drugs for six years,\u201d Pothineni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve screened almost 8,000 chemical compounds. We have tested 50 molecules in the dish. The most effective and safest molecules were tested in animal models. Along the way, I\u2019ve met many people suffering with this horrible, lingering disease. Our main goal is to find the best compound for treating patients and stop this disease.\u201d\n\nFrustrated by the lack of treatment options for Lyme disease patients with lingering symptoms, Rajadas and his team began hunting for a better alternative in 2011. In 2016, they published a study in Drug Design, Development and Therapy that listed 20 chemical compounds, from about 4,000, that were most effective at killing the infection in mice. All 20 had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for various uses. One, for instance, is used to treat alcohol abuse disorder.\n\nIn this most recent study, azlocillin, one of the top-20 contenders, was shown to eclipse a total of 7,450 compounds because it is more effective in killing B. burgdorferi and causes fewer side effects.\n\nMORE: Molecule Combo Actually Reverses Arthritis in Human Cartilage and Rats, Says \u2018Exciting\u2019 New Study\n\nLyme disease affects more than 300,000 people annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can affect various organs, including the brain, skin, heart, joints and nervous system, and cause heart problems and arthritis if untreated. Symptoms include fever, headaches, chills, and muscle and joint pain.\n\nTraditional antibiotics, such as doxycycline, are effective as an early course of treatment for the infection in the majority of patients, but it remains unclear why these drugs fail to treat 10% to 20% of patients, Rajadas said.\n\n\u201cSome researchers think this may be due to drug-tolerant bacteria living in the body and continuing to cause disease,\u201d said Rajadas, who is also a member of the Lyme Disease Working Group at Stanford. \u201cOthers believe it\u2019s an immune disorder caused by bacteria during the first exposure, which causes a perpetual inflammation condition. Whatever the cause, the pain for patients is still very real.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Simple Type-2 Diabetes Treatment With Low Calorie Diet is So Effective, It Reverses the Disease in Studies\n\nThe drug, which is not on the market, was tested in mouse models of Lyme disease at seven-day, 14-day and 21-day intervals and found to eliminate the infection. For the first time, azlocillin was also shown to be effective in killing drug-tolerant forms of B. burgdorferi in lab dishes, indicating that it may work as a therapy for lingering symptoms of Lyme disease.\n\nPothineni and Rajadas have patented the compound for the treatment of Lyme disease and are working with a company to develop an oral form of the drug. Researchers plan to conduct a clinical trial.\n\nThe study was funded by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation and Laurel STEM Fund.\n\nReprinted from Stanford University\n\nCure Your Friends Of Negativity By Sharing The Good News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Businesses Are Giving Away All Their Excess Toilet Paper to People in Need During COVID-19 Shutdowns", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/businesses-giving-away-toilet-paper-during-covid-shutdowns/", "date": "2020-3-19", "transcript": "As supermarket shelves around the world are cleared of hand sanitizer and toilet paper amidst the COVID-19 outbreaks, businesses are taking it upon themselves to share their wealth with community members in need.\n\nAtlanta-based marketing firm Trevelino/Keller is just one of many companies that have temporarily closed down during the quarantine.

Because of that, our top media outlets have been incentivized to publish the most triggering aspects of society.\n\nFor a long time, I strayed away from the news. Not because I didn\u2019t want to be informed\u2014I did. I just really couldn\u2019t stand waking up every day to the worst aspects of the world.\n\nRecently, though, I decided to dive back in head-first and start publishing a 10 minute daily news segment on my podcast.\n\nI wanted to offer an alternative dialogue\u2014not just by sharing uplifting stories, but by also going head-first into current events and still coming out with inspiring and empowering perspectives.\n\nRELATED: How the Animals All Around You Can Help You Love Your Life\n\nI won\u2019t lie.

So I kept going.\n\nAround Week 3, I sat in meditation and had a huge realization: \u201cIt\u2019s not NEW. It\u2019s AWARENESS.\u201d\n\nThat one idea shifted everything for me.\n\nMORE: 10 Things I Wish I Would Have Told My Kids\n\nLet me back up a bit, and I\u2019ll explain what that means and why this was such a huge shift for me. Back in college, when I used to watch, read, or listen to the news, I\u2019d be overcome with sadness at the state of the world. I\u2019d think, \u201cHow could this be happening? We should be further along than this.\u201d\n\nBut recently, with further reflection on ideas like, \u201cAll suffering is simply arguing with reality,\u201d I decided to attempt to re-enter the news with that perspective. I hoped to stay empowered and full by setting the intention of complete acceptance of all of it.\n\nIf everything in the news is truly a part of the world we live in, I saw an opportunity to increase my capacity to be with that reality\u2014and accept it.\n\nLOOK: 27-Year-old With Terminal Cancer Pens Heartfelt Letter on Why You Should Change Your Life\n\nThat\u2019s where I began the journey, but as I mentioned, after just a couple of weeks, I was already feeling drained and having trouble finding that place of acceptance.\n\nThen came this idea in meditation: \u201cThe news isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s awareness.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when it all clicked into place.\n\nI had trouble accepting the news when I believed it was all happening suddenly out of nowhere. I unconsciously believed something like, \u201cEverything was great, but now there\u2019s this atrocity that\u2019s happening! Can I do anything about it?

That little shift of perspective altered the way I viewed everything that came across my screen. And as many have come to see in the spiritual and transformational spaces\u2026 awareness is the first step to change.\n\nWhen we understand a limiting belief or personal habit, we have the power to make changes and face it head-on. We can change it.\n\nThat means\u2026\n\nAll the articles I was reading (even and especially those highlighting the worst aspects of the world) were actually signs that we were ready to shift and deal with these things as a collective.\n\nRELATED: Meditation and Mindfulness Tips to Combat Everyday Worries and Life\u2019s Big Questions\n\nHuge scandals, the rejection of basic human rights, articles about climate change and nuclear threats\u2014it was all ready to be seen in a new light.

Why was looking at the world any different?\n\nThe news is awareness. It\u2019s the global spotlight of awareness shining on everything that\u2019s ready to be transmuted into a newer, higher truth. From that higher vantage point, there was nothing I couldn\u2019t deal with.\n\nI found myself happy to see attention drawn to challenging global crises, because I knew how many other people were seeing it too.

The world is here, whether or not we report on it or see it.\n\nInstead, these articles represent the very awareness that transmutes the shadows to the light.

Our findings show that the success of stem cell transplantation as a cure for HIV, first reported nine years ago in the Berlin patient, can be replicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk, and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies,\u201d he added. \u201cTherefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful antiretroviral treatment.\u201d\n\nWhile most HIV patients can manage the virus with current treatment options and have the possibility of living a long and healthy life, experimental research of this kind following patients who have undergone high-risk, last-resort curative treatments, can provide insight into how a more widely applicable cure might be developed in the future.\n\nMORE: After Her Years of Research, a Cambridge Scientist Could Be on the Verge of Curing Multiple Sclerosis\n\nIn 2011, another patient based in Berlin (the \u201cBerlin patient\u201d) was the first HIV patient to be reported cured of the virus three and half years after undergoing similar treatment. Their treatment included total body irradiation, two rounds of stem cell transplant from a donor who carried a gene that is resistant to HIV, and a chemotherapy drug regimen. The transplant aims to make the virus unable to replicate in the patient\u2019s body by replacing the patient\u2019s immune cells with those of the donors, whilst the body irradiation and chemotherapy targets any residual HIV virus.\n\nThe patient reported in this study (the \u201cLondon patient\u201d), underwent one stem-cell transplantation, a reduced-intensity chemotherapy drug regimen, without whole body irradiation. In 2019, it was reported that their HIV was in remission, and this study provides follow-up viral load blood test results at 30-months and a modeling analysis to predict the chances of viral re-emergence.\n\nUltrasensitive viral load sampling from the London patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid, intestinal tissue, or lymphoid tissue was taken at 29 months after interruption of ART and viral load sampling of their blood at 30 months. At 29 months, CD4 cell count (indicators of immune system health and stem cell transplantation success) was measured, and the extent to which the patient\u2019s immune cells have been replaced by those derived from the transplant.\n\nResults showed no active viral infection was detected in samples of the patient\u2019s blood at 30 months, or in their cerebrospinal fluid, semen, intestinal tissue, and lymphoid tissue 29 months after stopping ART.\n\nWATCH: He Was Called Foolish for His Research; Now Documentary Tells How He Won Nobel Prize for \u2018Cancer Cure\u2019\n\nThe patient had a healthy CD4 cell count, suggesting they have recovered well from the transplant, with their CD4 cells replaced by cells derived from the HIV-resistant transplanted stem cells.\n\nFurthermore, 99% of the patient\u2019s immune cells were derived from the donor\u2019s stem cells, indicating the stem-cell transplant had been successful.\n\nSince it was not possible to measure proportion of cells derived from the donor\u2019s stem cells in all parts of the patient\u2019s body (i.e. measurement was not possible in some tissue cells like lymph nodes), the authors used a modeling analysis to predict the probability of cure based on two possible scenarios. If 80% of patient\u2019s cells are derived from the transplant, the probability of cure is predicted at 98%; whereas if they have 90% donor derived cells, they predict a 99% probability of cure.\n\nMORE: First Sickle Cell Disease Patient Treated With Gene-Edited Cells Experiences Significant Improvement\n\nComparing to the treatment used on the Berlin patient, the authors highlight that their case study of the London patient represents a step towards a less intensive treatment approach, showing that the long-term remission of HIV can be achieved using reduced intensity drug regimens, with one stem cell transplant (rather than two) and without total body irradiation.\n\nHowever, being only the second reported patient to undergo this experimental treatment successfully, the authors note that that the London patient will need continued, but much less frequent, monitoring for re-emergence of the virus.\n\nThat being said, the London patient\u2014Adam Castillejo\u2014has gone public with his identity in hopes that he can be a positive role model for other people living with HIV.\n\nReprinted from The Lancet\n\nDoing my best to try and embrace my new path as an Ambassador of Hope @londonpatient https://t.co/OZSQb2dWM5 \u2014 Londonpatient_HOPE (@londonpatient) March 9, 2020\n\nCure Your Friends Of Negativity By Sharing The Good News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "18-Year-Old Drove 225 Miles to Make Pizzeria\u2019s First and Only Delivery After Receiving Special Phone Call", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teen-makes-pizzerias-one-and-only-delivery-for-a-hospice-patient-225-miles-away/", "date": "2020-3-12", "transcript": "Reposted on #ThrowbackThursday, in case you missed it\u2026\n\nAn 18-year-old pizzeria worker was praised for going above and beyond the call of duty after he broke the restaurant\u2019s take-out rule to deliver a pizza to a family\u2019s home three and a half hours away.\n\nJulie and Rich Morgan had been reminiscing about the legendary pies that are served up at Steve\u2019s Pizza place in Battle Creek, Michigan. It had been 25 years since the couple lived in the city, but despite the distance, the fabled restaurant still set the bar for the perfect slice of pizza.\n\n\u201cWe were young and money was tight, but every pay day, Rich would pick up Steve\u2019s Pizza for dinner,\u201d Julie wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly describe how delicious this pizza is\u2014but several moves and all these years later, it is still the gold standard and we\u2019ve never found a better pizza yet.

However, these risks seem paradoxical. For humans, evolutionary pressures favor conserving energy. Spending a lot of time sitting would seem to accomplish that goal. So, why should sitting be so harmful?\n\nMORE: Never Too Late\u2014New Study Finds Lungs \u2018Magically\u2019 Repair Themselves After Quitting Smoking, No Matter the Age\n\nThe USC-led team has shown that resting postures used before the invention of chairs\u2014like squatting and kneeling\u2014may hold the answer, as they involve higher levels of muscle activity then chair-sitting. These more active rest postures may help protect people from the harmful effects of inactivity.\n\n\u201cWe tend to think human physiology is adapted to the conditions in which we evolved,\u201d said David Raichlen, a professor of biological sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. \u201cSo, we assumed that if inactivity is harmful, our evolutionary history would not have included much time spent sitting the way we do today.\u201d\n\nThe study was published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHow you rest matters\n\nTo better understand the evolution of sedentary behaviors, the scientists studied inactivity in a group of Tanzanian hunter-gatherers, the Hadza, who have a lifestyle that is similar in some ways with how humans lived in the past.\n\nFor the study, Hadza participants wore devices that measured physical activity and periods of rest. The scientists found that they had high levels of physical activity\u2014over three times as much as the 22 minutes per day advised by U.S. federal health guidelines.\n\nBut the scientists also found that they had high levels of inactivity.\n\nIn fact, the Hadza are sedentary for about as much time\u2014around 9 to 10 hours per day\u2014as humans in more developed countries. However, they appear to lack the markers of chronic diseases that are associated, in industrialized societies, with long periods of sitting. The reason for this disconnect may lie in how they rest.\n\nRELATED: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\n\u201cEven though there were long periods of inactivity, one of the key differences we noticed is that the Hadza are often resting in postures that require their muscles to maintain light levels of activity\u2014either in a squat or kneeling,\u201d Raichlen said.\n\nIn addition to tracking activity and inactivity, the researchers used specialized equipment to measure muscle activity in the lower limbs in different resting postures. Squatting involved more muscle activity compared to sitting.\n\nThe researchers suggested that because the Hadza squat and kneel and have high levels of movement when not at rest, they may have more consistent muscle activity throughout the day. This could reduce the health risks associated with sedentary behavior.\n\n\u201cBeing a couch potato\u2014or even sitting in an office chair\u2014requires less muscle activity than squatting or kneeling,\u201d Raichlen said. \u201cSince light levels of muscle activity require fuel, which generally means burning fats, then squatting and kneeling postures may not be as harmful as sitting in chairs.\u201d\n\nIn developed countries, humans spend inactive periods sitting on their duffs in chairs, recliners or sofas, so the only time they activate their leg muscles is when they bend their knees to slide into the seat. On average, people in more industrialized societies, including the United States and Europe, spend about nine hours per day sitting.\n\n\u201cPreferences or behaviors that conserve energy have been key to our species\u2019 evolutionary success,\u201d said Brian Wood, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has worked with the Hazda people for 16 years. \u201cBut when environments change rapidly, these same preferences can lead to less optimal outcomes. Prolonged sitting is one example.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Keep Your Eyes in Good Shape With These 4 Simple Ocular Stretches for Computer Users\n\nThe scientists dubbed this the \u201cInactivity Mismatch Hypothesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cReplacing chair sitting and associated muscular inactivity with more sustained active rest postures may represent a behavioral paradigm that should be explored in future experimental work,\u201d they wrote. Resolving this inactivity mismatch with our evolutionary past could pay off in better health today.\n\n\u201cSquatting is not a likely alternative,\u201d Raichlen said, \u201cbut spending more time in postures that at least require some low-level muscle activity could be good for our health.\u201d\n\nReprinted from University of Southern California\n\nBe Sure And Share The Intriguing Health News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "This Athlete Could Become the First American Amputee to Compete in the Olympics", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/he-could-become-first-american-amputee-to-compete-in-olympics/", "date": "2020-3-12", "transcript": "Blake Leeper has never let his lack of legs prevent him from pursuing his passion for sports\u2014and now, he is fighting to become the first American amputee to participate in the Olympics.\n\nSince Leeper discovered his passion for track and field in college, he has gone on to become a Paralympic champion and international silver- and bronze-medalist.\n\nDespite these achievements the 30-year-old double amputee has been denied a chance to compete for Team USA in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes because the World Athletics ruled that his prosthetic running blades gave him an unfair advantage over his competitors.\n\nRELATED: He Built His Own Prosthetic Out of LEGOS and Hopes to Provide Cheap Solutions for Others Who Need a Hand\n\nHowever, Leeper will not be deterred\u2014he has filed for an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to let him compete.\n\n\u201cWorld Athletics\u2019s decision to bar me from participating in the World Championships was a blow to all disabled athletes, but I will not be deterred.

When salt marshes, shallow water seagrass beds, river estuaries, and tidal zones are healthy, these delicate ecosystems work like the tiles of a mosaic to create the picture of resilient seas and shores.\n\nBut, the losses of the crucial seagrass piece is coming to a head in Wales, where Dr. Richard Unsworth of Swansea University, unnerved by the annual decline of 7% in seagrass beds around the UK and Ireland, has worked to organize a massive replanting effort along the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly productive and just sucks carbon into the sediments, traps particles that are locked there for millennia,\u201d Dr. Unsworth told BBC. \u201cThat means that carbon dioxide is not in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Whales Feces Represent One of the Greatest Allies Against Climate Change\u2014Even More Than Trees\n\nAccording to WWF\u2019s article 10 Reasons to Hope, seagrass can capture carbon 35 times faster than even tropical rainforests, but as it currently covers merely 0.2% of the seafloor, the potential to use more seagrass as a carbon offset is unlimited.\n\nIn preparation for this undertaking, 750,000 seagrass seeds were collected from various meadows around the UK last summer and stored in the laboratory at Swansea University.\n\nThose seeds were transferred into small pouches sewn together from natural materials, and work has begun on lowering these seeds down onto the ocean floor off the coast of Dale Fort to create a 20,000-square-meter meadow (5 acres).\n\nLOOK: You Can Now \u2018Reforest the Oceans\u2019 One Online Search at a Time Thanks to This New Search Engine\n\nSeagrass is also imperative as a haven for wildlife, providing shelter, food, and a place to raise young for all kinds of marine species\u2014as a video from the BBC demonstrates. Seagrass also acts as a nursery for important fish stocks like cod and pollock, and prevents seafloor erosion from storm surges.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Unsworth stressed the need for hundreds of thousands of acres of seagrass beds, salt marshes, and other coastal ecosystems because of the unique potential they have for tackling local, regional, and\u2014inevitably\u2014global environmental concerns, and for self-cleaning the seas themselves.\n\nPlant Some Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "CDC Director Commits to Free Coronavirus Testing for Anyone in the US Regardless of Insurance", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/us-congresswoman-secures-confirmation-for-free-coronavirus-testing/", "date": "2020-3-13", "transcript": "In a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday, a congresswoman managed to secure a verbal confirmation from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that he would use his power under law to make coronavirus testing free for all Americans.\n\nRep.

An alternative to this is to store the energy generated from the sun during the day in batteries, but along with representing a serious recycling problem, batteries require rare-earth minerals that are obtained from environmentally-destructive mining operations.\n\n\u201cBatteries are very expensive to store power for a 24 hour period,\u201d says Jonas Eklind, CEO of Azelio, the Swedish energy startup that has potentially solved this problem for good. \u201cIf you want to store a lot of renewable energy, the most cost efficient way of storing this is thermal energy.\u201d\n\nIn the always forward-thinking countries of Scandinavia, Azelio adapted an old Volvo assembly line factory to manufacture their patented, industry-first thermal energy storage system that will allow people to keep the energy that their standard PV solar panels generate during the day so they can use it in evenings.\n\nAnd, instead of the critical energy storage component using rare and expensive minerals, the Azelio system uses recycled aluminum, which emits nothing, is much cheaper than lithium, and\u2014as Jonas joked during an interview with GNN\u2014\u201conly lasts 62,000 years.\u201d\n\nMolten Aluminum can Save the Earth\n\nThe former CEO of a battery company, Jonas helped start this remarkable energy storage project in 2016 when he came onboard, around the same time Azelio was looking into thermal storage technology.\n\nLOOK: New Power Plant Doubles as a Ski Slope and Climbing Wall (and Turns Waste into Energy)\n\n\u201cWhen we started the project, we had a conversion unit that converts high temperatures into electricity,\u201d he said. This device was called a Stirling Generator, and at first they would use biogas from landfills, water purification units\u2014or from manure in a combustion engine to generate electricity\u2014but after running numerous computer simulations on cost and energy capacity, determined that aluminum was the best choice.\n\nPhotons absorbed by solar panels on your roof enter into the system where an aluminum alloy is heated so it moves from a solid to a liquid. This allows for the storage of an incredibly dense amount of energy within the material which can be sent as heat into the Stirling Generator and turned into electricity on demand, with zero emissions and at a lower cost.\n\nThis is in direct contrast to fossil fuels, uranium rods or pellets, or diesel fuel, because the energy in the aluminum can constantly be melted and hardened again to produce or store energy.\n\nWith its high energy density, the material has the ability to store energy for an extended period of time, while the aluminum suffers no degradation in capacity over time.\n\nCHECK OUT: Working in Secret, Bill Gates-Backed Solar Company Reveals Tech That Could Spell the End of Fossil Fuels\n\nVersatile yet Stable\n\nThe technology would prove to be ideal in parts of the world where grid reliability is low, like in Southern Africa where Jonas estimates that people only have access to a stable power grid 45% of the time.\n\nAzelio\u2019s thermal storage would allow for people to implement solar into a community, an industry, or just their homes, to defend against failing or unreliable grids, which Jonas says is becoming more and more normal even in the developed world. In his home country of Sweden, during the long winter, trees knock out power all the time, forcing rural communities to switch to diesel generators or similar interventions\u2014sometimes for weeks.\n\nWATCH: After 5 Years of Drought, Kenyan Region Finally Gets Clean Water Thanks to Solar-Powered Saltwater Plant\n\n\u201cOur system can give you decentralized power based on solar and wind so you can build a local micro-grid that provides you with almost everything you need 24 hours a day,\u201d said Jonas.\n\nAnd one of the really exceptional things about Azelio\u2019s system is that, in theory, it\u2019s as scalable as necessary; from 100 kilowatts per-hour, up to 100 megawatts per-hour, and more. Though it is maximized for solar power, it can easily work the same way for tidal or hydropower, biofuels, and wind.\n\nMost city or town grids are split up into multiple components that feed off of, support, and borrow from one another to remain stable. Like normal solar power that utilizes energy from from the sun and sells the excess into the grid before later buying back from the grid at nighttime, Azelio\u2019s thermal storage can fit into the baseload power of a modern established grid as much or as little as is required\u2014whether that\u2019s 10% of total power needs or 90%.\n\nLOOK: Three-Story \u2018Water Battery\u2019 Has Already Slashed University\u2019s Electrical Costs By 40% in One Month\n\nAzelio is conducting three verification tests this year\u2014first, in their home country of Sweden, and two others in partnership with renewable energy companies. On March 5th, they inaugurated their thermal storage technology at the massive Noor solar power complex in Morocco, teaming up with Masen, and later this year, they will launch in Abu Dhabi with Masdar. In addition to these, Azelio has received various customer enquiries of a potential value in excess of 16 billion euro, including one customer in California who wants the system both for wind and solar energy.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, with what we have promised to the market for the cost of electricity coming out of the system, we can possibly compete with large scale installations where we need to power a whole city.\u201d\n\nPower Up Your Social Media Feed With Positivity \u2014 SHARE it\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "They\u2019re Fixing The World\u2019s Plastic Problem Using \u2018The Milkman\u2019 Concept \u2013 With All Your Favorite Products", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/fixing-the-worlds-plastic-problem-using-the-milkman-concept/", "date": "2020-3-11", "transcript": "For several generations of young Americans, the idea of a \u2018milkman\u2019 is a completely foreign concept.

Researchers like Dr. David Sinclair, Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Dr. Eric Verdin, and others have catapulted the field from one that was secondary to other lifespan-focused fields like those dedicated to helping reduce cancer or diabetes, into one of the most exciting and interdisciplinary areas of study today.\n\nSo far, the ever-expanding research into longevity has yielded a shopping list of benefits\u2014from limiting age-related decline in the eyes, to reducing all-cause mortality.\n\nAlong with research into simple lifestyle interventions like sleep, exercise, and sauna use, certain specific nutritional elements, notably a select few known as \u201cNAD+ boosters,\u201d are being looked at and now commercially sold, as a potentially effective treatment for a condition that\u2019s very old but also very new: aging.\n\nCHECK OUT: When Blueberries and Grapes Are Combined, a Dramatic Decline in Memory Loss and Aging \u2013 Study\n\nNAD+ boosters, like nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), as well as the compound resveratrol\u2014produced in plants, notably red grapes, during periods of stress\u2014can now all be purchased in supplement form commercially.\n\nWhat might a longevity supplement do for you? We know it has shown a variety of benefits in scientific studies of both humans and rodents.\n\nNicotinamide riboside\n\nOf all the NAD+ boosters\u2014compounds which either convert directly into, or contribute in some way to the process of creating the nutritional element\u2014nicotinamide riboside (NR) has been the most extensively studied, mostly in animals.\n\nIn one study, mice who were fed a diet high in both sugar and fat in order to quickly create obesity, gained less body fat and demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity when taking an orally-administered dose of NR.\n\nMORE: Plant Compounds Used to Successfully Treat Alzheimer\u2019s in Mice Now Shown to Prevent Other Effects of Aging\n\nMice receiving the same size dose of NR as the obesity study (400mg per kilo of bodyweight) were also found in another study to have reversed mitochondrial damage and increased mitochondrial biogenesis, the process through which mitochondria are created.\n\nFinally, benefits to the brain from NR supplementation were also confirmed in rodents, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and reduced beta-amyloid build up in the brain, which is a strong indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\n\n\u201cWhether taking nicotinamide riboside will have the same effects on delaying aging or improving mitochondrial function in humans as it does in animals is unknown,\u201d writes longevity expert Dr. Rhonda Patrick on her blog. \u201cHowever, when people with type 2 diabetes took a nicotinic acid derivative (an NAD+ precursor), they exhibited improvements in mitochondrial function in their skeletal muscle as well as increased NAD+ levels in their muscles.\u201d\n\nLOOK: Keep Your Eyes in Good Shape With These 4 Simple Ocular Stretches for Computer Users\n\nNicotinamide mononucleotide\n\nWhile not studied as thoroughly as NR, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has also been shown to reduce some effects produced by aging.\n\nIn separate mouse studies, injections of 500mg per kilo of bodyweight were found to have beneficial effects in countering symptoms of obesity, particularly in improving insulin sensitivity and NAD+ levels in the liver and muscle, and also several markers of cardiovascular disease related to dysfunction of the heart.\n\nMORE: Never Too Late\u2014New Study Finds Lungs \u2018Magically\u2019 Repair Themselves After Quitting Smoking, No Matter the Age\n\nAs we age, levels of NAD+ decrease in tissues over time, which experts believe is a key factor in age-related decline in the muscles, heart, brain, liver, and other organs.\n\nStarting at 5 months of age, one mouse cohort was split into two groups and fed a diet that included 100 and 300 mg per kilo of bodyweight of NMN for 12 months respectively.\n\n\u201cThe mice that were fed nicotinamide mononucleotide had improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure, increased bone density and decreased insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner,\u201d writes Rhonda. (Dose dependency refers to the amount of NMN consumed relating to the gravitas of the observed effect.)\n\nFor instance in the case of the mouse cohort, 100mg of NMN in the diet resulted in a 4% reduction in age-associated weight gain, while the 300mg group experienced a 9% reduction. Remarkably, it was also shown to increase or fortify energy metabolism, eye function, insulin sensitivity, while reducing age associated gene expression.\n\nResveratrol\n\nShort of your bartender explaining to you why this or that particular bottle of red wine is good for your heart, resveratrol is only recently beginning to be explored as a potential longevity compound. It exists in the seeds, fruits, skins, leaves, stems, and other parts of a variety of plants, and is created during periods of stress on the plant.\n\nThis is why red wine is noted as having heart-healthy or antioxidant effects on the body. During the winemaking process, the stressed parts of the grape confer resveratrol into the beverage, however it\u2019s likely negligible amounts.\n\nIn a study where healthy individuals were given a 6-week course of 40mg of resveratrol derived from the extract of a plant called Japanese knotweed, multiple anti-inflammatory effects were observed. Reductions in pro-inflammatory markers such as cytokines TNF-Alpha and IL-6, as well as the concentrations of oxidants were noted after the trial.\n\nRELATED: Training for Your First Marathon \u2018Reverses\u2019 Aging of Major Blood Vessels on Par With Medication\n\nIL-6 and TNF-Alpha contribute significantly to declines associated with aging, with TNF-Alpha being correlated with possibly every disease known to man.\n\nThe most significant way in which resveratrol acts to improve longevity is through sirtuin activation. World at Large reported in January: \u201cSirtuins use NAD+ to control the genes involved in some of the most critical systems in our biology including energy metabolism, circadian rhythms, autophagy, DNA repair, and cell survival\u2026\u201d\n\nSirtuins play a role in insulin release, lipid mobilization, stress responses, and lifespan modulation, and mimic many of the beneficial effects observed in calorie-restriction, another longevity-based field of research. Dr. Patrick explains on her website how caloric restriction has been widely-shown to increase healthspan and lifespan in organisms from bacteria to primates.\n\nMORE: Managing Your Gut Bacteria Shown to Alleviate Anxiety, Says New Research\n\nA study in Nature involving yeast showed that \u201cresveratrol mimics calorie restriction by stimulating sirtuin-2, increasing DNA stability and extending lifespan by 70%.\u201d\n\nTaking resveratrol in supplement form must be done with a little more application than other supplements. Dr. Patrick has collected much of the resveratrol research on her website, including how the bioavailability of resveratrol was shown to be higher with a moderate fat breakfast than with a high fat breakfast and how resveratrol is safe in humans in doses as high as 5 grams.\n\nFinally, in a conversation between Dr. Patrick and Harvard Professor of Genetics Dr. David Sinclair, the latter recommends the storing of resveratrol in a cold dark environment at all times.\n\nContinue exploring this topic \u2014 Maybe You\u2019ve Heard of NAD+: Here\u2019s Why it\u2019s Important and Why Everyone\u2019s Talking About It\n\nTell Your Friends to Live Longer by Sharing This On Social Media!", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch the Adorable Moment a Little Girl in Star Wars Costume Gets to Meet Her Hero BB-8 Droid in Real Life", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-girl-in-bb8-costume-meet-droid-in-real-life/", "date": "2020-3-11", "transcript": "A little girl\u2019s determination to wear her BB-8 costume to a theme park earned her some celebrity friends.

The approach involves tiny muscle grafts and machine learning algorithms borrowed from the brain-machine interface field.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest advance in motor control for people with amputations in many years,\u201d said Paul Cederna, who is the Robert Oneal Collegiate Professor of Plastic Surgery at the U-M Medical School, as well as a professor of biomedical engineering.\n\n\u201cWe have developed a technique to provide individual finger control of prosthetic devices using the nerves in a patient\u2019s residual limb. With it, we have been able to provide some of the most advanced prosthetic control that the world has seen.\u201d\n\nLOOK: Teen Can Return to School After Undergoing Free Surgery to Correct Her Extreme Bow-Leggedness\n\nCederna co-leads the research with Cindy Chestek, associate professor of biomedical engineering at the U-M College of Engineering. In a paper published this week in Science Translational Medicine, they describe results with four study participants using the Mobius Bionics LUKE arm.\n\nIntuitive prosthetic control works on the first try\n\n\u201cYou can make a prosthetic hand do a lot of things, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the person is intuitively controlling it. The difference is when it works on the first try just by thinking about it, and that\u2019s what our approach offers,\u201d Chestek said. \u201cThis worked the very first time we tried it. There\u2019s no learning for the participants. All of the learning happens in our algorithms. That\u2019s different from other approaches.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: After Watching Brother Give Up on Gardening, Man Designs Tabletop Gardens for People in Wheelchairs\n\nWhile study participants aren\u2019t yet allowed to take the arm home, in the lab, they were able to pick up blocks with a pincer grasp; move their thumb in a continuous motion, rather than have to choose from two positions; lift spherically shaped objects; and even play in a version of Rock, Paper, Scissors called Rock, Paper, Pliers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you have a hand again,\u201d said study participant Joe Hamilton, who lost his arm in a fireworks accident in 2013. \u201cYou can pretty much do anything you can do with a real hand with that hand. It brings you back to a sense of normalcy.\u201d\n\nTurning a tiny muscle graft into a nerve signal amplifier\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in mind-controlled prosthetics is tapping into a strong and stable nerve signal to feed the bionic limb. Some research groups\u2014those working in the brain-machine interface field\u2014go all the way to the primary source, the brain. This is necessary when working with people who are paralyzed. But it\u2019s invasive and high-risk.\n\nFor people with amputations, peripheral nerves\u2014the network that fans out from the brain and spinal cord\u2014have been interesting, but they hadn\u2019t yet led to a long-term solution for a couple of reasons: The nerve signals they carry are small. And other approaches to picking up those signals involved probes that eavesdropped by force. These \u201cnails in nerves,\u201d as researchers sometimes refer to them, lead to scar tissue, which muddles that already faint signal over time.\n\nThe U-M team came up with a better way. They wrapped tiny muscle grafts around the nerve endings in the participants\u2019 arms. These \u201cregenerative peripheral nerve interfaces,\u201d or RPNIs, offer severed nerves new tissue to latch on to. This prevents the growth of nerve masses called neuromas that lead to phantom limb pain. And it gives the nerves a megaphone. The muscle grafts amplify the nerve signals. Two patients had electrodes implanted in their muscle grafts, and the electrodes were able to record these nerve signals and pass them on to a prosthetic hand in real time.\n\nMORE: Father Uses Scuba Therapy to Restore His Paralyzed Son\u2019s Motor Function\u2014And Now It\u2019s Doing the Same for Others\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, we\u2019ve seen the largest voltage recorded from a nerve compared to all previous results,\u201d Chestek said. \u201cIn previous approaches, you might get 5 microvolts or 50 microvolts\u2014very very small signals. We\u2019ve seen the first ever millivolt signals.\n\n\u201cSo now we can access the signals associated with individual thumb movement, multidegree of freedom thumb movement, individual fingers. This opens up a whole new world for people who are upper limb prosthesis users.\u201d\n\nAnd their interface has already lasted years. Others degrade within months due to scar tissue.\n\nThe future of prosthetics research and industry\n\nThe findings also open up new possibilities for the field, said Chestek, whose expertise is on real-time machine learning algorithms to translate neural signals into movement intent.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is now the nerve signals are good enough to apply the whole world of things we learned in brain control algorithms to nerve control,\u201d she said.\n\nWATCH: Blind Man Develops Smart Cane That Uses Google Maps and Sensors to Identify One\u2019s Surroundings\n\nThe approach generates signals for finer movements than what today\u2019s prosthetic hands are capable of.\n\n\u201cOther research groups have contributed to this as well, but we\u2019ve leapfrogged the capabilities of the prosthetic hands that are currently available. I think this is strong motivation for further developments from prosthetic hand companies,\u201d said Philip Vu, a research fellow in biomedical engineering and first author of the paper.\n\nA clinical trial is ongoing. The team is looking for participants.\n\n\u201cSo many times, the things we do in a research lab add to the knowledge in the field, but you never actually get a chance to see how that impacts a person,\u201d Cederna said. \u201cWhen you can sit and watch one person with a prosthetic device do something that was unthinkable 10 years ago, it is so gratifying. I\u2019m so happy for our participants, and even more happy for all the people in the future that this will help.\u201d\n\nChestek added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a ways from here, but we\u2019re not going to stop working on this until we can completely restore able-bodied hand movements. That\u2019s the dream of neuroprosthetics.\u201d\n\nReprinted from University of Michigan\n\n(WATCH the video below)\n\nGive Your Friends A Hand; Share This Inspiring News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "These Stunning Images Show What \u2018Work\u2019 Means to Photographers Around the World", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/work2020-agora-photo-competition-finalists/", "date": "2020-3-10", "transcript": "Welcome!

By providing fast and flexible funding at key stages of the development process, the Accelerator will de-risk the pathway for new drugs and biologics for COVID-19 and future epidemic threats, ensuring access in lower-resource countries.\n\nThe COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will operate jointly as an initiative of the funders, drawing on expertise from inside and outside their organizations, and will also pursue several aspects of the development cycle to streamline the pathway from candidate product to clinical assessment, use, and manufacturing.\n\nTo identify candidate compounds, the Accelerator will take a three-pronged approach: testing approved drugs for activity against COVID-19, screening libraries of thousands of compounds with confirmed safety data, and considering new investigational compounds and monoclonal antibodies. Drugs or monoclonal antibodies that pass initial screening would then be developed by an industry partner.\n\nRELATED: Husband-Wife Duo Has Developed \u2018Gene and Cell Therapy\u2019 Cancer Vaccine Now Being Tested on Patients\n\nThe biotech and pharmaceutical industries will be critical partners, bringing their compound libraries and clinical data to the collaboration and lending commercialization and other expertise that will be required to scale up successful drugs and monoclonal antibodies. In parallel to the development of the COVID-19 drug pipeline, the Accelerator will work with regulators to align criteria and develop manufacturing capacity with industry. An accelerated pathway to bringing effective treatments to patients is around one year for products that have current regulatory approval or candidates with existing clinical data. The timeline would be longer for compounds further upstream in the pipeline that have limited existing clinical data.\n\nDr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome said: \u201cScience is moving at a phenomenal pace against COVID-19, but to get ahead of this epidemic we need greater investment and to ensure research co-ordination.

Guy Robertson from Penguin, in the state\u2019s north-west, has turned his business over to deliveries after losing all of almost his usual sales at traditional farmers\u2019 markets and festivals, restaurants and in on-farm experiences overnight because of the COVID-19 outbreak. \u201cThe first week was the sleepless week,\u201d Mr Robertson said. \u201cThen we realised we could put everything online.\u201d The Mount Gnomon Farm website was born \u2013 and Mr Robertson is now busy selling meat, vegetables, and fruit online, as well as products from other local artisan producers. But it was a post on social media that landed him in hot water with the French. He has been including in-season rhubarb in his produce boxes, and suggested anyone who had too much should treat themselves, as he had, by brewing some homemade rhubarb bubbly, which he termed champagne. A couple of days later, he answered the phone to a French official. \u201cIn the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action about the farm\u2019s production of rhubarb champagne,\u201d Mr Robertson wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cI never thought that 10 litres of rhubarb cordial for our own consumption would be on the radar in France.\u201d  Yesterday in the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action\u2026 Posted by Mount Gnomon Farm on\u00a0Monday, April 6, 2020 The French official told Mr Robertson that organisations such as the Comit\u00e9 Champagne protect and promote the Champagne brand. \u201cHe was a really nice guy, he said: \u2018I know it\u2019s a really bad time around the world at the moment, but our legal team takes it very seriously\u2019,\u201d Mr Robertson told ABC Radio. \u201cHe said he has been doing it for three years and it\u2019s his job to make sure everyone complies and nobody markets their bubbles as champagne unless you come from the Champagne region in France. \u201cIt was a funny moment for me, I just couldn\u2019t believe I had a call from France in the current climate about 10 litres of home brew that we aren\u2019t even marketing.\u201d Apparently, among Mount Gnomon Farm\u2019s thousands of social media fans is a French person, who was concerned by Mr Robertson\u2019s post.

It\u2019s a view endorsed in at least two Australian states. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said the Easter Bunny fitted into the same category as health care workers, military personnel, transport and freight specialists, and MPs, and would be allowed to get on with his job despite the island state\u2019s strict coronavirus travel bans. \u201cI\u2019ve actually had a number of emails \u2026 one from a delightful young fellow whose brother was taken out of school [and had to] self-isolate because he had an underlying health condition,\u201d he told the Nine Network. \u201cHe wrote to me, an eight-year-old \u2026 wanting to know whether or not the Easter Bunny would come. \u201cIt\u2019s my personal view, based on a discussion with Public Health [Services] \u2026 that the Easter Bunny can be classed as an essential traveller and therefore will be in the state over Easter and able to deliver Easter eggs.\u201d It\u2019s a similar situation in Western Australia \u2013 which has closed its borders to try to halt the spread of the virus. Premier Mark McGowan said he\u2019d also been hit up by concerned kids \u2013 and had decided to allow the Easter Bunny free travel throughout the state.

Most of the surrounding cattle stations were now in lockdown \u2013 so he had little choice but to take to the skies to keep the locals in high spirits. \u201cNobody can go anywhere, they\u2019re limited to how they get their supplies and refreshments,\u201d Mr Frost said. \u201cWe thought we might do something to help them out a little bit. \u201cWe make pizzas at Dunmarra roadhouse anyway, so we thought we would get all the pizzas together and see if they were interested, if we can fly them out, so they don\u2019t have to leave the properties.\u201d Hot food and alcohol has already been delivered to stations within a 100 kilometre radius of the roadhouse, with plans to extend the once-a-week service to properties up to 400 kilometres away.

That\u2019s if you believe search engine overlord Google, which is apparently hitting pass on the trickery of April 1, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The revelation came via a leaked email from Google\u2019s chief marketing officer Lorraine Twohill, to all staff saying pranks would be put on hold this year as the platform has more important duties \u2013 like keeping the searching masses informed on the most relevant COVID-19 information. Seems legit, but only time will tell. Usually, April 1 is fraught with danger for the general public and the media. News outlet inboxes are flooded with \u2018clever\u2019 pitches from PR companies, trying to trick over-tired, unwitting journalists into running their brand name in headlines. Apparently this year, we can just be our gullible selves, no need to be on high alert. In lieu of any trickery, here\u2019s a round-up of some of the best (and most outlandish) April Fools Day pranks we\u2019ve seen in Australia over the years. It\u2019s a shame Google isn\u2019t (allegedly) participating this year \u2013 the company is pretty much the undisputed king of pranks.  About a decade ago, Google announced it was getting involved in the AFL, launching a partnership for the gBall: An AFL ball built-in with the best of Google\u2019s tech, to measure location, accuracy and torque of every kick. You could download all this data and more, to keep improving your game. Sounds like every budding Gary Ablett\u2019s dream, right? Google probably tipped the joke over the edge when it claimed the gBall shared its intel with scouting agents. If they were interested and wanted to contact the ball owner, the ball would buzz. National icon Vegemite got us good in 2015, when it announced a Big Vegemite was being erected in Melbourne. Have you heard? Something BIG is coming to Melbourne in the shape of a 60m tall interactive Vegemite jar. Who's keen? pic.twitter.com/86N7Fsjepo \u2014 Vegemite (@Vegemite) March 31, 2015 What made this prank more memorable was that it caught out pop culture news site pedestrian.tv, which not only ran with the pitch, but broke the embargo to get it out first. Thankfully they\u2019re a funny bunch, and took it on the chin. This served as a lesson for media outlets around the country for the next few years. The media of old knew how to prank. Without the sharp minds of the internet ruining everything with one tweet, news outlets could get hours of mileage out of their April 1 exploits. ABC program\u00a0This Day Tonight\u00a0 ran a harmless yet humorous trick in 1975, when it made the declaration Australia would be converting to metric time. What\u2019s metric time? According to the program, there would now be 100 seconds per minute, 100 minutes per hour, and 20-hour days. Seconds were now to be referred to as millidays, minutes centidays and hours decidays. Then deputy premier of South Australia Des Corcoran gave the report more weight by praising the new time system on the broadcast. It was topped off by rendered images of the Adelaide town hall displaying a metric time face. Boom-tish. Virgin Money Australia proved you don\u2019t have to go all out to get a launch.  In 2005 it announced it was launching scratch \u2018n\u2019 sniff credit cards, which Australians could travel with overseas and rub a little nail on when they wanted to be reminded of home. The cards\u2019 scent was barbecued sausages. Dick Smith cemented himself in Aussie lore in 1978 with his monumental prank. For weeks, he\u2019d been advertising that he was going to tow an iceberg all the way from Antarctica into Sydney Harbour. Why? He\u2019s an entrepreneur. He was going to park it next to the Opera House and chip off small wedges to passersby, selling them for 10 cents a piece. The \u2018Dicksicles\u2019 would improve the flavour of whatever beverage they were added to. And lo, April 1 sprung. There was Dick Smith towing his promised iceberg. The public went wild. The press were stirred into a frenzy. And then the heavens opened. The \u2018Dickenberg 1\u2019 began to melt and was revealed for what it really was: A layer of shaving cream and firefighting foam over a structure of plastic sheets. Dick Smith said afterwards he was pretty happy with the prank \u2013 it only cost him $1450 to pull off."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Why this cat\u2019s hiding place is confusing all of the internet | The New Daily", "date": "2020-3-26", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/03/26/hiding-cat-toys-bed/", "transcript": "Meet Obi the cat.

Both Beenleigh Rum Distillery and Bundaberg Rum Distillery are using existing production lines and staff to make the hard-to-come-by liquid. Queensland Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning Cameron Dick thanked the distilleries for stepping into the breach to supply sanitiser to schools and frontline workers. Australian cricket great Shane Warne halted production of gin at the SevenZeroEight distillery that he co-owns to make medical-grade hand sanitiser for hospitals. \u201cThis is a challenging time for Australians and we all need to do what we can to help our healthcare system combat this disease and save lives,\u201d Warne said on his Instagram page. Tasmanian gin distillery, Southern Wild, says it is ready to shift its entire business to a not-for profit producer of hand-sanitiser-for-schools if it gets the go ahead from the state government. Southern Wild owner George Burgess on Friday said the company was well positioned to begin making sanitiser immediately. The Bellarine Brewing Co in Victoria says it is ready and able to start producing hand sanitisers, and is hoping the Australian Taxation Office can fast track the required permit. Brewing Co director Tim Page-Walker told News Corp the move would allow the business to keep afloat, provide work for its local casual staff, and also assist the community so desperate to find hand sanitisers as supermarket shelves are stripped by selfish hoarders. The developments come as US distilleries have also switched to making the alcohol-based disinfectant. Pennsylvania\u2019s Eight Oaks Farm Distillery filled its first 20 bottles on Monday, according to The Associated Press, sending the batch to charitable groups that get hand sanitiser due to the coronavirus pandemic. The family-owned distillery reportedly plans to dramatically boost production as it distributes the bottles to charities, offers them at farmers\u2019 markets where it sells its alcohol, and via its website. \u201cWe are in a national emergency,\u201d brewery founder Chad Butters, was quoted as saying by AP. \u201cWhat\u2019s the right thing to do? The right thing to do is support this community by providing something that is in desperate need. We\u2019ll flood the valley with hand sanitiser and drive that price right down.\u201d Green Mountain Distillers in Vermont is giving away a hand sanitising solution, while North Carolina\u2019s Durham Distillery is donating a solution to hospitality colleagues.

I discovered last year I am an extrovert. My best friend \u2013 a psychologist \u2013 snorted when I told her I\u2019d only just worked this out. I thrive on having a calendar chock full of social engagements where I can swill wine with my friends, throw my arms around them and speak utter dross for hours on end. I always, always feel connected. The pub is my spiritual home. So solo isolation is not working out well. I\u2019m cooking meals for myself and I\u2019ve discovered it\u2019s hair-tearingly boring. Cooking is only fun when it\u2019s shared: if you cook a good meal and another soul doesn\u2019t get to appreciate it, did it actually happen? I guess that\u2019s the question Instagram has been answering since it began. Even though it hasn\u2019t been long since I started flying solo I\u2019ve been oddly emotional. Obviously the constant stream of doomsday news isn\u2019t helping. The internet \u2013 that singular tool for telling ourselves we\u2019re connected \u2013 is only serving to add to the turmoil. Waves of sadness and emptiness and disconnection roll and crash throughout the interminably long days. But I pull myself out by reminding myself that this is (hopefully) temporary, and maybe this spell will be good for me. I might finally do some of the chores that have been on my to-do list for the past decade. Like get on that ancestry website and see if I have some wildly fascinating heritage. Or go online and do that thing where you try and find your missing superannuation. The only time I\u2019m really allowing myself out of the house is taking walks around the park. Yesterday I saw a man in his 80s doing a slow shuffling jog and I instantly burst into tears. Standing next to the empty football fields I was overcome by the realisation that this sense of loneliness I\u2019ve felt for all of five minutes is something so many in our ageing community experience on a daily basis. And it\u2019s not just the elderly. There are young widows and bullied teens and people with crippling anxiety and folks working remotely who battle loneliness on a daily basis. Hell, you don\u2019t have to be part of a certain subgroup. There was this guy who lived by himself in the building where I used to live in Sydney. Coming and going, he was always there, determined to grab me for a chat. And, of course, I\u2019d avoid him \u2013 duck out a different way, keep my head down, sneak away \u2013 because I thought he was odd (and I was usually rushing off to hang with my gang). But now I think about how obviously lonely he was, how little he was asking for, and I feel absolutely gutted. Social isolation and loneliness are a huge problem in Australia. The impact it has on both mental and physical health is well documented. In fact, it\u2019s been identified as a \u201csignificant public health and wellbeing\u201d issue.

Thankfully, in this unusual time, people are stepping up their game to check on one another. Group Skype calls are being organised. My mate organised a virtual disco where people could dance \u201ctogether\u201d in their loungerooms. People are baking banana muffins to drop on neighbour\u2019s doorsteps (in this oddly resourceful time people are finally using those brown bananas in the back of the freezer \u2026 aren\u2019t *they* having a moment?) lots of grim stuff out there but there's never been a better time to be a black banana in a freezer. black bananas in freezers are actually going to get USED in BAKING this month instead of thrown out in a year and it's their TIME to SHINE \u2014 Caitlin Welsh (@Caitlin_Welsh) March 17, 2020 All this is a beautiful thing. How heartening that when there\u2019s a crisis, we step up. But what about when social isolation is no longer a hot topic? What about the people for whom loneliness is their everyday reality? My fear is we\u2019ll just go back to business as usual. That period where we nearly gave ourselves an aneurism stifling a sneeze on a packed train and genuinely washed our hands (instead of just turning on the tap so people didn\u2019t think we\u2019re gross) will just become the stuff of nostalgic anecdotes. So I am making this deal with whichever deity is currently drunk at the wheel: on the other side of this whole thing, when physical distancing is a lonely memory, I\u2019ll do regular volunteer work with The Red Cross companionship and social support program. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Glad you asked. Basically they pair you with someone in the community who is lonely and socially isolated. You visit for a cup of tea, go on an outing, chat on the phone, or go for a walk. It\u2019s for older people who have few social connections, people with a disability, or people recovering from mental illness. I mean, look at the photo they use to illustrate the program. The stuffed toys in the cabinet. The joy on the face of the lady with the nice beaded necklace. Stick a fork in me, I\u2019m done. I am not announcing this to make myself look like a top sort. I\u2019m writing it here because it\u2019s the kind of promise I\u2019ll make in my head, and when the pub is open again I\u2019ll dance off gaily into the sunshine and forget the deal I made. Writing it in public makes me accountable. I\u2019ve had but the tiniest taste of loneliness, and the impact leaves me breathless. How lucky that when we come out the other side, most of us will have people to reconnect with. Not everybody is that lucky.

Re-creating a cinema experience with your friends is a tough one, but here\u2019s where Netflix is stepping in. Netflix Party is a Google Chrome extension you add for free to your laptop or desktop computer. It allows you to choose a movie and watch it in sync with friends remotely. You can add a group chat so there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to swoon over Ryan Reynolds in 6 Underground, laugh and cry with Taylor Swift doco Miss Americana or get old retro belly laughs with Ghostbusters. Cinemas are still open, but many film companies are starting to send new releases straight to streaming services, which means you can host your own \u2018premieres\u2019. There\u2019s no better way to shake off global doom and gloom than by shaking your booty! First up, create a collaborative playlist with your friends using music streaming service Spotify. Share the playlist with your mates via a web link and everyone can add their own tunes. It\u2019s a mixtape, baby! Next up, set the time and date and then hook up your dance buddies via Skype. It\u2019s been around since the Spanish flu (OK, maybe not that long) but Skype never lets you down \u2014 unless you have relatives who say \u2018I can hear you but I can\u2019t see you\u2019 a lot. Make sure everyone has an account, add them to the call and then hit the dial button. One of you can have the collaborative list playing through their laptop and everyone else can pump up the volume. Let\u2019s get literary, people. Gather your read-a-holic friends and support small book retailers by ordering the same book online. Give yourselves time to read it, then gather around your devices for the Great Discussion. Zoom is a super-popular cloud-based meeting platform for corporate meetings, webinars and training \u2014 and it\u2019s being appropriated for social gatherings too. You can join in a chat via desktop, laptop or smartphone (or big screen if you can airplay it to your telly) and have online chats with the group as well or private chats with some people on the call. The only limitation is a 40-minute window for free use, so make your meeting quick or schedule one after the other. The free version of the app allows unlimited meetings. What better time to be sampling the great wines on offer from around Australia (and delivered straight to your door) via well-established companies including Vino Mofo, Tipple, Jimmy Bring, Naked Wines and, of course, your local wine store. Gather your purchases, slice up some cheese and launch Facetime! Use the app for Group FaceTime sessions if you have iOS 12.1.4 on the iPhone 6s or later and for iPadOS on the iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, or iPad (5th generation) or later. Simply open the app and add up to 31 contacts, then start your call. However, the FaceTime app is only available for Apple cult members, so if your crew includes an Android user or two, switch to Facebook Messenger, which can now handle up to 50 guests at one time. Simply create a group of winos, er, friends who appreciate a good drop, then hit the video button. Messenger\u2019s filters can add a whole new level of hilarity. If you have wifi it\u2019s free, otherwise the vid chat may eat into your phone\u2019s data. If your company has directed you to work from home, the ol\u2019 5pm pub gatherings on a Friday are a bit trickier to coordinate. Many corporations use Slack, the darling of communications apps on the market. Slack introduced video chats for its paid plans which means 15 or more people can jump in on a call once work is done and take turns in sharing their screens. The feature allows team members to draw on each other\u2019s screens too \u2014 we\u2019re thinking you could get pretty creative with party games!"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Welcome to Coping With COVID-19 | The New Daily", "date": "2020-3-20", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/03/20/welcome-to-coping-with-covid-19/", "transcript": "We at The New Daily have always been mindful of our responsibility\u00a0 to offer readers a balanced of news and analysis that is not only informative or entertaining, but useful.

Venice has been struggling with a high volume of tourism in recent years and recently banned large cruise ships from docking in the canals, in an attempt to preserve the city\u2019s infrastructure. But since the drastic reduction of water traffic and tourism, residents have observed the usually muddy canals run with bright, clearer water with swarms of fishes and the canal bottom clearly visible. \u201cThere are no boats, there is no traffic. Definitely, it is cleaner,\u201d Venice resident Serguei Michtchenko said. However, while it may look nicer, the city\u2019s mayor\u2019s office told CNN that the improved water visibility does not mean the water quality improved. \u201cIt\u2019s because there is less boat traffic, [which] usually brings sediment to the top of the water\u2019s surface,\u201d a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CNN air quality in the city has improved due to the lockdown. Several decades have passed since Venetians were used to swimming in the lagoon water, due to the intensified ferryboats and motorboats traffic in the canals and the increasing volume of commercial and tourist ships stopping at the Venice Passenger Terminal. The coronavirus shutdown is the latest problem the unique lagoon city had to deal with after it was\u00a0hit by its worst flooding in 50 years in November. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Coronavirus good deeds: Kindness acts and heartwarming scenes", "date": "2020-3-18", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2020/03/18/coronavirus-good-deeds-italy/", "transcript": "It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the panic and fear being fuelled by the coronavirus outbreak, but there\u2019s a wave of good deeds and positivity that\u2019s keeping the sickness at bay.

The village of Rappville, south of Casino, was hit by a firestorm in October that destroyed 15 homes, and is in the buffer area of the newly formed cane toad biosecurity zone. Tamar Cohen, of the Border Ranges Richmond Valley Landcare Network, said the community needed to work together to eradicate the feral amphibians that could travel as far as a kilometre in one night. \u201cBurnt land makes it easier for toads to travel as they\u2019re basically lazy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen a bushfire comes through and it clears out a lot of the undergrowth and logs, we\u2019re finding that cane toads can move much quicker through those landscapes. \u201cSo the concern with Rappville, as with other towns impacted by the bushfires, is that cane toads can now move in much easier than before.\u201d Ms Cohen said the toads picked easy pathways, such as roads and mowed lawns, but found it difficult to move through natural vegetation because they were not good jumpers. Ms Cohen said cane toads had been found on properties near the Richmond Range National Park. This was causing concern because the national park was one of the few remaining forests in the area that had not been destroyed by the fires and was home to threatened species that were vulnerable to cane toads. \u201cWe\u2019ve got native frogs and small reptiles that are already struggling to survive, so we don\u2019t want them killed by the poisonous cane toads,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first thing property owners see with cane toad invasions is dead red-belly black snakes, dead pythons and dead freshwater turtle species.\u201d A special Rappville team has been established to control the pests and Sydney dog trainer Steve Austin has been using his English springer spaniels, Tommy and Becky, along with cocker spaniel Emma, to help hunt them out. \u201cThe dogs have a high degree of hunting ability,\u201d Mr Austin said. \u201cThey can find the toads by scent and stand and point with their nose to alert me they are there. \u201cAll three dogs are conservation dogs, which means they have been trained in a passive response. \u201cThey stop and stare at their catch, but do not hurt it.\u201d Like many Rappville locals, Cathy Cook is upset many native species were lost in the bushfires. She believed any remaining species must be protected. \u201cEveryone is spewing about losing the natives but when the first lot of rain came, the first thing you heard was a bloody cane toad,\u201d Ms Cook said. \u201cThere were millions of cane toad eggs in our dam and that was two weeks between the rain \u2013 so I was armed with my butterfly net to get them.\u201d Ms Cook was concerned the toads would also move into Bungawalbin and Whiporie. \u201cWe\u2019ve built our place for native birds and we have a lot of native flowers and trees,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also look after our dams for the native frogs to live in. \u201cI love hearing the native frogs croaking away in summer and then you hear \u2018brrrr\u2019 start up amongst it all, and it\u2019s like \u2018You weren\u2019t invited, toads, so go away\u2019.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Family accidentally buys 2300 toilet rolls prior to national panic", "date": "2020-3-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/03/06/family-mass-toilet-rolls/", "transcript": "This is what 12 years\u2019 worth of toilet paper looks like. Toowoomba\u2019s Janetzki family have thousands of rolls of Australia\u2019s most sought-after product, after mistakenly ordering 48 boxes of 48 rolls instead of their usual box of 48 rolls from online delivery service Who Gives A Crap. They received 2304 rolls and were charged $3264 instead of $68, something that went unnoticed until the two-pallet order showed up on their doorstep days later. The family estimate it is enough to last them 12 years. The accidental hoarders made the purchase in early February, weeks before fears relating to coronavirus sent the country into a toilet paper-buying frenzy. Now, they\u2019ve got more toilet paper than most supermarkets have on the shelves. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a while to live down,\u201d said Haidee Janetzki, who placed the order. \u201cWe\u2019ve told our three daughters that if we\u2019ve still got all this toilet paper when they get married this is what they\u2019ll have as their wedding decorations.\u201d The Janetzkis have been ordering one box of 48 rolls every 12 weeks for the past two years. After Christmas, they decided to change product and set up a new subscription. \u201cIt asked for the quantity and I wrote 48 thinking I want a box with 48 rolls in it,\u201d Ms Janetzki said. \u201cA couple of days later, I got an email saying the order was on the way, and that was all good. \u201cOn a Monday there was a knock at the door at it was the courier. He said, \u2018I\u2019ve got two pallets of toilet paper for you.\u2019 \u201cWe checked the credit card statement to try to figure out what\u2019d gone wrong and turned out I\u2019d ordered 48 boxes, so it was legitimately my mistake.\u201d Ms Janetzki said she had paid off her credit card the day prior to being charged, and only checks her statement once a fortnight. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t notice there was a large amount on the card and it didn\u2019t max it out,\u201d she said. Husband Chris Janetzki said he could not quite believe the size of their order. \u201cAt the time I thought, \u2018Holy crap,'\u201d he said. Little did they, or anyone, know that weeks later a toilet paper shortage would make national headlines. Both Woolworths and Coles have limited the amount of toilet paper rolls customers can buy. Toilet paper manufacturers have also ramped up production to meet demand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that people have been mass-buying toilet paper like that. I still don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Mr Janetzki said. \u201cI\u2019m a pastor of a church and so a friend said, \u2018How prophetic are you to be able to see the future and know there was going to be a toilet paper shortage?\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a laugh out of it for a while.\u201d Unable to contact the online-only company via phone, the Janetzkis had no choice but to accept the delivery. The Janetzkis eventually sent off an urgent email about their unusual purchase and the company responded with an offer to take back the unwanted boxes. But by that time, the family had come up with a cunning plan. The family is now selling their excess toilet paper to help raise money for their daughter\u2019s school. Ms Janetzki said she jokingly offered up the toilet paper as a fundraising initiative for the school\u2019s trip to Sydney and Canberra later this year. Days later it was a go. \u201cLots of people we know offered to buy them off us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting lots of jokes though now. Every other order form I\u2019ve put in for other fundraisers people have said, \u2018Just check the quantity, make sure she\u2019s ordering just one, pie not one box of pies.'\u201d WGAC has also refunded $400 in postage for the boxes, which the Janetzkis have put towards their daughter\u2019s trip. \u201cIt really has worked out for the best for us in the end,\u201d Ms Janetzki said. While they wait for stock to sell out, the family have been having fun with it \u2013 building a wall in their garage, and then a throne in their lounge room. A spokeswoman for WGAC confirmed the Janetzkis\u2019 story. \u201cHaidee and Chris were so patient about this situation. I can\u2019t even imagine what it would have been like to have a whole pallet of toilet paper turn up at my front door,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cI can imagine there\u2019d be some folks around Australia this week who wouldn\u2019t mind it right about now.\u201d The spokeswoman said the company was unable to check all orders manually. \u201cWhen we were a smaller business, we\u2019d run manual checks twice a day on all the orders we received and a mistake like this would usually jump out during that process,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThen we\u2019d reach out to the customer before sending the order to the warehouse to make sure it was correct before shipping. \u201cBut as the business has grown up, we\u2019ve had to automate how we process orders.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Delighted residents welcome return of Darling River after three dry years", "date": "2020-3-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/03/06/darling-river-flowing-2020/", "transcript": "After a three-year wait, the community of Wilcannia in far-western New South Wales is celebrating substantial Darling (Baaka) River flows.

I want to fly Quaden and his mother to America, get them a nice hotel, and bring them to Disneyland\u201d. However, Quaden\u2019s Aunty Mundanara Bayles told NITV News that \u201cwhile it\u2019s a touching example of goodwill, the family will skip the all-expenses paid trip as they want to focus on the bigger issues at play\u201d. \u201cWhat kid wouldn\u2019t want to go to Disneyland, especially if you have lived Quaden\u2019s life. To escape to anywhere that is fun that doesn\u2019t remind him of his day to day challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my sister said \u2018you know what, let\u2019s get back to the real issue\u2019. This little fella has been bullied. How many suicides, black or white, in our society have happened due to bullying.\u201d \u201cWe want the money to go to community organisations that really need it. They know what the money should be spent on, So as much as we want to go to Disneyland, I think our community would far off benefit from that.\u201d \u201cWe need to come together and work out how to make sure young people like Quaden don\u2019t have to deal with what they have been dealing with,\u201d Ms Bayles said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had seven kids at the Murri School in Brisbane, where I am on the board, take their lives in the last ten years,\u201d she told NITV News. Mr Williams announced on Friday that about $100,000 will be donated to six local charities with the remainder going towards \u201ca fund for future medical and support expenses for Quaden\u201d. The charities Born This Way Foundation, STOMP Out Bullying, Dolly\u2019s Dream, Dwarfism Awareness Australia, Gallang Place and Balunu Healing Foundation are the likely recipients. The rest of the crowdfunding will go towards direct medical help, education, accommodation costs, food to feed the family, and for donating to any additional charities of their choosing. \u201cI have been in close communication with Quaden\u2019s family and fully respect their needs and the needs of Australian First Nations people who are experiencing bullying and discrimination at extremely high rates. \u201cBecause of this, I\u2019ve decided that the donations will be best served going to charities focused on helping individuals affected by bullying and discrimination,\u201d he wrote.  Meanwhile, Yarraka Bayles is pushing for a new law called Quaden\u2019s Law to be introduced into state and national school curriculums. \u201cWe discussed a care plan for Quaden if/when he chooses to return to school, or when we feel the time is right. We are working with the school to introduce an educational tools for schools package around disability awareness, diversity and inclusion,\u201d she told NITV. \u201cIt went okay \u2026 They were all very supportive in helping to move forward.\u201d Since Quaden\u2019s story, he has gone from despair to \u201chigh spirits\u201d as the family continued to just get on with their lives, according to Ms Bayles. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit overwhelming but we are doing good considering. It\u2019s pretty full on but we are strong enough to get through especially with all the mobs support and unconditional love,\u201d she told NITV News. \u201cQuaden is ok. He is spinning out a bit, we just have to protect our boy as best we can. We\u2019ve got a good team around us now.\u201d His Aunty said: \u201cHe\u2019s just an amazing kid that\u2019s larger than life.\u201d -with agencies"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "'Senate has voted to wish the baboons well': Runaway primate gets snip", "date": "2020-2-27", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/02/27/runaway-baboon-snip-senate/", "transcript": "A baboon that was on his way to a vasectomy when he and his two female companions escaped a Sydney hospital has had the big snip \u2013 and a mention in the Senate.

It was later revealed they were from the National Health and Medical Research Council facility in Wallacia, about 50 kilometres away in Western Sydney. According to Humane Research Australia, there were 272 primates used in medical research in the country in 2017. Of those, 165 were in NSW. Research at the lab has been used to tackle priority medical issues identified by the federal government, including diabetes, kidney disease and complications arising from pregnancy. Professor Annemarie Hennessy, a senior adviser at the facility, said the animals lived in an environment that resembled their natural habitat. \u201cThey would have been completely terrified outside their comfort zone in a world they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said of their escape on Tuesday. She said the facility had used baboons in \u201cimportant biomedical research\u201d in Australia for at least 30 years \u2013 justified only when there was \u201cno alternative\u201d. Mr Hazzard said the baboons were part of research programs that covered a whole range of health issues. When the program has finished with them, they are returned to their colony. NSW Police had earlier said there was no immediate danger to the public but people were advised to avoid the area. Footage shared on social media showed three baboons running in the car park as people took surprised double-takes. Animal activist and former GP Kevin Coleman said the primates\u2019 escape was a \u201cmajor concern\u201d that could raise biosecurity issues. \u201cIf an animal the size of a baboon can escape, how many mice have escaped? How many other animals have escaped,\u201d he asked. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know and this is the problem.

In the first officially recorded appearance of a live Bulwer\u2019s petrel in Australia, the bird \u2013 nicknamed Buggerlugs \u2013 is thought to have been blown south by adverse weather. He might even be an undiscovered species. He was found on the balcony of the Cronulla RSL, and later dug in his claws when two attempts were made by well-meaning wildlife carers to release him onto the chilly waters off Sydney. Ornithologist Lindsay Smith from the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association in Wollongong said Buggerlugs was a long way from home. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have ID so couldn\u2019t get a drink,\u201d he said of the appearance at the RSL. When Buggerlugs was identified as a Bulwer\u2019s petrel, the international birding community became excited. \u201cTo release Buggerlugs here off Wollongong would be like releasing it in the desert,\u201d Mr Smith said. Instead, Buggerlugs was fattened up with southern bluefin tuna (at $130 per kilo), wombaroo, insectivore mix and sea water. Money was raised and tickets booked to take Buggerlugs to Darwin on a scheduled commercial flight. He was checked into the luggage compartment like any other pet, and was in the Larrakia Nation Rangers\u2019 boat Mardma within an hour of arriving in Darwin on February 14. Rangers battled an outgoing tide of only two metres and unpredictable wet-season winds to get Buggerlugs back into a hospitable environment as quickly as possible. Larrakia Nation Land and Sea ranger Javadd Andersen said it was anything but hospitable for humans. \u201cIt was very rough and we had a lot of swell coming over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t head out too far because we had a bit of water coming over the front deck and we decided not to push ourselves too far.\u201d Damien Stanioch from NT Parks and Wildlife was also on board. \u201cThe conditions were ideal for the bird \u2013 a good strong headwind and fairly choppy, so he could use the wind to gain lift,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cLindsay gave him the final check to make sure he was still bright-eyed. \u201cWe simply held him in the hand and as soon as that offshore wind hit him in the face he just started flapping. \u201cIt was one of those now-or-never moments. \u201cLindsay opened his hand and he flew off beautifully \u2013 nice and strong into the wind. \u201cHe went off down toward the water and used that air pressure from the water and just beautifully followed the waterline until he disappeared over the water and then reappeared over the swell. \u201cIt was just so good to see.\u201d The team waited for 20 minutes before heading for home once they were confident Buggerlugs was safe. \u201cBecause he was housebound for a week or so, we weren\u2019t sure how his flight patterns would be,\u201d Mr Stanioch said. \u201cWe were all very, very nervous.\u201d Mr Anderson said: \u201cI hope the bird survives and lives a long and healthy life. It flew off pretty strong, so I hope it flies off in the right direction.\u201d The Bulwer\u2019s petrel is typically found in the latitudes between 10 degrees south and 40 degrees north.

By Friday morning, a million dollars didn\u2019t seem out of the question. Since then her target has grown by the hour. By Saturday evening, she was closing on $8 million, prompting Barber to set a new target of $9 million. The NSW Rural Fire Service and Brigades Donations Fund is used to buy equipment for use by NSW Rural Fire Brigades across the state. Other celebrities to have pledged donations include Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban ($500,000), Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen DeGeneres, Pink and Hugh Jackman. Donations to the NSW Rural Fire Service directly benefit the volunteer firefighters on the frontline. You can contact your local brigade directly to help or donate here. For bank transfers, there is a dedicated bank account (Account Name: NSW Rural Fire Service, BSB: 032-001, Account No: 171051). This account is for the RFS as a whole.

Why then are we giving you the low-down on what happened? When everyday people were asked to share their most generous act of 2019, it seemed help usually came from those who could do with the help themselves. Imagine this: A young mum pushing a pram that\u2019s carrying her one-year-old son arrives at your doorstep. She just got kicked out of home and only has the clothes on her back. She is also a drug addict. Before you ask yourself: What would I do? Consider this. Your youngest daughter has a genetic disorder and you\u2019re her full-time carer. You also have interim custody of your youngest granddaughter and are going for custody of your second youngest grandson. Instead of slamming her door shut, Kerie (surname withheld) welcomed Jessica (name changed) in. \u201cI was married to an alcoholic and he was also into drugs. He drugged me while I was pregnant with our first child,\u201d Kerie told The New Daily. She kept Jessica company while her son raided their pantry for \u201cwhatever she needed\u201d, filling two shopping bags to the brim. The 52-year-old didn\u2019t hold back when confronting the single mum about her drug habit. \u201cWhat would happen if you lost him (her son) completely?\u2019 she asked, to which Jessica responded, \u201cI\u2019d kill myself\u201d. Kerie pleaded with Jessica. \u201cMake him your reason to get clean. Make him your reason for living.\u201d Kerie cared for Jessica\u2019s baby while she briefly returned home to collect the rest of her belongings. Next. You\u2019re homeless, five months pregnant and only have $50 to spare. An elderly man catches your eye. He too is desperate for money. As Nikki (last name withheld) was explaining her situation, her eyes filled with tears. When asked about her most generous act this year, she recalled\u00a0seeing a homeless man in his 70s who was having a bad day. \u201cYou can just tell by the look on somebody\u2019s face,\u201d she said. Despite not knowing where her next dollar would come from, the 42-year-old Melbourne woman gave the man $20. \u201cThat made his day so it was worth it,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI\u2019d hate to be that old on the street and people just walk past me.\u201d Now, you have your hands full caring for your 72-year-old dementia-suffering husband who has become completely immobile. You later discover an old school friend is having a hard time coping with his extremely limited mobility due to post-polio syndrome and desperately needs a helping hand. Not only can\u2019t Trevor Cullen, 61, leave his home without assistance, but he struggles to have a shower and even get to the toilet on his own. Debe Thomas has been helping Mr Cullen apply to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. She has also started that process for herself, suffering from osteoarthritis and\u00a0fibromyalgia. Despite her chronic conditions, Ms\u00a0Thomas drives Mr Cullen to and from doctors appointments and even visits the local food bank once every fortnight to collect groceries for him. She also connects him to home-cleaning services and is enquiring about disability-friendly homes on his behalf. On top of everything, she keeps his mental health a priority. \u201cI found out that he hasn\u2019t even been hugged in 40 years. So now we make it a habit,\u201d\u00a0Ms\u00a0Thomas said. Next.\u00a0While working on a construction site, you notice an elderly woman who is struggling in the heat. She looks exhausted and could do with a refresher. After a day\u2019s labour in \u201cstinking hot\u201d weather, Melbourne builder Maarty Ploeg, 50, walked to a nearby IGA and bought the woman an ice-cream. \u201cShe was just so happy. Her smile was worth it all,\u201d he said. Finally, you\u2019re a stay-at-home mum and want to get back into the workforce. A brief google search brings up the State Emergency Service (SES). You know they need more volunteers but the idea of taking part in missing person searches or hazardous tree removals and other emergency response jobs seem daunting. This was Lisa May\u2019s fifth year volunteering for Victoria\u2019s SES. She was stumped for choice when asked about her nicest deed, as she\u00a0puts in about 30 hours every week. Ms May recalled speaking to a distressed elderly woman whose cat was trapped in her roof. She got the impression that the cat was \u201cpretty much all she had\u201d so her rescue team \u201cwent above and beyond\u201d to retrieve it. \u201cShe was over the moon with that and she actually ended up writing a letter of thank you to the unit,\u201d Ms May said."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Shock, tears and delight as company hands out $14.5m in staff bonuses", "date": "2019-12-11", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/12/11/real-estate-christmas-bonus/", "transcript": "Nearly 200 workers at a US real estate company are set for a joyous festive season after their boss announced they would share a $A14.5 million Christmas bonus.

It was then they noticed the shark\u2019s no-longer-functioning tracking device and a small buoyancy aid fitted only to one shark. \u201cOver 1500 individual sharks have been equipped with either visual ID or satellite tags in the Atlantic to date, leading to just a single record of transoceanic movement \u2013 until now,\u201d study co-author Emmett Johnston said. \u201cThis new evidence offers invaluable information to help us better understand the movements of this endangered species within an international context.\u201d As well as being one of the largest sharks in (second only to the whale shark) the basking shark is also one of the oddest in appearance. The basking shark has several evolutionary adaptations for filter-feeding plankton, its main diet, including a greatly enlarged mouth and its highly developed\u00a0gill rakers. It has a conical snout and gill slits that extend around the top and bottom of its head. Perhaps its oddest feature is the structured cartilage inside the shark\u2019s mouth that appears like ribs and serves to support its gaping mouth when feeding."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "The nine-year-old planning his PHD while his peers are playing downball", "date": "2019-11-18", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/11/18/nine-year-old-phd/", "transcript": "Not content with graduating from university at the ripe old age of nine years old, Belgium\u2019s Laurent Simons now has his sights set on a PhD in electrical engineering.

But this two-year-old reef is teeming with life\u00a0\u2013 created from seafood shells collected from restaurants that would have otherwise ended up in landfill. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing how critters know there\u2019s something there, and they come to it,\u201d he says. \u201cCrabs, oysters, starfish, octopus, squid, snapper\u00a0\u2013 you name it, they\u2019re all there.\u201d This is one of 10 pilot sites in four Australian states rebuilding the enormous chain of reefs that once stretched along the coast from Noosa to Perth, that were all but wiped out by dredge harvesting last century. \u201cThey tore the reefs to pieces,\u201d Mr Pearce says. \u201cIt broke my heart.\u201d Back in the 60s, when Mr Pearce first joined the Albert Park Yachting and Angling Club, he remembers being able to collect buckets of oysters in the shallows of South Melbourne beach. \u201cIf you felt like a feed of mussels, you\u2019d just go and get them off the pier pole,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery house along here had a mussel rake. We used to have them with a bit of brown vinegar and pepper. \u201cPeople told me not to worry about the dredging, but it\u2019s left us with a marine desert. I just put my hand up at a club meeting one night and said \u2018We should do something about this\u2019.\u201d It was the start of what became a multi-million-dollar project to begin rebuilding Australia\u2019s shellfish reefs, funded by philanthropic giant The Nature Conservancy, with help from state and federal governments. It has restored more than 100 similar reefs in the United States \u2014 and now wants to do the same in Australia on a similar scale.

State and federal governments have provided some support for the projects underway so far, but we want them to invest so we can quickly scale up. \u201cIf we can get that, this can be a game changer for water quality and fish stocks in Australia.\u201d The conservancy is lobbying to get the project funded in the next round of state and federal budgets. It\u2019s pushing hard on its value as a job-creation scheme in the regions and also as a way of preventing coastal erosion. \u201cWe need them to understand that these reefs are part of our national infrastructure. It\u2019s just that they are alive. And we\u2019ve got a way to go to convince them of that.\u201d In just a few years, 8 million native angasi oyster hatchlings have been placed in the waters off Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia, on the recycled mollusc shells collected from restaurants. They\u2019ve turned empty, sandy seabeds into thriving ecosystems\u00a0\u2013 covering an area the size of the MCG in Port Phillip Bay. \u201cThe results so far have been staggering,\u201d Mr Gilmore says. \u201cA single native oyster can filter a bathtub of water every day. That\u2019s billions of litres of clean water every single year of being filtered.\u201d Mr Pearce says every time he goes back, it reminds him of the bay he once knew. \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of pink snapper swimming on that reef that wouldn\u2019t have been there otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can just keep doing this a chunk at a time, eventually we\u2019ll have something fantastic again.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Jacinda Ardern's rapid-fire achievements video goes viral | The New Daily", "date": "2019-11-5", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/11/05/jacinda-ardern-achievements-video-viral/", "transcript": "It\u2019s been two years since Jacinda Ardern became New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister at 37.

Hairy, primitive beasts roamed the bush. Enormous prehistoric creatures inhabited the seas. And the skies? They brimmed with alien spacecraft. How I wanted to believe. I was obsessed with the strange and the unknown. I had scrapbooks filled with clippings about the Loch Ness monster, the Yowie and its Himalayan cousin, the Yeti. I devoured books about ancient civilisations that had been mentored by advanced extra-terrestrial beings. At the age of 12 I was founder and president of the Aerial Phenomena Investigation Bureau \u2013 an Australia-wide society with more than 60 members dedicated to proving the existence of UFOs in our skies. Unfortunately, it was forced to close. Sinister government interference? No, something far more down to earth. The money I earned from my newspaper delivery round couldn\u2019t meet the cost of the monthly newsletter. And then I grew up. I threw away my tin foil hat \u2013 the one that had successfully been blocking the government\u2019s ability to read my thoughts from its secretive tracking base at Pine Gap. Cold, hard reason replaced that mysterious world of my childhood and science and logic became the slayer of all those dragons and demons. But maybe I was on to something\u2026 For the first time in history the US Navy last month acknowledged that three videos of strange objects filmed by its pilots between 2004 and 2015 were of \u201cunidentified\u201d phenomena. The US Navy videos, published by The New York Times, show objects reaching hypersonic speeds along the east coast of the United States. In other reported cases they swerved and made instantaneous stops in mid-air, defying the physical laws that constrain current aircraft. A Pentagon spokeswoman also confirmed the phenomena was being treated as \u201cunidentified\u201d and was just a part \u201cof a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years.\u201d The videos and the unprecedented statements by US military officials have created a predictable wave of controversy around the world, capping off an extraordinary year for conspiracy theorists and a lucrative one for manufacturers of tin foil hats. The world, it seems, wants to believe. The more certain our universe becomes through science and technological innovation, the more we search for the unexplainable. A Facebook post earlier this year that jokingly called on people to storm the secretive US air force base in Nevada known as Area 51 \u2013 long suspected of harbouring the wreckage of crashed UFOs and alien bodies \u2013 drew more than two million responses and forced the US government to increase security around its perimeter. And in the year in which we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo XI moon landing, more people on the planet than ever before believe it was all just a hoax, insisting NASA\u2019s astronauts only travelled as far as a Los Angeles film studio. Plenty of academic studies have produced compelling evidence showing that in uncertain times, when people feel increasingly helpless with little control over their lives, they are willing to suspend common sense and logic and look for answers in the far-fetched. We saw this in the US when the 9/11 attacks sparked widespread claims of government involvement. We saw this when Barak Obama\u2019s elevation to the presidency resulted in claims he was not a US citizen, spawning the right-wing \u201cBirther\u201d movement. We saw this in the allegations of Hillary Clinton masterminding a global child-trafficking ring from a rear booth in a Washington pizza joint. We saw it in the UK when Princess Diana\u2019s death in a car accident triggered speculation of secret service involvement. And we have seen it in Australia with ongoing lunatic conspiracy theories around the Port Arthur massacre and whether there was a second shooter. This is an age when science has explained \u2013 and proven \u2013 how the universe emerged a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. We have mapped the human genome, sent craft hurtling beyond the limits of our solar system and even, earlier this year, captured the first image of a black hole. But the more explanations we are given and the more our universe shrinks and becomes less mysterious, the more people cling to outlandish theories as a way of coping with their rapidly changing and out-of-control lives. Those UFO videos? I have no idea what those objects are. But I\u2019m certain they cannot be alien spacecraft. It makes no sense. Why travel the vast distances of intergalactic space in your souped-up, technologically advanced ship, only to arrive on Earth and play hide and seek with navy aircraft? But most of all, in an era when almost everyone on the planet has a smartphone and an excellent in-built, automatically focusing camera, why do UFOs only ever appear in front of people who don\u2019t know how to properly use one? So for now, let\u2019s retain a healthy dose of scepticism. The world we live in contains more than enough mystery already. Let\u2019s first solve some of those elusive Australian enigmas like why so many drivers insist on picking their noses while waiting for the traffic lights to change, and why other people insist on ending sentences with the word \u201cbut\u201d.

The chances of twin foals being born alive are considered one in 10,000. But the odds of both animals surviving past their first two weeks are deemed much higher still, with most pregnancies ending in the death of at least one of the infants and often imperilling the mother. Spurrs Stud owner Kevin Spurr said the birth came as a complete surprise after he had opted not to have the mare, Pearl, assessed during her pregnancy. \u201cMy first thought was \u2018don\u2019t tell me another mare has had a foal and run away and left that\u2019,\u201d he said. Katanning Regional Veterinary Hospital owner John Maxwell has been practising as an equine vet for more than 50 years and said he had never seen the successful delivery of twin foals that go on to survive.

After finding the mare and her twins \u2014 now named Snip and Drop \u2014 in a field, Mr Spurr said it was a race against time to get the tiny foals to a vet.

Mr Spurr said even if they can make it, the chances of either going on to become a successful racehorse are low. But he said the twins have been bred from good stock \u2014 the stallion that sired them won almost $200,000 during a career on the track \u2014 and they could still develop into good breeders themselves. Regardless, he said the decision to keep the twins was born of hope rather than cold commercial realities. He is backing the miracle of life to triumph against the odds. \u201cReally, when you see something fighting for its life there\u2019s a tendency to want to help,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the back of my mind was the commercial aspect. \u201cBut when I saw them fighting \u2026 I wanted to give them that chance.\u201d \u2013 ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Truck makes 'brilliant recovery' after trailers sway wildly on freeway", "date": "2019-9-25", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/09/25/track-trailer-sway-recovery/", "transcript": "A dashcam recording has captured a B-double driver making a heart-stopping recovery on the\u00a0down track\u00a0of Adelaide\u2019s\u00a0South Eastern Freeway.

The joke event, posted to Facebook by California college student Matty Roberts, is planned for September 20, Mr Roberts\u2019 \u201crationale\u201d for his June invitation was simple \u2013 if enough people stormed the gates of the secretive base in the Nevada desert, there would not be enough guards to stop everyone from getting in. Their goal? \u201cLet\u2019s see them aliens,\u201d the post said. Area 51 has been shrouded in secrecy for decades, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of an alien crew from the crash of an unidentified flying object in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government would not even confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes. When the interest in the Facebook event became overwhelming, the US Air Force warned curiosity seekers not to breach the gates at the military base, which it said was still used to test combat aircraft and train personnel. But still the interest grew. Then\u00a0Mr Roberts teamed up with the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn to plan a music festival, dubbed Alienstock, in Rachel to entertain the expected crowds. He\u2019s since disassociated himself from that event, saying he fears it might devolve into a public safety crisis because of the sheer weight of numbers anticipated to attend. \u201cMy entire thought process for creating this was that it was going to be something funny for my meme page that probably a maximum of 52 people would see,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cI was absolutely terrified [when the FBI called]. But they were just concerned for my safety and the safety of others. They were doing their due diligence so I can\u2019t be mad about it.\u201d The official website for\u00a0Rachel, Nevada, echoed his warnings with a strident warning to intending visitors. It bold red font, it states: \u201cWe expect riots when those visitors that may show up and paid good money find out that the reality looks nothing like what they were promised. People will get hurt. \u201cSTAY AWAY FROM RACHEL NEXT WEEKEND!\u201d Mr Roberts is now promoting a new \u201csafer alternative\u201d planned for a more than two-hour drive from Area 51 in downtown Las Vegas. It even has a brand deal by way of a specially-created Bud Light beer can for the event. There are 11,500 RSVPs, with another 16,000 trying to get in, according to Mr Roberts\u2019 event planner Frank DiMaggio.

There was no stopping it,\u201d she said, adding that some visitors had come from as far away as Australia and New Zealand. \u201cI hope they just enjoy the party we are throwing.\u201d Earlier, Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee told the BBC that an extra 150 officers and 300 paramedics were being brought in to help deal with this weekend\u2019s expected crowds. An emergency declaration has been presigned, just in case. There are real concerns among locals about an influx of people to a place that has very limited services. Chairman of the Nye County Commission Jon Koenig, which is nearby, predicted there will be no mobile phone service, because the area\u2019s cellular towers aren\u2019t built for the volume of calls. \u201cThere will probably be no water \u2026 or ice available, because everything\u2019s going to sell out,\u201d he said during a Wednesday public meeting, the ABC reports. \u201cThere will be no gas left in the gas stations. No food.

The Austrian capital, which attracts tourists for its classical music scene and imperial history but also has abundant green spaces and excellent public services, last year ended Melbourne\u2019s seven-year run at the top of the survey of 140 cities, helped by an improved security outlook across Europe. Vienna and Melbourne have been neck and neck in the EIU survey for years, but the Austrian capital also regularly tops a larger ranking of cities by quality of life compiled by consulting firm Mercer. The gap between the two cities \u2013 of 0.7 point out of 100, with Vienna scoring 99.1 \u2013 was unchanged in the 2019 ranking, published on Wednesday, as were the cities in the top 10.

Healthcare and infrastructure are also matched at 20 per cent, with education coming in last with a 10 per cent weighting. \u201cParis in France is the highest-ranked city to have seen a deterioration in its stability score, owing to the ongoing anti-government gilets jaunes protests that began in late 2018,\u201d the EIU said of the French anti-government movement.

The culture and environment scores were reduced for many cities in poorer countries that are among the most exposed to the effects of climate change, including New Delhi and Cairo for their poor air quality.

She figured maggots \u2013 which can be fed to livestock \u2013 might solve that problem. Her hope was to run a conventional farm. Instead, she recognised the \u201cbeautiful opportunity\u201d that maggots might solve bigger problems \u2013 those of of food waste and landfill, and the rising cost of feed for farmers. That was in 2014. Since the she has built a novel business based on the idea of \u201cdecentralised waste management.\u201d  Instead of food waste being transported to the local tip, modular units full of black soldier flies \u2013 parked in the basement of office buildings, schools, hospitals and subscribed by individual households \u2013 convert up to five tonnes of food waste a day into one tonne of maggots, and 200 kilograms of manure. No arable land is required for maggot farming, and less than a litre of water produces a kilogram of almost pure protein. The maggots are euthanised with carbon dioxide and sold as feed \u2013 and the manure sold to gardeners. It\u2019s a model that Ms Yarger is determined to see replicated and expanded across Australia. Plenty of businesses have foundered on their big dreams, but not many of them are earning revenue off the back and front end \u2013 or have hit the sweet spot of the zeitgeist so well. According to the Department of Environment and Energy, Australians in 2016-2017 produced 7.3 million tonnes of food waste across the supply and consumption chain. Of this, 2.5 million tonnes was created in our homes, 2.3 million tonnes in primary production and 1.8 million tonnes in the manufacturing sector. Public consciousness of this scandal has been elevated by the ABC\u2019s War of Waste campaign, now in its second series. Eight months ago, Ms Yarger\u2019s business, Goterra, entered a partnership with the CSIRO via the research body\u2019s Kick-Start Program, which matches start-ups and small businesses with research and development activities. In this instance, the CSIRO provides technical support and advice to Ms Yarger in optimising her fly breeding program. Part of the motivation here was to give Ms Yarger \u2013 and Australia \u2013 an edge in a business that is growing globally. This is according to\u00a0Dr Cait Paull who heads CSIRO\u2019s Pest Suppressive Landscapes Team \u2013 which focuses on studying the behaviour of insect pests and their predators, looking for new ways to protect crops from infestation. \u201cWe were pretty much straight-away able to help Olympia just by observing what she did, and being able to somewhat test and tweak it,\u201d Dr Paull told The New Daily. Dr Paull noted that \u201cbeing connected with an emerging Australian industry\u2026 meant the relationship was a two-way collaboration\u201d\u2013 allowing the CSIRO to test lab-based results in an up-scaled real-world situation. \u201cThe knowledge benefits are going two ways,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u00a0can test all sorts of things in the lab and get fantastic results. The next step of applying it to real world problems, or upscaling in a commercial sense, takes a long time. And we don\u2019t have the capacity to do that, or if we do it takes a long time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to take what we\u2019ve found in the lab, bring it down to Goterra and test it on the industrial scale.\u201d Dr Paull was unable to give an actual example because of commercial confidentiality agreements. The use of insects in waste management and farming is becoming a billion dollar business. \u201cThe world outside Australia has made moves in a commercial sense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the work we\u2019ve done provide (Ms Yarger) some advantage to get ahead of the game for Australia.\u201d Dr Paull said Mr Yarger seems to take \u201can almost altruistic\u201d to what her work could mean for Australian research.

Artist Wayne Malkin used the wooden end of the match as a tiny canvas, to create an oil painting of Barry Humphries\u2019 alter ego, Dame Edna Everage. The hand-painted portrait measures 2.3 millimetres by 2.3\u00a0millimetres\u00a0or about the same size as the letter U on a 20-cent piece. \u201cI was online and saw a news feed about an artist in Cyprus, who was claiming the smallest painting in the world,\u201d Mr Malkin said. \u201cHis painting was 6.9 millimetres by 7.1 millimetres. And I thought, as an artist, that\u2019s a really great challenge to try to beat.\u201d Mr Malkin said he settled on the end of a matchstick because viewers could easily compare it to other tiny objects. The Sunshine Coast-based artist said it took two months to paint, far longer than his usual and much larger landscape paintings. \u201cA lot of that time was spent trying different methods,\u201d he said. Mr Malkin experimented with using a single brush hair and pinpoint, before switching to the fibre from a bamboo skewer. \u201cIt was the right sort of stiffness and size that I could actually dot paint onto it, and gradually build up in the traditional way with oil paints to form a portrait.\u201d He said he never considered using artificial means like digital printing to create the image. \u201cThere is a smaller painting around, but it\u2019s done by laser \u2013 there\u2019s no paint on it. \u201cMine is a painting that is painted exactly the same way as any other traditional painting.\u201d The artist, who owns a gallery at Montville on the Sunshine Coast hinterland, said he chose Dame Edna as his subject because she has a distinctive face, even in miniature. \u201cIt\u2019s the hair. It\u2019s the glasses,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople look at this painting through the magnifying glass and say I know who that is. That\u2019s Dame Edna.\u201d Mr Malkin said he had consulted record books, but there were no official records kept on paintings because art was considered too subjective. \u201cI have been in touch with the Guinness Book of Records and they\u2019ve sent a number of emails back to me,\u201d he said. The record keepers described it as \u201ctruly amazing\u201d but could not publish the painting as an official record. \u201cIt\u2019s not objective. Someone could argue that this tiniest dot of paint is a painting for the smallest painting. And someone could also argue that the longest painting, say, is the stripe on the M1,\u201d the artist said. \u201cThey tried to subcategorise it in some way, but came back to me and said \u2018No, it\u2019s just too difficult to do that\u2019.\u201d But Mr Malkin said after a thorough search of the internet he was confident his painting was the smallest in the world. The micro-art is best viewed in the gallery with the magnifying glass provided, but even then Mr Malkin said about half of his gallery visitors could not seem to see the work. \u201cThe reaction has been a mix,\u201d he confessed. \u201cThe 50 per cent say \u2018I can\u2019t see what it is, it\u2019s just too small for me\u2019 and the people that can see it have just gone \u2018That is incredible. I\u2019m blown away by it.\u2019 And that\u2019s really satisfying to have people say that.\u201d Mr Malkin said he used special equipment to see the tiny end of the matchstick as he was painting. \u201cI have a small hand-held lens, which is more powerful than the display one.\u201d The artist said he would be willing to lend the work to other galleries, but it would not be for sale. Without a clear ruling from world record keepers, the title of smallest artwork is disputed. Turkish micro-artist Mesut Kul claimed in 2017 that he had painted on to the world\u2019s smallest canvas \u2014 a hair. He has also used other miniature canvases, including pumpkin seeds and beans. Another Turkish artist Hasan Kale, who has dubbed himself the \u2018Microangelo\u2019, has developed an international following by painting tiny images onto food. He has recently painted onto pumpkin seeds, grains of rice, peanuts, sugar cubes and strawberry seeds. Mr Kale has also dabbled in painting onto matches, with portraits of Albert Einstein, composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and artist Salvador Dali onto the heads of matchsticks earlier this year. When opening his latest micro exhibition in an Ankara shopping centre in June, the micro-artist said he had been working in miniature for more than two decades. \u201cEverything that we omit, do not recognise and throw out as trash sometimes has become my canvas,\u201d he said. \u201cI started with the idea of opening new windows with different perspectives and creating a new language in the world. \u201cIt has been 25 years since that day.

They were analysed by a team that included Canterbury Museum curators Dr Paul Scofield and Dr Vanesa De Pietri and scientists from the Senckenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. C. waiparensis is the fifth ancient penguin species identified from fossils uncovered at the Waipara site. Dr Gerald Mayr, from the Senckenberg museum, said the site was arguably the world\u2019s most significant for penguin fossils from the Paleocene era. \u201cThe fossils discovered there have made our understanding of penguin evolution a whole lot clearer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to come, too \u2013 more fossils which we think represent new species are still awaiting description.\u201d The study team found that\u00a0C. waiparensis\u2018s closest relative was a fellow Paleocene species, Crossvallia unienwillia.

Even the mere existence of Area 51, which is part of the wider Edwards Air Force Base, was denied for decades. It was eventually confirmed by the CIA in 2013, through records obtained under freedom of information laws. That report maintained the base was solely an aircraft-testing facility.

Less than a decade after escaping, the 21-year-old is about to begin studying at the University of Melbourne and dreams of running her own business. Her former home, the Steng Meanchey landfill in Phnom Penh, has long been a symbol of the country\u2019s poverty. Each day, thousands of people pick through the filth in the hope of finding edible food and recyclables to sell. On a good day Ms Ron would earn 50 cents, enough for a few cups of rice to share with her parents and six siblings. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it was smelly. I didn\u2019t realise it was dirty,\u201d she said. \u201cI slept there, I ate there, I did everything there, so it became my home.\u201d Ms Ron said overwhelming debts left her family with no choice but to live at the dump site. The local school only offered a place to one child per family, so Ms Ron missed out on a chance to study. She said she followed her older sister to school and learned what she could by looking through the classroom windows. Her life changed after a chance meeting at the dump with Scott Neeson, the founder of the Cambodian Children\u2019s Fund (CCF). \u201cHe asked me whether I wanted to study English, and at that time I had no idea what English was,\u201d Ms Ron said. \u201cI ran home feeling happy because he promised he would take me to school.\u201d Mr Neeson\u2019s charity, featured by the ABC\u2019s Australian Story in 2012, has provided education, housing and medical treatment to thousands of people in Cambodia since its launch in 2004. The poverty rate in Cambodia dropped from 53 per cent in 2004 to 13.5 per cent in 2014, according to UNICEF, but children\u2019s living conditions remain poor. In a 2018 report, the United Nations agency said a third of children under four were stunted and about half aged between five and 14 did not have access to proper toilets. Ms Ron said she vividly remembered her first day of school, aged 11, when for the first time she saw groups of children laughing and playing. She was also a quick learner and a good communicator; by 2016 she was on stage presenting a Tedx Talk in English. Through CCF, Ms Ron was able to secure a scholarship to complete a foundation year of study at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Trinity College. She graduated in June, paving the way for her to start a Bachelor of Arts degree when the new semester begins this month. While Ms Ron said she loved life in Melbourne (apart from the cold), she hoped to eventually return home to start a business and continue working with CCF. Her uplifting story of transformation has been featured in Cambodia\u2019s local media in recent weeks, and Ms Ron said she hoped it encouraged others to donate to charity. \u201cI can\u2019t really describe the feeling.

The adult male box turtle is living life in the fast lane after undergoing a Lego transplant to get him moving once more. It\u2019s been a rocky road for the turbo turtle, who only had three legs when he was adopted by his owners. But after escaping from his outdoor enclosure in the US state of Louisiana, it\u2019s believed he was attacked by a raccoon or snake, which severed his remaining back leg. \u201cWhile he had three legs, he was able to move around very well,\u201d his owner Sandra Traylor said. \u201cHowever, once he lost his second leg it became significantly more difficult for him to get to where he was trying to go.\u201d Ms Traylor is the first to admit she wasn\u2019t sure what \u2013 if anything \u2013 veterinarians could do to solve Pedro\u2019s problem.

The wound where his leg had been torn off had healed quite well, she explained, and he was still able to \u201cbox up\u201d inside his shell for protection. \u201cWe discussed other prosthetics with his family if he was going to remain outdoors,\u201d Dr Rockwell said. \u201cHowever, they opted to make him an indoor pet and these wheels provided the best mobility for him in that environment.\u201d Armed with a tube of animal-safe epoxy and a Lego car kit, veterinarians got to work. They attached the wheels via axles that were secured to Pedro\u2019s shell and held together by syringe cases. \u201cThe most challenging part was figuring out a way to make it fit to his size,\u201d Dr Rockwell said. \u201cIt took some brainstorming, but once we came up with a design it was fairly easy to implement and attach.\u201d The newfound Speedy Gonzales took to his new wheels with gusto, according to Dr Rockwell, reversing and turning the prosthetics \u201cwithin minutes\u201d. \u201cThe benefit of Legos is that they are very lightweight, so for Pedro\u2019s size it was a perfect fit,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the very least, I hope it inspires veterinarians who don\u2019t work with these animals often to be creative.\u201d It is a sentiment echoed by Ms Traylor, who has lauded the veterinarians for going above and beyond the call of duty. \u201cWe are so glad he feels better.

The house was used to detain men, women and children up until 1908. \u201cMany of the subsequent owners could not handle the paranormal activities and sold on quickly,\u201d Home Domus 360 said.

But a colourful initiative to keep lambs warm with jumpers this winter has gained worldwide traction and has been saving lives \u2013 as well as bringing joy to farmers. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy and absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Marie Knight, a farmer from Coonabarabran in north-west New South Wales. Mrs Knight first put the call out to the world\u2019s knitters to help create the tiny jumpers one year ago and since then she has distributed more than 56,000 of them to Australian farmers. \u201cThe jumpers certainly help the lambs \u2013 and I planned on that \u2013 but what I never planned for was the extra support that would come pouring in from the people who knit them,\u201d she said. \u201cOften we get cards and letters of support to pass onto farmers and that\u2019s the beautiful thing.\u201d The jumpers have been donated from all around the world and, on any given day, Mrs Knight has been sending from one to 1000 items to farmers in need. \u201cThe furthest afield we have received jumpers was from Belgium and they actually came with beautiful chocolates,\u201d Mrs Knight said. \u201cPackages have also come from the United States, Canada, New Zealand and all over Australia.\u201d When Wollongong resident Noleen Shaw first heard about the worldwide push to knit lamb jumpers, she jumped with delight. \u201cI just love knitting of a night-time and my grandchildren don\u2019t like knitted clothes so I thought I\u2019d knit for the poor little lambs,\u201d Mrs Shaw said. The retiree said she knew few farmers but she recently knitted 12 jumpers \u2013 one jumper in each of the team colours within the National Rugby League competition. \u201cMy favourite jumper to knit was the one I did up in the colours of the Illawarra Dragons,\u201d Mrs Shaw said. She was told the farmer who received her lamb jumpers was delighted, which made her feel great too. \u201cIt makes you feel good knowing that you\u2019re doing something for the farmers,\u201d Mrs Shaw said. \u201cThey\u2019re having a rough trot at the moment.\u201d Mrs Shaw already has her next knitting project planned \u2013 she is going to create jumpers for lambs in all the colours of the AFL competition. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work out all the colours first, but I\u2019m going to do them too,\u201d she said. While they look cute and cosy, the jumpers help save orphaned lambs\u2019 lives. Sheep expert Geoff Duddy said lambs are most vulnerable in their first three days of life. During that time they use a lot of their energy reserves trying to keep warm. \u201cLambs have large surface areas so being able to regulate their body temperature is critically important,\u201d he said. Jumpers are ideal for lambs requiring extra warmth and protection, such as those orphaned, but Mr Duddy said lambs that do not require intervention should not have jumpers fitted. \u201cIf you are entering the paddock and disturbing the ewe to pull a jumper on the lamb that could interfere with their relationship and put the lamb at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther, if lambs get wet while in their jumpers \u2013 assuming they\u2019re unlined \u2013 that could actually cause them a lot of harm.\u201d As temperatures continue to drop and pasture growth freezes, drought-affected farmers across the country are continuing to supplementary feed their flocks \u2013 a practice that Mr Duddy said gives sheep extra energy to weather the cold. He said it would be a long and cold winter for many farmers. Forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology indicated this winter in NSW will be drier than average and the state is likely to see higher surface air pressures than normal, which will mean less cloud at times and a higher risk of frost in susceptible areas. Mrs Knight encouraged avid knitters to continue donating lamb jumpers this winter. \u201cAs farmers we all want to do the very best for our animals,\u201d she said. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "How pigeons and Brian the Alsatian helped with a winning war effort", "date": "2019-6-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/06/06/animals-world-war-heroes/", "transcript": "Pigeons and an Alsatian dog called Brian are among the heroes honoured for their vital roles during the D-Day invasion that helped bring an end to World War II.

Troops used the feathered fighters to help deliver intelligence, because radio equipment could be unreliable, particularly during heavy fighting. The birds braved fighting, bombs and bullets from enemy soldiers, as well as hawk attacks, in their relentless drive to get home. They carried coded messages in tiny scrolls attached to rings on their legs. Days before D-Day, on June 6, 1944, a pigeon named the Duke of Normandy was dropped into Merville with paratroopers from the 21st Army Group. Their mission was to ensure that four heavy-calibre guns trained directly on Sword Beach were out of action before D-Day, which was to be\u00a0history\u2019s largest combined land, air and sea operation. The only way to relay the success (or otherwise) of the operation was to release Duke of Normandy with the news. \u201cHis journey home took 27 hours and he flew through bullets and bombs,\u201d Ms Dickin said. The Duke\u2019s heroics delivered critical intelligence to Allied Command that saved many lives. Just days after, RAF homing pigeon Gustav, released by Reuters news agency correspondent Montague Taylor, relayed the first news report of the D-Day landings. He travelled 240 kilometres across the English Channel in five hours and 16 minutes with his message. Brian, who completed seven parachute jumps in his army career, was another Dickin Medal recipient. As the D-Day landings began, Brian was parachuted into the town on Ranville, but got stuck in a tree on his way down. Fellow paratrooper Sergeant Ken Bailey cut Brian down, despite being under fire, and the pair fought together over the next few months. After that operation, Brian remained on active duty in occupied Germany but was eventually reunited with his family. His Dickin Medal had the citation: \u201cFor excellent patrol work and qualifying as a paratrooper, Airborne Division, Normandy, June 1944.\u201d The 90th anniversary of the D-Day landings has been marked by veterans and world leaders on both sides of the Channel this week."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Vietnamese supermarkets find a-peeling solution to plastic packaging", "date": "2019-6-4", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/06/04/banana-leaves-used-wrapping-produce/", "transcript": "Supermarkets in Vietnam have come up with a genius way to reduce plastic packaging: To wrap produce in banana leaves instead.

They are simply wrapped in the banana leaf and bound using a length of bamboo. According to Forbes, of the nine billion tonnes of plastic ever produced, only 9 per cent has been recycled. The magazine also note that the\u00a0United Nations Environment Programme\u00a0estimates that by 2050 there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic in landfills, the environment and oceans, of which cigarette butts, plastic drinking bottles, food wrappers and plastic grocery bags are the biggest contributors."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Miniature donkey up to his neck in it rescued from septic tank", "date": "2019-5-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/05/31/donkey-septic-tank/", "transcript": "Firefighters have rescued a miniature donkey that became trapped after falling into a septic tank north of Brisbane.

Mr Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $US1.5 million gift to the school. The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $US40 million. Mr Smith said he expected the recipients to \u201cpay it forward\u201d and said he hoped that \u201cevery class has the same opportunity going forward\u201d. \u201cBecause we are enough to take care of our own community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are enough to ensure that we have all the opportunities of the American dream.

Morehouse College president David Thomas said the gift would have a profound effect on the students\u2019 futures. \u201cMany of my students are interested in going into teaching, for example, but leave with an amount of student debt that makes that untenable,\u201d Mr Thomas said. \u201cIn some ways, it was a liberation gift for these young men that just opened up their choices.\u201d CNN also quoted Mr Thomas as saying: \u201cWhen you have to service debt, the choices about what you can go do in the world are constrained. \u201c[The grant] gives them the liberty to follow their dreams, their passions.\u201d -with AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Dutch treat: The Netherlands claims Eurovision's crown | The New Daily Dutch treat: Holland claims Eurovision's crown", "date": "2019-5-19", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/tv/2019/05/19/holland-wins-eurovision/", "transcript": "Australia\u2019s Kate Miller-Heidke gave it her best shot with the visually stunning track Zero Gravity but could only manage a ninth-place finish in the Eurovision Song Contest.

Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries spokesman Jorgen Ree Wiig has told The Washington Post that the beluga \u201cwas the first thing I saw outside of the window\u201d of his patrolling ship in the morning. Speaking from the city of Hammerfest, he said the whale had moved only about 25 nautical miles in the past week and appeared to enjoy being close to humans. That, he said, was strange behaviour for a beluga. The whale was first reported by fishermen, who saw it swimming around their boat in Arctic Norway last week. It was wearing a tight harness with\u00a0\u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d written on the strap, and a camera attachment. Fisherman Joar Hesten jumped into the frigid water to remove the harness, which was later\u00a0handed to Norway\u2019s special police security agency.  Audun Rikardsen, a professor at the Department of Arctic and Marine Biology at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsoe, said he believed \u201cit is most likely that Russian Navy in Murmansk\u201d was involved. The find has triggered fresh speculation about a sea mammal special operations program that the Russian navy is believed to have pursued for years. According to The Washington Post, the Russian Defence Ministry has denied its existence, but the same ministry did publish a 2016 ad seeking three male and two female bottlenose dolphins and offering to pay $24,000. Russia has major military facilities in and around Murmansk, on the Kola Peninsula, in the country\u2019s far north-west. While the idea of putting sea mammals to work for the military might seem far-fetched, there is actually a precedent. According to\u00a0The Washington Post, the US spearheaded such a\u00a0program in the 1950s. The US Navy has its own dolphin and sea lion recruits, which are used to find sea mines, retrieve objects from the ocean floor and gather intelligence for military divers. Meanwhile, Norwegian officials are wondering what to do with their beluga defector. Mr Wiig said one option was to transport it\u00a0to a sanctuary in Iceland \u2013 about 2000 kilometres away. That proposal, he said, might increase chances of \u201cthe survival of the whale\u201d. -with agencies"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Sweet as, bro!

Shannon Loughnane left his home in Coburg two days ago with a plan to trek along major highways, country roads and mountainous areas to deliver his message to Canberra. He said he hoped his 700-kilometre trek would form part of a wider wave of protests aimed at pressuring leaders who he believed were not doing enough to address the issue. Four months ago, the Melbourne University student made a New Year\u2019s resolution to read more about climate change. He said he was concerned by the issue, but at the time did not know enough about it. As he read more and followed the protests of activists around the world, an urgency set in. \u201cFor a while I occupied that ground of feeling very afraid of climate change but only vaguely understanding what it meant,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I learnt more I became concerned by the inaction of our government \u2013 Australia at the moment performs really poorly on a global scale in terms of what we\u2019re doing for climate change. \u201cThis protest for me is about making a very direct plea to governments, and showing up and refusing to be ignored.\u201d The hike will take him through country towns from\u00a0Yea, Violet Town, Benalla and Wangaratta to Albury, Lankeys Creek, Rosewood and Tumut. Mr Loughnane plans to stop at each town to talk about climate change and garner signatures from any locals passionate about the cause. The petition will ask members of the House of Representatives to declare a climate emergency, aggressively lift emissions reductions, pursue renewable energy, ban the proposed Carmichael Coal mine and other fossil fuel projects, and ratify climate policy into legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t think my protest is going to hold leaders to account, but I hope it\u2019s part of a wider wave of protests and of action that pressures leaders to think about really changing things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people would be really shocked to see how far it reaches, and the types of things it\u2019ll affect \u2013 from food and water availability to the range of infectious diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s really crucial that we all start looking at it as the whole picture.\u201d Mr Loughnane considers himself among a growing number of young people across Australia and the world who are drawing attention to the impacts of climate change.

The results are a significant shift from 2016, where 9 per cent of voters saw it as the most important issue in the election. Climate change is shaping up to be a\u00a0key issue for the May federal election. Mr Loughnane said he believed debate and protests would make an impact. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for what\u2019s happening in the minds of leaders, but I do think culturally there\u2019s a lot happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe student strikes for climate are amazing, those young people stepping up and demanding change, [it] is really enlightening, and it\u2019s drawing attention to the fact that these young people are going to be affected the most by climate change. \u201cPeople are starting to tune into that at a rate that I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Explained: Why rabbits are synonymous with Easter | The New Daily", "date": "2019-4-21", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/04/21/rabbits-and-easter/", "transcript": "Ever wondered why rabbits are everywhere at Easter time?

They look like their dad, too \u2013 a more wrinkled form of Merino that went out of favour years ago because it made the animal vulnerable to flies laying eggs on its body. University of Sydney researchers found the ancient sperm \u2013 from four long-dead rams \u2013 was as healthy and viable as samples that had been frozen for only 12 months. In fact, the numbers suggest the old fellas had a bit more kick in their tads than contemporary sires. According to a statement from the university, out of 56 ewes inseminated with the ancient seed, 34 were successfully impregnated.  This compares to recently frozen semen from 19 sires used to inseminate 1048 ewes, of which 618 were successfully impregnated. This gives a pregnancy rate of 61 per cent for the 50-year-old semen against 59 per cent for recently frozen sperm, actually a statistically equivalent rate \u2013 but who can begrudge a blue ribbon to Sir Freddie. If still alive, he\u2019d be old enough to be great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather to his newborns. \u201cThis demonstrates the clear viability of long-term frozen storage of semen. The results show that fertility is maintained despite 50 years of frozen storage in liquid nitrogen,\u201d said Associate Professor Simon de Graaf from the Sydney Institute of Agriculture and School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Sydney. \u201cThe lambs appear to display the body wrinkle that was common in Merinos in the middle of last century.\u201d The wrinkles were bred into sheep back then to maximise skin surface and increase the amount of wool the animal could grow. But it also made them vulnerable to infestation. \u201cThat style of Merino has since largely fallen from favour as the folds led to difficulties in shearing and increased risk of fly strike,\u201d said Dr de Graaf. The findings are yet to be published, but Dr de Graaf believes they will provide a benchmark and resource when looking \u201cat the genetic progress made by the wool industry over past 50 years of selective breeding. In that time, we\u2019ve been trying to make better, more productive sheep,\u201d he said. The rams were of Ledgworth, Merryville and Boonoke genetics, famous names in the wool industry. The Boonoke ram, \u201cSir Freddie\u201d was born in 1959 and sold to Ledgworth owned by the Walker family in 1961 for 345 guineas \u2013 about $660 in today\u2019s currency. He died in the 1970s but lives on as part of what\u2019s been described as a time capsule project. It was started in 1968, by the late Dr Steven Salamon \u2013 a world leader in sperm preservation, and something of a legend for how he survived a Siberian after World War II. Dr Salamon died in 2017. In celebration of the semen\u2019s 50th year and Dr Salamon\u2019s 100th birthday, the semen was thawed and inseminated in ewes as part of the the 2018 Balmoral Sire Evaluation Group, a trial into leading sires suited for fine wool production in western Victoria. Dr Jessica Rickard, a post-doctoral McCaughey Research Fellow in the Sydney Institute of Agriculture, did the original work to determine if the stored semen was viable for artificial insemination. This involved thawing the semen, which is stored as small pellets in large vats of liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees. Dr Rickard and her colleagues then undertook in vitro tests on the sperm quality to determine the motility, velocity, viability and DNA integrity of the 50-year-old sperm. \u201cWe believe this is the oldest viable stored semen of any species in the world and definitely the oldest sperm used to produce offspring,\u201d she said."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Kenyan science teacher wins $1.4m global prize | The New Daily", "date": "2019-3-25", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/03/25/peter-tabichi-global-teacher/", "transcript": "A science teacher from rural Kenya, who gives away most of his salary to help poorer pupils, has won a $1.4 million prize for the world\u2019s best teacher.

Using cash raised in a community cropping program, the locals rallied together and bought the run-down establishment to start afresh. After 12 thirsty months without any cold tap beer, the new building finally opened to the public this week and the celebrations began. The Nyabing Community Hub is open for business and the locals could not be happier. They lost their only competitive sport program and came very close to losing their beloved watering hole. But, thanks to some hard work and perseverance, a new place to socialise has been created. A community cropping program, which raised almost $1 million, provided the means for the Nyabing Progress Association to step in and save the crumbling town pub. \u201cWe lost our sport to lack of numbers and the pub was slowly dying,\u201d association member Justin Germain said. \u201cFarms have got bigger, there are fewer people, and we have a big generation gap. \u201cThe pub had been on the market for a long time and there were no takers, so something had to be done.\u201d Originally the plan was to refurbish the existing building but, once the work began, a whole can of worms opened up. \u201cThe window frames were crooked and there were rotting timbers and everything else,\u201d Mr Germain said. \u201cIt was in a poor state, so we had to build a new hub.\u201d The finished product is far more than just a licensed tavern. It also features a modern function room, office spaces, and short-term accommodation for people passing through the small agricultural town. The Nyabing Community Hub is modern and sleek, tucked between shops along the main street. The building features eye-catching stone work and a sleek timber bar top. Association member Fiona Hobley said the stone and timberwork were included not just for aesthetic purposes but also as a sentimental addition. \u201cIt was lovely to keep the granite rock, which is local to the area, and that has formed a really lovely fireplace, so you have the real earthy feel with the fire and stone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to top it off we have salmon gum timber, which used to be a tree that towered over the main street. \u201cDue to safety, it had to be chopped down. But we get to enjoy its beautiful timber now, right? \u201cWe love the natural elements and we live in the elements, so it\u2019s only fitting that our building have a part of that.\u201d Hundreds of people gathered outside the Nyabing Community Hub on Thursday to witness the official opening of their new collaborative space. After weeks of delays, Ms Hobley was relieved to see the open day finally arrive. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely amazed by the number of people who turned up. We knew there would be a lot, but this has exceeded expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a family place that we\u2019ve created, so it\u2019s great to have the children here. \u201cThey\u2019ve had to watch us go through the build and, to have it actually done, I think they\u2019re delighted to be inside.\u201d While the new community hub opened this week with plenty of celebratory drinks, the people of Nyabing say it offers much more than a place to unwind. \u201cI think you need a drinking outlet. It\u2019s where people come to let their hair down and get off the farms,\u201d Mr Germain said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a pub in town, you don\u2019t have much of a town I don\u2019t think.\u201d \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "What an innings!

Owner Allison Lonergan said her family was enjoying a barbecue in early January when they went to fetch the extra chicken skewers from the kitchen bench, only to find them missing \u2013 the likely destination being Boris\u2019 belly. \u201cHe never steals food. This is the first time he has stolen food from anywhere,\u201d she said. Boris passed some of the chicken skewers and appeared to be in good spirits, until a month later when the pooch started to exhibit some strange behaviour. The family noticed Boris was not acting normally and was lethargic. After multiple vet visits and scans, Ms Lonergan noticed the pup had started coughing up blood. \u201cThey gave him a chest X-ray and found that he had fluid around his heart,\u201d she said. Following the X-ray, vets at the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic finally discovered the problem. \u201cThe doctor comes out and says, \u2018We\u2019ve got a situation \u2013 Boris has a kebab skewer in his heart\u2019,\u201d Ms Lonergan said. She said she was told Boris needed emergency surgery, or had to be put down. For Ms Lonergan, it was an easy decision. \u201cHe was only 19 months old when this happened. It was just like \u2018Nah, just have to do it! We will find a way\u2019.\u201d Manty Arnott from the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic told ABC Local Radio Boris was very lucky. \u201cWe assume the skewer turned around and went up through the stomach wall and up through the diaphragm and into the left atrium of the heart,\u201d Dr Arnott said. In a lucky turn of events for young Boris, the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic had a visiting cardiologist in town the day Boris came in. \u201cI think he is incredibly lucky \u2013 it was probably the best day for him to be here,\u201d Dr Arnott said. The vet told Ms Lonergan the skewer was millimetres from Boris\u2019 aorta, and one wrong move could have meant another ending to Boris\u2019 tale. Ms Arnott said while it was not rare for a dog to eat something it shouldn\u2019t, the fact that the skewer stayed in Boris for a month before he exhibited poor health was \u201ca freak event\u201d. The Lonergan family is now facing nearly $13,000 in vet bills, and are being extra careful to ensure Boris does not get anywhere near a skewer again. \u201cThere are no kebabs to be in this house ever again.\u201d Ms Lonergan said. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "French fencing federation officially backs lightsaber duels | The New Daily", "date": "2019-2-19", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/02/19/french-fencing-lightsabre-duels/", "transcript": "Move over Zorro, Robin Hood and The Three Musketeers, there\u2019s a new generation of duelling fencers in France. With the official recognition of lightsaber duelling as a competitive sport by the French fencing federation, young sword-fighters can now channel their inner Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Vader. Unfortunately for the really keen, the LED-lit, rigid polycarbonate replicas of the famed Star Wars lightsaber\u00a0won\u2019t slice a Sith lord in half. But they look remarkably like the lightsabers that Yoda and others wield in the blockbuster movies. Some of the more expensive sabers are even equipped with chips that emit a throaty electric rumbles \u2013 so they sound the part too. \u201cCape and sword movies have always had a big impact on our federation and its growth,\u201d French Fencing Federation secretary-general Serge Aubailly said. \u201cLightsaber films have the same impact. Young people want to give it a try.\u201d The physicality of lightsaber combat is part of the reason the federation has thrown its support behind the sport. It is equipping fencing clubs with lightsabers and training would-be lightsaber instructors, while officially recognising the three-minute duels. Like virtuous Jedi knights, the French federation sees itself as combating a Dark Side: The sedentary habits of 21st-century life that are affecting the health of ever-growing numbers of adults and children. \u201cWith young people today, it\u2019s a real public health issue. They don\u2019t do any sport and only exercise with their thumbs,\u201d Mr Aubailly said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming difficult to [persuade them to] do a sport that has no connection with getting out of the sofa and playing with one\u2019s thumbs. That is why we are trying to create a bond between our discipline and modern technologies, so participating in a sport feels natural.\u201d But not all of the converts to lightsaber duels are youngsters. Some are more like 49-year-old police officer Philippe Bondi, who was drawn to the idea of acting out the love for Star Wars he\u2019s had since he saw his first film at the age of just seven. Mr Bondi was a fencer for 20 years before switching to lightsaber duelling. He uses a\u00a0federation-approved lightsaber in luminous green \u201cbecause it\u2019s the Jedi colours, and Yoda is my master\u201d. \u201cI had to be on the good side, given that my job is upholding the law,\u201d he told USA Today. Mr Bondi was among the competitors at a recent national tournament outside Paris. They fought in a darkened hall, lit by spectacular illuminated swooshes of coloured blades, while fans dressed as Star Wars characters added their own colour. \u201cWe wanted it to be safe, we wanted it to be umpired and, most of all, we wanted it to produce something visual that looks like the movies, because that is what people expect,\u201d tournament organiser Michel Ortiz said. Nonetheless, lightsaber duelling counts its paid-up practitioners in France in the hundreds, not thousands \u2013 and it has no hope of a place in the Paris Olympics in 2024. But to hear the thwack of blades and see them cut shapes through the air is to want to give the sport a try. -with AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Fight to save dead shark found at abandoned wildlife park", "date": "2019-2-18", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/02/18/rosie-the-shark-abandoned-tank/", "transcript": "An unlikely campaign is growing to save a taxidermied five-metre great white shark discovered languishing in a tank in an abandoned wildlife park. Rosie, as the shark has been dubbed, has been alone in her tank at Victoria\u2019s former Wildlife Wonderland since 2012. The shark was captured in tuna fishing nets off South Australia in 1998. Her stuffed body was sent to the park at Bass, south-east of Melbourne, temporarily but she was left there to rot when Wildlife Wonderland closed seven years ago. Earlier in February, Luke McPherson posted footage to his YouTube channel of Rosie languishing in the tank. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for the shark but was compelled after the park shut down because I came here growing up,\u201d he told the Seven Network. \u201cThe tank was huge and in bad condition, with a rusting metal frame and smashed panels of glass and trash thrown inside. \u201cOnce I got the light behind the tank I was like \u2018wow, that\u2019s creepy.\u201d Mr McPherson said fumes from Rosie\u2019s tank were so bad he could stay in the same room for only a minute.  Mr McPherson\u2019s YouTube footage attracted international attention. It also led to the establishment of the Save Rosie the Shark Facebook page, which has nearly 4000 followers. There have also been some unwelcome visitors for Rosie. \u201cVandals have trespassed into the private property and tried their best to smash Rosie\u2019s tank. The glass is over three inches (7.5 centimetres) thick, and neighbours believe these vandals have used sledge hammers to try and break the glass,\u201d a post on the Facebook page says. \u201cLarge cracks have now appeared and the dangerous liquid, formaldehyde, is slowly seeping from the tank out into the open. \u201cWe need to act fast and save Rosie.

Every winter since 2011, people from around the world head to Canada\u2019s northern Yukon Territory for the annual International Hair Freezing Contest at the Takhini Hot Springs, usually in February or \u201cany day that it is cold enough\u201d, according to its website. How do you win? Create the most creative frozen hairdo possible by soaking in the hot springs and allowing the steam to accumulate on your head while the cold air freezes your hair.

People would soothe their weary bodies in the natural hot pools in the evening, and the pools manager would challenge people to create the best frozen hairstyle. Average winter temperatures in the Yukon reach daytime highs of 13 degrees Celsius and lows of -22\u00a0degrees Celsius at night \u2013 the perfect temperature for hair freezing. The mineral-rich waters are between 36 degrees and 42 degrees, ensuring bathers stay warm despite the temperature outside. But the ice-sculpted styles have taken off in other wintery parts of Canada, including Banff, in south-western Canada. And don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t happen to have lustrous locks on your head.

When your hair is wet, the body can struggle to stay warm, which in turn makes your immune system work harder, leaving the body more susceptible to germs and viruses. Management at the Takhini say freezing hair won\u2019t damage it and dipping it back into the hot water thaws it immediately. But before you consider this the \u201call-clear\u201d to recreate the\u00a0super-freeze style, some hair stylists warn the freezing temperatures can cause hair breakage, especially for those with curly hair. \u201cWhen water reaches a freezing point, it\u00a0solidifies and expands by almost 10 per cent, so when you walk out on a cold day with wet hair, those water molecules that have adhered to the hair\u2019s outer cuticle layer solidify and expand,\u201d hair stylist Becky Marinich told Business Insider. The hair expert behind Aquage Haircare explained the hair shaft can swell and cause the cuticle layer to lift, leaving hair vulnerable to environmental and thermal damage. \u201cWhen hair freezes, it naturally becomes less pliable \u2013 like an icicle, frozen locks can easily snap,\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Westminster Dog Show: King continues reign of terriers", "date": "2019-2-13", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/02/13/westminster-dog-show-king/", "transcript": "When King, a wire fox terrier, won best in show honours at the 143rd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Tuesday night, it was not a crowd-pleasing announcement.

Brian Bayliss, 51, originally thought the formations were man-made. That was until he realised there were no footprints in the pristine snow surrounding the bizarre, doughnut-like circles. He told the\u00a0BBC\u00a0he had\u00a0\u201cnever seen anything like it before\u201d. As\u00a0Mr\u00a0Bayliss got closer to the wheels,\u00a0he said he \u201ccould see the sun through the middle, and they just made no sense\u201d. But thankfully there\u2019s a rational explanation. The weird wheels of snow, while extremely rare, are a naturally forming phenomenon commonly known as \u201csnow rollers\u201d. Also known around the world as \u201csnow bales\u201d, \u201cwind snowballs\u201d or \u201csnow donuts\u201d, it is believed the rollers are formed only when a combination of ideal wind conditions combine with certain terrain to\u00a0 blow bundles of snow along. The wheels of snow gather in size along the way, resulting in a wheel-like shape with distinct track behind it. In the past few years, snow rollers have appeared in the US, Canada, and Scotland. They\u2019re most likely to be found in a place with a slope, which can help the snow roll. It is thought that if the wind is too strong, or too weak, or the snow is too tightly packed, snow rollers will not form. BBC weatherman Ian Fergusson said weather conditions need to be almost perfect for snow rollers to form. \u201cThese are truly beautiful photos of a very rare meteorological phenomenon \u2013 called snow rollers or snow bales. Brian was very lucky to see these,\u201d Mr Fergusson was quoted as saying. \u201cConditions have to be just right for snow rollers to occur: A smooth, un-vegetated hillside, such as in this case near Marlborough, enhances the chance of them being formed. \u201cA layer of thin snow, settled atop existing ice and not sticking to it, combined with specific temperature, moisture level and wind speed, are fundamental to the creation of these natural oddities.\u201d -with agencies"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Marilyn Monroe fans set world record before hitting the beach in Adelaide", "date": "2019-2-3", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/02/03/marilyn-monroe-record-beach-adelaide/", "transcript": "Hundreds of Marilyn Monroe impersonators have claimed a new world record on a sweltering Adelaide day before going for a dip in the ocean to raise tens of thousands of dollars for cancer research.

It\u2019s also lighter than your everyday clinker, is very strong, takes heavy metals out of the environment, is more porous and so promotes heat insulation \u2013 and would make the construction industry more eco-friendly. And it would significantly free up landfill. The catch? It\u2019s a psychological one in the public mind. The new brick, developed by RMIT University scientists, is made using biosolids, the sludgy remains of sewage after it goes through the wastewater treatment process. In other words, what you drop into your toilet has the potential to build walls and make the world a more sustainable place. The US produces about 7.1 million tonnes of biosolids a year, while the EU produces\u00a0more than 9 million tonnes. In Australia, 327,000 tonnes of biosolids are produced annually. While some biosolids are used in agriculture as fertiliser (in dry\u00a0form it looks like soil) most of it ends up in landfill or storage. This has proved unsustainable for Melbourne Water and its treatment plants. Last May the body announced it has trucked its millionth tonne\u00a0 of biosolids from its eastern treatment plant to a landfill rehabilitation project \u2013 but it said it had hopes that the construction industry might one day use biosolids in bricks and offer a permanent solution to the problem. Those hopes have been nurtured for a long time. Melbourne Water trialled biosolid bricks 15 years ago in partnership with a South Australian brick company. The results were encouraging and the construction industry wasn\u2019t turned off by the idea. But the bricks weren\u2019t durable, and for Melbourne Water it was back to the drawing board.

Dr Mohajerani had previously experimented with making bricks and asphalt from cigarette butts. \u201cThere are six trillion of them littering the world,\u201d he said in an interview that suggested he regards cigarette butts as a personal affront, and hasn\u2019t given up on the idea of making them useful. He\u2019s become similarly passionate about biosolids and how it can be used to conserve resources in the brick industry. \u201cMore than 3 billion cubic metres of clay soil is dug up each year for the global brickmaking industry, to produce about 1.5 trillion bricks,\u201d he told The New Daily. \u201cI tried to visualise what that means\u2026 and worked out it is the equivalent of 1000 soccer fields turned into a hole 440 metres deep.\u201d With funding from RMIT, Melbourne Water and the Australian government Research Training Program, Dr Mohajerani became the lead investigator in producing a biosolid brick that has proved technically viable. He said the research tested the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fired-clay bricks incorporating different proportions of biosolids, from 10 to 25 per cent. The biosolid-enhanced bricks passed compressive strength tests and analysis demonstrated heavy metals were largely trapped within the brick. Also, the biosolids bricks were more porous than standard bricks, giving them lower thermal conductivity \u2013 and would make households more environmentally sustainable. The research also showed brick-firing energy demand was cut by up to 48.6 per cent for bricks incorporating 25 per cent biosolids. \u201cThis is because of the organic content of the biosolids and so could considerably reduce the carbon footprint of brick manufacturing companies,\u201d Dr Mohajerani said. But how soon could these bricks come on the market? Dr Mohajerani said he hoped that government building codes could confidently mandate a conservative 15 per cent biosolids component in house bricks in the near future \u2013 based on the success of the research. But without the political will, \u201cIt would take another 20 years\u201d and the problems dogging water treatment plants would only be compounded. A spokeswoman from Melbourne Water said there would be \u201cfurther work and development around this exciting research\u201d."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Snake coils around teenage boy's arm as he sleeps", "date": "2019-1-17", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/01/17/snake-attacks-teenage-boy-cape-york/", "transcript": "Emma and Neville Jackson woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of their screaming 14-year-old son, only to discover he had been attacked by a three-metre-long snake. Ryan, who lives on a cattle station south of Weipa, was woken to the \u201caggressive\u201d scrub python coiled around his arm, sinking its teeth into his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone running to see what\u2019s going on and Ryan had his arm in the air screaming in pain with a scrub python wrapped around it,\u201d Ms Jackson said. \u201cIt was trying to eat his hand. \u201cWe wrestled with it but the more we kept trying, the more the head would inch its way up and it would sink its teeth in higher and higher.\u201d The 14-year-old said his parents saved him with some creative thinking. \u201cThey used a platypus money box \u2026 they used the platypus\u2019s beak to shove it in the snake\u2019s bottom jaw and my dad tried to push the snake\u2019s mouth forward to lift it off my hand,\u201d he said. Ms Jackson said it took about 10 minutes to prise the \u201chungry\u201d reptile from their son\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019ve taught our children not to fear snakes because they\u2019re everywhere, but this one was hungry and aggressive and not keen to let go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a shock,\u201d Ryan added. Ms Jackson said it was lucky the snake did not go into the room of her four-year-old daughter Trixie-Bell. \u201cRyan took one for the team in a way because I think the snake would have killed her.

Looking frail, dishevelled with matted hair and wearing shoes too big for her, Jayme spotted a woman, Jeanne Nutter, walking her dog on a nearby snow-covered street on Thursday afternoon. Jayme yelled out: \u201cPlease help me! I don\u2019t know where I am! I\u2019m lost!\u201d Ms\u00a0Nutter recognised Jayme immediately due to the enormous public campaign to find her after she disappeared from her home town of Gordon, some 120 kilometres away, on October 15 after her parents James and Denise were shot dead and the front door was left open. \u201cI just kept telling myself \u2018Don\u2019t let her know I\u2019m scared, just talk calmly, walk calmly\u2019,\u201d she told reporters.

She said she did not know him.\u201d Jayme\u2019s grandfather Robert Naiberg said in a telephone interview on Saturday that no one in the family knew Patterson. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know Jayme. He didn\u2019t know [parents] Denise or Jim,\u201d Naiberg said. \u201c[Jayme] don\u2019t know him from Adam. But he knew what he was doing. We don\u2019t know if he was stalking her or what. Did he see her somewhere?\u201d Jayme is now speaking to investigators, but it is not clear what the conditions were like inside the cabin, what she was fed, whether she was assaulted and how she managed to escape. Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald says Jayme is the hero in this case, naming her kidnapper as 21-year-old Jake Thomas Patterson who, less than 15 minutes later, was in custody after police pulled over his car based on Closs\u2019s description. \u201cJayme is the hero in this case. She\u2019s the one who helped us break this case,\u201d Sheriff Fitzgerald told a news conference on Saturday (AEDT). \u201cThe suspect was out looking for her when law enforcement made contact with him,\u201d he said. He said Patterson worked for just two days at a local turkey factory, where both Jayme\u2019s parents worked, but he was unable to provide details on how he knew about her or whether there was a \u201csocial media connection\u201d. FBI officers were currently combing every room of the cabin to collect evidence while Jayme spent just 24 hours in hospital before being discharged.

Almost 1500 volunteers, roughly half the population of Barron (3400), located 145 kilometres north-east of Minneapolis, combed cornfields and wooded areas refusing to give up the search for Jayme. Patterson, a resident of Gordon, was charged on Friday with allegedly kidnapping and murdering James and Denise Closs with a shotgun. \u201cThe suspect had specific intentions to kidnap Jayme and went to great lengths to prepare to take her,\u201d said Sheriff Fitzgerald. \u201cI know all of you are searching for the answer why any of this happened,\u201d Sheriff Fitzgerald said. \u201cBelieve me, so are we.\u201d Jayme\u2019s aunt and godmother, Jennifer Smith, told Good Morning America she just cried \u201clots of happy tears\u201d after hearing the news her niece had been located. She has since shared\u00a0on social media the first photo of herself with Jayme and her dog, Molly, \u2013 a picture of the duo being reunited at the hospital on Saturday morning (AEDT), saying: \u201cWe said we\u2019d never give up, and we didn\u2019t.\u201d About 350 people under the age of 21 are kidnapped by strangers in the United States each year, according to FBI data.

What a miracle!!! Jayme Closs has been found!!!! I\u2019m so thrilled to hear the news. What has been such a heart wrenching tragedy finally has some happiness in the story. I\u2019m praying for Jayme and all her family that they can have a joyous reunion and as the rest of the country celebrates alongside this happy occasion we all are mindful to give the family their space and privacy on their road to finding a new sense of normal and moving forward. I have no doubt Jayme and her family will forever appreciate the efforts and prayers of the many thousands of people who contributed and kept them in their thoughts and prayers! I hope we may all continue to support and embrace Jayme as she reclaims her life and comes to terms with the reality of her situation. What a brave, strong, and powerful survivor!!!! No matter what may unfold in her story let\u2019s all try to remember that this young woman has SURVIVED and whatever other details may surface the most important will still remain that she is alive.

The result of 15 years of work has been tested on 32 patients in Melbourne and Sydney and showed it could slow the progression of the disease, rather than just treat the symptoms. \u201cIt is a huge breakthrough,\u201d Professor Ashley Bush, chief scientific officer of collaborative medicinal development and director of the Melbourne Dementia Research Centre, said on Friday. \u201cThis is the first human evidence for a disease-modifying drug for motor neurone disease,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to confirming the positive results in a larger study soon.\u201d After six months, the copper-delivery drug CuATSM showed the progression of the disease in patients slowed by about 70 per cent. Participants had improved lung function and cognition and a reduction in the decline of their motor disability. Motor neurone disease is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease with the death of brain cells which control muscle movements, eventually causing paralysis. Patients usually die of respiratory failure within three years of diagnosis and there are no treatments or therapies available. Researchers plan a larger, second stage trial to confirm the drug\u2019s effectiveness in mid to late 2019. \u201cIt is gratifying to see such promising results made possible by collaborative fundamental research at the interface between chemistry and biology,\u201d University of Melbourne Professor Paul Donnelly said. The drug is also being tested on patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. The research comes after the establishment of the Fight MND organisation in 2014 by co-founder and former Melbourne Football club coach Neale Daniher. Mr Daniher went public with his diagnosis and battle with the disease to raise funds and awareness to help find a cure. The findings, by researchers from the Florey Institute and University of Melbourne, were presented at the International Symposium on ALS/MND in Glasgow, Scotland. -AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Seaside 'Ruby' coffee caravan in Yeppoon to be raffled off for $50", "date": "2019-1-8", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/01/08/coffee-caravan-yeppoon-raffle-50/", "transcript": "A central Queensland barista has come up with an innovative way of selling her idyllic seaside business that will see the new owner pick it up for just $50. Rachael Willson is raffling off her custom-made coffee caravan named Ruby, sparking interest from around Australia, and even as far afield as Germany. Ms Willson first parked the 1950s replica beside the Ross Creek boat ramp at Yeppoon on Queensland\u2019s Capricorn Coast about five years ago after it was built over nine months by a local carpenter. She has since grown a vibrant community and a diverse circle of friends around the little blue and white van. \u201cI always get a little bit of itchy feet and I\u2019ve had a lot of customers who\u2019ve said to me they\u2019d love to have a little business like Ruby,\u201d she said. \u201cBut financially, for a lot of people, [starting or buying a business] can be a bit of a strain.\u201d Having read about similar raffles around the world, Ms Willson said she loved the idea and wanted to be the first in Queensland to do it. \u201cIt gives everybody the chance to throw their hat in the ring and I\u2019d love to see it go to somebody that wants it more for passion than financial [reasons], because she\u2019s [Ruby\u2018s] got to be loved,\u201d Ms Willson said. At $50 a ticket, the entry includes a water colour portrait print of Ruby Caravan by local artist, Belinda Reid. Ms Willson hopes to sell 1900 tickets, which is the number of available prints, to raise $95,000. \u201cI probably would\u2019ve made more money by a traditional sale, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Ms Willson said. \u201cI like to help the community and watching people getting excited about what they would do if they won her \u2026 it\u2019s a bit of a thrill.\u201d Commercial sales agent and buyer\u2019s broker Bruce Coudrey said Ms Willson\u2019s plan was a \u201cgutsy\u201d way of overcoming the supply-versus-demand challenge that faced many small business owners who wanted to sell up, especially those in regional areas. \u201cTo get your business out there and stand out from the crowd, this is a really clever technique,\u201d Mr Coudrey said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try these sorts of things, otherwise it\u2019s going to be very hard for a buyer to find it because there are so many others [businesses] to look at. \u201cWe reckon that there\u2019s currently 41,000 businesses for sale across Australia right now and there\u2019s not 41,000 buyers looking to buy small businesses.\u201d Mr Coudrey, whose national agency has sold more than 4000 businesses since 1995, said the childcare sector was about the only industry where the number of buyers outstrip sellers. He said another common hurdle the raffle method would also remove was the issue of finance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not an easy business for a bank to lend money on, so even if a buyer wanted to buy it, getting money from a bank wouldn\u2019t be easy, especially since the royal commission, that\u2019s really tightened up lending,\u201d Mr Coudrey said. However, he said he did not expect raffling off businesses to become commonplace. \u201cWhen you sell a normal business, there\u2019s a lot of little things you need to cover like restriction of trade, gift vouchers, especially with leased premises \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of disclosure documents that need to be completed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for a caravan like this, it works perfectly.\u201d Ms Willson said drawing a winner would be bittersweet, as she is still not used to the idea of giving up her days with Ruby, named after her great grandmother. \u201cI very often open up and see someone sleeping in their car, so you do find a lot of people who have amazing stories, hardship stories,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll stay here in Yeppoon so I get to see her, but if not, I\u2019m just going to have to embrace her new adventure.\u201d And it is not just the caravan she will miss. Ms Willson has developed some special friendships with many of her regular customers. One of those is grey nomad and sailing enthusiast, John Amber. Mr Amber drove his campervan into the Ross Creek car park about two years ago and has spent every morning since perched on the park bench, watching the customers come and go. The 66-year-old was the first to buy a ticket in the raffle but said he has no plans of coming out of retirement. \u201cThe moment they call out my name, there\u2019ll be a For Sale sign right beside it,\u201d Mr Amber said. Too tall to stand up straight inside the van, Mr Amber said if Ruby ended up leaving Yeppoon, it was likely he would pull up stumps and continue north on his own caravan adventure. \u201cI\u2019d move on. I\u2019ve got the old bus over there and I better get somewhere before it rusts out,\u201d Mr Amber said. The raffle will be drawn via a computerised lottery system by Ms Willson\u2019s solicitors when all 1900 tickets are sold. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Stay safe: How to spot a rip at the beach | The New Daily", "date": "2019-1-2", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/01/02/how-to-spot-rip-beach/", "transcript": "The beach can seem like the ultimate destination at any time on\u00a0the long, hot days of the Australian summer.

A fifth person was saved by volunteer guards while swimming between the flags. \u201cWe saw an increase in the strength and frequency of rip currents last season, so it\u2019s important that people become familiar with how to identify, avoid and escape rip currents,\u201d\u00a0LSV acting life saving operations manager Kane Treloar said. \u201cThey can occur at all beaches, even in bays.\u201d He urged beachgoers looking for relief from the hot weather to draw a line in the sand when they get to the beach \u2013 and to stop, look and plan before rushing into the water. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that people realise just how dangerous beaches can be, even when the weather is nice,\u201d he said.  Associate Professor Rob Brander, from the University of New South Wales, told the ABC that surf life savers\u2019 red and yellow flags were an extremely effective way to keep people safe, but it was not possible to patrol every stretch of beach on the Australian coastline. \u201cIt is rare for people to drown between the flags, but we simply don\u2019t have enough flags,\u201d\u00a0Professor Brander said. \u201cWe hear the message to swim between the flags so often that we kind of switch off, and there\u2019s a dangerous complacency about swimming at unpatrolled beaches. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand things like rip currents and dangerous breaking waves, and you are not a good swimmer, you are at such incredible risk when you swim at an unpatrolled beach.\u201d Gold Coast chief lifeguard Warren Young said patrolled areas offered the greatest security for swimmers. \u201cWe are really saying \u2018go where the guardians are\u2019 \u2013 where the life guards and professional people are and the life savers,\u201d\u00a0Mr Young told the ABC. \u201cIf you go for a swim on an open beach on this coastline and if you are not a surfer or an experienced surf life saver and you have no floatation and your kids get into trouble, someone\u2019s going to drown.\u201d Information about patrolled beach locations and times is available at\u00a0beachsafe.org.au, and by downloading the Beachsafe app."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "From television to the economy, there's a lot to look forward to in 2019 | The New Daily", "date": "2018-12-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/12/31/reasons-looking-forward-2019/", "transcript": "Another year is over and we say goodbye to a mixed 2018 punctuated by political manoeuvrings and scandals, tragedies and heroic triumphs, and angry tweets and global\u00a0uncertainty. While we don\u2019t have access to a crystal ball, The New Daily has identified more than a few reasons to look forward to 2019. Game of Thrones\u00a0fans\u00a0are\u00a0looking forward to\u00a0their long wait to end\u00a0with the\u00a0final instalment from Westeros expected in April. Winter is well and truly here, and the show\u2019s producers have not only promised answers to all the tantalising/irritating questions posed in the previous seven seasons, they\u2019ll also give us the the bloodthirsty final battle\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0been waiting for. As Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) told Entertainment Weekly in November, the\u00a0final battle \u201cmakes the Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park\u201d.  While Canberra bears little resemblance to the Westeros capital of Kings Landing, the political bloodshed and recriminations spawned by the\u00a0 Liberal leadership spill in August was worthy of a Game of Thrones plot. Regardless of political machinations, Australians will have their\u00a0own chance to decide who leads their nation when they go to the polls for a federal election this year. While the date is yet to be announced, an election must be held by May at the latest. And if the polls are to be believed, Bill Shorten could be prime minister\u00a0with\u00a0a landslide victory in less than six months. While 2018 was plagued by talk of an impending housing market collapse, low wage growth and record household debt, much of that has overlooked a fairly important detail: Australia\u2019s economy remains a \u201cstandout\u201d among developed economies. Global consultancy firm Deloitte\u00a0pointed out in October that \u201cAustralia\u2019s economy remains on a steady trajectory\u201d despite the nation\u2019s seemingly unending political turmoil. The Reserve Bank agrees, noting in its November statement on monetary policy that \u201cdomestic economic conditions have been a bit stronger\u201d than predicted in the previous statement in August. There could also be good news for\u00a0pay packets\u00a0in 2019, with the RBA predicting a \u201cmodest pick-up\u201d in wages, supported by the steady falls in unemployment seen through the past year. Deloitte shared this view, as did the OECD in\u00a0its economic forecast summary from November, adding the RBA will need to monitor its policies as wages increase. And if you were worried about the value of your home, the \u201ccrash\u201d that Australia\u2019s property market has been supposedly barrelling toward will probably turn out to be something of a \u201csoft landing\u201d this year, according to property expert Michael Yardney. \u201cI\u2019m calling it a soft landing because there are very few forced sales at present, and only recently (December 2018) APRA have lifted their restrictions on interest-only loans to investors and the RBA Governor has encouraged the banks to lend more,\u201d he said in an article published on December 26. This year, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious plan to revolutionise the global internet is expected to take another leap as\u00a0SpaceX looks into raising a further $US500 million ($710 million) in private equity to make his plan to take the internet to the developing world a reality. Called Starlink, the project will see Space X launch 12,000 satellites to create a network of delivering the world wide web to every corner of the world. Gamers will rejoice as yet another console is rendered redundant by the\u00a0possible release of Sony\u2019s next-generation PlayStation 5 (PS5). Shawn Layden, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, recently confirmed to German website,\u00a0Golem.de,\u00a0to expect the PS5 in 2019. Speculation as to what it will offer has raged ever since. With a women\u2019s World Cup looming, 2019 might be the year Australia stakes its claim to having the world\u2019s best footballer. Sam Kerr was nominated for the inaugural female Ballon d\u2019Or in 2018, but lost out to Norway\u2019s Ada Hegerberg. TND\u2019s\u00a0sports editor Francis Leach says Kerr is every bit as good as\u00a0Hegerberg\u00a0and if she\u00a0plays with the full range of her talent at June\u2019s World Cup in\u00a0France,\u00a0she will become Australia\u2019s most celebrated sports star, and the Matildas its most venerated team.  English cricket fans, meanwhile, are salivating at the prospect of hounding the \u201ccheating Aussies\u201d when they arrive to defend the Ashes in August. While current performances from\u00a0Tim Paine\u2019s Australian team\u00a0has been underwhelming, the potential return of the \u201cCape Town trio\u201d of David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft significantly boosts\u00a0the baggy green batting stocks and makes them a real chance to retain the urn, despite the howls of derision and the insults that will rain down upon them wherever they go.

The military says the NORAD Tracks Santa won\u2019t be affected by the government shutdown because it is run by volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado and is funded by the Department of Defence budget that was approved earlier this year. Now in its 63rd year, the Santa tracker became a Christmas Eve tradition after a mistaken phone call to the Continental Air Defence Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1955. CONAD, as it was known, had the serious job of monitoring a far-flung radar network for any sign of a nuclear attack on the US. When Colonel Harry Shoup picked up the phone that day, he found himself talking not to a military general, but to a child who wanted to speak to Santa Claus. A Colorado Springs newspaper had run an ad inviting kids to call Santa but mistakenly listed the hotline number. Colonel Shoup figured out what had happened and played along. The tradition has since mushroomed into an elaborate operation that attracts tens of thousands of calls every year. For the 1500 civilian and military volunteers who will answer the phones for kids calling 1-877-HI-NORAD, it infuses the holiday with childlike wonder. \u201cThey\u2019re all really sweet, small voices,\u201d said Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer the phones in two previous years. The North American Aerospace Defence Command \u2013 a joint US-Canadian operation based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that protects the skies over both countries \u2013 has taken over the Santa tracker since the tradition started. The military command centre embraced and expanded the Santa-tracking mission and has been rewarded with a bounty of goodwill and good publicity. In the event of a government shutdown, NORAD will continue with its 63-year tradition of NORAD Tracks Santa on Dec. 24. Military personnel who conduct NORAD Tracks Santa are supported by approximately 1,500 volunteers who make the program possible each and every year. pic.twitter.com/fY0oyjrdDc \u2014 NORAD & USNORTHCOM (@Norad_Northcom) December 21, 2018 Last year, NORAD Tracks Santa drew 126,000 phone calls, 18 million website hits, 1.8 million followers on Facebook and 179,000 more on Twitter. It takes 160 phones to handle the calls that pour in. New volunteers get a playbook that briefs them on the questions kids might ask. Big screens on the walls show a Santa icon making blistering progress around the globe. US and Canadian officers do live TV interviews from the phone rooms. \u201cIt really gets you into the Christmas spirit,\u201d said Hill, a student at Mississippi State University who got involved through Air Force family members stationed in Colorado Springs. One year, she took a call from a boy who began reading a very long Christmas list. \u201cI remember having to cut him off after the 10th present or so,\u201d she said, explaining to him that she had to take calls from other children. Sometimes the volunteers have to handle the unexpected.

The previous couple in the home said the painting was already there when they purchased the house from a Swiss man in 1962. When Tracy and his wife moved to a different house in the area, they paid $52,500 to add a sunroom big enough to display the painting. \u201cThis painting was a beautiful painting, and we treasured it,\u201d Gabby Tracy, 84, said on Saturday. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t help but admire the fine painting, what detail was in Ivan\u2019s face.\u201d But as they made plans to move to a condominium in Maine last year, they realised the painting wouldn\u2019t fit. They hired an auctioning company near Washington to sell the work, which was appraised at about $US5000 ($7100). After the auction house added the painting to its catalogue, though, an employee received an urgent email from an art museum in Ukraine. \u201cAttention! Painting \u2018Ivan the Terrible\u2019 was in the collection of the Dnepropetrovsk Art Museum until 1941 and was stolen during the Second World War,\u201d the email said, according to court documents. \u201cPlease stop selling this painting at auction!!!\u201d The museum identified the painting as a 1911 work by Mikhail Panin, titled Secret Departure of Ivan the Terrible Before the Oprichina. It was a permanent exhibit at the Ukrainian museum until 1941 but disappeared during Nazi occupation of the city. FBI officials took custody of the painting and later traced it to the Swiss man who sold the Ridgefield home in 1962. Officials didn\u2019t release his name but said he moved to the US in 1946 after serving in the Swiss Army. He died in 1986. Gabby Tracy said it\u2019s unknown how he obtained the painting. After learning it had been stolen, the Tracy couple agreed the painting should be returned to Ukraine. The story particularly moved Gabby, who was born in Slovakia and survived the Holocaust. Her father, Samuel Weiss, died in a concentration camp. \u201cThere was never a question that it was going back.

The heavily armoured, club-tailed ankylosaurs are thought to have stopped themselves from overheating in the Cretaceous sun by using their long and twisting nasal passages. These acted as radiators, transferring heat from the body to the inhaled air and cooling blood on its way to the brain. Ruger Porter, one of the study\u2019s co-authors, said: \u201cWhen we reconstructed the blood vessels, based on bony grooves and canals, we found a rich blood supply running right next to these convoluted nasal passages. \u201cHot blood from the body core would travel through these blood vessels and transfer their heat to the incoming air. \u201cSimultaneously, evaporation of moisture in the long nasal passages cooled the venous blood destined for the brain.\u201d Researchers from Ohio University and the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine published their findings in the journal PLOS ONE. They used CT scanning and engineering to simulate how air moved through the nasal passages of two different ankylosaur species, the hippo-sized Panoplosaurus and larger rhino-sized Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurs were good at retaining heat but struggled to shed it, putting them at risk of overheating even on cloudy days. The results \u201cclearly showed\u201d that nose length was key to their air-conditioning ability, with heat-transfer rates dropping more than 50 per cent when a shorter nose model was tested. This natural engineering feat \u201cmay have allowed the evolution of the great sizes of so many dinosaurs\u201d, they believe. The most elaborate noses were found in the larger dinosaur species, suggesting they may have evolved as a response to the \u201cphysiological stresses of large body size\u201d. -AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Story behind Paul Kelly's How to Make Gravy | The New Daily", "date": "2018-12-21", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/12/21/make-gravy-paul-kelly-christmas/", "transcript": "It\u2019s 22 years since Paul Kelly first narrated the story of a prisoner named Joe and his longing to be with family at Christmas time in his hit song How To Make Gravy. In the song Joe writes a letter to his family \u2013 penned on December 21 \u2013 that includes a recipe for how to make gravy for Christmas dinner. Fans of the tune have since coined December 21 as \u201cGravy Day\u201d. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen to the song after you write them,\u201d Kelly told ABC Radio. \u201cIt was a song that doesn\u2019t have a chorus, it\u2019s set in prison, so I never thought it would be a hit song or anything.\u201d In 1996, Kelly was invited to record a song for an annual charity Christmas album organised by fellow musician Lindsay Field. When Kelly discovered his chosen cover song had been performed on a previous year\u2019s compilation, Field encouraged him to write an original. With no shortage of existing Christmas songs, Kelly\u2019s challenge was to come up with something unique and distinctly his own. \u201cI started thinking \u2026 maybe I\u2019ll write it from the point of view of somebody who is missing Christmas, who can\u2019t get to Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they get there? Maybe they\u2019re overseas and they can\u2019t get home. Then I thought, oh, he\u2019s in prison. \u201cThe song wrote itself from there.\u201d Kelly said he had played the song quite a few times in correctional institutions, to mixed responses from the audiences. \u201cIt\u2019s funny playing in prisons because some of the audience like it and some of them couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a normal gig.\u201d More than two decades since\u00a0How to Make Gravy\u00a0was written, Kelly now includes\u00a0it in every live setlist.

But there are, on occasion, a few gaps that could possibly be filled by more nuanced words. How useful would it be to have a single word to describe waking up in the morning still drunk from the night before, for example? In Denmark, (where the legal drinking age is just 16), they do have a word for the condition\u00a0\u2013 \u201cbagstiv\u201d. The hardcore Russians, meanwhile, have the very specific \u201czapoi\u201d\u00a0\u2013 two or more days of drunkenness usually involving a journey or waking up in an unexpected place. With the festive season upon us, it might be handy to have a collection of succinct and descriptive foreign expressions in case you find a good reason to employ them. Here\u2019s our pick of some of the best: Packesel: From the German for \u201cburro\u201d, the Packesel is the person who ends up carrying everyone else\u2019s bags on a holiday. Gjensynsglede: Norwegian for the joy of meeting someone you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Iktsuarpok: An Inuit word meaning being so excited about seeing someone that you have to constantly go to the door or look out the window to see if they\u2019re coming. Gigil: Tagalog for a favourite move the elderly often pull on the young \u2013 the cheek pinch, arm or thigh squeeze, in reaction to adorable cuteness. Tartle: A Scottish word for that panicky hesitation when you\u2019re about to introduce someone whose name you suddenly can\u2019t remember. Gluggave\u00f0ur: An Icelandic word meaning \u201cwindow weather\u201d\u00a0\u2013 weather that is nice to see, but not to be in. It could apply just as equally to Australia\u2019s sweaty\u00a0Christmas as Iceland\u2019s frigid, white one. Struisvogelpolitiek: Translates from the Dutch as \u201costrich politics\u201d. The ever-so-polite Dutch employ this to pretend they didn\u2019t notice something (like a fart at the dinner table). The Germans and the Finns, on the other hand, suffer Fremdsch\u00e4men (German)or my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 (Finnish) \u2013\u00a0\u201cvicarious embarrassment\u201d. Drachenfutter:\u00a0Translates\u00a0from\u00a0German as \u201cdragon fodder\u201d. It refers to the food a man uses to mollify his wife or girlfriend after he has annoyed her\u00a0(\u201cHere, my love, have another cherry liqueur chocolate\u201d). Sitzfleisch:\u00a0German for the ability to persevere through hard or boring tasks (literally \u201csit meat\u201d).\u00a0Such as a long Christmas lunch. Desenrascan\u00e7o:\u00a0A Portuguese word meaning to disentangle oneself from a troublesome situation. Backpfeifengesicht: German for a face ripe for a slap. Kummerspeck: Another German gem, it translates literally\u00a0as \u201cgrief bacon\u201d \u2013\u00a0the extra weight put on from emotional overeating. Tyvsmake: A Norwegian verb meaning to taste small pieces of the food when you think nobody is watching, usually while cooking. Shemomedjamo: A Georgian\u00a0word for the act of continuing to eat when you\u2019re full just because it just tastes so good. (See also \u201cgula\u201d, the Spanish version.) Lagom: From the ever-moderate Swedes, this translates roughly as \u201cjust enough\u201d, \u201ca fair share\u201d, or \u201ca sufficient amount\u201d. Sobremesa: Spanish for that delightful period when the food has finished and bellies are full but the conversation is still flowing. Borrell: Dutch for an informal party or casual drinks. Schnapsidee:\u00a0The word for an ingenious plan hatched by drunk Germans. Erkl\u00e4rungsnot:\u00a0German for the state of having to explain yourself quickly. Jayus: Indonesian for a story or joke so badly told you can\u2019t help but laugh. Like those found in a Christmas cracker. Pihentagy\u00fa: Hungarian for quick-witted people who can come up with sophisticated jokes or bon mots. L\u2019esprit de l\u2019escalier: This is French for \u201cstairwell wit\u201d\u00a0\u2013 that pithy retort we think of when the person has just left. It is also known in German as Treppenwitz\u00a0(stair wit). Desbundar: Portuguese for shedding one\u2019s inhibitions and getting down to having fun.

She\u2019s keen to spin a new reputation for the eight-legged critters which are part of an interactive exhibition. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of vendetta you go on where you\u2019ve got to get the word out there because no-one else is doing that.\u201d Ms Henderson has spent so much time researching spiders\u00a0\u2013 and defending them\u00a0\u2013 that she categorises the people who fear them into two broad types. \u201cThere are the ones that are a bit repulsed by them; they\u2019ve been told their whole life that they\u2019re disgusting and dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you start by just showing them something different, something they didn\u2019t expect, and then they get interested and they want to find out more.\u201d The second type\u00a0\u2013 severe arachnophobes\u00a0\u2013 pose more of an uphill battle, she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really get through that with just, \u2018here\u2019s a spider, let\u2019s look at it\u2019. In October, MAGNT put the call out for someone to professionally care for a colony of live spiders for its display. The job ad went mildly viral. Duties: day-to-day care of all live spiders, maintaining food and educating visitors. More than 50 spiders were flown to Darwin in the luggage compartment of a plane, unbeknown to passengers in the cabin above, while their environments were freighted by road. The invertebrate zookeeper needed to ensure those on display, and their understudies, were in good shape. \u201cNot all of them will be on display in the exhibition,\u201d Richard Wilan, the museum\u2019s senior curator of molluscs, explained in October. The role would also require meticulous attention to the spiders\u2019 health, right down to breeding the insects they would eat. \u201cSo all of the different spiders, and I think we\u2019ve got a total of around 60 spiders coming, will need care and attention\u00a0\u2013 even on Christmas Day,\u201d Dr Wilan said. Ms Henderson landed the job, and over the next few months she\u2019ll pay meticulous attention to the cluster\u2019s wellbeing. What their posture, movement and appearance says about their health she has down to a tee. She will also attempt to reform their image in the eyes of a cautious public and bust a handful of common myths to boot. Daddy-long-legs spiders are the most venomous in the world\u00a0\u2013 myth. White-tailed spider bites cause necrosis\u00a0\u2013 myth. \u201cThe idea that white tails cause necrosis or any kind of horrible bacterial infection came about from a misdiagnosis in the \u201980s and we\u2019re still trying to repair that damage,\u201d she said. So why are these reputations so enduring? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever get past that idea that these are all deadly creatures that must die, but you can definitely see how these myths travel much faster than the very boring truth of them just being regular animals.\u201d Despite arranging for the exhibition to travel to Darwin, even MAGNT\u2019s director Marcus Schutenko harbours a fear of spiders. \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet people who just don\u2019t see spiders as something to be fearful of at all and working alongside them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anybody coming into this exhibition, the way it\u2019s been set up, is I think any arachnophobic tendencies someone has are lessened. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get people fearful of them\u00a0\u2013 in fact we\u2019re trying to do the opposite.\u201d So far, for him at least, it\u2019s worked.

Katherine Connor Martin, the company\u2019s head of US dictionaries, said there had been a marked uptick of interest in the word on its website\u00a0in the past year. But the word was chosen less for statistical reasons, she said, than for the sheer variety of contexts in which it has proliferated, from conversations about environmental poisons to laments about today\u2019s poisonous political discourse to the #MeToo movement, with its calling out of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. In fact, Ms Martin said, the committee initially considered choosing \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d until it realised how widespread \u201ctoxic\u201d had become. Oxford\u2019s word of the year is chosen to reflect \u201cthe ethos, mood or preoccupations\u201d of a particular year, but also to highlight that English is always changing. Last year\u2019s winner was \u201cyouthquake\u201d. In 2016, it was \u201cpost-truth.\u201d \u201cToxic\u201d derives from the Greek \u201ctoxikon pharmakon,\u201d meaning \u201cpoison for arrows\u201d. The current entry in the online Oxford English Dictionary dates its earliest known printed occurrence to 1664. Other words on the shortlist highlight different ways words emerge or evolve. While \u201ctoxic\u201d is an old and common word that has expanded in usage, \u201cincel\u201d \u2013 short for \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d \u2013 is an example of jargon used by a limited group that suddenly enters widespread usage. In that case, it came to prominence in April, after it was reported that the young man who drove a van into a crowded sidewalk in Toronto, killing 10 people, appeared to be connected to a now-banned Reddit community of resentful self-identified male \u201cincels\u201d. Then there\u2019s \u201ctechlash,\u201d defined as \u201ca strong and widespread negative reaction to the growing power and influence of large technology companies, particularly those based in Silicon Valley\u201d.

It was truly remarkable on so many levels.\u201d Leigh turned down an invitation to be at the documentary\u2019s premiere because of the fresh challenge he\u2019s set himself \u2013 to build a new normality with son Hugh, 4. \u201cI\u2019m sort of craving just rebuilding my every day a bit more,\u201d he told The New Daily. \u201cThe Hawaii experience was so amazing and perfect and is captured in the documentary. There\u2019s plenty for me to do at home. I don\u2019t feel the need to push for anything more. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say, just to be.\u201d Sara was a triathlon competitor herself, and \u201cKona was their dream as a family,\u201d her close friend Mia Greves, who helped bring Leigh\u2019s story to the attention of Ironman, told The New Daily. \u201cI\u2019m a little less heartbroken knowing I could do something to honour her and Alfie. In a different life, Sara, Hugh and Alfie would have all been cheering for Leigh as he crossed the finish line. \u201cAt least Hugh can look at this documentary when he\u2019s older knowing how his mum and her friends helped make this all happen.\u201d On a Thursday morning, Leigh is working from home after dropping Hugh at childcare. \u201cI\u2019ve done some tax, there\u2019s washing on the line, some I need to fold and some cleaning to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day-to-day things with Hugh are what I\u2019m concentrating on. \u201cWith the Sara and Alfie journey, I dealt with it trying to look to the next thing I had to do and could do. Now I don\u2019t mind the idea of spending a little bit of time not latching on to the next thing, just letting whatever comes next happen. \u201cThere\u2019s some time at the beach we didn\u2019t get to do. Hugh and I might do that this summer. I think feeling normal is what will make me happy.\u201d Still on a high from Kona, Leigh \u201cfelt glorious\u201d for most of the nearly 10-hour event: \u201cThere\u2019s been a couple of days in my life where I thought everything just went perfectly. One was my wedding day, and the other was that race.\u201d Leigh admitted\u00a0there were \u201cdefinitely\u201d super challenging moments. \u201cI felt so much gratitude. I just kept telling myself how lucky I was to be out there, with Sara and Alfie in mind that they couldn\u2019t be.\u201d While competing is \u201cwhere you can be fully and wholly yourself\u201d, his late wife and son were on his mind during the race. \u201cI think I had some thoughts in the swim where it went really smoothly and I felt I had a protective ring around me, but that seemed ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThen in the ride I had a feeling of satisfaction they were watching from somewhere but the flip side is I also got quite sad I couldn\u2019t share it with them. Especially Sara. I feel she would have got a big kick out of it.\u201d About five\u00a0kilometres into the run, Simon Johnson, a four-time Kona finisher and Chivers\u2019 friend of 15 years through running and triathlon clubs, was passed by Leigh. \u201cHe ran by looking a million bucks,\u201d Johnson told The New Daily. \u201cSometimes when you have people go past you, you know you\u2019ll see them later, it\u2019s such a long day. But I knew I wasn\u2019t going to see Leigh again. \u201cHe was motivated by more than a normal person can get motivated by. He is incredibly strong willed, a truly impressive athlete with a great engine on him.\u201d Near the finish, Leigh put on a gold \u2018Alfie\u2019 superhero cape and Hugh was passed over a barrier for a quick kiss. Then Leigh pumped a fist and looked to the sky. \u201cThat was just sending Alfie and Sara a signal, blowing them a kiss. It felt pretty natural, and just seemed like the right place to look,\u201d he said. \u201cI was probably smiling and laughing and thinking, \u2018I am in a world of pain right now and this is the greatest thing ever\u2019. \u201cIt blows my mind to think of the happiness and sadness you can have in a single moment.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Elon Musk's Tesla-driving Starman just rocketed past mars", "date": "2018-11-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/11/06/elon-musk-tesla-starman-mars/", "transcript": "Elon Musk\u2019s space-bound Tesla Roaster\u00a0with its dummy \u201cStarman\u201d at the wheel has just cruised past Mars.

But when Ear Spring geyser in Yellowstone National Park in northern United States erupted, it fired rocks, water and trash metres into the air. \u201cOn September 15, 2018, Ear Spring erupted and ejected lots of decades-old trash,\u201d Yellowstone said on its Facebook page. In a live video on Facebook, park staff detailed the trash they had found from the eruption, which included a cinderblock, cigarette butts, a 1930s baby pacifier, a grizzly bear warning sign, and nearly 100 coins. Some of the items \u2014 which somehow survived inside the boiling-hot spring \u2014 were historic and may end up in Yellowstone\u2019s archives. \u201cStuff like this that can tell us a story, and the history of how people were unfortunately using the spring while they were visiting it, will definitely be added to the collections,\u201d Yellowstone museum curator Colleen Curry said. Despite the detritus-laden time capsule giving park authorities a glimpse of artefacts from decades ago, they were adamant that visitors not throw their refuse into the springs. \u201cWhen the vent becomes completely plugged, as it has in several springs in the park, then the spring can actually plug up to the point where it\u2019s not a hot spring anymore and it\u2019ll go dormant or it\u2019ll die,\u201d park ranger Rebecca Roland said. Yellowstone spokeswoman Linda Veress said the combination of increased tourism and tourists continuing to throw garbage into the geysers has affected springs like Handkerchief Pool. \u201c[Handkerchief Pool] stopped functioning some time in the 1920s or \u201930s. It stopped because people threw coins, broken bottles, rocks, hairpins, and a small horseshoe into it about 100 years ago,\u201d she said. Other springs like the Morning Glory pool have over time transformed from a deep blue colour to yellow and green due to the chemical composition in the spring changing thanks to garbage clogging it up. Ear Spring erupts very rarely, and is a more docile neighbour of the famous Old Faithful geyser. The US Geological Survey says Ear Spring has only erupted four times in the last 60 years, with the last significant burst of activity coming in 1957. \u201cThe next time Ear Spring erupts we hope it\u2019s nothing but natural rocks and water,\u201d Yellowstone National Park wrote on Facebook. \u201cYou can help by never throwing anything into Yellowstone\u2019s thermal features.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "The New Daily 'extremely proud' of record growth | The New Daily", "date": "2018-11-2", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/11/02/new-daily-record-growth/", "transcript": "Only days away from its fifth birthday, Australian-owned digital news website\u00a0The New Daily has continued to clock record growth in 2018.

But it was that nerdiness which led him to make history. On Thursday, in between\u00a0 studying and his favourite video gaming, Connor witnessed the major impact of his actions. That moment came when the new $50 note entered circulation \u2013 one Connor and 360,000 visually impaired Australians like him can read properly. It\u2019s the first $50 to include tactile markings which enable blind people, like Connor, to differentiate it from other notes. And it happened as a result of a major, relentless campaign he ran with the help of his mum when he was 12. \u201cIt started in Christmas 2012, when I received some Christmas money and couldn\u2019t tell how generous, or for that matter how cheap, my folks had been!\u201d\u00a0Connor said\u00a0when he discovered his campaign had been successful. When Connor discovered the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) already printed tactile markings on banknotes for other countries, but not for Australia, he was \u2018flabbergasted\u2019. \u201cI remember saying, \u2018What? Oh no you don\u2019t!\u201d The RBA said they needed convincing of the need for Australian tactile markings. Our notes are different sizes, but Connor argued he needed an easier way to ensure he wouldn\u2019t be \u201cripped off\u201d when given change and not having other notes to compare it with. He and his mum started a\u00a0Change.org\u00a0petition\u00a0targeting the RBA, amassing 57,000 signatures. \u201cThat kind of proved the need,\u201d he says. Using all the signatures on his petition as leverage, they targeted MPs for a meeting, leading to a Canberra trip where Connor and his mum met cabinet ministers. \u201cHe spoke surprisingly eloquently,\u201d Ally says. In addition to pressuring MPs and the RBA with the petition, they put in a complaint to the Human Rights Commission. They declared\u00a0victory\u00a0on their petition in February 2015 \u2013 but the impact continues year after year, as each new banknote is released. The $5 note has one \u2018bump,\u2019 the $10 has two and the new $50 has four. Next year\u2019s new $20 note will have three bumps. Connor\u2019s mum, Ally Lancaster, said Thursday was special. \u201cEach time a new banknote gets released, I just feel very proud of my boy,\u201d she tells\u00a0The New Daily.\u00a0\u201cHe saw something that wasn\u2019t right, wanted to fix it and saw it through.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that,\u201d Connor says. \u201cMy head will get so big, I\u2019ll get stuck in my bedroom!\u201d Humour has kept the family going through darker times. Ally remembers when Connor\u2019s blindness was first diagnosed. \u201cIt was absolutely devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cI cried a lot. They initially thought it was a brain tumour. It was so scary. Someone was going to cut into my baby\u2019s head. \u201cBut then they discovered it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Ally continues. \u201cAnd I kicked myself up the backside saying \u2018he doesn\u2019t have cancer, it\u2019s just his eyes aren\u2019t working\u2019.\u201d Connor says: \u201cThe first blind joke was made four hours after diagnosis \u2026\u00a0 tell it Mum.\u201d \u201cI was very, very upset\u201d Ally remembers. \u201cI was sat in this room with my mum feeling really frightened, thinking, \u2018how am I going to raise him?\u2019 But then I turned to mum and said, \u2018Oh well, it\u2019ll save me on Christmas wrapping!\u2019. \u201cAs I grew into my role of a parent of a vision-impaired child, I realised how capable he is. His limitations are those that others put on him because they don\u2019t know better.\u201d The banknotes campaign wasn\u2019t the first time Connor has righted a wrong. In year 5, he qualified to represent his school at cross country, but they said he couldn\u2019t. \u201cHe came home very upset and said he was only blind, his legs weren\u2019t painted on,\u201d Ally says. \u201cInitially the Education Department stood by the school, but we told his story on social media and to journalists, and now, thanks to Connor, vision-impaired people can represent their schools at cross country with guided runners.\u201d Life today is busy for Connor. He has a girlfriend in WA he met at Braille Music Camp, which he has attended yearly since 2015. He loves medieval themed audio books. Now he\u2019s\u00a0sizing\u00a0up universities with a plan to study coding and app development. \u201cBut I need to find a university that\u2019s good at audio, rather than just visual learning, and that\u2019s proving a challenge.\u201d Like every other challenge, it\u2019s something his mum knows he\u2019ll meet. \u201cWith new technology, I know there\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t do if he doesn\u2019t put his mind to it,\u201d Ally says. Connor agrees. The role reversal in care has already started. \u201cI\u2019m still fixing all your text problems for you, Mum!\u201d he says.

Fearnley wasn\u2019t present for the annual SAHOF function in Melbourne, having chosen to remain in the United States after racing in the Chicago marathon last weekend to spend time with wife Sheridan and young children Harry and Amelia. But his speech still held an audience of Australia\u2019s sporting greats and luminaries from the worlds of politics and big business spellbound with its messages of hope and inclusion. \u201cThrough the medium of sport that\u2019s what our movement represents \u2013 hope,\u201d he said. \u201cHope, that if sport can adjust to include those with disabilities, maybe the community can follow. \u201cI fundamentally believe that sport can lead this country and I believe the Paralympic movement is a jewel within the sporting crown.\u201d Fearnley also called for people with disabilities to be given more opportunities in sports administration and governance, as well as on the fields of play. \u201cLet\u2019s lead the way.

It is pretty and big,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say it is about twice the size of the Asian house geckos you would find in your house which is quite slender, whereas these ones are much chunkier.\u201d Asian house geckos are one of the most successful invasive species in Australia, and biologists have recently\u00a0raised concerns they\u2019re spreading from suburbia into bushland. The new gecko is the first reptile known to be local to the Gregory Range, which Dr Hoskin said is relatively unknown. He said it has probably been sighted before but has been assumed to be one of the others similar species. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people would come into contact with them day to day,\u201d he said. Dr Hoskin said the gecko didn\u2019t face many threats, but more surveys were needed to learn more about it. \u201cThey eat anything they can fit in their mouth. Lots of insects, spiders, and some baby geckos,\u201d he said. The geckos are typically found at night foraging on sandstone cliff faces and pavements but have also been found on small, thin trees and emerging from narrow rock crevices at dusk. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Seven-year-old's rendition of anthem goes viral", "date": "2018-9-26", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/09/26/girl-anthem-la-galaxy-match/", "transcript": "A seven-year-old\u2019s stunning rendition of the US national anthem at a Los Angeles soccer match has become a viral sensation.

Officers found the meerkit at a house in the town of Beverley on Friday night. It had been reported missing from its enclosure two days earlier. WA Police said a 22-year-old man would be summonsed for the offence of stealing and a 23-year-old woman would be summonsed for receiving. Zoo staff noticed the baby meerkat was missing from its enclosure on Wednesday afternoon, less than 24 hours before an event to introduce the animal to the public. Staff were unsure whether the meerkat had been stolen or taken by a predatory bird. WA Police have confirmed it was stolen and said it was found in Beverley, a small town about 130 kilometres south-east of Perth. \u201cAs a result of inquiries by Kensington Police, a search warrant was executed at a house in Beverley around 6pm [last night],\u201d a police spokesman said. \u201cThe baby meerkat was located at the house and was conveyed back to the zoo by a veterinarian. The zoo said the meerkit was back in expert care and staff were busy preparing to reintroduce it back successfully with its family. Senior vet Simone Vitali said the animal would be returned to its mother soon. \u201cHe was very stressed and tired and hungry, just like any bub that\u2019s been away from mum,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after an evening of getting his favourite foods and getting a bit of warmth and a bit of quiet, he\u2019s really bounced back quite well, so we\u2019re quite happy with his progress so far. \u201cHe\u2019s still not out of the woods, we\u2019ve still got to get him back with the group and hope that they accept him as one of theirs and they haven\u2019t decided to reject him, so we\u2019re still in very early days.\u201d Ms Vitali said the safety of the meerkat enclosure may need to be reviewed following the incident. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got these open facilities, which you need [in order] to give the animals good welfare, you like to have them open and have lots of sunlight, lots of air, lots of height,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you have animals in those sorts of facilities there\u2019s always the risk of theft, there\u2019s always the risk of predatory birds. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to need to review quite carefully now that this has happened to see if we need to make changes.\u201d Speaking on Thursday after the meerkat was taken, the zoo\u2019s curator of operations, John Lemon, said the newborn was under almost-constant watch. But he admitted there was a small window in which it could have been taken. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an effort to get into our meerkat enclosure.

Ironically, the answer to the mystery of the Endeavour\u2019s final resting place could be the same location as Australia\u2019s greatest sailing victory. It was found in Newport, Rhode Island where the John Bertrand-skippered Australia II won the America\u2019s Cup in 1983. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work ahead, but it is an exciting day,\u201d Australian National Maritime Museum director Kevin Sumption told AAP on Saturday (Friday local time). A 25-year-long archaeological study of transport ships deliberately sunk by the British in Newport Harbour during the American War of Independence in 1778 led to a wreck that fits the dimensions of the Endeavour. The results of the study were announced at a press conference held by Dr Kathy Abbass, founder of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project. The Endeavour, through its lifetime, was used for different purposes. After Captain Cook took it on his historic voyage to Australia and the South Pacific from 1768 to 1771 it was re-fitted into a transportation vessel. It was renamed the Lord Sandwich II and in 1775 was used to take German mercenaries to Newport and New York before its final refit into a prison ship. It is believed the British sunk the Lord Sandwich II and 12 other British ships in Newport Harbour as a tactic to block the French, who were allies of rebelling American colonists, from entering in 1778. Divers on Thursday carefully took four samples from the potential Endeavour. Three will be delivered to separate laboratories around the world, with one location possibly Australia, to confirm if it is timber grown in the north of England in the early part of the 18th century. That would match the timber used for the Endeavour. The fourth sample will be stored and archived. Archaeologists believe it is likely the Endeavour because the shipwreck matches the size of the 360 tonne vessel Captain Cook sailed. A final piece in the puzzle will be if evidence is found the wreck was formerly a prison ship. \u201cWhat will ultimately determine which of the ships is Endeavour is if we are lucky enough to do an excavation that finds evidence that it was used as a prison hulk,\u201d Mr Sumption said. \u201cThat will be the definitive evidence really.\u201d Despite the historical significance of the Endeavour to Australia and New Zealand, if it is determined it is Captain Cook\u2019s former ship it will remain in Rhode Island at the bottom of the harbour. \u201cThe legal ownership of the vessel is incontestable,\u201d Mr Sumption said. \u201cIt is Kathy\u2019s and RIMAP\u2019s under Rhode Island salvage law. \u201cWhat we hope to continue to do with Kathy is with her permission, and the Rhode Island authorities, is look for a loan of a small amount of material at some point when there is a positive identification and we can help with preservation. \u201cUltimately that will be something that is over a year or possibly a couple of years away.\u201d -AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Greek lakefront covered in 300-metre-long web | The New Daily", "date": "2018-9-20", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/09/20/spider-web-greece/", "transcript": "Spiders enjoying warmer weather and boom in their favourite food have created an eerie 300-metre-long web along\u00a0the shore of a lagoon in western Greece.

Workers at the Beta Hunt mine near the small town of Kambalda, 630 kilometres east of Perth, have brought more than $15 million worth of gold specimens to the surface in just four days. The gold-encrusted rocks were found about 500 metres below the surface in an area just three metres wide and three metres high. The largest specimen weighs in at 90 kilograms and took three men to lift it onto the back of a ute. The quartz rock is covered in an estimated 2300 ounces of gold, worth about $3.8 million at today\u2019s gold price. Another 60-kilogram specimen is estimated to contain 1600 ounces, or about $2.6 million in gold. Senior geologist Zaf Thanos said in most mines around the world it is only possible to see gold through a magnifying glass. \u201cYou might go your whole life and you\u2019ll never see anything like it. It\u2019s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime discovery,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a geologist\u00a0\u2026 you get excited by a pinhead speck. But to see something on this scale is just phenomenal. \u201cThis sort of bonanza zone is incredibly unique.\u201d The rich cluster of high-grade gold has so far produced more than 9000 ounces. Kambalda miner Henry Dole is credited with the discovery, describing it as hitting the \u201cmother lode\u201d. Mr Dole had drilled holes into the wall of the mine and planted explosives\u00a0that were fired once he was safely on the surface. When he came back to the same area for his next shift, Mr Dole thought it was business as usual. \u201cEverything was covered in dust, and as I watered the dirt down there was just gold everywhere, as far as you could see,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been an airleg miner for 16 years. Never in my life have I ever seen anything like this. \u201cThere was chunks of gold in the face, on the ground, truly unique I reckon. \u201cI nearly fell over looking at it \u2026 we were picking it up for hours.\u201d A handful of gold rocks could be worth several thousand dollars, so security has been beefed up in the days since the find. Armed guards have been transporting the gold to a secure vault. Workers are under constant video surveillance and the area of the mine where the gold was found has been fenced off and padlocked. The irony is that Beta Hunt has been mined for nickel, which is a key ingredient in stainless steel, since the 1970s. Gold has always played second fiddle. There are stories among the workforce dating back to the early days of the mine\u00a0that suggest similar bonanza finds\u00a0might have been made in the past but were not considered significant at the time because of low gold prices. There are also tales that workers in those days would bury bags of gold rocks in the event the commodity came back stronger. The mine\u2019s Canadian owner, RNC Minerals,\u00a0is planning an auction for the large specimens. RNC president Mark Selby said collectors in north America and around the world are known to pay up to a 50 per cent premium on the gold metal value for rare specimens. \u201cGiven the rarity of the rock, and the physical beauty and presentation of the gold that\u2019s there, it\u2019s a very spectacular stone in multiple ways so we\u2019ll see whether 20, 30 or even 50 per cent premiums apply here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to auctioning the key stones off over the coming weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty select group of collectors who this would appeal to. \u201cWhen you look at nuggets, which are a solid piece of gold, the biggest are around 2000 ounces, so this is right up there in terms of the largest specimens we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d An interesting sub-plot to the discovery is the fact Beta Hunt\u2019s future had been in doubt. The Toronto company was battling to keep it open and had put Beta Hunt on the market several months ago. The sale process is in the final stages, but Mr Selby said the \u201cworld-class discovery\u201d\u00a0did not make RNC think twice about the sale. \u201cWhen we started the sale process it wasn\u2019t because we don\u2019t like the asset. We always believed that it had the potential to become a multi-hundred-thousand ounce mine, we just weren\u2019t able to raise capital required to do the exploration drilling,\u201d Mr Selby said. \u201cWe believe that a different set of management should be running the asset with the right amount of capital to take it forward.\u201d The question now is whether there is more bonanza gold waiting to be found at Beta Hunt. In the eyes of Mr Dole, there is no doubt. He hopes it is just the beginning of a revival for the Kambalda community, which has been hit by multiple mine closures in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we were looking down the barrel for a while, but with this, it\u2019s picked everyone\u2019s morale up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the town, the mine life, all of that. \u201cI truly believe there\u2019s something bigger and better down there. \u201cI reckon we\u2019re just on the fringe of it \u2026 and if we get deeper I reckon we\u2019ll find more.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Peter Dutton's maid-to-order immigration policies", "date": "2018-8-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/08/31/ferguson-dutton-dustup-visa-row/", "transcript": "DUTTON GROWS AU PAIR Fatherland Minister Peter Dutton-To-Do-With-Me has denied that granting two visas for his mates\u2019 au pairs is a conflict of interest. \u201cHe\u2019s neither conflicted nor interested,\u201d said a spokes-cop in a maid\u2019s outfit. \u201cPeter couldn\u2019t just do it for one.

This time, it\u2019s her unusual dance style. Mrs May\u2019s moves in the final days of her tour of Africa have led to calls for her to compete on TV dance shows and seen media outlets publish instructions on how to do what has been dubbed the \u2018Maybot\u2019 and the \u2018Cabinet Shuffle.\u2019 British online newspaper Metro called it a \u201cphenomenon that\u2019s sweeping the nation\u201d. The May dance craze gained fresh impetus on Thursday, when Mrs May nearly made it out of the UN campus in Nairobi, Kenya, without being called on to use any dance floor diplomacy. But a group of scouts, feeling the jaunty music that was playing, roped in Mrs May to join them in throwing some shapes. According to reports, the prime minister realised there was no way out and got her groove on. Mrs May \u2013 whose claim she\u2019ll never be asked to appear on a TV dance competition may be premature \u2013 was nothing if not enthusiastic. Combining arm and leg swings with a maniacal expression, she moved to her own internal rhythm. Her attempts culminated \u201cin a cross between a standing-up front crawl and a desperate attempt to hail a cab\u201d, according to the UK Guardian.

Two days earlier, she had gamely performed a medley of moves including a side-to-side sway at a South African school. It was pointed out that to be obliged as PM to execute dance moves once during a foreign trip could be seen as unfortunate. \u201cTo go through it twice could be seen as the hosts having a laugh at your expense,\u201d said the Guardian.

Salome Sechele, a judge on South Africa\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing TV show, said she was \u201con time with the beat, making for great synchronization.\u201d According to Metro, dancing like Mrs May is deceptively hard and a \u201ctough one to master for anyone with any sort of natural rhythm.\u201d It published a step-by-step guide to copying her moves, with steps including \u201cStart walking forward in a slow, mechanical fashion out of time to the music and with arms still positioned like the large dinosaur.\u201d Next, while keeping both feet planted and swinging arms in a jerky motion \u201cas if trying to prove to your parents you are sober\u201d, add \u201ca creepy smile\u201d while gazing into the middle distance.

Truth is, in Australia, our generation is one of the luckiest to be alive. Take travel, for example. Travel has never been cheaper, easier or safer than it is now. My mother took two international trips in her entire life.\u00a0I have taken many more than that. When I first started travelling in 1992 a return fare from Australia to Europe was $1800. It was a bloody good fare too as a hard-working travel agent pulled every string she could. In today\u2019s money that would be $3356.19. I was searching on Kayak the other day for a potential trip to Australia from London in September (to watch the mighty Magpies at the MCG), with the cheapest return economy fare being \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u00a3315 with China Southern, or $559.62. Today\u2019s discount economy fares are 16 per cent of the 1992 fares. What is more, I can get a return business class, fully flat bed on a 787 Dreamliner for just on \u00a31900 or $3376, flying Vietnam Airlines. In other words, today\u2019s business class fare is more or less what the economy used to be. But of course, I am at the privileged end of world wealth. What about the less privileged end? I worked for the Red Cross in the 1990s in places like Rwanda and Yugoslavia. The countries in war then that are in peace now include Rwanda, Mozambique, a big chunk of west Africa and many countries in Asia. Despite what we read about Syria and terrorism, death counts in conflict have been steadily in decline since the end of World War II,\u00a0with Our World in Data showing death rates in conflict falling from over 100 per 100,000 in the mid-1900s to around 10 per 100,000 now. On the wealth front, while inequality exists and wealth disparity is growing in many places of the world, it is not a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Rather it is the rich getting richer\u00a0and the poor getting richer. It is just that the rich are getting richer faster. Global literacy rates are rising. Those living in absolute poverty (less than $2 per day) is falling, and the numbers entering the middle class is measured in the millions each year. Which brings me back to travel. Many people are now complaining that typical tourist attractions are now overcrowded. Cities like Barcelona are cracking down on Airbnb and short-term lettings. Venice is considering limiting the maximum number of tourists allowed each day. Those with a racial eye note that many of the extra tourists look Asian. And there is a reason for this. When I was a kid we wanted to \u2018bring the world out of poverty\u2019. Guess what? We really are succeeding \u2013 despite the charity TV ads desperately asking for money. Yes there are more Asian tourists because more Asian economies like China, Vietnam, India and others are pulling millions of people out of poverty. And airlines like China Southern and Vietnam Airlines don\u2019t give just you and I cheaper fares, they give them to everyone. While our media calls out the negative, we are being blinded to the positive. Sure, the world is not perfect. Poverty and conflict remain, but both are at the lowest level ever. Further, far from capitalism being the enemy, well-regulated capitalism has given humanity the greatest boost in wealth, life expectancy, health and education we have ever seen. Shouldn\u2019t we celebrate the positive, just as much as we bemoan the negative in the world today? For many people, for the majority, life is actually pretty good, and better than it has ever been. Let\u2019s now make it better for the rest, too.

A dream to be fulfilled.\u201d So it was that five months after Sara died of brain cancer in January \u2013 and just six days after Alfie, 2, passed away in June of the same cruel disease that took his mother \u2013 Leigh toed the start line for the Cairns triathlon. His goal? To qualify, with minimal training, for the iconic Ironman world championship in Kailua Kona, Hawaii, and fulfil his promise to Sara. Cairns was his last shot at it for 2018. And after getting through the swim and bike legs, Leigh, 35, pulled out during the marathon. \u201cI resigned myself to having to qualify next year,\u201d he said. But after The New Daily\u00a0brought Leigh\u2019s story to the attention of Dan Berglund, director of communications for Ironman in Tampa, Florida, the organisation made Sara\u2019s wish a reality. On August 14, Ironman named Leigh \u2013 who qualified for Kona in 2014 but had to forgo it when Hugh, now 4, was sick \u2013 and Queensland\u2019s Elle Goodall as competitors and race ambassadors for 2018. Only one such honorary slot is given each year \u2013 Turia Pitt won one in 2016 \u2013 but an exception was made for the two Australians. \u201cHe is so incredibly deserving and I am just so glad we can make this happen,\u201d Mr Berglund told\u00a0The New Daily. For the uninitiated, the 36-year-old Kona event is the Olympics of the Ironman world. Most triathletes aim for it and only around 2000 get a shot every year. There\u2019s a hairy 3.8-kilometre open water swim, a 180-kilometre ride where winds shear off a volcanic cliff face to smash cyclists, and a 42.2-kilometre run in the Hawaiian heat. Leigh and Ms Goodall, who transformed her life by losing 120kg, were chosen \u201cthanks to characteristics that go well beyond competition,\u201d said Noel McMahon, Ironman\u2019s Oceania media manager. \u201cThey inspire others to do something they thought might not be possible and exemplify our mantra, \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m literally blown away and honoured. Life is so strange,\u201d the engineer told\u00a0The New Daily\u00a0after being surprised at work with news of his ambassador role. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how Sara in a way has been able to orchestrate this. I just feel it\u2019s her gift to me. \u201cSaying, \u2018Leigh you need to go after this\u2019 was because she understood me. She understood I would need to have something to look forward to. She understood that would help me through the hard times. \u201cShe was pretty clever.\u201d Leigh, who hopes to finish the gruelling event in under 10 hours, will have Hugh as head cheerleader in Hawaii. \u201cThis will be the most special of memories for Hugh and I. And I look forward to seeing Sara and Alfie out on the course too. They will be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get it done. Even if I have to walk, I\u2019ll finish.\u201d Squashing around 18 months of preparation for Kona into eight weeks, the former competitive rower finished Sydney\u2019s 14.2-kilometre City2 Surf run on August 12 in 50 minutes and seven seconds. He placed 108 out of 67,242 runners. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a terrible run, so I\u2019ll probably focus on my swimming now,\u201d said Leigh, who also plans to do training rides and runs in a jacket to prepare for the Hawaiian heat. Doing triathlons together was Sara and Leigh\u2019s thing. \u201cI think we loved having coffee and breakfast together afterwards,\u201d Leigh said. One year, he finished the Noosa event and ran back to find Sara then did the last two kilometres again by her side. Before their April 2012 wedding Sara signed up for an entire local series of six triathlons: \u201cIt was her strategy to do all of them purely to be at her fittest for the wedding. It worked.\u201d \u201cWe even had a Noosa triathlon photo for our wedding save-the-date invitation,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cGeeky but we thought it was hilarious \u2013 nobody looks good in a lycra onesie.\u201d Having Kona to train for has \u201cdefinitely\u201d given Leigh motivation after the heartbreaking deaths of his wife and son, whose ashes were scattered by their families at dawn on a Queensland beach last month. \u201cIt\u2019s been tricky because I was living day to day for a long, long time and hadn\u2019t really thought about the future at all,\u201d he told The New Daily. \u201cIt comes and goes in waves. \u201cSome days you\u2019re fine and some days I see a photo of Sara and Alfie and I get sad but I also get angry, for them as well. Even though there\u2019s nobody to get angry at.\u201d How is Hugh dealing with life without his mum and brother? \u201cSo far, so good, but it\u2019s not something you can ever say is all done,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cWe were driving to the airport the other day and talking about Sara and Alfie in the car, and he was telling me they\u2019re not in the stars any more. \u201cHe said they\u2019re on the top of a mountain.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Killer whale says goodbye after carrying dead calf for 17 days", "date": "2018-8-13", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/08/13/killer-whale-calf/", "transcript": "An\u00a0endangered killer whale that captured the world\u2019s attention when it refused to abandon the body of its dead calf\u00a0is finally back to feeding and frolicking with her pod. The whale, known as J35, carried the baby on her head for at least 17 days, in an image of grief that struck an emotional chord worldwide. The Centre for Whale Research in Washington state\u00a0said\u00a0Monday that J35\u00a0had been\u00a0spotted chasing a school of salmon in Haro Strait west of San Juan Island on Saturday. The killer whale\u00a0population in the Pacific North-West has\u00a0been struggling because of a lack of salmon, and J35\u2019s calf died soon after birth on July 24. \u201cThe baby\u2019s carcass was sinking and being repeatedly retrieved by the mother, who was supporting it on her forehead and pushing it in choppy seas,\u201d the CWR said in a statement at the time.

J35, a 20-year-old whale who is also known as Tahlequah, is an important member of the critically endangered southern resident orca population. Her relative youth means she could have years of reproductive ability ahead of her.

The program lets voters receive\u00a0free \u201cnationhood material\u201d, including flags, recordings of the national anthem and images of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, just by asking their federal member. Tim Watts,\u00a0MP for the inner-west Melbourne seat of Gellibrand, said his office had been inundated with\u00a050 requests on Thursday and Friday alone. \u201cTalking with other members of parliament, it does seem to be a bit of an ironic monarchist trend \u2026 with a higher concentration in the younger electorates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that young Australians are jumping on this in that great Australian tradition of taking the piss.\u201d The\u00a0pictures available through the program are poster-sized\u00a0portraits of the Queen\u00a0in front of gumtrees, in a formal\u00a0setting or with\u00a0her husband, Prince Philip.

Well, that came true \u2013 and then some. Professor Venkatesh, who graduated from the University of Western Australia aged 16 with honours in pure mathematics, has achieved his subject\u2019s highest honour. He has been awarded the Fields Medal, known as the \u201cNobel Prize for mathematics\u201d \u2013 awarded once every four years to between two and four people under the age of 40. It is an amazing achievement for the 36-year-old, who was described as a \u201cprodigy\u201d and a \u201cgenius\u201d during his teenage years in Perth. But for his mum, who is immensely proud of him, she just wants him to be happy. \u201cThat is all I hope for him, that he is happy and he loves what he does,\u201d said Svetha Venkatesh, who is herself a professor of computer science at Deakin University, and a leader in the field of machine learning. Professor Venkatesh, who teaches at Stanford University in the US, is being honoured for work that combines insights from several different fields of mathematics. His former classmate, and now professor of mathematics at the University of WA, Michael Giudici said explaining his work to the general public was hard. One of Professor Venkatesh\u2019s most famous pieces of work is solving what\u2019s called the \u201csubconvexity problem\u201d. To do that, he developed new techniques and borrowed from other areas of mathematics, Professor Giudici said. He recalled that despite Professor Venkatesh being so much younger than the rest of the group at university, he was incredibly well adjusted. \u201cI know in our fourth year, he was probably one of the main characters in the group \u2013 always discussing things other than mathematics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time as honours students talking about cricket.\u201d His mum said that was something she was keen to foster. \u201cHe was a normal, happy child growing up in a normal family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never did anything particularly special because he was good at maths. It was just one of those things.\u201d When he started university at the age of 13, one of his mentors was Professor Cheryl Praeger, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. \u201cAt our first meeting I was speaking with Akshay\u2019s mother Svetha while Akshay was sitting at a table in my office reading my blackboard, which contained fragments from a supervision of one of my PhD students, just completed,\u201d Professor Praeger recalled. \u201cAt Akshay\u2019s request I explained what the problem was. He coped with quite a lot of detail and I found that he could easily grasp the essence of the research. \u201cIt was clear from the start that Akshay was amazingly talented. He was interested and immediately engaged with all kinds of mathematical questions. \u201cI was sure that he would achieve a great deal mathematically, and I\u2019m thrilled at his stunning success in being awarded a Fields Medal.\u201d Professor Venkatesh is just the second Australian to receive the Fields Medal. Dr Terence Tao won the award in 2006. Comedian and mathematics communicator Adam Spencer said it was a \u201cgreat day for Australian mathematics\u201d and the crown in a string of recent achievements from Australian mathematicians. \u201cAustralian mathematics is on a real roll here,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cFirst mathematician Geordie Williamson from the University of Sydney was admitted to the Royal Society, making him the youngest member. \u201cThen Nalini Joshi, also from the University of Sydney was named vice-president of the International Mathematical Union. In 2016, when Professor Venkatesh was awarded another prestigious prize, he said doing mathematics gave him a feeling of \u201ctranscendence\u201d. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve been part of something really meaningful,\u201d he said at the time. Now a husband and father of two, he said children were a great way to force him to stop obsessing about mathematical problems. Those children are the joy of his life, his mother said. \u201cHe is a terrific father, a wonderful father. And yes, they are the joy of his life.

Wallace, whose sire was a donkey and dam was a horse, comes from a humble background. He was found wandering the streets in Ireland, living off scraps and flowers from village gardens (much to the chagrin of residents), and rescued by a British donkey sanctuary. But 11-year-old Wallace\u2019s life changed dramatically after\u00a0he\u00a0met Christie Mclean, from Stroud in Gloucestershire. Ms Mclean competes in entry-level dressage \u2013 and\u00a0had her own problems when all of her horses went lame. This was Wallace\u2019s time to shine \u2013 and he and Ms Mclean paired up to learn the delicate movements of dressage. But when they wanted to enter a British Dressage-affiliated competition last weekend, the pair was denied their chance \u2013 because Wallace is not a horse. It was a huge blow,\u00a0especially as Wallace and Ms Mclean\u00a0had already done well in local competitions. \u201cWhen British Dressage said the rule book only refers to horses and ponies within its affiliated criteria, I was really surprised and disappointed,\u201d Ms Mclean told the BBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a case of equine racism but more a case of the rule book being very out of date.\u201d News of the discrimination spread across Britain, sparking a public outcry and calls of justice for Wallace the mule. \u201cIt\u2019s got 4 legs, a mane, a seat, why not? Discrimination in the highest order,\u201d wrote one supporter on Twitter. \u201cWallace the mule needs justice!!! Mules matter,\u201d wrote another. Under pressure, British Dressage\u00a0buckled, changing the rules to\u00a0allow Wallace \u2013 and \u201call other animals born to a mare\u201d \u2013 to fulfil their destinies. \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Wallace and his fellow mules to compete with British Dressage, as part of our commitment to inclusion and diversity in dressage, making the sport more accessible to all,\u201d British Dressage chief executive Jason Brautigam said.  But more momentous news was to come. Not only did Wallace change the course of history for his kind, he went on to win last weekend\u2019s competition. \u201cHe did everything I asked of him \u2026 he rode beautifully,\u201d Ms Mclean wrote on Wallace\u2019s Facebook page (where he has more than 6000 followers). \u201cI cannot thank everyone enough for the huge amounts of support for Wallace, knowing that he has a chance in life makes it even more heart-warming.\u201d She said history had been made, for mules and for British Dressage, and \u201cwow, was it a good one\u201d. \u201cI [Christie] fully admit that the pressure was firmly there; we\u2019d come this far and, although I trust Wallace 100\u00a0per cent, would I remember to breathe?,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those big ears flop to the side and he\u2019s in work mode \u2013 legend.\u201d Wallace the Great\u2019s future plans are unknown at this stage.

Paleontologist Xing Xu and a team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found a cluster of fossils belonging to the\u00a0Diplodocoids according to a new study published in Nature Communications. The Diplodocoids include famous long-neck species like Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. The fossils, dating from about 174 million years ago, were found\u00a0in the Ningxia region in northwest China. The new find is 15 million years older than the earliest members of this family known until now. Scientists say it changes the historical documentation of how\u00a0sauropod dinosaurs evolved everywhere. The early Diplodocoid has been named \u201cLingwulong shenqi\u201d, meaning \u201camazing dragon of Lingwu\u201d after the town near where it was found. \u201cPreviously we thought that advanced sauropods arrived in the late Jurassic and quickly became dominant on this planet, but this suggests that these dinosaurs evolved earlier and spread slower,\u201d saiMr Xu said. In 2005, four excavations began at dinosaur sites in Ciyaopu, Lingwu and Ningxia Hui where fossil fragments of up to 10 partial skeletons (including portions of two skulls) ranging from juveniles to adult were discovered. The new sauropod was based on the examination of these fossils, as Nature reported: \u201cWe name a new sauropod based on this material, and demonstrate that it is, to our knowledge, the earliest diplodocoid (and therefore also the earliest neosauropod) sauropod, and the first from East Asia\u201d. \u201cThis discovery has major implications for calibrating the timing of neosauropod diversification,\u201d Nature reported, and provides the \u201cfirst insight into a previously hidden aspect of their evolutionary history\u201d. The Diplodocoids were previously thought to have evolved after the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, but the discovery of these fossils has forced a rethink. These long-neck sauropods, who could stretch up to 36 metres from head to tail, were the largest animals to ever walk on land and dominated the planet\u2019s \u201cland ecosystems\u201d for most of the dinosaur age. According to National Geographic, the \u201camazing dragon\u201d is \u201cthe first dinosaur of its kind ever found in Asia\u201d. Scientists concluded an inland sea had cut off eastern Asia and this so-called \u201cmega-moat\u201d prevented the diplodocoids from reaching this region. \u201cThe discovery of our new animal \u2026 means that this isolation hypothesis has been somewhat watered down, or even placed in serious doubt,\u201d according to University College London paleontologist Paul Upchurch. \u201cWe propose that many of the groups that were supposedly absent in China might well have been present, but we simply do not see them there yet because of poor sampling in the fossil record rather than genuine absence,\u201d he told National Geographic."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Bus caught in tide while trying to rescue beached plane", "date": "2018-7-26", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/07/26/bus-plane-fraser-island-tide/", "transcript": "A good Samaritan bus driver\u00a0found himself in a sticky situation after trying to come to the rescue of a bogged plane on Fraser Island.

When the tiny bird \u2014 weighing only as much as a 10 cent piece \u2014 could no longer be found in SA, there were still numbers that existed in parts of Victoria\u2019s north-west, but they were listed as endangered. In one of the three national parks where they remained, Victoria\u2019s Wyperfeld National Park, their numbers were only in the hundreds. Researchers were concerned a severe bushfire season would threaten the remaining population. Numerous organisations in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, together with the support of the South Australian government, devised a breeding program over four years to boost the birds\u2019 numbers. In April this year, 40 birds, known by bird enthusiasts as the \u2018holy grail\u2019, were introduced into parts of Ngarkat Conservation Park. Another 40 birds are due for release in August, with researchers aiming to establish a population of 250 birds over several years. Before extinction, the estimated population of Mallee emu wren in the early 2000s was upwards of 6000 in Ngarkat. BirdLife Australia\u2019s Rebecca Boulton said it was a massive challenge finding a net that could capture the little birds. \u201cThey\u2019re such a tiny bird and no one\u2019s ever held them overnight and transported them such large distances before. We had to learn a lot about their husbandry. \u201cYou can\u2019t use a traditional net\u2026they\u2019re super fine but these birds are so small they just go straight through the net,\u201d Ms Boulton said. The group had to improvise, she explained, and used large throw nets that covered patches of grass to trap the birds. It took one week to catch just 40 birds. The next challenge for the birds was to find breeding territory and a good insect population to feed on. \u201cWe did quite a lot of surveys before the birds were released. The habitat where we\u2019ve left them is similar to the one they came from,\u201d Ms Boulton said. A number of prescribed burn-offs have been conducted in Ngarkat to reduce the risk of wildfires for next summer. Natural Resources SA Murray Darling Basin project officer Luke Ireland said they would be using the next release of birds to refine their technique, before introducing a larger population. He said the group found an easy way to keep track of the birds by painting their tails with nail polish in unique colour combinations. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Gay farmers go naked to help raise awareness of mental health | The New Daily", "date": "2018-7-11", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/07/11/gay-farmers-go-naked-help-raise-awareness-mental-health/", "transcript": "When The Naked Farmer came to town looking for people to get their kit off for a good cause, dairy farmer Kerry Wilson was approached to take part.

The cause, which\u00a0raises awareness about the mental health of Australian farmers, hit a personal chord with the couple. Kerry and Paul are fifth-generation farmers who live and work together near Nimbin, in the northern rivers of New South Wales. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a journey, to the point where I left a wife and three sons to become openly gay in the dairy industry,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cYou carry a lot of guilt thereafter and even before, the 35 years before that when you know that something\u2019s not quite right in your head, but you can\u2019t quite work it out.

But it was a fleeting thought. It wasn\u2019t an option because I had three sons.\u201d At the time the kids were aged nine, six and four. \u201cAnd they by default had to come on the journey with us,\u201d Kerry said. With the support of Kerry\u2019s former wife, life kept rolling on. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever sitting around with my head in my hands going, \u2018Oh God, what are we going to do?'\u201d Paul said. And, Kerry said, \u201cwe weren\u2019t the only gays in the village\u201d. \u201cWe used to have a joke, because we moved to Nimbin with three boys and a hundred goats, living on the side of a mountain, that we were the most normal thing in town,\u201d he said.

Michael Guinea, the president of sea turtle research and conservation group AusTurtle, reopened the facility on Tuesday. He explained it was a place for turtles to finish their rehabilitation before being released back into the sea, no matter how long that took. Darwin vet nurse Geraldine Reid said there had been a jump in the number of injured turtles due to plastic consumption, and a new facility like the one in Darwin could not have come at a better time. It can treat around 20 turtles in individual tanks pumped with high-quality water for as long as required. When a turtle is injured it is usually taken to a veterinarian, who can perform any emergency treatment. But because of their slow-healing biology, they need a few months to recover enough to return to the wild. That is where the rehabilitation centre comes in. \u201cTime is the biggest factor, so what we are trying to do is provide them with the time, expert care, good water quality, uncrowded facilities so they can be released back to where they came from,\u201d Mr Guinea said.

But the pooch has never herded a single sheep. No offence to livestock, but Rubble has always had a higher calling \u2014 first as a search-and-rescue dog, and now as a conservation detection dog sniffing out some of Australia\u2019s most elusive and endangered native animals. Owner and trainer Luke Edwards says the dogs are perfect for the job. \u201cWe know that border collies are really good at both searching and stamina,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re after for working dogs \u2014 their stamina both mentally and physically. Border collies are well known for that.\u201d Mr Edwards and his partner Tracy Edwards run Canidae Development, an organisation that selects and trains dogs to search for animals. \u201cWe sort of live a bit differently than most people with working dogs,\u201d Mr Edwards said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got five dogs \u2026 and they\u2019re all inside dogs with us. First and foremost they are working dogs but we live as a unit, as a pack. \u201cWe spend a lot of time out in the field together. We spend a lot of time working away from home together \u2026 we\u2019ve got a pretty close relationship.\u201d The dogs have worked looking for koala and tiger quoll scat, as well as dead birds and bats as part of windfarm mortality surveys. But last year, Rubble and Uda received their most difficult assignment yet. The dogs were called upon by Zoos Victoria to help sniff out one of the country\u2019s most critically endangered species \u2014 the Baw Baw frog. The small brown frog lives only on the Mount Baw Baw Plateau in eastern Victoria and, like a number of other amphibian species, it has been hit hard by the introduction of the deadly chytrid fungus. It is estimated that there are fewer than 1200 Baw Baw frogs left in the wild. At the rate they are going, they are likely to be extinct in the wild within a decade. Zoos Victoria amphibian specialist Deon Gilbert says up until now, the only way to find the elusive frog was to listen for their calls \u2014 but that can be very tricky. \u201cThis species is incredibly difficult to detect in the wild,\u201d he said. \u201cThey live predominantly underground \u2026 the males only call for about five or six weeks of the year, so that restricts our opportunities to actually locate the species.\u201d Knowing where the frogs are is critical to Zoos Victoria\u2019s captive breeding program. Dogs are often used to detect the presence of animals that live above ground. They\u2019ve been used in northern Australia to detect cane toads. But Mr Gilbert says using dogs to find a native amphibian species that lives underground is as rare as the Baw Baw frogs themselves. \u201cDogs are very, very rarely used for amphibians. There\u2019s only a couple of examples worldwide that have utilised dogs and it\u2019s certainly a first for Australia,\u201d he said. The first challenge is training the dogs. To start with, the dogs are trained to locate the smell of a frog swab on a \u2018scent board\u2019. When they recognise the smell, the dogs drop and indicate with their nose. They are then rewarded with a treat. After that the dogs are giving limited and strictly controlled training with real frogs from the captive breeding program. Ms Edwards says there is no actual interaction between the dogs and the frogs. \u201cAs soon as they find that smell and do that drop, they look to us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they\u2019re not actually looking to the animal for the reward, they\u2019re looking back to us for the reward.\u201d Finally, it\u2019s time to go up the mountain. And that\u2019s where the challenges really begin. It\u2019s remote wild terrain \u2013 and Mr Edwards says it\u2019s hard on everyone, including the dogs. \u201cThe first time we took the dogs up there we actually had about two inches of snow one night \u2013 the first time that the dogs have worked in the snow.\u201d Simply reaching the frog\u2019s habitat is a major achievement. \u201cGoing out to the sites in Mount Baw Baw is probably one of the hardest areas I\u2019ve had to search,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to get out to the site we\u2019re trekking through alpine forest \u2026 it took us maybe 45 minutes to an hour just to arrive on site.\u201d Then the dogs had to catch a scent of the frogs, which can live in burrows up to a metre underground. But the dish-lickers were not about to be licked. Both dogs found several frogs. \u201cThe dogs were able to locate the exact site where the frogs were calling from much quicker than we were able to do just by using ears,\u201d Mr Gilbert said. Mr Edwards says it was exciting for everyone involved. \u201cI think the biggest surprise, particularly with Rubble there was \u2026 as he stuck his nose into a crevice the frog actually called,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s [like] ooh here\u2019s a frog there and that was one that no one knew that was in that particular location, so it was really cool.\u201d The frog dogs not only have the potential to locate Baw Baw Frog populations, but also to help when it comes time to release captive-bred frogs back into the wild. Mr Gilbert says the frogs take years to mature, and are not likely to start calling for five or six years \u2026 meaning scientists have a long wait to find out if they\u2019ve survived. \u201cWe have a huge dark period or dark window where we don\u2019t know if those strategies we\u2019ve put in place were successful or not,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re hoping to be able to use the dogs to indicate just presence or absence within that time period. \u201cIf we release the frogs year after year we can use the dogs to just say \u2018Yep, they\u2019re there, they\u2019re alive\u2019 or \u2018No they\u2019re not there. Do we change our strategy and look for another option?\u2019 \u201d Research assistant with Zoos Victoria\u2019s wildlife conservation and science unit, Chris Hartnett, says the detection dog pilot is a success. \u201cWe set up a challenge for those dogs to find a species that burrows in mud. It\u2019s brown, it\u2019s small, very cryptic, and the dogs actually detected Baw Baw frogs in the wild, so that was quite a thrilling development.\u201d Zoos Victoria is now considering using detection dogs for other threatened species. \u201cThe accuracy of a dog\u2019s nose is really unsurpassed, so they basically have a sense of smell or can have a sense of smell that\u2019s about 10,000 times stronger than humans so we really want to utilise that talent,\u201d Mr Hartnett said. \u201cParticularly for those cryptic and low-density species, we think detection dogs might have a really important role to play. In fact, that could be their niche as a monitoring technique.\u201d Luckily for Zoos Victoria, there are more dogs coming up through the ranks that might be able to fill the new roles. Detection-dog-in-training Oakley is now one-year-old and will start field work later this year and Ms Edwards has been in charge of his training. \u201cHe\u2019s only a puppy, or what we call a \u2018whuppy\u2019, a whopping big puppy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is just living life at the moment, learning the basics so obedience and recalls and environmental exposure. \u201cWe\u2019re letting him have a puppyhood, letting him have a little bit of a life because he is going to work and work hard in his life, so we don\u2019t want to add too much pressure at the moment.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "A French man has won the lottery twice in 18 months.

You have to be exceptionally lucky to win it twice in less than 18 months. But according to Le Parisien newspaper, that\u2019s exactly what happened to one unnamed man from south-east France. His first win was in November 2016 and his second came just weeks ago in May 2018. Both times he won one million euros (thus the name of the lottery \u201cMy Million\u201d). That\u2019s about $3 million total. The newsagent who sold him the ticket told the BBC he barely reacted the second time round: \u201cI guess he is used to winning.\u201d UTS Professor Louise Ryan from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical & Statistical Frontiers did a back-of-the-envelope calculation for us based on the report in Le Parisien that said the odds of winning the My Million lottery in any given week were one in 19 million. It\u2019s a bit complicated because while we know the man had been playing weekly, we don\u2019t know how long for. But suppose the man had been playing weekly for five years. Professor Ryan says the chance he would win once in that time is just over one in 73,000. The chance that he\u2019d win twice in those five years and only 15 months apart is roughly one in 1,473,489,000,000. By comparison, the chance that he\u2019d win once over 50 years would be just over one in 10,000. And the chance that he\u2019d win twice in 50 years and only 15 months apart would be roughly one in 139,670,929,703. Those are still huge numbers. To put them in perspective, Professor Ryan said the odds for winning the lottery twice could be compared to \u201cgetting a good price for a house in Sydney\u201d. To get the odds of winning\u00a0just once\u00a0down to one in 100, you\u2019d have to play weekly for 3,700 years. So, whatever the case, the man in France was extremely lucky. No, Professor Ryan says it\u2019s just not happening. \u201cIf I was him I\u2019d probably quit while I was ahead,\u201d she said. Also before you think about trying to replicate his success in Australia\u2019s Oz Lotto,\u00a0just remember that the odds of winning the first division in that are even less (under one in 45 million).

Are we marketing cotton all wrong?!? pic.twitter.com/G7R9fwTmTR \u2014 Mark Dawson (@markmdawson1) May 7, 2018 Mark Dawson estimated in his tweet that if there were 10 cotton plants per metre and each plant sold for $22 that would equate to $22,000 per hectare. However in reality growers have been averaging 12 cotton bales per hectare this season, which returns the much smaller figure of $6500 per hectare. Southern New South Wales farmer Gavin Dal Broi has nearly finished picking his cotton crop and cannot believe how much people are paying for cotton branches at florists and markets. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mind boggling that people are willing to pay for something that we have thousands of hectares of. \u201cI just shake my head at what they are willing to pay for it, but if there is someone willing to pay it, someone is going to sell it.\u201d One thing is for sure, Mr Dal Broi will not be showcasing cotton in a vase or mason jar in his home. \u201cThere is plenty on the floor when I take my clothes off at night after being on the cotton picker all day,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife is actually sick of it, so we don\u2019t need any extra sitting inside the house on show.\u201d Cut flower grower Sal Russo from Greater Sydney is among the many wholesalers sourcing cotton from NSW growers and said cotton attracts a lot of attention as it stands out to buyers amongst traditional blooms. He said some people visiting the market see the cotton branches and reminisce about when they used to pick cotton. \u201cThey\u2019ll have their kids with them and explain to them how they used to pick it,\u201d Mr Russo said. School teachers are also flocking to the market to buy bunches of the plant to show their students. \u201cMost kids haven\u2019t seen how cotton grows \u2014 it\u2019s a real novelty at the moment, but how log it stays in vogue I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mr Russo said he is very particular about the features of cotton branches. \u201cWe actually go out to the paddocks and pick it ourselves \u2014 there is an art to picking it. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to get people to pick it for us, but when it arrives it looks like it\u2019s been through a mulcher.\u201d Mr Russo said florists are quite fussy when it comes to the plant. \u201cGrowers like a lot of cotton on the bottom of the plant, and we like a lot of cotton at the top of the plant,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there are dry conditions the tops of the cotton plants are bare \u2014 that\u2019s no good.\u201d Mr Russo said cotton is a favourite with florists as it has a long shelf life. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need water and can last up to five years,\u201d Mr Russo said. \u201cFlorists have started to use it in their corporate arrangements and they love it. \u201cIf you put traditional flowers in that sort of office temperature they only last two or three days, whereas, cotton lasts irrespective of whether it\u2019s hot or cold. \u201cFlorists can rely of cotton not to fail if they put in an arrangement.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Egyptian artefacts uncovered in Sydney house clean-up", "date": "2018-5-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/31/egyptian-artifacts-house-clean-up/", "transcript": "A large collection of Egyptian antiquities uncovered during a clean-up of a Sydney home has been donated to a university archaeological museum. Rosemary Beattie recalls the oddity of being shown what was supposably a mummified cat during childhood visits to her grandmother\u2019s house. \u201cWe\u2019d come and have a look and I\u2019d think, \u2018Alright, OK, fine, that\u2019s the cat\u2019,\u201d Ms Beattie said. \u201cBut then I\u2019d go and roll the cannonballs on the back verandah; that was much more my style.\u201d The linen-wrapped item was one of the many antiquities her grandfather, John Basil St Vincent Welch, brought back from his time serving as a medical officer in World War I. It is believed he employed the help of a dragoman who assisted him to find and buy antiquities as souvenirs of his time in Egypt. \u201cHe brought back chestfuls of memories,\u201d Ms Beattie told ABC\u00a0Radio. Most recently the artefacts were kept by Ms Beattie\u2019s mother, Margaret St Vincent. The items came to her through her husband, also named John Basil St Vincent Welch, who inherited the antiquities after the death of his father. However ailing health forced her to move into aged care and her house needed to be sold to help with costs. While cleaning up the house, Ms Beattie was tasked with finding a new home for the case of Egyptian antiquities. \u201cIt was a big, sort of a long box with a glass front that I had looked at as a child,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt had been sitting on a closed-in verandah on top of a cupboard.\u201d \u201cWe thought what are we going to do with it?\u201d Family members suggested the items be donated to the University of Sydney where both of the men had studied. Archaeologist Candace Richards was ecstatic to learn about the existence of the collection. \u201cI was obviously very excited, confused and really intrigued by what could actually be in this home,\u201d said Ms Richards, the assistant curator of the university\u2019s Nicholson Museum. \u201cWe do know that a lot of soldiers, especially in WWI and WWII, did buy genuine artefacts and we know there are lots of fakes out there.\u201d The museum has since catalogued the 185 artefacts, which range from small amulets, scarab beetles, a coffin fragment, ceramic items and bronze Roman coins. It is believed some objects date back to the first millennium BC. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly rare in Australia; we do have items from other WWI diggers but nothing on this scale.\u201d One long-shaped object wrapped in linen and covered in resin is thought to be a mummified cat. It will undergo medical imaging scans to confirm if does contain a feline within the wrapping. \u201cYou can\u2019t unwrap these sorts of things because that destroys the artefact in itself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut through these technologies that we use in medical science all the time, we can actually use them in Egyptology as well and understand more about those artefacts.\u201d It is expected that many of the items will be displayed in an exhibition at a new museum facility expected to be completed by 2020. Ms Beattie\u2019s family had previously\u00a0donated 70 military-related items to the Australian War Memorial. Other relics found in the house included 500 photographic glass negative plates, swords, and a\u00a0hand grenade\u00a0originally kept by her father who served during WWII. Medals belonging to two German soldiers will be personally returned to their rightful owners. Ms Beattie\u2019s mother died soon after the Egyptian artefacts were donated, but the gesture has inspired her to uncover more about her family\u2019s history. \u201cSadly [my grandfather] was never really talked about because\u00a0he died, when my father was five or six years old, from influenza,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t really know much about this incredible man and we\u2019re now at this stage discovering he was fascinating and it\u2019s just sort of opened up a great big world to us.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "TV preacher calls on flock to buy him a fourth private jet", "date": "2018-5-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/31/preacher-jesse-duplantis-fourth-jet/", "transcript": "A US Christian televangelist has called on his flock to fork out US$54 million ($71 million) after claiming Jesus told him he needs a new private jet.

But a new project in Melbourne\u2019s north has successfully been able to take the dreaded plastic bag and turn it into something that can be used again and again \u2014 a road. The 300-metre stretch of road, on Rayfield Avenue in Craigieburn, uses an additive that\u2019s made up of 530,000 plastic bags, more than 12,000 recycled printer cartridges and 168,000 glass bottles. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a great initiative,\u201d said Geoff Porter, the mayor of Hume City Council, which takes in Craigieburn. \u201cIf this does work out as we hope it will \u2026 we will be promoting this all around the city.\u201d Tests also reveal the new road can handle extreme temperatures better and when it comes to costs, is about the same price as traditional road laying. It\u2019s the first time the additive has been used and the results have stunned the recycling company behind it, Close the Loop. \u201cThe great thing about it is not only is it competitive, but it is a more flexible road surface, it\u2019s more durable, it\u2019s longer lasting and it\u2019s a great use of product that would otherwise go to landfill,\u201d said Craig Devlin, the company\u2019s chairman. The bags are being collected from Australia\u2019s supermarket giants by another major recycling group. The road additive was developed by Close the Loop using $40,000 from a $2.5 million state government fund designed to boost research and development into recycling. It\u2019s a step in the right direction, and one that could take the pressure off councils in the midst of the Chinese recycling crisis, according to Rob Spence, from the Municipal Association of Victoria.

Mr Spence said that councils were only weeks away from striking a new agreement for a similar price \u2014 about $1 a week or $52 a year per household. \u201cA number of them have already signed and there are some who are putting a lot of pressure on the recyclers to get better pricing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want is a smooth process \u2026 and that the recycling system continues to operate.\u201d \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Malaysian cub is the world's newest panda", "date": "2018-5-26", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/26/cute-baby-panda-wows-fans/", "transcript": "A baby panda born in a Malaysian zoo five months ago has made her public debut.

The 11th annual\u00a0list compiled by the\u00a0International Institute of Species Exploration\u00a0(IISW) includes\u00a0microbes, plants, animals and exotic sea creatures. The list is traditionally published to\u00a0highlight the diversity of species on earth, especially the endangered ones, and encourage their conservation. But among the rare and endangered creatures highlighted this year is\u00a0Wakaleo schouteni, a predatory marsupial thought to have hunted the\u00a0open forest habitat in northwestern Queensland in the\u00a0late Oligocene period, which ended about 23 million years ago. Scientists from the University of New South Wales recovered fossils in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in Queensland that proved to be a previously unknown fossil marsupial lion, the IISW said. The \u2018lion\u2019 was thought to have weighed around 23 kilograms, was the size of a\u00a0collie dog\u00a0and spent at least part of its time in trees. Its teeth suggested\u00a0it was not completely reliant on meat but was, instead, an omnivore. One of Wakaleo schouteni\u2019s discoverers,\u00a0Anna Gillespie, last year wrote it was highly likely\u00a0the animal\u00a0\u201cpursued its prey \u2013 small vertebrates like lizards, frogs, birds and small mammals \u2013 through the tree-tops of these forests\u201d. \u201cPreviously, species of\u00a0Wakaleo\u00a0were known from younger sites that spanned the middle Miocene to the late Miocene era, dating to approximately 17 million to 5 million years ago,\u201d she wrote in The Conversation. The new species was named in honour of acclaimed Australian\u00a0paleoartist Peter Schouten. The\u00a010 species on the\u00a0IISW list were selected by the institute\u2019s international committee of taxonomists from some 18,000 new species named in\u00a02017. Protist (Ancoracysta twista) This single-celled protist was found living on a brain coral in a tropical aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. Atlantic forest tree (Dinizia jueirana-facao) A\u00a040-metre, 56-tonne tree found in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest, home to half of the country\u2019s threatened species. Amphipod (Epimeria Quasimodo) A brightly coloured, 5cm, humped-back\u00a0crustacean (hence the Quasimodo name)\u00a0found in\u00a0icy waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front. Baffling beetle (Nymphister kronaueri) This tiny beetle, measuring just 1.5 millimetres long, lives alongside a species of nomadic army ant. When the ant colony moves every two to three weeks, the beetle joins them,\u00a0attaching itself to\u00a0the ants and living off their labours. Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) The most endangered great ape in the world, these diminutive primates are\u00a0isolated\u00a0from other species of Sumatra.\u00a0The male orangutans stand under 5 feet tall, while the females are under 4 feet, which is similar to other orangutans. Swire\u2019s snailfish (Pseudoliparis swirei) The\u00a0fish resembles a tadpole and lives at the bottom of the Western Pacific\u2019s Mariana Trench. The name can be traced to one of the officers from the HMS Challenger, which discovered the trench in 1875. Heterotrophic flower (Sciaphila sugimotoi) A critically endangered but\u00a0gorgeous flower on Japan\u2019s Ishigaki Island that produces small blossoms in September and October. While most plants capture energy from the sun to grow\u00a0via\u00a0photosynthesis,\u00a0the flower receives nutrition from fungus without harming it. Volcanic bacterium (Thiolava veneris) The eruption of the Tagoro volcano off the coast of the Canary Islands in 2011 killed off several marine ecosystems, but gave birth to a\u00a0proteobacteria in the new toxic environment. Named \u201cVenus\u2019 hair,\u201d the bacteria formed a white mat making up nearly half an acre around Tagoro\u2019s volcanic cone. Marsupial lion (Wakaleo schouteni) The\u00a0marsupial lion lived in the open forest\u00a0about 23 million years ago and spent part of its life in trees. As big as a collie dog, the omnivore was thought to have increased in size as the Queensland climate became drier and cooler. Cave beetle (Xuedytes bellus) Found in a cave in Guangxi province, southern China, this beetle adapted to have long spider-like legs, a compact body and no flight wings, eyes or pigmentation.

Scientists on Wednesday described the cranium of a small primitive Cretaceous Period mammal called Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch, about the size of a small hare, that lived 130 million years ago, as boasting traits suggesting it possessed a keen sense of smell and may have been nocturnal. \u201cIt\u2019s a plant-eater, as we can tell from its herbivorous teeth,\u201d University of Chicago paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo said. \u201cFrom the sediments in which it was preserved, likely it lived on the banks or flood plain of a small river.\u201d The 7.5cm skull was well preserved and nearly complete, unlike the usual scrappy fossils of the group to which Cifelliodon belonged, called haramiyidans. The earliest primitive mammals evolved during the Triassic Period, when dinosaurs also first appeared, from creatures that combined reptilian and mammalian characteristics. Haramiyidans appeared close to the dawn of the mammalian lineage, with the earliest-known representative living about 208 million years ago and the last-known member perhaps about 70 million years ago. The skull was unwittingly excavated at a site north of Arches National Park in eastern Utah. The paleontologists from Utah Geological Survey did not know it was entombed in rock brought back to a lab for study until they looked under a foot bone of a two-legged plant-eating dinosaur called Hippodraco. It may be the best-preserved skull of any haramiyidan, offering a new understanding of the group. \u201cCompared to modern mammals, Cifelliodon had a simple, tube-like brain, lacked complex bony structures usually associated with the front part of the brain case and nasal region, and had simple tooth roots, among other primitive features,\u201d University of Southern California paleontologist Adam Huttenlocker said. Before a geological process called plate tectonics rendered them separate land masses, the Americas, Eurasia, Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India all were part of a huge, single continent called Pangaea. The timing for Pangaea\u2019s break-up, initially into two major land masses, has been a matter of scientific debate. The researchers said the discovery of Cifelliodon, which had a close contemporaneous relative in Africa, suggests there were still connections between the northern hemisphere continents and those in the southern hemisphere 15 million years later than previously believed. The research was published in the journal Nature. -AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Policeman does C-section on deer killed by car, saves baby", "date": "2018-5-22", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/22/policeman-c-section-saves-baby-deer/", "transcript": "An American police officer has saved a baby deer from its dead mother after delivering it via caesarean section.

The park regularly focuses on bear safety and they decided a video educating people not to feed wild bears would be a good idea. \u201cWe thought if we were to do something in the natural setting of the park then people might get the idea that feeding a wild bear was a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we thought if it was kind of that extreme, something nobody would ever do, it wouldn\u2019t give the wrong message. \u201cUnfortunately \u2026 it was still twisted and taken out of context.\u201d But Ms Bos said the park accepted the fine, because in the end it was their own human error that resulted in the investigation. \u201cThe reason we were fined is because we failed to notify special wildlife that we were taking an animal off the property,\u201d she said. There is no rule against taking a bear off the park\u2019s property, nor any animal for that matter, however there are strict rules that stipulate authorities must be notified. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a bear or a guinea pig or if it\u2019s a mouse \u2013 we have to notify them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes we did have human error and we forgot to send our email notifying our authorities that yes we were taking an animal off the property.\u201d The park has since deleted both the drive-thru video and another video showing Berkley eating an ice cream cake. Ms Bos said the park \u201c100 per cent\u201d accepted the charges and did not believe the regulations were in any way too strict. In fact she said they were thankful that the authorities fined them and held them accountable. \u201cIt shows the public in \u2026 Canada that our regulations are extremely strict and that the animals here are held in the highest respect and have the highest welfare,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact \u2026 not only did they inspect the situation but we asked for a fully-fledged inspection of our facility, which they did come and do as well. \u201cThat was something we requested just because we felt that it\u2019s beneficial for the public to know that we are inspected and that there are authorities making sure we are giving these animals the utmost respect and care that they deserve and require.\u201d Ms Bos was adamant that when planning Berkley\u2019s ice cream outing they considered both the safety of the bear and the general public. \u201cWe would never do anything that would ever jeopardise anybody\u2019s safety,\u201d she said. Berkley is just a cub, and has been raised by staff at the wildlife park. Ms Bos said riding in a vehicle is an everyday activity for Berkley, as she is driven to different sections daily so she can have play time. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t something that she would ever be stressed out from,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as safety goes for the public she was in the truck the entire time, she never left the truck.\u201d Berkley was also on a bear version of a leash \u2014 a chain \u2014 for the whole trip. Wildlife protection organisations have called the outing completely irresponsible, but Ms Bos said they did not plan for it to be \u201ca stunt\u201d. She said for them it was another part of Berkley\u2019s training for \u201cenrichment purposes\u201d. \u201cTraining is considered to be the highest form of enrichment you can give an animal in captivity, it creates brain function no different than you and I going to school or having a job,\u201d she said. \u201cThey truly enjoy doing different things.\u201d A lot of the training animals get given is for their medical benefit \u2013 bears get trained to pee in a cup and for blood draws, so if they have a medical issue vets can easily test them. \u201cThey\u2019re trained to give you their blood samples so we don\u2019t have to sedate them for simple things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it really does increase their quality of life. \u201cEven training them to open their mouth big and wide, we can make sure we\u2019re doing regular tooth checks to make sure there\u2019s no problems, because animals get those just like humans do. \u201cIn fact we had a jaguar that had his canine tooth broken, he required a root canal and we would have never known if he wasn\u2019t trained to open his mouth and do his daily checks. \u201cWe even had to brush the jaguar\u2019s tooth after the root canal, which again had they not been trained that\u2019s not something we would have been able to.\u201d Would they take a bear out for ice cream again? Ms Bos said they would definitely do something similar again, but probably not exactly the same. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t taken the way \u2026 we wanted it to be taken,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal was to educate people and for it to be taken a specific way \u2014 no we wouldn\u2019t do it exactly the same.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Old Melbourne trams go up for sale", "date": "2018-5-15", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/15/old-trams-for-sale/", "transcript": "A piece of Melbourne\u2019s history is up for sale and it can be yours for the bargain price of just $1000.

Thousands of items have been unearthed, including red crayons that are 48,000 years old and decorated beads made from sea shells and ostrich eggs. Australian National University archaeologist Dr Ceri Shipton said the discovery sheds light on a major turning point in human history. He said for someone whose lifestyle would have revolved around hunting and gathering, the technology was comparable to the smartphone, or the car a hundred years ago. \u201cThe invention of the bow and arrow, because it\u2019s such an effective hunting weapon, could have a totally similarly revolutionary effect,\u201d he said. More than 30,000 items have been discovered, many of them in mint condition. Examples of rapid innovation found in the cave include sharp arrow points carved from bone, more sophisticated use of materials for craft work and essential tools. Dr Shipton said the way the artefacts changed over the timeline indicated the people who made and used them were very innovative. \u201cIn the early part of the sequence, we see they are using quite big stone tools for making things like stone-tipped spearheads,\u201d he said. \u201cThen around 67,000 years ago there is an abrupt change in the stone tools and from that point on, [the tools] become very small and made of very sharp stone.\u201d The cave, called Panga ya Saidi, is 15 kilometres from Kenya\u2019s south-east coast, just north of Mombasa. Dr Shipton, who was part of the team working in the cave, said it was unique in providing such an unbroken, continuous record of human occupation. Humans moved into the cave 78,000 years ago and lived there until 500 years ago. Dr Shipton said the technological revolution seen there in the Later Stone Age would have driven rapid change. During that period, it was unusual for people to live in a tropical rainforest, as they were mostly found in grasslands where there were larger animals for hunting. Living in a rainforest forced humans to hunt for smaller animals, such as monkeys and small deer, which required more sophisticated technology, thus driving the push for better tools. This helps explains the rapid improvement in arrow points found in Panga ya Saidi. Dr Shipton said it was the kind of \u201cbehavioural flexibility\u201d that allowed humans to populate the rest of the world. Other sites from the same period have been found in South Africa and the Rift Valley in East Africa, but this is the first site found with such a continuous record. Dr Shipton said many of the items remain in excellent condition, partly because the cave protected them from the elements, but also because the limestone walls helped preserve materials containing calcium carbonate such as bone, marine shells and egg shells. The tools are still sharp and the crayons still show grooves where they have been used. Dr Shipton said the site was \u201cinspiring\u201d to work on, with clouds of butterflies rising from the vegetation as the jungle over time has begun to take over parts of the cave. \u201cYou walk in through this narrow entrance and it opens up into this huge chamber with lots of little passages going off from it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so old that the roof has collapsed, so inside it\u2019s actually open air and there is all sorts of jungle growing from within the cave. \u201cAnd vines growing down from above as well, so when you go in it\u2019s absolutely beautiful. \u201cIt has these huge chambers that are lush and green inside and they\u2019re 40 metres across with walls that are 15 metres high. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a sanctuary for local wildlife, so there\u2019s monkeys going across overhead, there\u2019s owls that live in the cave and monitor lizards and a giant python.\u201d The cave remains sacred to the local people, so none of the vegetation or wildlife has been cleared away. \u201cThere are parts of the cave, alcoves, that are used for rituals today and it\u2019s a real privilege to work there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe locals that we work with are friendly and generous in letting us work there and they\u2019ve also become good archaeologists in their own right.\u201d The project was led by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and the study was\u00a0published in the Nature Communications\u00a0journal."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Indian fraudsters ridiculed after being paraded in 'space suits'", "date": "2018-5-10", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/10/indian-fraud-space-suits/", "transcript": "A\u00a0man and his son have been embarrassingly paraded in \u201cspace suits\u201d by Indian police after\u00a0they were\u00a0arrested for allegedly defrauding a businessman by\u00a0pretending to work for NASA.

Our point man is armed with a metre-long length of pipe and a dart filled with two potent tranquilisers: ketamine and medetomidine. Beside him is Nasum Ucup, a keeper at the shelter, which houses stolen and smuggled wildlife confiscated by government. He guides us along a row of steel bars and stops at the final cage. The muted torchlight barely penetrates into the cage, but even in the low light you can tell that there\u2019s something big inside. No one speaks \u2026 or even whispers. The dart man raises his blowpipe and then the silence of the rescue centre is torn apart by an ear-splitting screech. It\u2019s like a car alarm blasting a metre from your head. It\u2019s a cockatoo: another resident of the centre, alarmed to find half-a-dozen humans creeping through this place in the middle of the night. The whole centre roars into life. The creature in the cage stirs, and stands up. It\u2019s Jono, an adult orangutan, and the reason we\u2019re all here. Jono\u2019s been here, in this tiny cage, for six years, and it\u2019s finally time for him to get out. Jono, unsurprisingly, does not seem calm. Nasum tries to quieten him, patting his hand against the cage and calling, \u201cJono, Jono, Jono\u201d, in a soft voice, trying to let him know that it\u2019s him, Nasum, a familiar voice, giving the dart man time to get a clean shot. Getting Jono out of the cage without being tranquilised is unthinkable \u2014 he\u2019s eight times stronger than any of us and he could tear off an arm or a leg without much trouble at all. Nasum\u2019s still tapping the cage and the cockatoo is still screeching. Before I understand what I\u2019m seeing a black hand shoots out and grabs Nasum\u2019s wrist\u00a0\u2013 and pulls his hand into the cage. Jono bites Nasum, hard, and his hand is still in the cage. The dart man and another keeper dive in and try to pull Nasum\u2019s hand free. After a few seconds Jono releases Nasum, who\u2019s a bit shocked but his finger seems intact. A dart is finally blown in to him, and within a few minutes Jono is knocked out. He\u2019s hauled out of the cage and carried inside for inspection. Femke den Haas from the Jakarta Animal Aid Network says he\u2019s in pretty good condition. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve been able to inspect him thoroughly,\u201d she says, as a team weighs and measures the unconscious Jono. He\u2019s then loaded into a custom-made crate ready for the flight to Pangkalan Bun. This mission has been planned for months. Animal welfare volunteers and Indonesian government officials had been working to get Jono out since last year\u00a0when Jono\u2019s presence at the centre was revealed by the ABC\u2019s Foreign Correspondent program. Femke den Haas says she didn\u2019t know Jono was still in the centre. \u201cThis transit centre is very important\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s where they put wildlife that\u2019s smuggled through the airport,\u201d she tells 7.30. \u201cBut it\u2019s a transit centre. \u201cNo animal should stay here for more than a few months.\u201d Jono was brought to the centre six years ago after he was confiscated from a private owner who\u2019d kept him illegally as a pet. Efforts to find him a permanent home failed. Ms den Haas says events moved quickly after the Foreign Correspondent episode. The Indonesian government agreed to grant permission for Jono to be moved. DNA tests revealed Jono was from the Indonesian province of Kalimantan. An orangutan rehabilitation centre in Kalimantan agreed to take Jono and donations from Australia helped cover the cost of a new, temporary cage at the Orangutan Foundation International centre outside the city of Pangkalan Bun, run by Professor Birute Galdikas. The centre has released more than 500 orangutans back into the wild. Often the centre is working with baby orangutans that are orphaned by fire or land clearing. The young orangutans are raised by humans and taught survival skills in a jungle camp. Getting an orangutan ready for release is a long process. Professor Galdikas said Jono\u2019s rehabilitation would take several years at least. \u201cWe can\u2019t just open the cage door and let him out into the forest,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure he knows how to make a nest. We also make sure that he\u2019s capable of foraging, of finding wild foods in the forest.\u201d Initially he\u2019ll go into a quarantine cage, then into a small reserve. But the first step is getting him to Kalimantan. The most moving parts of the program come when Jono\u2019s finally released into his new, temporary cage. It\u2019s four times bigger than his Jakarta cage, and it\u2019s fitted with ropes and tyres for him to climb. It\u2019s open to the light, and for the first time in at least six years, Jono\u2019s able to swing and hang from the ceiling. It\u2019s a vast improvement. Ms\u00a0den Haas is in tears as Jono enters his new cage and immediately grabs hold of the ropes, swinging about the cage. \u201cFor all these years he\u2019s not been able to swing around,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the cage in the transit centre in Jakarta, there was nothing for him to swing with. He was always lying on a bare concrete floor. \u201cThat was his life. Dark, no sunlight. Now he can finally swing again.\u201d It is the last stop for Jono. After a short time in his new quarantine cage he will be released into the jungle. Nasum Ucup, the keeper bitten by Jono, also made the trip to Kalimantan with Jono. \u201cI took care of Jono since he arrived in 2012 until today,\u201d he says. \u201cI am very sad but he must return to his habitat. \u201cI am happy too, not just sad. \u201cI\u2019m also proud. Maybe he bit me in that last moment so that he could remember me.\u201d Before leaving, Nasum gives Jono a final wave. \u201cBye, Jono. Please remember me,\u201d he says."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Secretary, 96, amasses millions and donates it to needy students", "date": "2018-5-8", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/08/96-year-old-secretary-donates-fortune-students/", "transcript": "Even by the dizzying standards of New York City philanthropy, a recent $US6.24 million ($8.37 million) donation to the\u00a0Henry Street Settlement\u00a0on the Lower East Side was a whopper \u2013 the largest single gift from an individual to the social service group in its 125-year history. It was not donated by some billionaire benefactor, but by a frugal legal secretary from Brooklyn who toiled for the same law firm for 67 years until she retired at age 96 and died not long afterward in 2016. Her name was Sylvia Bloom and even her closest friends and relatives had no idea she had amassed a fortune over the decades. She did this by shrewdly observing the investments made by the lawyers she served. \u201cShe was a secretary in an era when they ran their boss\u2019s lives, including their personal investments,\u201d recalled her niece Jane Lockshin. \u201cSo when the boss would buy a stock, she would make the purchase for him, and then buy the same stock for herself, but in a smaller amount because she was on a secretary\u2019s salary.\u201d Since Ms Bloom never talked about this, even to those closest to her, the fact that she had carefully cultivated more than $US9 million ($12.07 million) among three brokerage houses and 11 banks, emerged only at the end of her life \u2013 \u201can oh my God moment\u201d, said Ms Lockshin, the executor of Ms Bloom\u2019s estate. \u201cI realised she had millions and she had never mentioned a word,\u201d recalled Ms Lockshin. \u201cI don\u2019t think she thought it was anybody\u2019s business but her own.\u201d Ms Bloom\u2019s will allowed for some money to be left to relatives and friends, but directed that the bulk of the fortune go toward scholarships of Ms Lockshin\u2019s choice for needy students. Ms Lockshin, the longstanding treasurer of the settlement\u2019s board, called the group\u2019s executive director, David Garza, and asked him if he was sitting down. \u201cWe were all agape, just blown away,\u201d recalled Mr Garza, who said the money would endow the settlement\u2019s\u00a0program\u00a0which helps disadvantaged students prepare for and complete college. Ms Bloom joins the ranks of unassuming and magnanimous millionaires next door, who have died with fortunes far larger than their lifestyles ever would have suggested. Like Ms Bloom,\u00a0Leonard Gigowski, a shopkeeper from New Berlin, Wisconsin, who died in 2015, left his secret $US13 million ($17.4 million) fortune to fund scholarships.\u00a0Grace Groner, who lived in a one-bedroom home in Lake Forest, Illinois, and directed that her $US7 million ($9.39 million) estate go to her alma mater when she died in 2010 at 100, shopped at thrift stores and chose to walk, not drive. Donald and Mildred Othmer, who settled in Brooklyn Heights, lived relatively simple lives; he was a professor at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn and she was a former teacher and buyer for her mother\u2019s dress stores. They invested wisely in Berkshire Hathaway, run by a family friend from Omaha, Warren Buffett, and died in their 90s with three-quarters of a billion dollars, most of which they donated. Ms Bloom, who never had children of her own, was born to eastern European immigrants and grew up in Brooklyn during the Great Depression. She attended public schools\u00a0and did her degree at night while working days to make ends meet. In 1947 she joined a fledgling Wall Street law firm as one of its first employees. Over her 67 years with the firm,\u00a0Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, it grew to its current size, with more than 1200 lawyers, as well as hundreds of staff members, of which Ms Bloom was the longest tenured, said Paul Hyams, a human resources executive for the firm who became good friends with Ms Bloom over his 35 years working there. Ms Bloom\u2019s husband, Raymond Margolies, who died in 2002, was a city firefighter who retired and became a city schoolteacher with a pharmacist career on the side, relatives said. Nearly all the money was in Ms Bloom\u2019s name alone, Ms Lockshin said, adding that it was \u201cvery possible\u201d that even Mr Margolies did not know the size of his wife\u2019s fortune. The couple lived modestly in a rent-controlled apartment, though \u201cshe could have lived on Park Avenue if she wanted to\u201d, Mr Hyams said. Ms Bloom was known for always taking the subway to work, even on the morning of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center, not far from the firm\u2019s offices. That day, Ms Bloom, at 84, fled north and took refuge in a building before walking over the Brooklyn Bridge and taking a city bus \u2013 not a cab \u2013 home."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Slow lorises are now on the road to recovery", "date": "2018-5-7", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/07/slow-lorises-now-on-road-to-recovery/", "transcript": "Perth Zoo\u2019s newest arrivals may have narrowly avoided a bleak future of social media stardom.

Oncologist Sandra Nguyen said state-of-the-art technology would not only cure cancer in some pets but could also improve their quality of life. \u201cThe radiation delivery is moulded to the tumour, so we can try and reduce the side effects, as well as shorten the treatment times where possible,\u201d Dr Nguyen said. \u201cMost patients we see are completely healthy when first diagnosed, so what they require is treatment, so they can continue living a happy and pain-free life.\u201d Before the centre opened most animals were either sent to a similar facility in Brisbane for treatment or would be forced to have a limb amputated to prevent the cancer spreading. \u201cMost people can\u2019t afford to take their pets interstate for treatment, whereas at least here, they can drop their patient off with us, go to work and pick them up on the way home,\u201d Dr Nguyen said. Depending on the form of cancer, the cost of treatment ranges from $3000 to $13,000, while an individual dose of radiation takes around 20 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s really up to the pet owner whether or not they want to proceed with treatment, but I would highly recommend pet insurance,\u201d Dr Nguyen said. \u201cWe even had one case where an owner set up a crowd-funding page on Instagram.\u201d Zanthia Harvison put her nine-year-old border collie Dusty through a full cycle of radiation after he was diagnosed with a nose tumour. \u201cHe has only just finished four weeks of treatment and it was so worth it \u2014 he isn\u2019t in any pain, the tumour is shrinking, and he\u2019s even back to hunting for sticks in the park,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t put a price on a human\u2019s life \u2014 a pet is like one of the family \u2014 you do whatever you can to make sure they are happy and we are delighted with the results from this centre.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "'Usain Bolt' oyster on track to be a Guinness World Record holder", "date": "2018-5-1", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/01/giant-oyster-on-track-to-break-world-record/", "transcript": "Bernie Connell is an oyster farmer from the Clyde River on the NSW Far South Coast hoping to claim a Guinness World Record at this year\u2019s Narooma Oyster Festival. Mr Connell has been growing a Pacific oyster named Jack for the last four years. Incredibly, Jack the Oyster has grown to the size of a human forearm and unofficially weighs just over\u00a0two kilograms. Mr Connell said it was not uncommon for some oysters to grow at faster rates than others in a batch. \u201cEvery batch of oysters you get, there\u2019s always a certain few that grow a lot faster than the other ones, so he [Jack] stood out for the last four years,\u201d Mr Connell said. \u201cAny time I\u2019d come back and work my crop he\u2019d be a lot bigger than the other ones. \u201cAfter a couple of years he was pretty big \u2026 so I put him in his separate little home and he\u2019s just grown from there. \u201cHe\u2019s still growing. Every time I pick him up he\u2019s got a fringe on him \u2013 new shells. So if nothing happens to him he should grow into a pretty big oyster,\u201d he said. Mr Connell said there are several oysters on his lease which could break the record. Mr Connell said growing Jack has not meant much extra work, aside from finding the right spot in the river and a bit of tender loving care. \u201cThey\u2019re just a special type of oyster, like Usain Bolt \u2026 Just a champion oyster,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery couple of months I bring him back to the shed and clean all the barnacles and seaweed off him. \u201cThey [the oysters] all eat the same sort of stuff \u2026 I look after them and they grow. On whether Jack has reached his peak, Mr Connell said he has still got some growing years in him yet. \u201cHe\u2019s only four years old and the one overseas [which currently holds the record], they reckon is about 16, so he\u2019s got a lot of growing to do,\u201d he said. According to Guinness World Records, the current record for the largest oyster was set in Denmark in 2013 by another Pacific oyster found on the shores of the Wadden Sea. The oyster had another five attached to it, but the cluster weighed a total of 1.62kg and measured 35.5cm long. All new world record contenders looking to claim the official title will be weighed, measured and photographed at the Narooma Oyster Festival this weekend. The information will then be sent to the Guinness World Records office for an official appraisal. And as for Jack the Oyster, it looks like he will avoid the plate. \u201cIt\u2019s like one of the family, you couldn\u2019t eat him!\u201d Mr Connell said."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Rare US 'fire rainbows' just as likely to happen in Australia", "date": "2018-5-1", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/01/fire-rainbows/", "transcript": "A colourful splash in the sky known as a \u201cfire rainbow\u201d has been spotted in the United States, raising the question of whether the phenomenon could occur in our own backyard. Circumhorizon arcs, a phenomenon that sees wispy rainbow-coloured shapes appear in the sky, have been lighting up social media after a runner spotted one over a national park near San Francisco, California. The \u201cfire rainbows\u201d are formed when the ice crystals that make up wispy cirrus clouds catch sunlight or moonlight at a certain angle. Meteorologist and ABC weather presenter Nate Byrne says they can happen anywhere if you have all the right ingredients. \u201cWhen it comes to the when/where question, it\u2019s really a matter of chance,\u201d Ms Byrne said. \u201cLatitude matters and the time of year depending on that latitude matters. \u201cYou\u2019re generally most likely to see it when the sun is high in the sky\u00a0\u2013 so summer is the most likely time of year you\u2019ll see it.\u201d A number of conditions in the atmosphere must culminate for the condition to occur: If the stars align (so to speak) and the arc of light passes through the ice crystals at the right angle, the cirrus clouds will light up in a rainbow of colour parallel to the horizon. \u201cWhen the sun hits the ice crystals, you get pretty colours,\u201d Roger Gass, a meteorologist with the US National Weather Service, told local news site SFGATE. \u201cIt\u2019s an optical illusion.\u201d And the closer you are to the equator the more likely it is. Because the sun needs to be so high in the sky for the \u201cfire rainbow\u201d to form, places more than 58 degrees north or south from the equator are unlikely to see it occur. \u201cIn the Northern Territory you\u2019re pretty well positioned because you do get quite a few thunderstorms and cirrus clouds occur often after those storms,\u201d Ms Byrne said. \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re not seeing more in Australia is because there are fewer eyes looking up to the sky.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Massive swordfish could smash Australian record", "date": "2018-4-30", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/04/30/massive-swordfish-could-smash-australian-record/", "transcript": "A whopper 349-kilogram swordfish caught in Victoria on the weekend may have smashed an Australian record.

Tony Kemna from Far Out Charters at Lakes Entrance weighed the colossal catch when it came into port. Mr Kemna, who is also vice president of the Gippsland Lakes Fishing Club, said while there was an element of luck in catching giant swordfish, it also required specialist equipment and plenty of patience. \u201cThey are a very, very hard fish to catch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are sending your bait down 500 metres deep, the baits hit the bottom and then \u2026 you have flashing lights on the end of the rods near the bait, and the lights bring the swordfish in.\u201d \u201cOver the last two years catching swordfish has been increasing in popularity, there\u2019s a lot of people going out and buying bigger boast and bigger motors \u2026 to chase these elusive swordfish.\u201d Mr Kemna said the details of the catch had been sent to Game Fishing Association Australia for record verification. \u201cEverything needs to measured, sent away and then approved \u2026 everything goes to them they check it all out and then they say if you have a record,\u201d Mr Kemna said.

Per CBS News, she set up the DHH Project, in which members with \"no prior experience in sewing\" are creating handmade masks based on the design of commercial masks made for this purpose. That is, with a portion of the front of the cloth mask cut out and replaced with a piece of plastic, so those who read lips or use American Sign Language can see the wearer's mouth or facial expressions, an important component in communicating via ASL. \"This is how we stay #HealthyatHome,\" she writes in a Facebook post.

It's not clear how long she'll be able to keep up with demand, as she's already had dozens of orders come in from six states in just two days' time. Lawrence's group can also provide a tutorial and sewing pattern so others can make the masks. A GoFundMe she set up to raise money for the masks had pulled in nearly $3,400 as of Friday morning.

With an expected surge of cases expected in the state in mid-April, Gov. Charlie Baker has now put out a call pleading for personal protective equipment, or PPE, for health care workers\u2014from face masks and gowns to disinfecting wipes\u2014and New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft has just partially answered that call. The Wall Street Journal reports on a \"remarkable delivery\" due in to Boston's Logan Airport Thursday, when the NFL team's private plane is set to land after a flight from Shenzhen, China, with 1.2 million N95 masks on board. The masks were made by various manufacturers scattered around China.                                                                            Kraft and his family not only arranged for the plane and took care of other details, but also ponied up $2 million, which will pay for about half the costs of the masks. Even New York will reap some benefit from this gesture: Because Kraft has been inspired by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's efforts in that state, he and Baker are planning to send 300,000 of the masks to New York. Baker offered his gratitude to Kraft online Thursday, per Sports Illustrated. \"Thanks to some serious teamwork, Massachusetts is set to receive over 1 million N95 masks for our front-line workers.

Inspired by Michael Rosen's 1989 book We're Going on a Bear Hunt, residents of the US, England, and New Zealand (and maybe other countries) are putting bears in windows so children can spot them from outside. Parents say it gives families a fun distraction and a sense of community as they walk or drive around the neighborhood. \"For about an hour we didn't think about anything else that was happening in the world,\" a Maine mom tells WMTW. \"It was just about the bears.

Donuts Delite in Rochester began selling hundreds of doughnuts with Dr. Anthony Fauci's face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with patriotic sprinkles. The exclusive treats have been selling \"like crazy\" since the store put them on display Monday, according to Nick Semeraro, franchisee of the caf\u00e9. The shop's decision was inspired by the 79-year-old doctor's straightforward communication style and calm demeanor while he's been advising millions of Americans amid a pandemic.                                     The infectious disease expert has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan and President Donald Trump has coined him as a star on his administration's coronavirus task force. Therefore, putting Fauci's face smack down in the middle of a doughnut felt like an obvious choice for Semeraro. \"We're watching the news like everyone else,\" Semeraro told the Democrat & Chronicle on Thursday. \"He's on TV giving us the facts; you\u2019ve got to respect that.

One researcher tells CNN if a health care worker is forced to resort to cloth masks, he or she should alternate between two masks, with daily washes in hot water.

He also asks that they use the hashtag #IStayHomeFor so he can share the posts.                                                                            \"The more folks involved, the merrier,\" he says. \"We\u2019re all connected by various degrees\u2014trust me, I know,\" he says.

Mehra provided it, and her tweet has been shared more than 100,000 times. \"I think that this was just kind of a small light in a dark time, like a nice story of kindness that inspired a lot of people. I'm grateful for that,\" she noted, per USA Today. See her interview on CNN.

After local media reported on Jayde Powell's \"shopping angels\" idea, the movement took off. She's now trying to coordinate volunteer shoppers across the country through Facebook. She also launched a GoFundMe page for the needy.

Per KCRG, the Iowa 4-year-old started feeling sick in the days before Christmas, but mom Amanda Phillips thought she just had a cold. Then, on Christmas Eve, Jade was hit with a high fever, and her parents rushed her to the ER. After having a seizure there, Jade was airlifted to a children's hospital, where her parents were given a frightening diagnosis: She had the flu, but also acute necrotizing encephalopathy, or ANE, a rare disease often brought on by viral infections. \"They said our child might not ever wake up, and if she did, she might not ever be the same,\" Phillips told CNN in January. She also told CNN Jade hadn't had a flu shot, as she'd had one last March; Phillips didn't know she needed a new shot for this flu season.

Then, another sigh of relief a few weeks after she went home: She regained her sight enough to get to the bathroom without touching the walls. Jade's grandmother warns other parents not to ignore signs of sickness in their own kids if they don't show signs of improvement after 24 to 48 hours. \"Demand ... an influenza test,\" Courtney Frey tells CBS 17.

It was then, Craft says, that Trebek pulled out an envelope and said, \"I hope this helps a little bit.\" Inside the envelope: a check for $100,000 to help pay for hot meals, transportation, medical services, or whatever else the 80-plus-bed facility needs to get up and running.

It was hard to believe. With a time of 2 hours, 27 minutes, Seidel had just finished second in the Olympic trials, earning her a ticket to the Games this summer in Tokyo. She beat some of the best runners around, the New York Times reports. Knowing the quality of her competition, she tried not to put too much pressure on herself before her marathon debut. \"But talking with my coach,\" she said, \"I didn\u2019t want to phone it in just because it was my first one.\" Seidel, 25, describes herself as more of a racer than someone who does well in time trials; she said the tough course and headwinds worked in her favor. She was in the pack until Mile 21, when she made her move with Aliphine Tuliamuk and Sally Kipyego. They were the first three finishers and now make up the 2020 Olympic squad. Tuliamuk finished first at 2:27:23.                                                                            At Mile 7, Seidel veered over to high-five her sister. Seidel's route to Atlanta wasn't especially direct. She's overcome an eating disorder. She works two jobs in Boston. She's been a success in 5,000- and 10,000-meter races and won a national cross country championship in 2011. But no marathons. It was her time in a half-marathon in December that qualified her for Atlanta.

After getting safely back outside, he ran next door to his uncle's house, who then alerted the other members of the family still inside the burning home.                                                                            \"Because of his quick actions, he alerted the rest of the family members, so a total of eight family members were able to get out of the house with only minor injuries and smoke inhalation,\" Bartow County Fire Chief Dwayne Jamison tells WXIA, adding to CNN that Noah's actions were \"extraordinary.\" Noah himself suffered burns on his hands; the fire also singed his hair. \"We thank God for our Noah and his heroic actions,\" reads a GoFundMe that as of Saturday morning had raised nearly $25,000 for the family, which says the home was a \"total loss.\" \"If it wasn't for Noah, we may not be here today.\" Bartow County Commissioner Steve Taylor proclaimed Friday \"Noah Woods Day\" in Noah's honor, per ABC News. Fire officials, who suspect the fire was started by an overstressed electrical outlet in the children's bedroom, say there were no functional smoke detectors in the home.  \u00a0"}, {"source": "Newser", "title": "Teen Steps Up to Help Sick Sister, Gets in Trouble at School", "subtitle": "Newt Johnson told he's violating district's dress code", "date": "2020-2-10", "link": "https://www.newser.com/story/286745/teen-told-by-school-to-cut-hair-drops-out-for-his-sister.html", "transcript": "                                                                                    \u2013                                        Maggie Johnson, 11, was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease in October, requiring her to undergo chemo and dialysis that started making her curly red hair fall out, per WOAI. Her big brother, 16-year-old Newt, decided to do something special for her\u2014and now his family says he's been forced to drop out of school because of it. CNN reports Newt's hair has been gaining inches as he grows it out to donate to Locks of Love so the group can make a wig out of it for Maggie, who has Wegener's disease (aka granulomatosis with polyangiitis), which is causing inflammation in her kidneys.

In a statement, Renken adds the community helped raise $3,000 for the family, and that district staff and students wrote cards. \"It was never about not supporting a sick child,\" Renken says. Newt's dad tells WOAI he's proud of his son, noting his kids \"know to be respectful and kind, but if they have a thought they believe in ... they can put their foot down and stand up for it.\" Newt, meanwhile, has plans to now help other people who are dealing with hair loss.

The jersey he wore back then was swiped from the Ardmore school in 2017, but now, in the wake of the late NBA star's death, Bryant's former coach says they have a \"fitting ending to a tough week.\" The AP reports that the long-missing jersey officially came home to the school Saturday during an unveiling ceremony that included a Bryant cousin, ex-teammates, and Gregg Downer, who guided Bryant on the school's court before the teen phenom left for the pros at age 17.

More specifically, she listened to the beat of her son's heart, which had been implanted into Cohen after her son's death. Such meetings are always remarkable, but A.C. Shilton's story in Bicycling explains that this one had even more unusual twist. Cohen had ridden his bicycle across the country\u2014from San Diego to Jacksonville, Florida\u2014to meet Cohen's parents and pay his respects at the gravestone of James Mazzuchelli. The latter had been a 32-year-old Navy flight surgeon when he was mortally injured in a helicopter training mission at Camp Pendleton.                                                                            Cheer and her husband, David, got to the California hospital before he died, but doctors informed them their son would never wake up. Cheer then made sure his organs were donated. The day Mazzuchelli was injured just happened to be Cohen's 33rd birthday. That day, he blew out the candles of his cake and wished for a new heart, writes Shilton. Cohen had survived leukemia as a youth, but the treatment ravaged his heart, and it finally began failing. The transplant was successful, and after Cheer reached out to him with a letter about her son, Cohen settled on his plan for the bike journey. \"As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I wanted them to know that James\u2019s heart was in a safe place,\" he says of his donor's parents. \"That I was going to do everything I could to protect it.\" (Read the full story.)\u00a0"}, {"source": "Newser", "title": "A Late Journalist Gets One More Honor", "subtitle": "Gwen Ifill is now on a forever stamp", "date": "2020-1-30", "link": "https://www.newser.com/story/286283/a-late-journalist-gets-one-more-honor.html", "transcript": "                                                                                    \u2013                                        She was a groundbreaking journalist.

And on Thursday afternoon, it paid off in a big way: Alarms immediately alerted firefighters a baby was inside the box, which was installed at the Seymour Fire Department in June of last year, and she was retrieved within one minute. \"This baby is healthy, perfect, and doing very well, and appeared to be around one hour old,\" the founder of Safe Haven says, per the Tribune.                                                                            \"We are ecstatic that the system was used,\" the fire chief says. \"It worked perfect, exactly how it was designed to work.\" The infant was taken to a hospital and will be placed in the custody of the state's child service workers upon her release; an adoptive home will be found within 45 days, but mothers who surrender their babies have 30 days to return if they change their minds. The boxes are meant to give distressed mothers a place to safely and anonymously leave their babies. Wart, who came up with the idea as a junior in high school and worked on it as his senior project, is now raising money for a second box.

Who are the people I look at and say, 'That's who I want to be'?\" For Demetrio Aguila, a Nebraska surgeon specializing in nerve pain, the answer to his own question is his father, also a physician\u2014and one who loved helping people so much he never complained about his long hours at work. Those genes appear to have been passed down to his son, who's making headlines for an innovative program meant to assist people who can't afford surgery. CBS News reports that Aguila, an Air Force veteran, set up his M25 program at his Healing Hands of Nebraska clinic after he saw patient after patient have to turn down surgery because it cost too much. Six months ago, he decided to do something about it, and his idea was a creative one: Let those who qualify do volunteer work in exchange for any necessary procedures.                                                                            \"We can't ignore the people in our own backyard,\" Aguila tells CBS. Per KMTV, the program's name comes from Matthew 25:40: \"Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.\" About 10% of his patients qualify for the program, which figures out the number of volunteer hours depending on how complex the surgery is; other people can help patients fulfill their hours. Reception so far has been positive. \"There's nothing more depressing than seeing a bill for ... $24,000, and going, 'And how much of this will my insurance cover?'\" patient Jeff Jensen tells CBS, noting that instead he put in 560 hours of volunteering (100 or so people helped) as barter for foot surgery. \"This whole practice is about restoring hope for patients by giving them the opportunity to wrest back control of their health care,\" Aguila says.  \u00a0"}, {"source": "Newser", "title": "2 Guys Just Made an 'Earth Sandwich'", "subtitle": "They precisely placed slices of bread on the ground in New Zealand and Spain", "date": "2020-1-21", "link": "https://www.newser.com/story/285885/2-guys-just-made-an-earth-sandwich.html", "transcript": "                                                                                    \u2013                                        Two strangers who live a world apart just made an unusual sandwich together.

The result is an \"earth sandwich\"\u2014two slices of bread placed on opposite sides of the planet with about 7,900 miles of earth between them, per the Guardian. See the resulting images for yourself via Reddit. (Sierra actually placed nine slices on the ground, to make extra-sure he hit his precise coordinate.) The men used longitude and latitude to figure out where to lay their respective slices of bread. Technically speaking, they placed the slices on antipodes\u2014points opposite each other on the Earth's surface.                                                                            \u201cWe made sure to get the exact location with Google Maps, to get us within a few meters range, and then we used the actual image data on Google Maps to pinpoint ourselves even closer than that,\" Naude tells RNZ. His spot was relatively close to where he lived, but Sierra had to travel several miles. \"It's quite tough to find a spot which isn't water on the New Zealand end\u2014and where public roads or paths intersect in both sides,\" he says. They are not the first to make such a sandwich, with that honor going to American artist Ze Frank in 2006, notes the BBC.

Emily James tells the Oregonian that on Dec. 23, she was working at the bank's call center in Gresham, Ore., when she heard from Marc Eugenio, who needed help lifting a hold on a $1,000-plus paycheck from a new job. James tells KOIN 6 that Eugenio told her without that cash, he couldn't afford living expenses or Christmas gifts for his two young kids. James advised him to visit his local branch the next day, Christmas Eve, to have the hold lifted\u2014but when he went, the bank manager was on vacation and no one else could lift the hold. He called James back in frustration and happened to mention he was at a gas station about 15 miles away from the call center. \"I wish I had just $20 bucks to get home,\" Eugenio says he told James.

Appearing on ABC's Good Morning America, spouses Benny Correa and Amanda Disley described recognizing the vehicle sought in an Amber Alert in the abduction Wednesday of 11-year-old Charlotte Moccia. The couple said they were out getting dinner with their five children when the blue car drove by. Correa, in the driver's seat, began following the car. His wife called 911, giving their location as the driver sped up and ran red lights. The couple noticed the driver was pushing something down in the back seat.

Upon discovering that one box containing a household item also contained a separate box with stacks of bills, a staffer at the facility alerted team members, who called police, then analyzed CCTV footage to see who had left the money behind.                                                                            After using on-site license plate recognition cameras to identify a vehicle, officers interviewed a couple from Burnham-on-Sea, without revealing that anything had been found, until they were sure the money was theirs. \"Shocked\" that they'd unwittingly thrown out $20,000, the couple in their mid- to late 60s thanked the staffer who found the box with an undisclosed reward, per the Times. Police, meanwhile, praised employees' actions as going beyond the \"reasonable enquiries\" that would typically be expected. \"Without their diligent attitude, integrity and assistance, the family would never have known about the money found, and we would not have been able to return it to them, especially in time for Christmas,\" a police statement reads, per Metro.  \u00a0"}, {"source": "Newser", "title": "Woman Lost in Woods Saved Thanks to iPhone Flashlight", "subtitle": "Woman got lost on a trail, was spotted via night vision helicopter", "date": "2019-12-31", "link": "https://www.newser.com/story/285034/woman-lost-in-woods-saved-thanks-to-iphone-flashlight.html", "transcript": "                                                                                    \u2013                                        That iPhone flashlight really comes in handy sometimes ... like when you're missing in the Florida wilderness and hoping to be rescued.

After years of fear and uncertainty, bottom trawler fishermen\u2014those who use nets to catch rockfish, bocaccio, sole, Pacific Ocean perch, and other deep-dwelling fish\u2014are making a comeback here, reinventing themselves as a sustainable industry less than two decades after authorities closed huge stretches of the Pacific Ocean because of the species' depletion, the AP reports. The ban devastated fishermen, but on Jan. 1, regulators will reopen an area roughly three times the size of Rhode Island off Oregon and California to groundfish bottom trawling\u2014all with the approval of environmental groups that were once the industry's biggest foes.                                     The rapid turnaround is made even more unique by the collaboration between the fishermen and environmentalists who spent years refining a long-term fishing plan that will continue to resuscitate the groundfish industry while permanently protecting thousands of square miles of reefs and coral beds that benefit the overfished species. Now, the fishermen who see their livelihood returning must solve another piece of the puzzle: drumming up consumer demand for fish that haven't been in grocery stores or on menus for a generation. \"It's really a conservation home run,\" says Shems Jud, regional director for the Environmental Defense Fund's ocean program. \"The recovery is decades ahead of schedule.

Then she fell unconscious. \"I couldn't feel a breath, I couldn't feel a heartbeat,\" he recalls, per the BBC, explaining why he thought his wife was dead. Doctors aren't surprised.

That allowed doctors to remove blood and infuse it with oxygen before putting it back in her body.

The result: Schoeman was released 12 days later with only mobility issues in her hands, per Reuters. For Argudo, it's remarkable, if not a miracle.

A shortened version of the ad aired during the parade, but there's a four-minute-plus version on YouTube that shows a now-grown Elliott's kids discovering E.T. in their yard, followed by an awed reunion between the movie's two stars.                                                                            \"You came back,\" Elliott says breathlessly as he kneels in front of his long-lost alien friend in \"A Holiday Reunion.\" \"The audience is going to get everything they want out of a sequel without the messy bits that could destroy the beauty of the original and the special place it has in people's minds and hearts,\" Thomas said in a release. \"It's really a win-win.\" io9 touches more on the connection between all the seemingly disparate parts involved with the commercial: Xfinity is owned by Comcast, which also owns parade network NBC and Universal Pictures, which owns the Spielberg movie.

Images of the silver-backed chevrotain, commonly called the Vietnamese mouse deer, were captured in the wild by trap cameras, Global Wildlife Conservation says. The group says the rabbit-sized animal is not a deer or a mouse, despite its nickname, but is the world's smallest hoofed mammal. They are shy and solitary, have two tiny fangs, appear to walk on the tips of their hooves, and have a silver sheen, the group says. The chevrotain was first described in 1910 by four people.

Per KSFY, the fundraiser aims to honor both 79-year-old Trebek, who is battling Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and the late Jeopardy champion Larry Martin, who died from pancreatic cancer earlier this year.

The North Carolina man, a retired Department of Transportation worker from Pink Hill who has colon cancer, was headed to his very last chemotherapy treatment on Tuesday when he stopped at a convenience store in Beulaville to pick up a scratch-off lottery ticket, CBS News reports. Foster forked over the $1 he usually did, played his card, and found out he'd won $5. He plunked his new winnings down for a $5 scratch-off, then bought a second $5 card just for the heck of it. While he didn't win anything with the first ticket, the second one had something else in store.                                                                            \"I saw all those zeros and I froze,\" Foster said, per a North Carolina Education Lottery release. His big win: $200,000. \"When it showed, 'Go to lottery headquarters,' I started shaking. I couldn't believe it.\" Foster tells CBS he started undergoing chemo in April after a February surgery, and that he couldn't say if this stroke of luck on an already significant day was a \"sign\"; he \"just might have been at the right place at the right time.\" His take-home windfall of just over $140,000 after taxes will go toward paying medical costs not covered by insurance, as well as buying a lawn mower and car, with the rest to be squirreled away in savings. \"I was already happy because it was my last round of chemo,\" says Foster, per the release. \"Winning this made it my lucky day.\"  \u00a0"}, {"source": "Newser", "title": "Opposing Players Huddle to Help a Foe", "subtitle": "Sportsmanship on display in footage out of Jordan", "date": "2019-10-25", "link": "https://www.newser.com/story/282214/opposing-players-huddle-to-help-a-foe.html", "transcript": "                                                                                    \u2013                                        A viral video clip from a soccer match is warming hearts.

On Friday, that all changed, thanks to Christina Koch and Jessica Meir. The two NASA astronauts became the world's first all-female team to do a spacewalk when they were sent out to make fixes to the International Space Station's power grid, the AP reports. It was the first spacewalk ever for Meir (she's only the 15th woman ever to make a spacewalk), and Koch's fourth (she's No. 14, as she did her first spacewalk on a co-ed team earlier this year). The women, former Girl Scouts who are also close friends back on Earth, were originally supposed to carry out the dangerous task next week, to put in new batteries, but their mission got moved up a few days when a new problem that needed addressing cropped up over the weekend.

On Friday, Meir and Koch both wore medium-sized suits, per the New York Times, with Space.com noting Koch's bore special significance: Hers included a portable life support system with the number \"1008\" on it, which is the same number that appeared on the backpack of Kathryn Sullivan, the first woman ever to do a spacewalk, on Oct. 11, 1984.

New research in the journal Nature notes that even though it's already known bacteria is able to move from the gut to the pancreas, it wasn't clear whether fungi could do the same\u2014until now. \"Our new study is the first to confirm that fungi, too, make that trip, and that related fungal population changes promote tumor inception and growth,\" study co-author George Miller says in a release from NYU, which led the research on this \"fungal invasion.\" Scientists examined both humans with pancreatic cancer and fecal samples from mice with and without the disease, and found \"an increase in fungi of about 3,000-fold\" in the cancerous tissue compared with healthy tissue.

Boyan Slat, a university dropout who founded the Ocean Cleanup nonprofit, announced Wednesday that the floating boom is skimming up waste ranging in size from a discarded net and a car wheel complete with tire to chips of plastic measuring just 1 millimeter, the AP reports. The results are promising enough to begin designing a second system to send to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area of floating plastic trash twice the size of Texas, Slat says.

After it was towed out to sea last year, the barrier did not catch any trash in its first weeks of operation because it was moving at the same speed as the plastic. That problem was overcome by using an underwater parachute anchor to slow the boom. Also, late last year, the barrier broke under the constant pummeling by wind and waves, requiring four months of repairs before being relaunched in June. The organization wants to continue developing the plastic traps, scale them up, and deploy more to the Pacific so they can gather thousands of tons of plastic each year.

He didn't own one, so he did the next best thing\u2014the unidentified boy wore an orange T-shirt with his own hand-drawn UT logo taped to the front of it. You can see it here, via a post from Laura Snyder, his teacher at Tallahassee Elementary School. Snyder posted the image because other students teased the boy so much about the shirt that he broke down in tears.

First, UT interim President Randy Boyd tweeted his support. Then the university turned the boy's design into a shirt that's now for sale at the school gift shop for $14.99\u2014with part of the proceeds going to anti-bullying efforts. \"I am overwhelmed by the love I feel from this extended community,\" the boy's mother wrote, per WVLT.

That's thanks to two California professors who erected three bright-pink seesaws through a section of steel border fence separating El Paso, Texas, from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, reports the Guardian. Ronald Rael, an architecture professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Virginia San Fratello, an associate professor of design at San Jose State University, came up with the design for the \"Teetertotter Wall,\" per People. It's meant as a sign of unity, with the border wall acting as \"a literal fulcrum,\" Rael wrote on Instagram, where he shared drone footage showing children and adults playing on either side of the border.

So what was the Florida couple to do when they got engaged? Ask wedding guests to bring school supplies for kids in need in lieu of traditional wedding gifts. They came up with an \"Angel Tree\" idea, in which each guest was given a description of the children they'd be buying for, and the guests really went for it: More than 70 backpacks were donated, full of school supplies, uniforms, other articles of clothing, water bottles, and even cleaning supplies.

But when her 9-year-old daughter asked if they could buy a pair of Avengers sneakers for a classmate in need, Jernigan was struck with an idea: What if she just bought out the entire store and donated all of the shoes? And so she half-jokingly asked the clerk how much she'd want for the 350 or so pairs of shoes still perched on the store's shelves. Per KFSM, the clerk asked for Jernigan's phone number and told her she'd let her know about her request.

If he had arrived at the scene much later, it would have been a dead human. Quinones, a Portland resident who works for a company that makes route-planning software for cyclists, soon realized that he had found a semiconscious, badly sunburned, and dehydrated man who had collapsed. \"Once I got a better look at him, I could tell he was in deep trouble,\" Quinones tells the AP.

Police say Randolph was incredibly lucky that Quinones, who was on a weeklong back-country trip, turned up when he did.

The north Atlantic archipelago currently has only one person in hospital with Covid-19 and it is one of three European countries, along with Georgia and Liechtenstein to so far not have any deaths from the virus. On Wednesday, the country\u2019s prime minister, B\u00e1r\u00f0ur \u00e1 Steig Nielsen, announced that as of 20 April the country\u2019s kindergartens, nurseries and early years classes in primary schools would reopen. Pupils in the last year of secondary school will also return to class and sport will recommence without spectators. The success of the Faroese approach is said by local politicians to be largely a result of the foresight of the veterinary scientist Debes Christiansen, the head of department at the National Reference Laboratory for Fish and Animal Diseases in the capital, T\u00f3rshavn. Christiansen had warned the government of the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark as early as January of the need to prepare for the possible spread of the disease from China. His laboratory, which was primarily geared to test salmon for viral infection, was adapted and he purchased the extra ingredients required to test humans. There has been mass testing for virus among salmon farmed in Faroese waters since an outbreak of salmon anaemia virus in 2001 ravaged the species. Of the archipelago\u2019s total export value, 90% is accounted for by fish and half of that is salmon. According to official records, 10% of the population of 61,000 people have now been tested for the coronavirus. Faroese doctors have been able to track and quarantine everyone who has had contact with the 184 people who had tested positive for the virus. Of those who have fallen ill, 131 have fully recovered. Christiansen told the Guardian that the switch to human testing had not involved \u201ctoo much hocus pocus\u201d and that his veterinarian laboratory had been able to source materials required for the tests from a wider range of suppliers than hospitals. He said: \u201cIt is very easy to adapt. The only thing I changed were some of the ingredients. In our normal work it is specific to fish virus and fish bacteria and in this case I just changed the three components specific to the coronavirus.\u201d Christiansen said his facility could do up to 1,000 tests a day if required and the research assistants were available. He said the latest batch of test samples on Tuesday had been negative. He said: \u201cIt seems that there isn\u2019t a high load of virus in the Faroese environment at the moment. Everyone is talking about those black figures [of patients now showing symptoms] but we have tested more than 10% of the population so I don\u2019t think we have that have that many running around who are infected.\u201d Kristina H\u00e1foss, an opposition MP who was the country\u2019s finance minister until 2019, praised Christiansen\u2019s swift action and that of the government in setting up a drive-in testing facility at the main hospital in the capital and a quarantine at an airport hotel. She said: \u201cIf we had had to send the tests to Denmark for analysis it takes days and up to a week to get them back and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to control the disease the way we have done. \u201cTracking and tracing has been a very important part. It has been possible to trace all the people who have been tested positive and who they have been with.

The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible \u2013 extending workers\u2019 rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US \u2013 have already happened. The word \u201ccrisis\u201d means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word \u201cemergency\u201d comes from \u201cemergence\u201d or \u201cemerge\u201d, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word \u201ccatastrophe\u201d comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning. We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now \u2013 especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties \u2013 is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible. A disaster (which originally meant \u201cill-starred\u201d, or \u201cunder a bad star\u201d) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of \u201cwe\u201d might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are. As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you\u2019re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you\u2019re working all the time, especially when it appears you\u2019re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world. * * * The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems \u2013 political, economic, social, ecological \u2013 in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what\u2019s strong, what\u2019s weak, what\u2019s corrupt, what matters and what doesn\u2019t. I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it\u2019s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo \u2013 it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it\u2019s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both. Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life \u2013 as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power \u2013 as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights \u2013 and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing). Disaster scholars use the term \u201celite panic\u201d to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201clooting\u201d in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it\u2019s wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it\u2019s altruistic to gather supplies to share. Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a \u201cshoot to kill\u201d proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans\u2019s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided. The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 levees had failed; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush\u2019s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil\u2019s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: \u201cHe represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn\u2019t care less about people\u2019s lives. They\u2019re worried about maintaining their profitability.\u201d (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.) The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed divine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: \u201cplease do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms &amp; your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.\u201d The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: \u201cThe damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.\u201d (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.) Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status. The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them \u2013 this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one\u2019s whims. \u201cThis denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times. Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US \u2013 a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions. * * * When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future. For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: \u201cLet us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.\u201d We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant. My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: \u201cWe are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.\u201d When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables. Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff \u2013 medicine, medical equipment \u2013 made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all. \u201cGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers,\u201d Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all \u2013 and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces. A dozen years ago I interviewed the Nicaraguan poet and Sandinista revolutionary Giocondo Belli for my book on disaster, A Paradise Built in Hell. What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua \u2013 that, despite the dictatorship\u2019s crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution \u2013 was unforgettable. She said: \u201cYou had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: \u2018So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.\u2019 You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It\u2019s a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.\u201d I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good. * * * I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe\u2019s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible \u2013 housing the homeless, for example \u2013 have come to pass in some places. Ireland nationalised its hospitals, something \u201cwe were told would never happen and could never happen,\u201d an Irish journalist commented. Canada came up with four months of basic income for those who lost their jobs. Germany did more than that. Portugal decided to treat immigrants and asylum seekers as full citizens during the pandemic. In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is \u201cfollowing guidelines\u201d on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost half a million Kroger grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general told Amazon to expand its paid sick leave. These specifics make clear how possible it is to change the financial arrangements of all our societies. But often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011\u2019s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible. We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There\u2019s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land. * * * There\u2019s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it\u2019s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells \u2013 for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It\u2019s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid \u2013 full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change. But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one\u2019s own interior life and the suffering around us \u2013 and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed \u2013 well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory. Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: \u201cProvide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.\u201d It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless. Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Crossbreeding corals: the hunt for ways to heal the Great Barrier Reef", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/crossbreeding-corals-breathing-new-life-into-the-great-barrier-reef-aoe", "date": "2020-04-04", "transcript": "One of the dive instructors points out two blacktip reef sharks circling a docile green turtle busy grazing on algae. Stingrays of various sizes, colours and shapes pass beneath us. Suddenly, a pod of dolphins appears, swimming over the hard corals. The dive takes place on what appears to be healthy and pristine coral reef surrounding Lady Elliot Island, at the very southern end of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef off Queensland. There are no visible signs of the bleaching that has plagued other parts of the reef for some years, but the government agency responsible for the reef, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has confirmed that the natural landmark has suffered a third mass coral bleaching episode in five years, describing the damage as \u201cvery widespread\u201d. Mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 hit vast areas of the reef. As the rate at which bleaching events hit the world\u2019s biggest reef system increases, scientists, farmers and volunteers across Queensland are trying to do their bit to lessen the impact. Gary Spotswood is a third-generation farmer at Mt Alma Organics, an organic farm a couple of hours drive from Townsville, a city on the north-eastern coast of Queensland. Spotswood has installed pumps to accumulate the run-off on his 430 acres, which then filters through aquatic plants growing in the adjacent wetlands. The project is partly funded by a grant from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, which was awarded a controversial A$444m (\u00a3217m) from the Australian government to sponsor projects on the reef. \u201cI try to keep as much water on the land as possible,\u201d says Spotswood, who leads courses in land use for other farmers and graziers. \u201cChanges take time. But in five years people have changed their habits in how they use the land,\u201d he says. At Townsville\u2019s tropical marine research centre, scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) are looking at how so-called super corals (corals that can resist increased water temperatures) could be used to save the reefs. About 25 strains of coral are being crossbred with the same or different species. The research is being carried out in the National Sea Simulator, the world\u2019s most advanced research aquarium, and intends to show that young coral offspring \u2013 produced from mixing corals from various parts of the reef \u2013 can survive in warmer sea temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s like crossbreeding corn. We do the same thing with the corals, so they can withstand higher temperatures,\u201d says Kate Quigley, a researcher on reef restoration at Aims. The method is called \u201cassisted gene flow\u201d, and although at an early stage, shows encouraging results in the sea simulator, as well as on the reef \u2013 where cross-fertilised corals have been transplanted. The hybrids have one parent from the northern parts and one parent from the central reefs, and the results show that corals with at least one parent from the more heat-resistant northern reefs survive when placed in cooler environments. The research has also confirmed that the offspring inherit heat tolerance from their northern parents, and these genes may ultimately be passed on to make reefs more heat resistant. Aims also conducts research on how to decrease the numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish (cots), which prey upon corals. There are currently more than five million cots on the reefs between Cairns and Cooktown, and the invasion spreads south as the heavily spined species (which normally range from 25\u201335cm across, and can have up to 23 arms) devours corals and leaves nothing but traces of fine calcium carbonate. Female cots can produce up to 50 million eggs a year and each one annually ingests 10 square metres of coral. Rising sea temperatures and increased availability of nutrients due to run-off from farming practices are said to be behind the rise in cot numbers. So far divers have culled about half a million by injecting the starfish with white vinegar. Scientists at Aims are attempting to wield another \u2013 more natural weapon \u2013 to combat the mass outbreak. They breed the rare giant triton, a large marine snail that feeds on cots. The scientists aim to reintroduce the snails on reefs \u2013 from where they have disappeared. The climate crisis and evidence of another mass bleaching, however, continue to overshadow any sign of progress. Quigley says hundreds of studies point in the same direction. \u201cThey are showing that climate change is the biggest threat against the reef,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future reefs look like. But we need to mitigate the effects that climate change has on the corals.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Covid-19: a good time to dig out good news", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/ploughing-through-coronavirus-news-for-the-brighter-stories", "date": "2020-04-03", "transcript": "Last week we began with a paradox.

Lucky numbers Defence budgets are likely to be a secondary victim of the Covid-19 pandemic. Jane\u2019s, a defence thinktank, reckons spending could be reduced by tens of billions of pounds around the world as a result of the virus. Andrew MacDonald, a Jane\u2019s analyst said: \u201cDefence spending plans in a series of the world\u2019s largest defence markets are on course to be derailed in the near-term by the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d What we liked This piece in the Conversation asked whether the virus might kill off the global wildlife trade. We were humbled by the sports stars who realised there is another kind of heroism, people like Jos Buttler, Marcus Rashford and the Barcelona football team. This piece in the Atlantic is beautiful: the chance to regain a less hurried life. We admired the Boston Globe\u2019s new initiative to connect people in need with people who are able to help. And the LA Times piece on the festival hands now building Covid triage units. Given that we cannot travel at the moment and are restless for new vistas, we also liked this attempt to digitally recreate ruined castles of Europe by NeoMam Studios. And finally there were bouncy rubber pavements, which we thought might have been an early April fool, until it emerged that April Fool\u2019s Day was largely cancelled this year. What we heard With so many of us restricted in our movements, the life-in-lockdown stories have been pouring in. Keep them coming. Lesley Freedman wrote in from lockdown in Sydney We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary last week in Sydney. It was a covid news-free day! My partner and I rediscovered our wedding photos and watched the video for the first time right through. In the evening we dressed up and connected with four of our special guests online. We wore silly hats, popped champagne on cue and offered each other olives and cheese. For the first time in days we were happy. Adam Mileusnic has also been indoors, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from doing miles on his bike I\u2019m a British guy living in Madrid and have been quarantined in my flat for 15 days now. I livestreamed an eight-hour cycling challenge on my exercise bike for a group of 36 children\u2019s charities affected by the Covid crisis (collectively called Family for Every Child) and raised over \u00a31,000.

Swollen rivers have been sluggishly sitting in the valley for months. Inhabitants\u2019 attempts to protect their homes from flooding are part of a losing battle played out across the country. The UK\u2019s flooding this year is a story of desperation \u2013 but also hope, says John Hughes, development manager at Shropshire Wildlife Trust, who works in the valley. Following widespread acceptance of the climate and ecological emergency, Hughes believes people are increasingly looking to nature for solutions. George Eustice, the environment secretary, has announced that \u00a34bn will be spent on flood defences in the next five years and said a \u201cbig part of our focus is going to be nature-based solutions upstream\u201d. Hughes says: \u201cThe media normally have a distinct agenda when it comes to floods which is: \u2018how miserable have you been?\u2019 This time around the interviews I heard were talking about natural solutions and I\u2019d never heard that before. \u201cI say thanks very much Extinction Rebellion and Greta [Thunberg] \u2013 you\u2019ve done a great job. It\u2019s the job we\u2019ve been trying to do for 50 years. We need to take a holistic view \u2013 land can do many, many things.\u201d Soils In the past, flood plains acted like sponges that soaked up water and stopped it flowing headlong into settlements downstream. Wetter habitats provided useful materials such as willow and reeds for baskets and thatched roofs. However, natural wet woodland, neutral grassland, fens and marshes were ironed out of the postwar landscape and now cover just 11% of English and Welsh flood plains. Intensive agriculture covers 70%. Crops such as maize, potatoes, asparagus and onions are harvested as late as October because of the milder UK climate. This means fields are often left bare over winter months after heavy machinery has compacted the soil. This leaves the land unable to soak up so much water. \u201cWhen you drive heavy vehicles on soggy soil you make a mess,\u201d says John Quinton, professor of soil science at Lancaster University. \u201cYou\u2019ve then destroyed the soil structure, and because of that water can\u2019t get into the soil very quickly. The water runs over the surface of the soil and picks up the soil and deposits it in rivers or elsewhere. If soils are in good condition, the water will go into the soil and you will have a lot of storage.\u201d Scientists say creating grassland, giving land rest periods and avoiding the use of heavy machinery in flood-prone areas will reduce nutrient and sediment loss from fields. \u201cSome groups of farmers are definitely moving in the right direction. When I started my career in the late 80s we weren\u2019t talking about soil erosion or nutrient losses. Things are changing,\u201d says Quinton. Experts are only beginning to understand the complexity of soil ecosystems. In the flood-hit village of Eaton Bishop in Herefordshire, farm conservation adviser Caroline Hanks compares two spadefuls of soil from the same field near her house \u2013 one from the middle of the field where intensively farmed maize was harvested in October, and the other from under tussocky grass by the hedge. The first sample is root-free and heavily compacted, meaning water cannot percolate more than eight inches below the surface. The second spadeful is crumbly, full of roots and moist throughout. The two samples look \u2013 and smell \u2013 different. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give people a visual way to assess their soil. It\u2019s such a simple technique \u2013 you can tell so much from a spadeful of soil,\u201d says Hanks, who specialises in advising farmers on creating flower-rich grassland. \u201cTwenty years ago people expected us to focus on birds and hedgerows and field edges but these days getting a spade out and looking at soil is a core part of the visit.\u201d According to Quinton\u2019s Defra-funded research there is between three and 10 times more water run-off from compacted soils than healthy soils. \u201cThat rotten egg smell you get from compacted soils is certainly something that says to me that\u2019s an unhealthy soil,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows that it\u2019s compacted and its normal biology isn\u2019t functioning very well. In the soil that\u2019s aerated you\u2019ve got fungi and bacteria which are active and sometimes after rain, you get that sweet smell of damp soil, and it\u2019s actually a compound called geosmin.\u201d Creating rough landscapes Many natural flood-management techniques involve reinstating features that were once common to fields such as ponds, hedges and leaky dams (either created by fallen trees or beavers). Creating buffer strips, wooded areas, drainage ditches and re-meandering rivers are all part of the toolkit. The overall effect is to give the landscape more structure and roughness to counterbalance the way industrialised farming has smoothed it out. The problem is that reducing food production is currently counterintuitive to most farmers\u2019 business plan, says Dr Marc Stutter, a soil and water scientist at the James Hutton Institute. \u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019re fighting against is that the farmers and their fathers and grandfathers have been very proud of the way they\u2019ve brought the land into condition for crops and quite rightfully so. Their parents have spent a lot of effort draining the land and now there\u2019s someone telling them they want pockets of it to be wet up again. \u201cIf we could reverse it and say they\u2019re not just farmers of a crop but stewards of the land then we might be able to think of water quality and flood resistance as part of their overall job.\u201d Natural flood management has other benefits \u2013 planting trees and hedges helps to create vital habitats for nature and locks away carbon. Creating buffer strips along streams and rivers helps filter out pollutants and improves water quality. However, nature-based solutions are no silver bullet, according to analysis by the University of Oxford which found they would be overwhelmed by the sort of floods seen in the UK this winter. Making the land more absorbent should be used alongside traditional \u201chard engineering\u201d techniques such as flood walls, says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading. \u201cPutting beavers in the River Thames is not going to keep people dry and a different solution is required. However, for some of the smaller communities you could implement woody debris dams and make sure the soil upstream is able to absorb the water. Not one size fits all. It must be an open discussion between farmers and Defra and the Environment Agency and scientists. It\u2019s not an easy problem but I think we should be confident that we can solve it,\u201d she says. Case studies In 2015 Glenridding, a village at the bottom of Helvellyn in the Lake District, was one of many communities trashed by Storm Desmond. Danny Teasdale, a mechanic from the village, decided to do something. \u201cFlooding isn\u2019t going to go away, we\u2019ve got to start looking at things. There are extreme conservationists on one side and extreme farmers on the other and they keep clashing heads and nothing happens. I sit in the middle \u2026 I know the local farmers and they trust me,\u201d he says. In the valley above the village, Teasdale created a wiggly upstream release channel that runs parallel to the river and fills up only when the river is full. He worked with the local farmer and the Environment Agency. The \u00a36,000 project was funded by a local flood action group. Teasdale says: \u201cWe\u2019ve just had really, really heavy rain with Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis \u2013 I think some of the heaviest since Storm Desmond \u2013 and it didn\u2019t flood this time. So it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s been helping. It goes hand in hand with hard engineering in the village but if you can slow things down upstream you don\u2019t need to build your walls so high.\u201d Teasdale\u2019s work was so successful he created a community interest group called Ullswater Catchment Management CIC in November 2018. He has since worked in a number of different catchments around Ullswater with the Woodland Trust, Natural England and the Environment Agency, including planting 2,000 trees in Grisedale valley at a cost of \u00a38,000 and a project to re-wiggle the river in Matterdale that cost \u00a314,000. \u201cIt\u2019s peanuts compared to the money that goes into hard engineering,\u201d explains Teasdale, who says \u00a32m has already been spent on hard flood defences in Glenridding. Elsewhere in the Lake District, the RSPB led a similar river re-wiggling scheme in Swindale valley. The work cost \u00a3200,000 and involved letting the river meander back into its old course after being straightened by hill farmers looking to dry out land hundreds of years ago. The valley is a kilometre long and the river is now 180 metres longer. \u201cIt\u2019s all about holding that water in the higher catchments for longer,\u201d says Lee Schofield, a site manager at RSPB Haweswater. \u201cHaving a wiggly river means they move more slowly. We\u2019re delaying flood peak \u2013 it\u2019s a low-tech solution that delivers many other benefits and makes the landscape much more resilient.\u201d Paul Quinn, a senior lecturer in catchment hydrology at Newcastle University, believes more drastic landscape measures, called catchment systems engineering (CSE), are needed to compensate for the fact that flood plains are already full of houses and roads. More than 40% of rivers have been deepened or modified so that they are no longer connected to their flood plains. \u201cIn a beautiful world that doesn\u2019t exist, we could get our soil back into good condition and that would actually stop a lot of floods. But when the big floods come along \u2013 the kind that climate change is going to produce \u2013 soil management is not going to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cCSE is halfway between nature-based solutions and something that\u2019s a bit like traditional flood management which is usually big dams, big ponds and big walls. We need to start spreading them out over the whole catchment system. It seems to me such a simple idea. It\u2019s not rocket science, it\u2019s about storing water \u2013 and large amounts of it \u2013 at every opportunity you can.\u201d Quinn\u2019s approach includes natural solutions as well as features such as the creation of large retention ponds and cascading channels. His team built 35 ponds and dams, and created 10 zones of oak, beech and willow plantations in the catchment attached to the village of Belford in Northumberland which has been badly affected by flooding. The scheme cost \u00a3200,000 and in the seven years since the work was completed the village has not flooded. \u201cEvery single catchment in the country will have to be done,\u201d he says. What next? In terms of soils, Quinton believes people\u2019s attitudes are already changing: \u201cI sense a shift in the farming community with a much greater emphasis on soils and how to sustain them. I have no evidence for this, except talking to farmers and watching Twitter. I get the feeling that there is increasing recognition that protecting soils is vital for the sustainability of the farm business.\u201d Farmers think of food production as their primary motivation because that is what they have been subsidised to do. Rather than trying to farm flood-prone areas of land that don\u2019t yield much, farmers may be subsidised to manage them for nature. Many feel the government is making the right noises with policies laid out in the new Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) \u2013 which will be fully implemented by 2028. A Defra spokesperson told the Guardian that natural flood management would be an important part of protecting the nation from flooding. \u201cELMS will reward farmers for the public goods that they provide, including protecting communities from environmental hazards such as flooding. Natural England and the Environment Agency do vital work and we continue to work closely with both agencies to ensure they have the right resources to continue to do so.\u201d Soil management has featured prominently in ELMS \u2013 with funding set to be available for measures such as no-till agriculture and maintaining water in peat soils \u2013 but conservationists are worried that the devil is in the detail. Teasdale says: \u201cI\u2019ve seen what the government has done to Environment Agency and Natural England and what they\u2019ve done to their budget, and it\u2019s criminal. They\u2019ve slashed it. ELMS could potentially be good but it needs to be funded properly and that\u2019s what I\u2019m not sure about.

Dancing in the street Residents on a street in Cheshire are doing something a little bit different for their daily exercise in lockdown \u2013 a socially distanced communal dance session. Fitness instructor Janet Woodcock, 54, came up with the idea after one of her neighbours said she was missing her exercise class. For eight days now the residents of Springbourne in Frodsham have stepped out of their front doors at 11am, keeping a safe distance from one another, to do 10 minutes of exercise led by Woodcock. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple stuff, but it\u2019s about people moving, seeing one another and just having fun really,\u201d she said. \u201cOne woman told me it\u2019s the highlight of her day. Some people are working from home, but a lot of retired people just tend to be reading and watching the news all day, and it can get really depressing. So it\u2019s just nice to get people out in the fresh air.\u201d Each session starts with the Neighbours theme tune, followed by other specially chosen songs like Dancing in the Street, Our House by Madness and Tom Jones\u2019s It\u2019s Not Unusual \u2013 a street favourite. \u201cThe way it\u2019s brought us all together is just fabulous,\u201d said Woodcock. \u201cIt feels really heartwarming to see how it\u2019s helped people now, but hopefully we won\u2019t forget this. \u201cWe\u2019ve all promised a big street party when it\u2019s over and I think everybody will feel like they know each other a bit better.\u201d Singing at six Hundreds of people across the country have joined a singing movement set up by an NHS intensive care nurse to boost morale. Roxie Jackson set up Sing at Six last week to encourage her neighbours to sing some uplifting tunes after the 5pm news. \u201cEverybody sits down at five to watch that update, and the mood gets a little bit upset and people get stressed out, and I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want to send the kids to bed in that kind of atmosphere, I want to do something happy.\u2019\u201d In just a few days the Facebook group has skyrocketed to nearly 10,000 members, with people joining in by singing together in their gardens, by video call, or posting videos, with some even dressing up. Each day Jackson sets a theme and allows group members to vote for their favourite tune. Man! I Feel Like a Woman was chosen for the 90s night and Let it Go for the Disney theme. Somewhere Over the Rainbow was the choice for a night dedicated to the elderly, with a local care home posting a video of its residents joining in. Jackson said she had been overwhelmed by the numbers of people getting involved, particularly her mum, who dons elaborate fancy dress and likes to watch the videos during her breaks at work. \u201cThe mood in the hospital has been horrible for weeks on end and now it is scary, so when you come home, you need something nice to look forward to,\u201d she said. \u201cI think music is a big thing and it\u2019s one of those things that people remember. If the kids can remember anything from this time, let\u2019s try and make it something happy.\u201d Meanwhile, a video of an elderly couple singing from their sofa during lockdown has gone viral on Facebook. Rex Taylor, 86, posted the video of him singing the wartime song We\u2019ll Meet Again with his wife Selina, 83, who has Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cWhen we are on lockdown, there is only one thing to do,\u201d said Rex, who has become the sole carer for his wife while they are isolating. Rolling with Rick Rick Astley has announced that he will be playing a free concert for NHS and emergency workers at Manchester Arena in October. The singer, whose song Never Gonna Give You Up was a worldwide number one hit in 1987, revealed the plan on social media. In a video message he said: \u201cIt\u2019s free to you guys because I just want to say a massive thank you and I don\u2019t know how else to do it. You\u2019re doing an amazing job, the whole country thanks you. \u201cI\u2019m going to work my butt off to give you a great night.\u201d Frontline NHS staff, primary care workers, paramedics, firefighters and police are all eligible to apply for free tickets, which are available from 7pm on 2 April. Attendees must present a valid ID on the night. Meals on wheels A private bus company in Blackpool has transformed an idle school bus into a pop-up shop for NHS workers. Archway Travel has created the Heroes Hamper to sell essential food supplies outside Blackpool Victoria Hospital, where the staff face long queues and empty shelves when trying to buy food outside work. The shop has been going for nearly a week and sells hampers stocked with essentials including locally sourced fresh fruit and veg, fresh bread, milk and eggs, and toilet roll. \u201cIt is a bit demoralising that we need to do this when there are so many supermarkets out there,\u201d said Sam Archer, who helps run the family business. \u201cWhen [NHS staff] have been going, there\u2019s nothing left, and they just want basic stuff.\u201d Another company that has transformed itself to benefit NHS workers is the five-star Mayfair hotel Claridge\u2019s, which has opened its doors to the dozens of medical staff unable to live at home during the coronavirus crisis. Up to 40 doctors, nurses and other key staff will move into the luxury hotel from Friday, staying in rooms that typically start at \u00a3650 a night. Paddy McKillen, co-owner of the Maybourne Group, which runs the 208-year-old hotel, said: \u201cJust as it has in the past world wars, Claridge\u2019s has a duty to step up and support the people of London. Teams from all our hotels have volunteered to help and support the dedicated NHS workers at this critical time. We are for ever in their debt.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "New blood test can detect 50 types of cancer", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/31/new-blood-test-can-detect-50-types-of-cancer", "date": "2020-03-30", "transcript": "A new blood test that can detect more than 50 types of cancer has been revealed by researchers in the latest study to offer hope for early detection. The test is based on DNA that is shed by tumours and found circulating in the blood. More specifically, it focuses on chemical changes to this DNA, known as methylation patterns. Researchers say the test can not only tell whether someone has cancer, but can also shed light on the type of cancer they have. Dr Geoffrey Oxnard of Boston\u2019s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, part of Harvard Medical School, said the test was now being explored in clinical trials. \u201cYou need to use a test like this in an independent group at risk of cancer to actually show that you can find the cancers, and figure out what to do about it when you find them,\u201d he said. Writing in the journal Annals of Oncology, the team reveal how the test was developed using a machine learning algorithm \u2013 a type of artificial intelligence. Such systems pick up on patterns within data and as a result learn to classify it. The team initially fed the system with data on methylation patterns in DNA from within blood samples taken from more than 2,800 patients, before further training it with data from 3,052 participants, 1,531 of whom had cancer and 1,521 of whom did not. Using this information, the system sorted the samples into groups based on the methylation patterns. The team then taught the system which groups reflected which type of cancer. \u201cIn pregnant women we look in their free-floating DNA for foetal abnormalities,\u201d said Oxnard. \u201cWe know this [approach] exists, the question is how do you fine-tune and perfect the art of looking for cancer in this free-floating DNA? And that is what the machine learning did.\u201d The team then tested the trained system on another set of samples from 1,264 individuals, about half of whom had cancer. The results reveal that less than 1% of those without cancer were wrongly identified by the system as having the disease. \u201cIt is really important you don\u2019t tell non-cancer patients they have cancer,\u201d said Oxnard. When it came to identifying people with cancers the team found that, across more than 50 different types of cancer, the system correctly detected that the disease was present 44% of the time \u2013 although the team stress that figure could differ if the test was used to screen a general population, rather than those known to have cancer. Detection was better the more advanced the disease was. Overall, cancer was correctly detected in 18% of those with stage I cancer, but in 93% of those with stage IV cancer. The team say the results are exciting as they offer the possibility of a new way to screen for cancers that are otherwise difficult to detect. For example, the system correctly identified 63% of those with stage I pancreatic cancer, rising to 100% in stage IV. The team further found that the system could shed light on the type of cancer. For 96% of samples deemed to show cancer, the test was able to offer a prediction for in which the tissue the cancer originated, with 93% of these predictions found to be correct. Dr David Crosby, head of early detection at Cancer Research UK, said that detecting cancers in their early stages is important as they are less aggressive and more treatable. Although this test was still at an early stage of development, the initial results were encouraging, he said. \u201cAnd if the test can be fine-tuned to be more efficient at catching cancers in their earliest stages, it could become a tool for early detection.\u201d But Crosby added there was work to do. \u201cMore research is needed to improve the test\u2019s ability to catch early cancers and we still need to explore how it might work in a real cancer screening scenario,\u201d he said.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Amid our fear, we\u2019re rediscovering utopian hopes of a connected world", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-fears-rediscover-utopian-hopes-connected-world", "date": "2020-03-29", "transcript": "If this is the worst of times, it is also the best of times. In our anxiety we are drawing deep reserves of strength from others. In our isolation we are rediscovering community. In our confusion we are rethinking whom we trust. In our fragmentation we are rediscovering the value of institutions. To each their own narrative or metaphor. If this feels like the blitz spirit to you, all well and good. Others find it helps to imagine a world recast through virtual networks. But what it amounts to is this: there is such a thing as society and we are all interdependent. And if it sometimes takes a grave crisis to remind ourselves of these truths, then this moment may well be historic for the possibilities of hope as well as for all the tragedy and turmoil. Nearly 200 years ago, the French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about the power we have been re-experiencing over the past few weeks: \u201cIn democratic countries knowledge of how to combine is the mother of all other forms of knowledge; on its progress depends that of all the others.\u201d At least three forms of combination have blossomed in the present crisis: the NHS, the BBC and the internet itself. It is difficult to see how the NHS will not emerge stronger from this pandemic, however traumatic and stressful the coming months will be. We get the service we pay for. It would take an unusually obtuse future government to be blind to the signals sent by three quarters of a million volunteers or the echoing applause of people across the nation in the past few days. The BBC is having its moment, too. Only a month ago it seemed on the ropes \u2013 the bizarre target of the obsessional figure who sits at the prime minister\u2019s right hand. Dominic Cummings had long nursed a loathing for the corporation, with his thinktank willing its demise more than 15 years ago. The aim was to replace it with a \u201cFox News equivalent\u201d, along with talk-radio shows and bloggers \u201cto shift the centre of gravity\u201d. Today such aspirations look like lunacy, as they did even then. Fox News has shown its true colours during the Covid-19 emergency, parroting the wildly erratic line from an increasingly dangerously deluded White House. Fox is these days less a news company than an oligarchically owned state broadcaster. The BBC, meanwhile, has been doing what it does best: providing reliable and trustworthy information to a huge audience \u2013 both broadcast and online, both young and old. On any surveys of trust it towers over other news organisations as well as other institutions in society. Again, it is difficult to imagine any sane administration wanting to diminish the national, international and local reach of the BBC for the foreseeable future \u2013 far less hand over our national spine of communication and conversation to the Murdoch family and a bunch of talk-radio hosts. Three and a half years ago we\u2019d apparently had enough of experts. They seem to be back. More understandably, many were convinced the original dream of the world wide web was dead and buried. Maybe, today, not so much. In our self-isolation, many of us have rediscovered some of the things that inspired such cause for hope when the web first demonstrated the power of combination. How many of us have relied on it for friends, food, family, education, health, fitness, worship, ideas, culture, ideas and knowledge over the past week or more? Think of all the other utopian words that were associated with this new form of self-organisation barely a decade ago. Here are some: generosity, community, participation, sharing, openness, cooperation, sociability, learning, assembling, imagination, creativity, innovation, experimentation, fairness, equality, publicness, citizenship, mutuality, combinability, common resource, information, respect, discourse, conversation, contribution. All these things seemed within our grasp. And then a kind of darkness stole over that shared space and we gradually began to give up on what, we soon convinced ourselves, had only ever been a lovely dream. Well, maybe. And of course \u2013 unlike the NHS or the BBC \u2013 there is a genuine malign aspect to the way in which so many people have twisted the web\u2019s capabilities into an engine of hatred, misinformation and bleakness. That will not wither away: there is a different kind of virality in play there. But, in the end, the internet simply amplifies who we are. As the New York academic Clay Shirky wrote in his 2010 book, Cognitive Surplus: \u201cHuman character is the essential component of our sociable and generous behaviours, even when coordinated with high-tech tools. Interpretations of those behaviours that focus on the technology miss the point: technology enables those behaviours, but it doesn\u2019t cause them.\u201d Surveys of trust since Covid-19 began to bite show people re-evaluating whom to believe. They, overwhelmingly, trust the NHS and \u2013 still \u2013 the BBC. They absolutely trust experts. They rely on mainstream news organisations while proclaiming low levels of trust in journalists as a category. They are inclined to trust their own employer \u2013 but not as much as they trust \u201ca person like yourself\u201d. In Shirky\u2019s 10-year-old analysis, trust in the world today is dependent on perceptions of motive. Why is this person telling me this? Is it for money, power or some kind of personal or political advantage? Or is it out of genuine disinterest? A respect for evidence? A feeling, in Shirky\u2019s words, that \u201cby treating one another well (fairly, if not always nicely) we can create environments where the group can do more than the individuals could on their own\u201d. There will be much stress and sorrow in the months ahead. But a kind of better future feels quite tangible.

Roisin McGuinness, a primary school teacher, got in touch from Ireland: Thank you for your column, especially in times like these. I loved reading what others are up to during their isolation. I am treating this time at home as a chance to do all the things I complain I don\u2019t have the time to do. Morning to lunchtime is tidying, a little exercise, a bit of work. Lunch is a short walk, and watching something I never get round to watching on telly. One episode only. The afternoon is for hobbies. I have written a list and hung it on the wall to remind myself of all the choices I have. Eg, sitting down to regular practice sessions with my piano and ukelele, sorting photographs, making a scrapbook with the boxes of tickets and postcards I\u2019ve been collecting and hoarding. Getting the sewing machine out, with YouTube videos to hand, and mending or altering clothes. Listening to podcasts while also doing some mindfulness colouring, or Zentangle that I have newly discovered. Evening is cooking and TV with my husband like any regular evening, but maybe now we\u2019ll play some card games to shake it up. Making sure I get up early and go to bed at a reasonable time like I would for work is really important, I am trying really hard not to fall into the bad habits of late sleeping and hours of TV like I\u2019ve done in the past during periods of unemployment. Finding happiness in the benefits that this time at home is offering as well. Myself and my husband are very much enjoying not commuting, and I hope all your commuting readers are too. This sounds great, Roisin. I would stress regular sleep and wake times, routine and trying stuff you\u2019ve not done before will all be important for us to get through these difficult days.

Nearly five people per second enlisted in the government\u2019s new volunteering scheme in the hours after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, launched a call on Tuesday for 250,000 people in England to help bolster the NHS response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Overnight the number of volunteers who had pledged support topped 170,000, and as the day went on the target was smashed. \u201cThat is already, in one day, as many people as the population of Coventry,\u201d said Boris Johnson in the daily Downing Street press conference. The figure now stands at 504,303. The overwhelming response has prompted the NHS to extend its target to recruit 750,000 volunteers in total. Those volunteers who have already signed up will start next week. As the coronavirus death toll in the UK rose to 422 people as of 10.10am on Wednesday, the government called on fit and healthy adults to deliver vital supplies such as food and medicines to up to 1.5 million vulnerable people, drive them home after being discharged from hospital and make regular phone calls to those in self-isolation. Nearly 12,000 recently retired NHS staff came forward to rejoin the frontline following a separate call for help. The government has announced plans to set up a makeshift hospital with capacity for 4,000 beds at the ExCeL centre in east London. Announcing on Wednesday morning that the government\u2019s volunteering scheme was two-thirds of the way to reaching its target just 15 hours after it was set in motion, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, Stephen Powis, said he was \u201cbowled over\u201d by the \u201castonishing\u201d response. \u201cYesterday we sent out a call to arms for an army of NHS volunteers, looking for a quarter of a million volunteers, and I can say that overnight we\u2019ve already had 170,000 people sign up ... It\u2019s an absolutely astonishing response,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. Asked if he had expected such support, he replied: \u201cI think at times of crisis, people come together. And the vast majority of people in this country are doing what the government has asked us all to do. But it\u2019s important that everyone does that as that will save lives. \u201cI know there\u2019s vast numbers of people looking to help neighbours, vulnerable people who live close by, so no it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all. In times like this, as the chief medical officer has already said, we see outbreaks of altruism, people wanting to help, so it\u2019s a wonderful response in the same way that all those doctors coming back, nurses coming back. I\u2019m bowled over by it.\u201d People can join the scheme in four different roles, including as a community response volunteer, which involves \u201ccollecting shopping, medication or other essential supplies for someone who is self-isolating, and delivering these supplies to their home\u201d. Patient transport volunteers will support the NHS by driving discharged patients to their homes, and NHS transport volunteers will move equipment, supplies or medication between sites. Other volunteers will provide support calls to elderly people who are in isolation and at risk of loneliness. Volunteers, who must be over 18, fit and healthy and able to pass an enhanced DBS check, will be directed to tasks via a responder app that they can switch to say they are \u201con duty\u201d when available. Robert Jenrick, the housing and communities secretary, told BBC Breakfast: \u201cI know there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people out there who would like to support us during this time and support the NHS. \u201cThere will be lots of different opportunities available from helping deliver medicines and food to the elderly and vulnerable who we\u2019re asking to stay at home, being volunteer drivers to get supplies to the frontline or to take people into hospital, or working in hospitals obviously in non-clinical roles.\u201d Asked if the scheme went against advice to stay at home and how the government would keep volunteers safe, Jenrick said: \u201cThe government\u2019s guidance is to stay at home unless you\u2019ve got a reason to be going out. If you\u2019re doing something absolutely essential for fighting the virus, like volunteering in this very organised way, then obviously that\u2019s different. But we want to keep those individuals safe, they\u2019ll receive the training, the support and the equipment that they\u2019ll need to carry out those roles.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'People think it's magic': how one of Brazil's poorest cities gets its best school results", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/people-think-its-magic-how-one-of-brazils-poorest-cities-gets-its-best-school-results", "date": "2020-03-25", "transcript": "As you approach the city of Sobral in north-east Brazil, the road worsens. Huge pot holes slow traffic to a crawl. The heat is suffocating, even worse when there is no cloud cover. Sobral is poor. Jobs are scarce, salaries meagre, gangs the only option for many. For children, it\u2019s a tough start to life. Ana Farias, headteacher of an early-years school in a low-income neighbourhood controlled by a gang, knows this only too well. Some of her students wouldn\u2019t eat if it were not for free school meals. Farias and her colleagues often hear stories of home life; some children have to accompany their mothers who sell sex at night. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge but it motivates me to be here every day. We want to make a difference in their lives,\u201d she says. This is one of the last places anyone would expect would be a paragon of educational excellence. Yet, Sobral has gone through an extraordinary metamorphosis and is now the best place in Brazil to get a state education. The city comes top of 5,000 districts in Brazil\u2019s education development index. Fifteen years ago, it was ranked 1,366th. Since 2015, literacy rates have risen from 52% to 92%, and the number of families living in extreme poverty has declined by 89%. This is a stunning turnaround in a country beset by income inequality and poor literacy rates: half of state-educated students are still illiterate by the third grade. So what has been Sobral\u2019s secret to success? The mayor, Ivo Gomes, says: \u201cWe have reached this position because this is a 23-year-old project that has surpassed changes in mayors and secretaries of education. People think it\u2019s magic and it\u2019s not. It is persistence and a lot of hard work.\u201d In 1997, the movement to improve education in Sobral began with renovating school buildings and furnishing them with computers and other resources. Public spending on education was boosted. In the past, politicians had commonly rewarded allies by handing out government jobs, including headteacher posts to people who could barely read or write. This practice was stamped out. There was a crackdown on truancy; today families are called if their children don\u2019t turn up to school. Newly qualified teachers now undergo a preparatory internship and all teachers, regardless of experience, receive on-the-job training for a day each month. Every term there is a bonus system for teachers whose students perform well in assessments. Student welfare is a high priority; pupils receive two free school meals a day and there are plans to hire a mental health professional in each school. All this has led in part to the success of former students such as Chelton Santos, 22, and his sister Maria, 20. The siblings live with their parents and grandmother in a poor and dangerous area. The family have survived on one minimum wage (now $258 a month) for many years. \u201cI grew up seeing gang fights,\u201d said Chelton Santos. \u201cI had to face poverty and violence. My parents took good care of us but we had financial difficulties, and had to take out loans.\u201d Despite a difficult upbringing for the pair, the future is looking bright: Santos is studying law at university and his sister is working as an office clerk to save money to study medicine. They are determined to succeed. Maria says: \u201cMy dream is to be a doctor. I\u2019m going to get there. I\u2019ve seen my mother suffer with health problems since I was a child and now I want to help the poorest in society.\u201d Their mother, Eliane, is hopeful about her children\u2019s future: \u201cI never believed that one day my son would be studying to be a lawyer at university. We did everything we could to keep [the children] in school. I wanted to give them a nicer place to live \u2026 it\u2019s dangerous here. God willing, they\u2019re going to move from here to a better life.\u201d Sobral\u2019s success is now being replicated across the country. Clodoveu Arruda, a former mayor of the city, who oversaw a large part of the transformation in the education department, has teamed up with the Lemann Foundation to spread best practice. So far they have worked in 25 municipalities across five states. Not everyone in Sobral is content with what has been achieved, however \u2013 they are hungry for further success. The mayor, Gomes, says: \u201cBeing the top in Brazil doesn\u2019t mean much if you look at the rest of the world. Brazil is not very well positioned in the [international educational] Pisa rankings \u2026 This is what we are running after now.\u201d The Lemann Foundation and Republica.org assisted with travel for the Guardian This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

And in the 850-person auditorium of a storied Russian theatre sits just one lucky viewer, a lottery winner whose prize is the personal performance of a lifetime. Barred from hosting audiences due to the coronavirus outbreak, a theatre in Perm, a city near Russia\u2019s Ural mountains, plans to host a unique experiment \u2013 private viewings of the theatre\u2019s ballets and operas for the price of just a normal ticket. The project, called One on One, is the creation of Marat Gatsalov, the principle stage director of the Perm Opera and Ballet theatre. The idea, he said, predated the coronavirus pandemic that has shut theatres, museums and other cultural institutions around the world as audiences practise physical distancing and hunker down in their homes. But when the local government in Perm, an industrial city that also has a reputation as a cultural powerhouse, declared that events with large audiences should be cancelled, he realised the time for the experiment had arrived. \u201cWe\u2019d been told that we can\u2019t let viewers into the theatre hall,\u201d Gatsalov said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t let just one viewer in.\u201d The plan for private performances has captured national media attention and personal support from local cultural officials, Gatsalov said, as a novel way to keep the theatre performing before live audiences. \u201cI thought about how I often sit alone in the theatre and watch a play,\u201d said Gatsalov. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s a fairly special feeling \u2026 it\u2019s a really important experience for the viewer and the people on the stage.\u201d Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has accelerated in the last week and the government has passed tougher measures to prevent its spread. One on One had been scheduled to open with Puccini at the end of March, but the theatre has said that it will begin holding shows only when the rules for the country\u2019s theatres are clearer. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this project regardless of what ends up happening with coronavirus,\u201d said Gatsalov. \u201cEven when this story with coronavirus ends, we\u2019re planning to perform [these shows].\u201d The lottery will work like this: 850 people will register for each show, whether it\u2019s an opera, ballet or concert, and a winner will be selected and invited to buy a ticket at the theatre for the normal price. Nobody else will be charged, although the theatre could use the funds. Financially, Gatsalov said, the coronavirus crisis has been \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. Asked about how planned to keep performers safe, Gatsalov said he was trying to follow safety rules \u201cas much as possible\u201d and said the theatre regularly checked people\u2019s temperatures and disinfected the premises. But it was clear that plans were in flux. \u201cOf course the theatre can\u2019t be operating as normal at the moment,\u201d he said.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'Nature is taking back Venice': wildlife returns to tourist-free city", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/20/nature-is-taking-back-venice-wildlife-returns-to-tourist-free-city", "date": "2020-03-20", "transcript": "Look down into the waters of the Venice canals today and there is a surprising sight \u2013 not just a clear view of the sandy bed, but shoals of tiny fish, scuttling crabs and multicoloured plant-life. \u201cThe water is blue and clear,\u201d said Gloria Beggiato, who owns the celebrated Metropole Hotel a few steps from St Mark\u2019s square and has a view over the Venice lagoon. \u201cIt is calm like a pond, because there are no more waves caused by motorised boats transporting day-tripper tourists. And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.\u201d Under Venice\u2019s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus \u2013 all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden \u2013 the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight. La Serenissima\u2019s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored. The clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Cormorants have returned to dive for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. \u201cSomeone has put up a sign saying, \u2018Don\u2019t tread on the duck eggs,\u2019\u2019\u201d Beggiato said. \u201cAll totally unimaginable a while ago.\u201d As the death toll from coronavirus in Italy outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls. But locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping \u2013 except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw protests against overtourism under the No Grande Navi (\u201cNo more cruise ships\u201d) slogan. At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance. In a queue to buy fish at his local fishmonger in Canareggio, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: \u201cWhen I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.\u201d \u201cFor the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?\u201d said Franco Folin, a fisherman. \u201cBut when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited \u2013 there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.\u201d The apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor. Matteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time. \u201cFor goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.\u201d It is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed. It is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way. \u201cWe Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,\u201d said Beggiato. \u201cIf you ask me today \u2013 sunny blue skies, clear canals \u2013 then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with. \u201cI honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.\u201d This article was amended on 20 March 2020 because an earlier version contained a tweet which was subsequently found to contain incorrect claims.

They were going to get the train from Kendal to Milton Keynes to join us. That\u2019s clearly not happening. But I have a plan. A virtual dinner between three households. We pick our video conference provider of choice, set up a VC, coordinate dinner start times, and see whether we can have a 50th birthday celebration dinner virtually across three households. Will it work? I really hope so, I can let you know if you like. Ruth Coomber I\u2019m in social isolation as an asthmatic, so I\u2019m still enjoying walks over the fields with our little dog and very tall son, I\u2019ve very nearly finished my complicated knitted poncho and I\u2019ve joined Libby, a great little app that Suffolk libraries use to give you access to the e-library. Luckily, I do usually work from home, but last week I attended my first meeting by Skype. The old hands knew to sit there motionless while I wriggled around.

Stella We will trial the after-work \u2018video wine\u2019 this Thursday. A colleague suggested it and I thought it\u2019s a great idea. Bookshelves, photographs and all in the back, us passing around the thoughts on how the first week of real corona-craziness in Germany went, more or less confined to all our homes. It might be an idea to copy for other teams all spread out to isolated kitchens and living rooms across these cities. Christine Mallaband-Brown Can I recommend joining an urban sketchers\u2019 group and following one of the \u2018drawing indoors\u2019 challenges that are being set up? The first I knew about it was a Facebook post from Urban Sketchers in London. They had decided to do a 30-day challenge while they spend enforced time at home. After all, you only need a pen or pencil and some paper. My branch of Urban Sketchers in Stoke-on-Trent are thinking of doing the same. Peter Kent My hobby is wildlife photography, particularly insects. It never ceases to amaze me how many different insect species you can see in even a small garden if you have suitable plants and flowers. Sometimes you see dramas playing out as predator insects move to attack their prey. I have my own safari park, but instead of seeking the big five, it\u2019s more a case of the little five. Last year\u2019s photos started on 29 March, when in little over an hour I managed to photograph nine different species in my small garden. Ideally, you want an SLR and a macro lens, but you can get started with much simpler equipment. So on any sunny day from March to October I can keep myself entertained with a garden chair, a book, a camera and a refreshing drink. I usually try to identify any unusual-looking insect and then try to read about its life cycle, some of which are truly bizarre. Tricia Henton I\u2019ve already received or have instigated communication with a number of friends with whom the odd call or email a couple of times a year was the norm. We\u2019ve agreed to keep in touch a bit more closely over the next few weeks. Best of all, I got a letter today from a friend, a former work colleague, with whom I normally exchange an annual one at Christmas. He writes beautiful letters about where and what he and his wife have been doing, his reflections on events and other thoughts. They are a joy to read, and I reciprocate. Good old-fashioned paper-based letter writing will occupy time, bring joy to the recipient, and provide solace to the lonely. That\u2019s my small suggestion for helping us all maintain our sanity! Keep up the good work. Elizabeth Copp A few evenings ago I sat in front of the TV with a tray, newspaper and scissors and made paper pots. The next day, I sowed broad beans in my greenhouse, putting one bean in each pot, but you can sow them sitting at your kitchen table as well, using the rest of the newspaper to keep the table clean. When the beans have germinated, you plant them \u2013 pot and all, for the roots grow through the newspaper \u2013 in your allotment, raised bed or garden, and when the supermarkets run out of veg you have your own supply. This method works well with peas and beetroot too. Sowing seed is mindful, as is gardening in general, and it\u2019s absolutely the way to go in these rather concerning times. Today I sowed peas. Ninian Millar I have just spent a really interesting day sorting through papers going back some 60 years to my graduation certificates from university in the UK and covering my entire professional career until I retired in 2005. I have only actually worked in the UK for three years, and one delightful document I found was from the British pensions service seriously offering me a pension of 32p a week! Sibylle Zipperer As a teacher (and technophobe), I have had to move to remote teaching this week and decided to spice up things for my pupils (10-11 and 12-13 years old) by \u201creporting\u201d via photos the adventures of Kevi the kiwi and having my friends from around the world record some lines in their respective regional dialects. Things like this could easily be adapted for adults by sending around a story to which everyone would add a sentence or two. A bit of silliness is rather important in this situation, which is why I am sending you a picture of Kevi. Hugh Busher I\u2019m building a WhatsApp group with some friends as we can no longer meet for our weekly French conversation group. Now we can stay in touch online and still have French-language conversations. We are members of the local U3A group. My wife is doing something similar with her art group. Rachel Preston If the schools close, my plans are to go hiking with my children and meet friends and have picnics (at a distance, obvs). Get the children growing as much fruit and veg in our little garden as possible. Lots of board games, reading and seeing what we can make, using things we have lying around.

The report, which ranks countries according to happiness, will throw up crucial clues to wellbeing that will help in the weeks and months of the coronavirus crisis to come, says Prof Richard Layard, co-director of the Wellbeing programme at the LSE\u2019s Centre for Economic Performance. Finland remains at number one for the third year running, while the UK has edged up the table, rising from 15th place to 13th. The report \u2013 compiled by a group of independent experts and produced by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network \u2013 uses six variables to measure the quality of life in more than 150 countries across the globe: GDP per capita; social support; healthy life expectancy; freedom; generosity and absence of corruption. Research has long shown that co-operation and social support are fundamental to happiness; Layard believes the coronavirus crisis will speed up changes that he and others have advocated for decades. \u201cTo get through this we\u2019re going to have to develop a much higher level of social responsibility. Some people are going to have to stay in quarantine, and others are going to have to support them to do that. My hope is that it will encourage a move from an atomised society to a much more caring one.\u201d Vanessa King, lead psychologist for Action for Happiness which is the UK partner organisation to the World Happiness Report, said: \u201cWhat we know is that social factors and trust are at least as important as income and being healthy \u2013 and also they\u2019re particularly buffering to the psychological welfare of those who are hardest hit. In this crisis, the more we can create social trust and support and connect with others, despite being isolated, the better we will be \u2013 and the rosier a future we\u2019ll build.\u201d So looking out for others is key, not only to their welfare but also to our own, said King. \u201cYou might think you\u2019re doing it for others but you\u2019re also doing it for yourself: it\u2019s win-win.\u201d Setting up a neighbourhood WhatsApp group to ensure isolated people get help with the shopping, looking out for others and being outward-facing were some of the most psychologically healthy ways forward. Coronavirus, according to King, brings home something essential that has never before been quite this tangible: that there is no \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d in the world, but only \u201cus\u201d. \u201cThis is a worldwide epidemic; it\u2019s not us against them, it\u2019s all of us against this virus. It\u2019s a moment when we have to say: \u2018we, as a world, are fighting this\u2019.\u201d Powerlessness doesn\u2019t make people happy, but taking control \u2013 even in chaotic circumstances like a pandemic \u2013 goes a long way to help us cope. \u201cPeople are finding it hard to focus and that\u2019s entirely understandable. What I\u2019d suggest is that you try to be really clear about your intentions. Don\u2019t get sucked into a continual stream of news: decide at what points in the day you\u2019re going to update yourself. Think about who you need to in touch with, who you need to support \u2013 both in your immediate family, and the community around you.\u201d Active coping is vital. \u201cTrying to do something rather than doing nothing is extremely important for resilience. This is a real opportunity, and we need to recognise it as such. And don\u2019t forget that coronavirus isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s contagious: happiness is contagious too, as well as fear. If you go outside, smile at people. Be really friendly. It can and will make a huge difference.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Saving a city millions of gallons of water \u2013 one tap at a time", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/saving-city-millions-gallons-water-one-tap-at-a-time-india-kolkata", "date": "2020-03-19", "transcript": "There is light drizzle as Vijay Aggarwal and Ajay Mittal manoeuvre their two-wheelers through the labyrinthine alleyways of Kolkata\u2019s Tiljala road slum. Early Sunday morning, the neighbourhood is teeming with activity \u2013 women sit on their haunches washing clothes and utensils; half-soaped children scurry in and out of their baths; towel-clad men wait to brush their teeth. Every 50 metres a community pipe gushes out water \u2013 plastic bottles, jerry cans and metal buckets are lined up to fill. The duo along with their plumber, Ravi Shaw, who rides pillion, make their way to the first huddle of people and get to work. All it takes is a blow and twist of a wrench \u2013 the nozzle pops loose. Shaw fishes out an orange and white tap from his bag and fits it. While Aggarwal hurriedly plasters a Save Water Save Life sticker on to a lamppost, Mittal tells the people to close the tap once they are done and points out the helpline number on the sticker. As the three gather their tools, Aggarwal says: \u201cIt literally took two minutes to install a tap on this pipe \u2013 in return we have just saved the city gallons of water.\u201d It was a casual moment that spurred Aggarwal into action. \u201cIn July last year, I was dropping my son off to school when at a traffic signal, I watched water gush out of a tap-less roadside pipe,\u201d says Aggarwal, who runs a travel and tourism agency. Irked by what he saw, Aggarwal, 40, returned with his friend Mittal, 29. They bought taps at the local hardware store, hired a plumber and fixed 12 pipes on the street. The Fix for Life campaign to conserve water in Kolkata was born. In a country where safe drinking water is a development goal, Kolkata relies on its treatment plants to meet 95% of its needs. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) produces 450m gallons of filtered water every day at its three main treatment plants. Apart from domestic and commercial complexes, KMC also provides potable water to the streets and slums for a few hours every day through an estimated 17,000 roadside pipes. For the 5 million people who reside in the city and 6 million who commute daily from the suburbs for work, this freely available safe drinking water is a life force. However, a recent KMC survey conducted in six of its 144 wards estimates that 30% of the water simply runs down the drain. The survey found about 10% of the wastage was due to these roadside pipes that do not have taps. \u201cWe had installed taps earlier but they are regularly stolen or broken,\u201d says Mainak Mukherjee, the director general of KMC\u2019s water supply department. \u201cA large part of our budget is dedicated to providing clean drinking water. Kolkata is also one of the few cities in India where water is tax-free.\u201d But without taps most of these efforts go to waste. Since July, every weekend members of Aggarwal\u2019s civic society group, Active Citizens Together for Sustainability (ACTS), conduct \u201cwater drives\u201d to fix taps. \u201cIn these last eight months we have conducted over 70 drives in several pockets of the city,\u201d says Mittal. \u201cOn our most productive day we fix about 30 to 35 taps.\u201d The target is to have fixed 1,500 by Sunday, which is World Water Day. But finding these pipes is a challenge. \u201cThere is no official data on the exact location of these pipes. This costs us precious time,\u201d says Mittal. Here, other concerned citizens, community clubs and even police stations have reached out over social media to help accelerate their efforts. \u201cPeople send us photos of pipes in their neighbourhood and we plan our drives along that route,\u201d says Aggarwal, showing a WhatsApp text on his smartphone with photos of open pipes. \u201cWe will fix these this weekend. Our helpline is flooded with such messages.\u201d ACTS has been helped by citizens such as Ashfaq Alam, a shopkeeper in the Tiljala slum, who earlier used his own money to install taps on the pipe that is being fixed. \u201cIt did get stolen but we installed it again. Sometimes you have to take matters in your own hands,\u201d he says. A few years ago, the Lutheran World Service India Trust also ran a similar campaign in Kolkata to tap the pipes in surrounding streets. Some are unimpressed by the efforts. \u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d says Bindu Das as the team fixes the pipe on his street. \u201cThe children in the neighbourhood will break it in a few days.\u201d The solution to this is to use plastic taps. Mittal says: They last but they don\u2019t have much resale value. We also go back and replace stolen or leaking taps if you reach out on our helpline.\u201d Mukherjee concedes that this colossal wastage is mainly due to a lack of civic awareness. As Mittal points out, citizen-led initiatives can only complement the government. \u201cThere are just a few of us and it takes a lot of time to bring up our tally count. If only the government could do this in all the wards in the city, we could solve this problem in a week.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

As the bad news about the coronavirus continues, \u201csend me dogs and cats\u201d has become a regular cry on social media, an easy-to-grasp shorthand for \u201cI feel terrible, cheer me up\u201d. The response is always the same: a torrent of pictures of animals doing daft things \u2013 but somehow it has a magical, calming effect. The therapeutic value of our relationship with our pets, particularly dogs, is increasingly recognised by researchers. Cats can be wonderful too \u2013 but dogs have been domesticated by humans for much longer, and, as even the most devoted cat lover will admit, dogs are far easier to train for companionship. Most cats, as we know, are admirable for entirely different reasons. Marion Janner, a mental health campaigner and all-round animal lover, says that dogs teach us a whole range of lessons. \u201cDogs love us unconditionally. They\u2019re the ultimate in equal opportunities \u2013 entirely indifferent to race, gender, star sign, CV, clothes size or ability to throw cool moves on the dance floor. The simplicity and depth of this love is a continuous joy, along with the health benefits of daily walks and the social delights of chats with other dog walkers. They teach kids to be responsible, altruistic and compassionate and, valuably but sadly, how to cope when someone you love dies.\u201d Robert Doward* felt this odd effect when his health suddenly took a downward turn. \u201cI\u2019d been working incredibly hard, long hours, too many days. One day I started crying and just couldn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t put sentences together properly. I\u2019d been pushing everything so hard for so long, and I just couldn\u2019t do it any more.\u201d It took a long time to put himself back together: plus some therapy, another job and changes to his family life. But the key factor, he says only half-jokingly, was a small Greek rescue dog called Maria. \u201cTaking her out for walks, getting out into fresh air, just putting one foot in front of the other, that lifts your spirits. And then there\u2019s nothing like having a dog curled up beside you, even when you feel absolutely miserable. She\u2019ll check my face anxiously, as if she knows something is wrong. And that makes me smile \u2013 and that somehow makes you feel better. There is just something magic about dogs. Honestly, she got me through.\u201d But why? What is responsible for these therapeutic effects? One key aspect appears to be social recognition \u2013 the process of identifying another being as someone important and significant to you. The bond that forms between owner and pet is, it seems, similar to the bond that a mother forms with her baby. The importance of social recognition is increasingly acknowledged for the role it plays in helping us form networks. We now understand that healthy social bonds can play a key role in mental health; without them, we become lonely, depressed and physically unwell. And pets, it seems, can fulfil that role. Academic and psychologist June McNicholas points out that pets can be a lifeline for socially isolated people. \u201cPet care and self-care are linked. When you take a dog out for a walk, people talk to you and that may be the only social contact an isolated person has the whole day. If you have a cat, you can have a conversation standing in the cat food aisle in the supermarket, deciding which brand to buy. When pet owners leave the house to buy pet food, they\u2019re more likely to buy food for themselves and when they feed their pet, they\u2019ll sit down to eat too. People with disabilities often find that able-bodied people are socially awkward with them; if they have a dog it breaks down barriers and allows a more comfortable and natural interaction.\u201d Social recognition is something humans share with a few (though not all) mammals, including sheep and prairie voles. We are primed to look after those we have made social bonds with; we don\u2019t breastfeed just any old baby and we don\u2019t take random dogs home from the park. Author and researcher Meg Daley Olmert explains \u201cWhen we call our dog, \u2018our baby\u2019 it is because we recognise it on a neural level as such. And this recognition triggers the same maternal bonding brain networks that allow a mother to look at her red, slimy newborn and say, \u2018mine!\u2019\u201d A small study of functional MRI brain scans in 18 women showed similar responses in regions involved in reward, emotion and affiliation when the women looked at images of their child and pet dog.There were important differences though; dogs caused activity in the fusiform gyrus (involved in facial recognition) and babies in the tegmentum (centres of reward and affiliation). We love our pets, but in a fire we\u2019re primed to save the baby. Although scientists have some understanding of social recognition and where it takes place in the brain, we still don\u2019t entirely understand how it happens. The missing link could be oxytocin, the so-called \u201chug\u201d, \u201clove\u201d or \u201ccuddle\u201d hormone. Oxytocin has a key role in both childbirth, lactation and sperm movement, but it also has an increasingly recognised role in our social behaviour, acting as a chemical messenger in pathways that control sexual arousal, recognition, trust, mother-infant and human-pet bonding. Oxytocin works in tandem with another brain hormone, vasopressin, to help to modulate our response to stress and deal with social situations. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a lot of interest in a possible role for oxytocin in addiction, brain injury, anorexia, depression, autism and severe anxiety. And there are other reasons that pets and therapy animals are increasingly recognised as being good for our mental health. In addition to helping to alleviate stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness, there are all the benefits that come from having to exercise a dog. Daily walks outdoors boost physical and emotional wellbeing. Chucking sticks, picking up balls \u2013 even scooping up dog poo \u2013 can provide an all-round workout. Increasingly that knowledge is being turned to practical use, with some lovely effects. When the Centre for Mental Health ran an evaluation on therapy dogs in prisons, for example, the feedback was off the scale. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but even when I am running around with [the dog] I just feel better inside, calmer, more peaceful,\u201d said one prisoner. Another told the interviewer: \u201cDogs have a magic effect on you, you can feel their love and that just makes you feel better inside you.\u201d The good feelings persist even after the dogs have left, the reviewers found, with one subject saying: \u201cI just walk around for the rest of the day on cloud nine.\u201d Some of the UK\u2019s most dangerous and violent mental health patients are cared for in one of four high-security psychiatric hospitals. Most are diagnosed with schizophrenia and stay an average of seven years. The State hospital in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of these facilities and runs an animal therapy centre which gives patients the chance to pet and care for a range of animals including chipmunks, rabbits, hens, geese, pygmy goats and pigs. Staff say that animal therapy helps to develop problem-solving skills, empathy, attention to the needs of others, a sense of responsibility and a way of channelling aggressive thoughts among individuals who have proved hard to reach with conventional psychiatric drugs and talking therapies. But what if you don\u2019t have a pet? Is there any shortcut to reproducing the beneficial effects? One candidate is sildenafil (Viagra). Having sex causes an oxytocin surge in the brain and taking Viagra may reproduce that surge without the faff of mating. A more practical idea might be an oxytocin spray or tablet. But biologist Sue Carter says that translating naturally occurring oxytocin into a commercially available product is challenging. Oxytocin has unique chemical properties and can shift form, making it hard to work with and measure. Importantly, \u201cthe effects of oxytocin are context dependent, sexually dimorphic (different in men and women), and altered by experience.\u201d Honestly? Gazing into your dog\u2019s eyes may produce a more reliable sense of wellbeing than any commercially available synthetic product. * Some names and details have been changed.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Social distancing is a must \u2013 but many are ready to contribute even more", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/17/mutual-aid-coronavirus-contributing", "date": "2020-03-17", "transcript": "Last Tuesday morning at Middlebury College in Vermont, rumors swirled. Across North America, colleges and universities were suspending in-person classes and shuttering campuses in response to the coronavirus outbreak. An associate professor had sent an email to students in two of his classes, indicating that Middlebury classes would end that Friday, 13 March, and screenshots of the email began to spread through an increasingly anxious student body of more than 2,500 undergraduates. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Is this real? What do I do? How do I prepare?\u2019\u201d said Leif Taranta, a Middlebury student. \u201cDo we need to leave this place that\u2019s been our home?\u201d About an hour later, Middlebury\u2019s president, Laurie Patton, confirmed that students would have to leave campus by Friday for an extended two-week spring break. Remote classes would begin on 30 March, and students would be \u201cexpected to remain at home and not return to campus until further notice\u201d. Immediately, concerns abounded. How quickly could they find storage space for all their belongings, or arrange travel plans to go home? A number of students could afford to purchase plane tickets home with only a few days\u2019 notice, but many could not. The announcement stipulated a process for students to request permission to remain on campus, especially if they were international students, but how exactly would that work? Would anyone end up homeless? In the midst of this panic, Taranta and a number of other students created a publicly editable Google spreadsheet. \u201cPlease list anything you can offer the community under the offers sections, and any requests you have in the requests column,\u201d they wrote. The Middlebury Mutual Aid Spreadsheet circulated through social media, and within 24 hours, it was filled with responses from students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members from the surrounding town of Middlebury. They offered each other rides to the airport in Burlington, or the Amtrak station in Port Henry. They arranged carpools to Boston, New York City, Philadelphia. Mike Roy, the dean of library and information services, volunteered his barn for storage space. They listed their spare rooms, air mattresses, couches and futons. They offered up food, healthcare supplies and emotional support. \u201cI have a car and as of now am staying on campus, so if you need help transporting things to storage or a ride to the airport let me know!\u201d wrote one student. \u201cMy wife, Pat, and I are healthy seventysomethings living in Middlebury,\u201d wrote a local resident. \u201cWe have two bedrooms available in our home and are able to provide transportation support as necessary.\u201d \u201cIs it your birthday while stuck on campus?\u201d wrote Stacie Marshall, a staff member. \u201cI will bake you a (mini) cake!\u201d Middlebury College itself eventually began to offer more resources, like financial assistance for low-income students\u2019 travel arrangements. \u201cInstitutions can\u2019t move fast enough to respond right away,\u201d said Taranta. \u201cThey\u2019re large and slow and bureaucratic. In the first couple of days, it was just student organizers and community relationships that stepped up.\u201d As schools continue to close, some have followed the same model of mutual aid, including Wesleyan College and Tufts University. By now, most students have returned to their homes. For Taranta and others, however, the mutual aid effort has only just begun. \u201cStudents have been vulnerable as they face these surprise evictions,\u201d said Taranta. \u201cBut there\u2019s also this reality that we are the least at-risk in terms of the actual virus, unless we\u2019re immunocompromised. So having received all this amazing support, there\u2019s this desire to give back to the communities that helped us. What can young people do that might be dangerous for older people to do?\u201d As the coronavirus continues to spread, policymakers and medical professionals have exhorted the public to practice social distancing \u2013 remove themselves as potential vectors for Covid-19 by limiting their interactions with others. This is the premise: for the sake of protecting those vulnerable, the elderly and the immunocompromised, everyone must sacrifice. Cancel your dates and your dinner parties, your weddings and your funerals. Remain indoors, mitigate the pandemic. But many people are ready to contribute even more. Walela Nehanda is a community organizer and poet based in South Los Angeles. Nehanda has advanced stage leukemia, and regularly uses a particular Lysol spray to disinfect surfaces. When panic-buying emptied store shelves, Nehanda\u2019s partner spent days searching for the spray. \u201cIt was sold out everywhere in Los Angeles,\u201d said Nehanda. Nehanda, who uses they/them pronouns, has been using social media to find a match for a bone marrow transplant. When they feared they wouldn\u2019t be able to find disinfectant spray, they turned to Twitter. \u201cWithin 10 minutes,\u201d they said, two people volunteered to send them Lysol. \u201cEven after I said my needs were met, people were still offering to help me.\u201d Realizing that others might be in similar situations, Nehanda started a Twitter thread where immunocompromised people listed what they needed, and people with access to disinfectant products volunteered to send them out. \u201cThe response has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d said Nehanda, who eventually created a Google document to organize it all. Nearly 200 people from across the US and Canada signed up to mail out soap, face masks and hand sanitizer. Even more offered to make local food deliveries and run errands. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of how self-motivated some people are to really ensure everyone is OK, and be committed to practicing mutual aid in real life in their own communities,\u201d said Nehanda. Mutual aid is a concept in organization theory, based on the late-19th-century anarchist writings of Russian economist and sociologist Peter Kropotkin. It describes people providing each other support, whether through resources or services, for the sake of mutual benefit. The hallmark of mutual aid is that aid flows horizontally \u2013 between peers, colleagues, community members \u2013 rather than from the top-down, as it would from a government, major charity or other institutional program to those in need. It is fitting that mutual aid is rooted in anarchist theory: typically, in times of crisis, war, or natural disaster, when institutions begin to fail, human altruism comes to the forefront. After the 2017 Mexico City earthquake, civilians organized brigades to move broken pieces of rubble, and volunteers directed traffic. In 2011, in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, a group of 200 Japanese elderly volunteered themselves to work to stabilize the nuclear plant, citing their likelihood to die of other causes before cancer from radiation exposure. Even in the US, a nation characterized by individualism, disasters have had a tendency to beget altruism. John Abruzzo, a quadriplegic accountant, was working in the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks. His co-workers took turns carrying him to safety down 69 flights of stairs. For some populations, of course, the disaster is constant. For many marginalized and vulnerable demographics, crisis only exacerbates already-dire circumstances. As the threat of Covid-19 looms, many sex workers have seen drastic decreases in business. \u201cAny time the demand for services is really low, and people are pushed into a place of financial desperation, some clients will take advantage of that,\u201d said Molly Simmons, a sex worker and activist based in Brooklyn. \u201cThey\u2019ll ask people to cross boundaries they\u2019re not comfortable with, perform services in unsafe areas, lower their prices. So people find themselves taking more risks because work is scarce.\u201d To compound the problem, sex workers are often unable to access social services. Sex work is largely a cash industry, and workers often struggle to open bank accounts or obtain health insurance. Some have criminal records. Some are migrant workers without documentation. They generally do not have paid sick leave. \u201cI don\u2019t have a paystub to show anyone,\u201d said Fera Lorde, another Brooklyn-based sex worker and activist. \u201cI can\u2019t prove to a bureaucracy that I\u2019m poor.\u201d Simmons and Lorde are representatives at the Brooklyn chapter of the Sex Worker Outreach Project, a social justice network dedicated to the rights of sex workers. To support their community, they started a GoFundMe to raise an emergency relief fund for sex workers in New York. Many of the donors are other sex workers. \u201cWe\u2019re always spreading the wealth around,\u201d said Lorde. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re flush, we help each other out.\u201d For Taranta, mutual aid is the path forward \u2013 not just for this crisis, but for the next one. \u201cWe\u2019re about to face all these collapses,\u201d said Taranta. \u201cWith the economy, and with climate change. We need to have these systems ready.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How Helsinki and Oslo cut pedestrian deaths to zero", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/how-helsinki-and-oslo-cut-pedestrian-deaths-to-zero", "date": "2020-03-16", "transcript": "They cut speed limits, changed street design, removed space for cars and generally made life harder for motorists. Now it appears the work is paying off. Two of Europe\u2019s smaller capital cities \u2013 Oslo and Helsinki \u2013 are reaping the rewards of committed action on making their roads safer, reducing pedestrian fatalities to zero last year. Helsinki recorded no deaths for the first time since records began in 1960, down from an average of 20-30 a year in the 1990s. In Oslo, there were also no pedestrian or cyclist deaths in the city, which has a population of 680,000, and no children under 16 died in traffic crashes in the entire country. In comparison, 57 pedestrians died in London in 2018; 2019 figures have yet to be released. The Nordic achievements beg the question: what did they do to achieve such dramatic improvements? Christoffer Solstad Steen from Trygg Trafikk, a road safety organisation in Norway, said: \u201c[Politicians in Oslo] have chosen to make it more difficult to use a car \u2013 it takes more time to drive from one part of the city to another now and you have to pay money to use the road much more than you used to.\u201d In 2017 there was a 70% increase in tolls across the city, in plans spearheaded by the Labour and Green parties, which led to a 6% decrease in traffic. Car parking charges were also increased \u2013 by 50% in downtown Oslo and 20% elsewhere \u2013 although thousands of spaces have now been wiped out to make room for 35 miles of new cycle lanes. The city has reduced speed to a maximum of 30km/h outside schools and started trialling \u201cheart zones\u201d, where driving is banned in areas around schools. Officials in Oslo hope to create 100 of these zones over the next four years. There has been some opposition to the changes, admits Arild Hermstad, Oslo\u2019s vice mayor for environment and transport \u2013 particularly when it comes to banning cars from certain areas of the city. However, he thinks when people become accustomed to the new set-up, they see the benefits: \u201cWhen it actually starts happening and people see that it\u2019s working, then no one wants to reintroduce the cars into these roads. So I think more and more people are seeing that this is actually good for the city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reduce the overall car traffic in Oslo by 30% by 2030. It\u2019s a hard goal, but we think it will be good for the city as well.\u201d Similar traffic reduction tactics have been employed in Helsinki, where speed limits have been tightening for decades and were reduced again last year. Now the speed limit is 30km/h on most residential streets and the city centre, 50km/h on main streets in suburban areas and 40km/h on those in the inner city. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not only a question of speed limits, although I think all our specialists do say that is the most important single thing affecting traffic safety,\u201d said Anni Sinnem\u00e4ki, the deputy mayor of urban environment in Helsinki. \u201cIn the last few years, we have also focused on how we build the street environment. Streets are being better divided between pedestrians, cycle lanes and cars \u2013 the car lane is not the widest possible.\u201d Along with narrower driving lanes, Helsinki has also built dozens of roundabouts and installed speed bumps since the 1990s to reduce speed. The wider picture across Europe shows a sharp difference in road safety. From 2015 to 2017, the average number of road deaths on urban roads per million urban inhabitants was 10.9 in the UK. In Norway it was just 5.3, the lowest in Europe, while in Finland it was 16.9. The countries with the highest rates of urban road deaths were Romania with 105.2, Croatia with 87.9 and Serbia with 73.8. Norway and Finland have implemented Vision Zero, a set of principles and policies aimed at eliminating serious injuries and fatalities involving road traffic. The project shifts responsibility for crashes from road users to the designers of the road system \u2013 if one occurs, it is up to authorities to ensure that it does not happen again. The initiative has been taken up across the world with varying levels of success. Sadiq Khan signed London up in 2018, but Norway has been working towards it since the 1990s. The goal hasn\u2019t been achieved yet, however. Although both cities recorded zero pedestrian fatalities in 2019, in Helsinki three drivers died in traffic crashes last year, while in Oslo one driver died. A pedestrian has also been killed in the city this year. In Norway, there has also been a renewed focus on road safety education in schools and maintaining a tough driving test. Hermstad said: \u201cFor many years, the driver education system has focused a lot on road safety. And also strict regulations and road rules that prioritise safety, maybe more here than in many other countries.\u201d Steen added: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to build yourself out of problems but it is more difficult to get people to understand that this is important and make them act in a more secure way. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we have managed to achieve that goal, but it\u2019s one of the things we have been focusing on for many years in Norway and probably one of the reasons why things are getting better.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Coronavirus: campaign launched offering help to those self-isolating", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-campaign-launched-offering-help-to-those-self-isolating", "date": "2020-03-14", "transcript": "As coronavirus engulfs the world, with increasing numbers putting themselves in self-isolation as a response to the growing pandemic, it is easy to become swept up in the doom and gloom. But some kind-hearted people are shrugging off the sense of apocalypse by offering to lend a helping hand to those in need, notifying them by dropping leaflets through their letterboxes as dozens of \u201cmutual aid\u201d groups spring up across the UK. Eighty-seven groups have been formed across the country to offer practical support for those in self-isolation, as well as phone calls. Volunteers are organising WhatsApp and Facebook groups, and are holding meetings online alongside distributing flyers in the street. Anna Vickerstaff, one of the coordinators of the national Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK network, said: \u201cNo matter what we look like, where we live, or how much money we have, getting sick reminds us that at our core we\u2019re all just human. \u201cAnd in every country it\u2019s the old, the sick and those already struggling who will be affected worse. That\u2019s why we set this network up \u2013 because we want to make sure that no one in our communities is being left to face this crisis alone, and because we want to try and redress some of the serious inequalities this outbreak will expose.\u201d The groups follow a #viralkindness campaign where postcards bearing the message \u201cHello! If you are self-isolating, I can help\u201d are being dropped at doorsteps across the UK with the idea already spreading as far as Australia. The cards, which are available to download online so people can print them at home, include boxes for neighbours to write their name, address, phone number and state whether volunteers can help with picking up shopping, urgent supplies, posting mail or even just \u201ca friendly phone call\u201d. It comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK reached over 1,000 on Saturday, with the government advising anyone showing symptoms \u2013 including a cough or high temperature \u2013 to self-isolate at home for seven days. People with mild symptoms are not being tested. The postcard idea was conceived by Becky Wass, a lecturer in Cornwall who said she felt helpless by the pandemic and was compelled to do something to combat it. Wass, an associate lecturer in creative advertising at Falmouth University, told Cornwall Live: \u201cI was talking to my husband John about how the news was quite hard-hitting and there wasn\u2019t much we could actually do to make a positive difference.\u201d Wass, 32, added: \u201cIf just one person feels less lonely or isolated when faced with this pandemic, then I\u2019ll feel better about it. Coronavirus is scary. Let\u2019s make kindness go viral.\u201d She wrote on her Facebook page on Thursday evening: \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling pretty helpless watching the news. Maybe you have too? I wanted to do something about it, so I\u2019ve made a postcard that I\u2019ll be posting to my older neighbours as this progresses (after washing my hands!). \u201cIf just one person feels less lonely or isolated when faced with this pandemic, then I\u2019ll feel better about it (I hope!) Coronavirus is scary. Let\u2019s make kindness go viral. Feel free to share/print/use.\u201d Polly Cox, who runs a post office store in Wiltshire, is also posting leaflets to neighbours in order to \u201creach out to the vulnerable people in our community\u201d who are self-isolating or cautious about going outside. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe\u2019re buddying up people so those who already know elderly people or people who are at more higher risk, if they already know them then we\u2019re pairing them up. And we\u2019re making sure that people have regular contact and just reach out to people really and reassure them that we\u2019re all in it together. \u201cAlready we\u2019ve had a brilliant reaction. We\u2019ve got a neighbourhood watch WhatsApp group and a village WhatsApp group so people have already been messaging me saying they know so-and-so or they\u2019ll check in on this household and so already we\u2019re building up a good list of names of people who can help. Other people have offered to drive if they need to.\u201d Meanwhile, in Brighton the community spirit is also thriving as locals rally round to help the vulnerable. A Covid-19 mutual aid group on Facebook is connecting people who need help with food shopping, picking up prescriptions or even dog-walking. Within 24 hours of it being set up on Friday, the group swelled to more than 600 members who have already set about distributing flyers offering help. Sussex University lecturer Dr Andrea Brock, 33, who came up with the idea with her friend, said: \u201cIt can be incredibly isolating to be in your house for weeks. We are used to this idea that asking for help is a bad thing and that is not something we are encouraged to do. \u201cSo we are setting up this group so people can ask for help and they can ask for support.

There is something in the air, a sense of the slow-motion shutdown of public life in dozens of countries. Quiet streets, empty buses, vacant offices. If that feels scary, then there is another way of looking at things. It\u2019s very possible that you and I might have a little more time on our hands in coming weeks, as public events dwindle, holidays are cancelled, travel options dry up, working-from-home days proliferate and millions self-isolate. And therein lies the opportunity from this crisis. A chance to pivot away from the routine of your everyday life, do something different, pick up some new skills. As Oliver Balch explained recently in this lovely little Upside piece, the digital world means it has never been easier to learn something new, whether that is bike maintenance, barbering or baking. What could you learn in a few short weeks? That rather depends on your dedication, I suspect. Sewing, juggling, CPR, drawing, wood turning, the Cyrillic alphabet, solving cryptic crosswords, cooking, meditation, temari, knitting, video editing, offspin, yoga, coding, diving (though this might be difficult in your front room), the accordion \u2026 the list is endless. So how about it? What will you learn? Let us know. Lindsey Smith has already been in touch: \u201cI have planned my fortnight in self-isolation. The house will be spring cleaned, books read, but I may not have enough loo paper \u2026\u201d Of course, you\u2019ll have to leave a little time in your study schedule for reading the best Upside pieces of the week. This week that is just 12 minutes: \u2022 The new-look department store that doesn\u2019t sell stuff. Three-minute read \u2022 The baker who recycles old bread. One-minute loaf \u2022 The EU green deal \u2013 can it save the world? Four-minute read \u2022 Here comes the sun canoe. Two-minute read \u2022 Italy puts a brave face on it all. Two-minute read Lucky numbers It was, in truth, not a great week to be an investor (though don\u2019t be fooled by the headlines about billions being wiped off share markets: these things have a habit of turning around). But if you were a Tunisian garlic grower, things were definitely looking up. Indeed, Covid-19 \u2013 while still clearly a supremely grave global event \u2013 continues to produce silver linings: China\u2019s carbon emissions fell by one quarter as a result of its containment measures. Three quarters of Chinese virus patients have now recovered. New case numbers are falling in South Korea and other east Asian nations. Meanwhile this article demonstrates how social distancing, destined to become one of the words of the year, really can and does work to flatten the epidemic sine curve. What we liked The world didn\u2019t seem so bad after reading this uplifting piece from the BBC about the revival of one of Britain\u2019s great rivers. And here is some fascinating science about why visualising an action can lead to its better execution. What we heard Last week, we asked you what you thought of our coverage of coronavirus. The majority of you were positive, though for balance we include a mix of responses. Margaret Clough was pleased that we are making huge efforts to ensure that our reporting is balanced and responsible: All I can say is a huge thankyou for honest, balanced reporting, and really thinking about the effect your ethical reporting can have on our society. I wish more people could have access to it. Fiona Greig added: Keep doing what you do best \u2026 objective, balanced, trustworthy reporting. It\u2019s what we need most to help us make sense of the world in these turbulent times. A German reader who didn\u2019t want his name published is not a fan of the minute-by-minute type of coverage: I have also wondered how you will escalate the coverage as the outbreak grows (which is likely though not certain). If you are already at the top of the scale with the first few cases, the first few deaths in the UK, what will you do should people die in the thousands per day? And Karen Hubbard in Australia wonders if the media are making things worse: I think they are scaring everyone with the sensational way of reporting every new person case. They have turned it into a pandemic before it is and ordinary people feel out of control and are panicking. In Australia there is panic buying and now countries are closing there borders, yet so far it has caused less damage than the flu. Jeremy Becker in Sweden wanted a little more context: Thanks for your excellent coverage. In terms of perspective, I as a reader would appreciate some statistics comparing mortality rates for corona and other causes of death. Monica Lanman had a suggestion: Just one thought that someone might pick up - worldwide collaboration of the kind that is building over Covid 19 is exactly what we need over the climate emergency. Can we learn from the one and inject the same huge power and urgency into the other? Elsewhere, and changing the subject, Adam Davey wrote in from France, and from leftfield: Binned wine corks would insulate every home in the country, especially in France. Waste is an absolute scandal. I use all manner of materials to insulate my barn conversion in France. I don\u2019t have a landfill bin bag at all. Zero waste. Thanks Adam. Corks it is then.

A team of young indigenous people are onboard. Such vessels are an essential and ubiquitous part of life in the Ecuadorian Amazon, but this one boasts a hugely symbolic difference from its predecessors. It is powered by the sun. The nine members of the Achuar indigenous group on board are returning home after learning about solar power and installation. It is a technological development they hope to use in their battle with a more traditional power source that threatens their very existence. Oil. \u201cThey have sold us out, they have sold our resources,\u201d says Nantu, 31, referring to the authorities in Quito. \u201cAnd they are expanding the oil wells. They are stealing from us without us noticing. That\u2019s why we are now standing up, to defend what\u2019s ours, our territories, our way of life.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s oil industry has wrought tremendous disruption and destruction on the peoples of the Amazon rainforest. It is not just the pollution, heavy machinery and deforestation. It is roads as well. A highway that starts in the town of Puyo has already penetrated dozens of kilometres into the territory of the neighbouring Shuar indigenous group, and it is about to enter Achuar territory. \u201cThe road is a poison,\u201d says Jos\u00e9, Nantu\u2019s companion. \u201cThe road doesn\u2019t respect us. It\u2019s been imposed on us from the city. It\u2019s a very dangerous territory for us.\u201d The solar canoes are a defiant attempt to stand up to this incursion. The project, conceived by the Quito-based Kara Solar Foundation, aims to connect nine communities in Achuar territory with public transport powered by the sun. The project envisages an Amazon teeming with solar canoes that will potentially replace the tens of thousands of vessels that burn thousands cubic metres of fuel each year. As Kara Solar\u2019s founder, Oliver Utne, puts it: \u201cSustained and truly intercultural collaborations can create technological solutions that serve indigenous communities, rather than destroying them.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s oil industry pumps about 500,000 barrels a day, most of it extracted from reserves in the Amazon rainforest. The oil is then piped to the coast and shipped thousands of miles north for refining. Much is sold for export, but some is transported back to Ecuador and driven by road back to petrol stations. From there it is poured into drums and transported in trucks or cars to to be used in canoes that in turn are propelled by two- or four-stroke outboard engines or smaller long-tailed engines known locally as peque-peques. The oil goes back into the rainforest from where it was extracted as pollution. The solar canoes are an attempt to forge an alternative. As with any research project, the two boats in operation have had technical problems and there have been accidents in the tricky territory. The river floods periodically and there are often currents, whirlpools and underwater obstacles to overcome. The surface of the canoe\u2019s solar panel needs to be optimised so that it can carry the greatest number of photovoltaic cells without endangering the vessel\u2019s stability. The durability and storage capacity of the batteries also need to be improved, to make them lighter and ideally to replace the lead with lithium without increasing the cost. There is a long list of other improvements that are needed, but the process is well under way. During the next phase of development, solar recharging stations will be installed along the canoe route. Seven young Achuar people are being trained in using the technology. These are \u201cintercultural training\u201d programmes taught by peers, who are also instructed by indigenous technicians. Concerned about the future of a growing population, the Achuar community is gradually diversifying economically in terms of moving beyond self-sufficiency toward sustainability. There is already an ecotourism project where as many as 24 people can stay in two cabins managed by the community, and a balanced food project that uses a solar power plant. The main and imminent threat, however, is undoubtedly the proximity of the road. Nantu makes a very clear complaint to the authorities in Quito: \u201cI would tell the government not to carry out projects without consulting the indigenous peoples. They should carry out projects in consultation with the people, who are the owners of the territories. They should stop expanding oil frontiers and the arteries that reach the outer corners of the Amazon. It\u2019s becoming very dangerous for us.\u201d Nantu is aware that changes are taking place in the climate and of how global heating affects the territory and the world. \u201cThere is some variation of life here in the jungle. The flowering cycle has changed by one to two months. The rains are too intense, and the sun is too strong.\u201d He has a vision for the future of his five children. He imagines an Amazon capable of being economically self-sufficient, a few community tourism centres managed by indigenous people and solar canoes managed by the Achuar with recharging stations along the river. No roads, no pipelines, no oil.

Seconds later, face beaming, his digitised silhouette is bopping across the screen together with Dahl\u2019s gangly giant. It\u2019s just one of many experiences on offer at a new downtown development in the Dutch city of Groningen that is seeking to reinvent urban hubs for the post-consumer age. The \u20ac101m, trapezoid Forum building is part library, part meeting space, part science museum and part recreational hangout \u2013 a 10-storey \u201cmulti-space\u201d designed to resonate with citizens who know that shopping is not necessarily the answer. It\u2019s a new-look department store that doesn\u2019t actually sell very much. But with high streets feeling the pinch across the developed world, with shops shuttered and town centres wondering what they are for any more, the Groningen experiment is being closely watched. Nowhere is that truer than in the UK, where more than 16,000 retail stores closed last year at the cost of more than 143,000 jobs. The picture in the US is similar, with more than 9,300 shops going to the wall in 2019 as shoppers increasingly move online. In Europe, city centres are being emptied of life as skyrocketing rental costs push low-income residents out to the peripheries. In cities such as Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Luxembourg, for instance, 80% of citizens say affordable housing is hard to find. It\u2019s early days, but the Forum certainly feels like it is working. More than 700,000 people \u2013 three times the city\u2019s total population \u2013 have visited the library since it opened late last year. So, what\u2019s the big draw? There are books galore (92,000 in total), but they are for rent, not sale, distributed liberally across multiple mezzanine floors with a joyous disregard for Dewey decimal discipline. Geography on one floor, history on another, mathematics \u2026 somewhere, presumably. For the non-bookish, there\u2019s plenty besides: a six-screen cinema, two exhibition halls, a couple of cafes, a museum (about comics, no less), a 250-seater auditorium, and a hip (but not overly hip) top-floor restaurant and bar. Oh, plus a rooftop \u201cmarket square\u201d with panoramic views over the whole of Groningen. \u201cEvery day when I pick him up from school, he asks to come to the Forum. He just finds it so much fun,\u201d says Joris\u2019s dad, Marcel, an archaeologist, who cuts his working day short every Tuesday to accommodate his son\u2019s request. Right to roam The comment is music to the ears of Dirk Nijdam, the Forum\u2019s director, who readily admits that lending out books has never been his priority. Instead, what\u2019s driven his thinking since he took on the project six years ago is the idea of creating a space where anyone and everyone can wander in, kick back and collectively feel at home. \u201cIf people walk in and say, \u2018Wow, Groningen has got a new library\u2019, then we\u2019ll have failed,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to come in and just hang out, you should feel just as welcome as if you\u2019re going to an exhibition or taking out a book.\u201d This notion of \u201changing out\u201d gets to the real function of Groningen\u2019s artful new creation: namely, helping fellow citizens mix and mingle and \u2013 who knows? \u2013 perhaps even taste that nebulous yet ever-necessary thing called \u201ccommunity\u201d. It\u2019s a mission born, in part, out of Groningen\u2019s struggling city centre. The hope is that the Forum will revitalise the main market square, which, after the German occupation during the second world war was home to a dingy car park for decades. At the same time, the project marks a bold riposte to the effects of modern-day capitalist society: first, in its promotion of an individualistic society; and second, in its commercialisation of public space (ie with malls and coffee bars gradually replacing libraries and community centres). The Forum is a splendid example of form following function. Clean and contemporary, the final design shouts anything but library. Hotel lobby, perhaps? Department store, even? From the luminous circular information desk, to the free-floating elevators, to the immense, cathedral-esque atrium. It\u2019s all quite discombobulating and really rather marvellous. Once through the door, the challenge is to make people stay. It\u2019s all about \u201cthe experience\u201d, says Nijdam, borrowing from big retail\u2019s mantra de jour. So no security beefs on the door, no blaring Tannoy announcements, no endless queuing. Instead, it\u2019s all soft furnishings, mood lighting and make-yourself-at-home courtesy. Signposts are also kept to a minimum. Exploration, not explanation, is the building\u2019s guiding motif, says Kamiel Klaasse co-founder of NL Architects, an upstart Amsterdam-based firm that beat off an all-star list (including the late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid) to win the design contract way back in 2006. \u201cThe brief talked as much about searching as about finding and we interpreted that as an incentive to let people roam,\u201d Klaasse says. Community connector The Groningen resident and social activist Ritzo ten Cate is an early cheerleader for the project. Describing the Forum as \u201cone big welcome gesture to us as citizens\u201d, he points to the diversity of the building\u2019s users as proof of its communitarian qualities. The evidence seems solid. On any given day, you\u2019ll find students working at their laptops, mums with their toddlers, school kids on assignment and grannies reading newspapers. All of them together, under one roof, seemingly as one. Nor is it just Groningen\u2019s well-heeled citizens who make use of the space. On his many visits, Ten Cate regularly spots friends from the city\u2019s homeless community. Some come to read or use the free internet, while others are after a warm corner to kill time or take a nap. \u201cThe Forum only opened a few months ago, but it\u2019s already doing its job as a connector,\u201d says Ten Cate, who has plans to run a large-scale hackathon there in June. But as much as the Forum brings people together, is it serving to create community. For Paul de Rook, an alderman on Groningen city council, it\u2019s a crucial question. More than just shared physical space, genuine community is about a shared understanding of one another, he argues. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s really valuable to create spaces where people \u2026 can see what is going on in other people\u2019s lives.\u201d In a nod to this reality, the Forum seeks to orient all its cultural activities around a common thread. Whether it\u2019s the current exhibition on artificial intelligence (recently on show at the Barbican in London) or Spike Jonze\u2019s futuristic film Her at the cinema, everyone is collectively inching towards the same page (\u201coptimism about the future\u201d, in the Forum\u2019s case). Dr Ward Rauws admires the sentiment but harbours doubts. An assistant professor of spatial planning at the University of Groningen, he notes that the core building blocks of community \u2013 social capital, civic culture, place identity and so forth \u2013 start first at a street-by-street level and expand out from there. Even so, he remains a big fan of Groningen\u2019s Forum because of its role in helping foster \u201cfamiliarity\u201d. Echoing De Rook, he defines the term as a state of awareness that \u201cother kinds of citizens exist who might think differently or look different, but who are part of the same community\u201d. It\u2019s a salient point for a university town such as Groningen, where town-gown tensions are a feature of daily life. Groningen\u2019s audacious experiment in urban planning isn\u2019t without its detractors, most of whom gripe about the final price-tag. Joris\u2019s mum is in that camp. Her son begs to differ. Done with the BFG, he\u2019s now playing a spelling game on one of the library\u2019s iPads. His dad watches on patiently, albeit with half an eye on the upstairs cafe. \u201cAfterwards,\u201d he whispers, \u201cwe go for cake.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "What is the European Green Deal\u00a0and will it really cost \u20ac1tn?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn", "date": "2020-03-09", "transcript": "What is Europe\u2019s green deal? The European Green Deal aims to transform the 27-country bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy, without reducing prosperity and while improving people\u2019s quality of life, through cleaner air and water, better health and a thriving natural world. If that sounds ambitious, it is. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it \u201cEurope\u2019s man on the moon moment\u201d. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic. Nearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution. Previous attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual. How will it work? The green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets \u2013 a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core \u2013 alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources. All of the EU\u2019s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of \u201c50 actions for 2050\u201d for other sectors. Jobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. \u201cThe European green deal is our new growth strategy \u2013 a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,\u201d von der Leyen said. What is the legal basis? All of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals. East European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK \u2013 which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda \u2013 will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP. The new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill. But what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans \u2013 charged with delivering the green deal \u2013 will throw all of its might behind the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,\u201d says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. \u201cIt will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.\u201d Will the green deal make a difference? It needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 \u2013 good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that \u2013 disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key. On other environmental scores, the EU\u2019s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s. Dozens of harmful chemicals have been phased out, farm animal welfare standards raised and recycling rates beat most of the world. But alongside those successes, the natural world has suffered a calamity across the continent: birds, insects, mammals, fish \u2026 few creatures (other than humans) have had a good time of it since the EU was created in 1992. How much will it cost and where will the money come from? At least \u20ac1 tn (\u00a3852bn) needs to be found over the next decade, according to the European commission. The biggest share, \u20ac503bn, should come from the EU budget, unleashing a further \u20ac114bn from national governments (because EU programmes often require a contribution from member states). The next \u20ac279bn would come mostly from the private sector: the idea is that companies would be encouraged to make risky green investments by loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, the EU lender, which recently pledged to phase out loans to fossil fuel projects. On top of this Brussels has promised a \u20ac100bn \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism to help retrain workers who lose jobs in shuttered coal mines or steel factories. But is it really \u20ac1 tn? Even friendly experts detect wishful accounting in Brussels\u2019 figures. Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the \u20ac503bn from the EU budget as \u201cgreen investment\u201d, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to \u201cgreen\u201d the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU\u2019s auditors highlighted how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out \u201cgreen\u201d cash with little oversight. Others fear that carbon financiers will game the system, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don\u2019t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four \u201cfrugal\u201d net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The \u20ac503bn is not even in the bank. Even if the EU realised its \u20ac1tn plan, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. Bruegel argues the \u20ac1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission\u2019s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from Arag\u00f3n to Silesia. Why does the green deal matter internationally? This year \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world\u2019s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible. But the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases fell short of what is required to stay below 2C, and since 2015 the world\u2019s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after. But enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from Donald Trump\u2019s US, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. The key player will be China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a pact between the US and China was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone. \u201cEU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,\u201d says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. \u201cIn the face of Trump\u2019s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world\u2019s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.\u201d What do critics say? The EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. He points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. \u201cThe AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,\u201d he says. \u201cThe green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won\u2019t be going carbon-neutral,\u201d says Grant. \u201cThis will increase the electoral strength of populists.\u201d Some leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, wrote in the Guardian: \u201cWill there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.\u201d Will the UK be affected? Boris Johnson\u2019s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain various loopholes that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees. The UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK\u2019s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot. On the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What\u2019s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim. That is what Europe\u2019s green deal is meant to provide, and unless the UK forms its own parallel plans soon, its 2050 target will look increasingly adrift. Who are the green agitators in Europe? The idea of a Green New Deal has been kicking around US politics since at least 2006. The European Green Deal (minus the word \u201cnew\u2019 with its radical overtones) is not yet one year old. The EU plan resulted when an unexpected political leader collided with newly-elected MEPs, energised by the global climate movement. Von der Leyen, a German defence minister, was a surprise choice to become European commission president, leapfrogging candidates who had run in the European elections in May. Those elections resulted in a record number of seats for European Greens, as climate change topped the agenda in Germany and the Nordic countries. Von der Leyen\u2019s last-minute elevation angered the European parliament, pressuring her to lean to the left, liberals and Greens to gain support. To win MEPs over, she promised a European Green Deal within 100 days of taking office. Beyond the Brussels power play, politicians were responding to the streets, as school children walked out of their classrooms, demanding action. The school strike was personal. Chief executives, heads of government and senior UN officials told EU officials their children were asking what they were doing to save the planet. As one official recounts: \u201cYou can imagine a conversation with your own children is much more confrontational than a conversation with a shareholder, or a bad headline in a newspaper.\u201d Who\u2019s in favour, who\u2019s against? It\u2019s a bit like world peace: everyone backs the European Green Deal, in theory. But there is a big hole in the ambition to be net-zero by 2050: Poland, which says it will reach climate neutrality at \u201cits own pace\u201d. And beneath the surface, tensions over Europe\u2019s green ambitions are not hard to find. At least eight countries, including Spain, Sweden and Latvia, want the EU to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target. Poland and Hungary think that is too much. Divisions will also come when hard choices have to be made: from closing coal mines, demanding more from farmers, to tougher emissions standards for the car industry. What role will the European parliament play in the green deal? EU governments agree environmental laws with the European parliament. That gives MEPs a weighty role across a swathe of new laws expected to flow from the European Green Deal: a revision of the EU\u2019s heavily criticised carbon trading scheme, new performance standards for cars and vans, an overhaul of farm policy, changes to EU rules on state subsidies that will phase out support for fossil fuels. Typically, the parliament tends to raise the bar on green action \u2013 it last year declared a climate emergency. But MEPs often lose the battle against EU ministers, who usually get the upper hand in EU negotiations.

Now there are savoury crackers made with leftover cheese ends, baguettes turned into croutons, and day-old croissants filled with fresh ingredients. It\u2019s all part of a drive by a UK bakery chain to become a zero-waste business. At least 25 new products and initiatives are promised over the coming year by Gail\u2019s, as part of an entire Waste Not range of foods which aims to cut down on ingredients squandered throughout the company\u2019s supply chain. Globally, the UN estimates global food waste causes about $940bn (\u00a3770bn) a year in economic losses. It says a third of the world\u2019s food is wasted while one in nine people remain malnourished, while food waste also accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Surplus bread remains one of the biggest waste problems for food retailers, according to the UK government\u2019s food waste adviser Wrap, particularly from freshly baked lines which have a short shelf life. It is also wasted in our homes: Britons throw away 24m slices a day. The original \u201cwaste bread\u201d is made from strong white flour, malt, and a decades-old sourdough \u201cstarter\u201d, mixed with so-called \u201cbread porridge\u201d \u2013 a brownish, flecked mush of fresh breadcrumbs from leftover loaves blitzed into tiny pieces. \u201cWe freshly bake all our products every day and obviously we don\u2019t know how much we are going to sell,\u201d said Gail\u2019s co-founder Tom Molnar. \u201cThe waste sourdough bread has proved very popular with our customers, and as a result, we decided to review our entire range of products and ingredients to see how best to tackle waste. It seems a good example of the circular economy in action and reflects the philosophy of our business.\u201d The circular economy model \u2013 which aims to use closed-loop production to keep resources in play for as long as possible \u2013 is being increasingly used in a range of different sectors from food, packaging, plastics and fashion. Gail\u2019s opened its first bakery in Hampstead in 2005 and today has 59 outlets in London, Brighton, Cambridge, Oxford and elsewhere in the south-east. Every night, its shops donate unused food to more than 40 local charities, but any leftover bread not sold or distributed in this way has, for the last eighteen months, been diverted into the waste bread. The first dozen Waste Not products, launched this month, include two more repurposed sourdough loaves \u2013 one using cheese. The chain also makes and sells up to 6,500 croissants every day, and those that are not sold are now being refreshed as part of the new range. Its ham and gruy\u00e8re croissant, for example, uses yesterday\u2019s flaky croissants filled with rich b\u00e9chamel sauce, honey-glazed ham and gruy\u00e8re cheese, then re-baked. Other croissants are similarly refashioned into almond versions. In the run-up to Easter, day-old hot cross buns will be turned into a novel breakfast version of the traditional bacon sarnie. Shard-like cheese crackers are made from leftover dough scattered with cheddar cuts from Gail\u2019s cheese supplier Quicke\u2019s. Even its butter \u2013 part of the new range \u2013 is made from the whey cream left over from the cheese-making process. Gail\u2019s is also teaming up with Suffolk-based brewer Brewshed to create its first ever beer brewed with leftover bread, something increasingly popular in the brewing industry. Toast Ale, for example, was launched in 2016 by Tristram Stuart, the founder of the food waste charity Feedback, who was inspired by a Belgian brewer who follows the same process. Toast Ale has just launched its first beer brewed with \u2018wonky\u2019 crumpets made by Warburtons: Toasted Crumpet is a 4.2% abv session IPA where some malted barley has been replaced by crumpets that would have otherwise been disposed of. Meanwhile, Marks &amp; Spencer is repurposing leftover baguettes from its in-store bakeries into packs of crostini \u2013 extending their shelf life by seven days \u2013 and is also trialling turning leftover baguettes and boules into frozen garlic bread, extending their shelf life by 30 days.

All this in week one of a brand new series that aims to cross borders, generate hope, and emphasise that while the UK might be leaving Europe, the Guardian is not. How welcome it is to see Katharine Viner\u2019s defiant leader. As Keats said on first looking into Chapman\u2019s Homer: \u201cThen felt I like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken ...\u201d etc etc. Denis Loretto I am a Canadian who has followed Brexit with a broken heart. Yes. It is a self inflicted wound. But your quality of journalism makes me believe there is hope for your lovely country and most especially for the next generation. Somehow the Guardian enables me to Keep Calm and Carry On. Wendy Young As a graduate in European Studies in the 1980s, who benefited from partnerships between UK, French and German universities that allowed students to study abroad for an academic year, who has since lived in Asia for many years before returning to live in the UK and voting Remain, I am proud to call myself European as well as being a citizen of the world. The last few years have been challenging. It feels good to know that my favourite newspaper will continue to keep me connected to Europe. Thank you. Nicola Tanner Thanks to the Guardian, for your renovated stance towards Europe, as for your engagement for a journalism without fear and without borders. I\u2019m Italian, I live in Edinburgh and work in Italy: since Nov. 2017, I\u2019m also British. In such a multiple \u2013 and sadly divided \u2013 identity, I\u2019m proud of being a Guardian reader. Isabella Lazzarini Today I am simply writing to you to say a heartfelt thank-you for your commitment to Europe and the launch of the dedicated Europe section. The Guardian is my first port of call every morning and I am glad that I can support the Guardian\u2019s free and impartial journalism through my modest partner/membership fee. Andrew Craston Just to say the new This is Europe section is totally brilliant; we\u2019ve needed this for years! As a professor of modern languages at Birmingham, I regularly work with students and colleagues to explore European perspectives, and this has just made our lives a whole lot easier. Thank you. Helen Abbott I always support your free, independent journalism and read your papers which give me the opportunity to keep abreast of the times with a language full of historical background and of a deep sense of humanity. Anna Giordano I am French and a daily reader of the Guardian. I was terribly upset by Brexit. I am afraid it will loosen relations with many British people despite the fact they were \u201cremainers\u201d. Your decision to be a European news organisation will greatly help to keep these relations alive. Jacques Roos I am delighted that you have to decided to continue and deepen your coverage of Europe. I am an Irish citizen, and I often feel the coverage of European affairs here is not as good as it should be, so I am looking forward to your weekly newsletter \u2018This is Europe\u2019. Edmond Gibbons Your words are very much appreciated as were Katharine Viner\u2019s. I saw something, clicked and followed, read her editorial, joined. There was no question about thinking about it. This decision by the Guardian to have this new site was an inspired moment for me; the choice between yes and yes. Brian Milne As a Europe-based supporter of the Guardian, who is highly appreciative of, if not reliant upon, the organisation\u2019s brave journalism in this age of misinformation, I am overjoyed to read of the decision to uphold a European orientation. Peter Symmons The article by Katharine Viner in yesterday\u2019s paper made me cheer out loud (very loudly)! I also wept and so I recognise I haven\u2019t yet worked through all the stages of grief at leaving the EU! Ellen Wallace Well done \u2013 you are a constant inspiration to me (for about 50 years!). Thank you. Peter Wishart Delighted to hear from you and your decision to keep a focus on European events. You have my full support. A very happy member. Lesley Siddall This is a simple message to tell you how much I value your reporting on European issues. I\u2019m particularly interested in what the rest of Europe is doing about the climate emergency, pollution and how transport, public or private cars, is being incentivised to make a positive impact. Mike Mellor I just wanted to agree totally with your three principal reasons for deepening your commitment to Europe. I think that there are lots of opportunities to learn from our near neighbours, such as: Modern architecture and the public realm \u2013 numerous examples throughout Europe. Cycling infrastructure and hydro-engineering in the Netherlands. Regional banks supporting business in Germany. Eric Kelsall Thanks so much for Katharine Viner\u2019s inspiring message, and the news that the Guardian is going further than just \u2018not turning its back\u2019 on the rest of Europe. The European idea in the UK can and should survive the setback that Brexit represents, and open-minded journalism of the sort announced here will help considerably. As a linguist and a convinced Europhile over decades, I felt supported and heartened by what I read. Niall Hoskin Having moved with my French wife in August last year to escape the disaster that is Brexit, we, as Guardian members, are very heartened by your decision to align and commit yourself to Europe as we have. We look forward to your unsurpassed coverage and more excellent comments and articles, from Rafael Behr, John Crace and Marina Hyde et al and give our wholehearted support to you for our very uncertain future.

The building, which will open in early 2021, is more than just a healthcare facility. It is a symbol of Romanian frustration with successive governments and a growing realisation that maybe citizens need to find their own solutions to the country\u2019s problems. Since 2015, more than 300,000 people and over 4,000 companies have donated money to construct the facility, which will treat children with cancer and will be the first state hospital built entirely through private donations. More than \u20ac30m (\u00a325m) has been raised so far, enough to build and equip it. The heavy metal band Metallica donated \u20ac250,000 when they came to play a concert in Bucharest last August. \u201cI think Romanians needed a project to believe in because for the past 30 years nothing was built, no roads, no hospitals, no infrastructure,\u201d said Oana Gheorghiu, one of the two founders of Give Life Association, the NGO behind the project. Since the end of communism in 1989, Romania has lagged behind in terms of public investment. It has the lowest spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP in the EU, at about half the EU average, according to the latest available figures from Eurostat. At the same time, each year thousands of doctors and nurses leave the country for better-paid jobs abroad, and corruption and scandals continue to plague the sector. Last year one Romanian entrepreneur, fed up with the lack of progress in creating a modern road network in the country, inaugurated a symbolic, one-metre-long stretch of motorway he had constructed to publicly shame the government\u2019s lack of investment. While that stunt was aimed at drawing attention to a problem, the hospital in Bucharest is a potential solution, albeit one that will be hard to replicate. Donations have poured in through the NGO\u2019s website and via SMS. Some of the biggest donations have come from the energy companies OMV Petrom and Engie, as well as Mastercard. The average individual donation on the website is about \u20ac16. \u201cMy donation isn\u2019t a big deal, but I am very happy to see a project like D\u0103ruie\u0219te Via\u021ba coming true,\u201d said Livia Grigorescu, a schoolteacher in a small town outside Bucharest, using the Romanian name of the NGO. Grigorescu donates \u20ac2 a month via SMS. \u201cFor me, this is a hope for a better future and, in the meantime, a proof of what can be done when people really want it.\u201d Built on the grounds of one of the city\u2019s existing hospitals, the paediatric oncology wing will cover 12,000 sq metres, with a floor dedicated to intensive care, six operating rooms and about 160 beds. Construction started in June 2018. \u201cWe wanted to refurbish and remodel the oncology department here [at the existing facility],\u201d said Gheorghiu, pointing out that they had done the same with a hospital in Timi\u015foara, in the west of the country. But, she said, they found it would be easier to build a new structure than to renovate the existing one, which was constructed in the late 1970s. Gheorghiu, who was a student at the time of the 1989 revolution, said the Romanian healthcare system had not improved over the last 30 years. \u201cIt\u2019s actually even worse than it was during the communist era, because the infrastructure was not developed at all so they have the same resources.\u201d Vlad Voiculescu, a former health minister who co-founded a children\u2019s cancer charity in 2014, spoke of a disconnect between the growth in other parts of the Romanian economy and investment in areas such as healthcare. \u201cOur private sector has thrived. Hundreds of office buildings in Romania\u2019s cities, impressive living areas, and probably the biggest shopping malls in Europe. Our government, on the other hand, has managed to build only one new hospital in three decades,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is this urgency for decent hospital infrastructure, as sub-optimal medical care drives tens of thousands to move west each year. This hospital simply shows us that we, Romanians, are better than our government. That we can and we deserve better.\u201d Since Give Life was founded in 2012 \u2013 by Gheorghiu and Carmen Uscatu, neither of whom had a medical background \u2013 it has helped to build 18 sterile transplant rooms in Romania, tripling the country\u2019s transplant capacity. The association has also constructed the country\u2019s first laboratory for the \u201cdeep diagnosis\u201d of leukaemia, and renovated oncology departments for children and adults in three of the country\u2019s largest cities. Even so, relations between the NGO and government officials have, at times, been strained. In contrast, the NGO is heavily engaged with its donors, using social media posts to keep them up to date with developments and to give them a sense of ownership. This has kept money pouring in. Given the progress, it is tempting to wonder whether this approach to healthcare funding could be rolled out in other countries in the region with ageing and poorly funded health infrastructure. However, experts are not convinced the model is replicable more widely. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic, it will save lives, but it reminds me of the 1990s,\u201d said Pascal Garel, the chief executive of the Brussels-based European Hospital and Healthcare Federation. \u201cIt puts pressure on the government in Romania saying you\u2019re not able to run the system properly and fund it. That\u2019s incredible.\u201d He said a healthcare system\u2019s problems could not be solved by such an initiative because it could not be done over and over again for different medical issues and age groups. Gheorghiu said they hoped to inspire others and they are well aware that one hospital will not change the entire system. However, she said the aim was to create \u201can island where things work normally and when people come \u2013 patients, doctors and nurses \u2013 they will see that things can be done differently and they will start changing\u201d. The new hospital will become part of the public health system upon completion, and Give Life is already looking beyond the initial construction. \u201cWe have the money for the first building, but now the project has been extended,\u201d said Gheorghiu. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to do another building that will be connected with this one. The new hospital building will be about as big as the first.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The small Dutch town that wants to shape the future of your food", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/how-a-small-dutch-town-is-shaping-the-future-of-your-food-wageningen-netherlands", "date": "2020-03-05", "transcript": "In the low-lying Gelderse Valley some 85km east of Amsterdam, a Dutch university is changing how humans eat. There, a bright-eyed press officer with Willy Wonka flair is showing me the miracles of modern food science. One laboratory door swings open to reveal giant, fragrant basil leaves growing under multicoloured lights. In a greenhouse nearby, thousands of tomatoes are suspended mid-air like plump, levitating Buddhas. A few steps away, I shake hands with a world-famous banana scientist, who dreams of introducing Europeans to the many varieties of banana eaten across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and ending the tyranny of the common yellow Cavendish. For miles in every direction, fields bulge with crops; in some, drones monitor soil fertility, in others, giant luminescent panels light up greenhouses at night. The press officer is accustomed to impressing visitors. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asks at every turn. The Netherlands is not a big place. You can drive across the whole country from the north to the south in under four hours. And yet it ranks consistently among the world\u2019s top food exporting nations, in terms of gross value. The country\u2019s surpluses are mind-boggling; how does the second largest exporter of tomatoes and onions also produce such outsize quantities of dairy and potatoes, and export more eggs than any nation on Earth? The mystery of how this tiny patch of northern Europe does it draws government delegations, multinational companies and agriculture students from around the world to marvel at the nucleus of the Dutch innovation juggernaut: Wageningen University. Wageningen is set to face its biggest challenge yet. By 2050, according to some estimates, the number of mouths to feed on Earth will exceed 9.7 billion. That\u2019s the equivalent of having a second Europe and a second Africa on the planet. To feed all of humanity, according to the World Resources Institute, we will need to produce 56% more food while avoiding further deforestation. The climate crisis will not help: pests will multiply as temperatures rise; floods, droughts and extreme weather will ravage crops; and desertification will take large bites out of currently available arable land. Broadly speaking, humankind has two paths to choose from to confront what is about to happen. One option \u2013 we innovate our way out. Wageningen\u2019s science addresses some of the biggest problems in our food supply system today: scientists there are developing plant-based meat, vertical farms and gene-editing technology. If the answer to the problem of humanity\u2019s survival is going to come out of a laboratory, there\u2019s a good chance that it will happen in Wageningen. Multinational companies and energetic startups are pouring money into the university; the collective brainpower of 8,000 international food scientists is part of the machinery that will determine how humans of the future will eat. The other option \u2013 championed by a small but spirited group of Wageningen students \u2013 is rather more drastic. Neurosis about surplus and production, the students say, has driven the Earth to crisis point. Hunger continues, even as agriculture occupies 40\u201350% of the earth\u2019s habitable land, guzzles 70% of all freshwater, and accounts for about 10\u201312% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. A third of food produced globally is wasted, while many of the world\u2019s hungriest people are farming cash crops such as flowers and tobacco, the students say. The cycle of year-on-year growth fuels unnecessary demand, while market-led models of resource allocation cause huge inequalities in access to food. The Wageningen model, one student tells me, is flawed. \u201cThe question of how to feed the world is a political one,\u201d she says. Global hunger Louise Fresco, one of the world\u2019s leading food scientists and president of Wageningen University, has been thinking about how to feed the world since she was 15 years old. In 1967, the budding scientist saw photographs of a famine in Biafra, Nigeria, and awakened to the urgency of global hunger. The images set Fresco off on journeys to Papua New Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she witnessed scarcity first-hand \u2013 in her book, Hamburgers in Paradise, she recalls eating roasted palm beetles and python in tomato sauce on these trips to poverty-stricken countries. \u201cI contemplated how little was available to the world\u2019s population,\u201d she writes. Fresco was born in the aftermath of one of the most traumatic chapters in modern Dutch history, a manmade famine known as the Hunger Winter during the second world war in which about 20,000 Dutch people starved to death in a few months, as wartime rations in some regions fell to 500 calories per day. The echo of this event, encapsulated in the postwar slogan: \u201chunger \u2013 never again\u201d, reverberates through my conversation with Fresco, and through many conversations I have at Wageningen. \u201cI always felt that the coincidence of birth should be translated into some kind of a moral responsibility,\u201d Fresco says in an interview at her office. \u201cThere was a great sense that something had to be done, that there is more than just going about your own life and being rich and happy.\u201d The Dutch obsession with agricultural surplus is at the heart of the story of Europe. In the years after the war, the Netherlands\u2019 agriculture minister Sicco Mansholt piloted large-scale mechanised farming. Mansholt wanted to secure the country\u2019s food supply by increasing production. Heavy machinery, chemical fertilisers, and new research and technology were part of a modernising mission that Mansholt later evangelised across the continent as the first European commissioner for agriculture through the common agricultural policy. He sought to build a postwar Europe of plenty while lifting small farmers out of poverty and integrating Europe\u2019s economies. But by the 1980s, CAP\u2019s guaranteed minimum prices for farmers led to production overdrive, environmental devastation and obscene amounts of waste: Europe was paying millions to store hoards of unwanted meat, undrinkable \u201cwine lakes\u201d and mountains of grain and butter. Agriculture was devouring nearly 70% of the EU budget, disproportionately rewarding the biggest, most efficient producers. European popstars advanced the rhetoric of their leaders, singing \u201cfeed the world, let them know it\u2019s Christmas\u201d while their countries used export subsidies to dump surpluses on world markets at knockdown prices. Public opinion turned against Europe\u2019s state-sponsored excesses, in favour of efficiency-driven American capitalism. Wageningen was suffering an existential crisis. \u201cThere was a questioning (sic) of \u2013 should we take responsibility, shouldn\u2019t the market do things?\u201d said Fresco, who at the time was a rising star at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and would have been aware of the waste mountains and the first international conversations about sustainability. Wageningen\u2019s establishment turned to the giants of industry to keep the university afloat. Walking around Wageningen with Fresco, I am struck at how the town has compartmentalised the angst and suffering of the war in a small museum in its cobbled old quarter. The futuristic Wageningen next door is unsentimental and solution-focused. Its glossy, modernist buildings architecturally distance the lingering emotion of Europe\u2019s history, and invite in only reason and logic. Big money propels Wageningen\u2019s new swagger. Sleek corporate buildings of companies such as Unilever and Dutch dairy giant FrieslandCampina blend seamlessly into the campus architecture and the old university town has rebranded as \u201cFood Valley\u201d \u2013 a shiny agri-tech mecca with one big goal: shaping the future of food. This mission-driven Wageningen is providing dazzling solutions to humanity\u2019s impending food supply problem. As an example, one of the university\u2019s star scientists Leo Marcellis is pioneering new vertical farming techniques as a possible solution to producing more food without using more land. Marcellis grows plants in tiered shelves inside highly monitored labs. The potential of this innovation is immense, he says, conjuring skyscrapers of herbs and abandoned buildings stacked with vegetable farms. But there is a small-print environmental cost attached, Marcellis admits. His vertical farms require huge inputs of artificial light, and are partially funded by Philips, the lightbulb manufacturer. Marcellis\u2019 land-saving vertical farms, it emerges, will require quite a lot of lightbulbs. The close relationship between Wageningen scientists and industry makes many people uncomfortable. Dutch investigative journalist Vincent Harmsen from One World magazine recently went to court asking Wageningen to release information about scientists\u2019 communications with Syngenta, Monsanto and Bayer, large agrochemical firms. The university denied his freedom of information request, and a court upheld the university\u2019s right to do so, on the grounds that Wageningen University\u2019s funding is partially private. But without understanding the relationships between scientists and companies, Harmsen argues, it is impossible to discern scientific fact from company-sponsored fiction. This proximity between science and industry goes all the way to the top of the Wageningen pyramid. Fresco is a paid non-executive director of the multinational Syngenta. She previously held positions at Unilever and Dutch financial firm Rabobank. She argues that collaboration between private companies and science is necessary, and can be positive. Her role at Syngenta, she says, involves advising the company about sustainability. \u201cSyngenta is not influencing Wageningen. It is contracting me, who tries to bring some good ideas to Syngenta. We work with all kinds of industry because we fundamentally believe that these big companies have such an influence in the world that they need to be helped to formulate sustainable products and ideas.\u201d Forest farming Meanwhile, on an abandoned apple orchard in Wageningen, a handful of students are planting a forest. In it, they will grow pumpkins, walnuts and berries. The aim is to demonstrate that small-scale farming is viable and more environmentally friendly than industrial mega-farms. \u201cLouise Fresco still thinks quite a lot in terms of \u2018we have to feed the world\u2019,\u201d says Louise Vercruysse, one of the students planting the farm. \u201cI\u2019m not really into that. You have to first look at why the world can\u2019t feed itself.\u201d The young Wageningeners believe that profit-seeking industrial farming has driven the planet to the edge of crisis. The Netherlands\u2019 fantastical food production messaging has hidden modern agriculture\u2019s assault on the environment for years, says Vercryusse. Dutch bees and butterflies are vanishing at astonishing speed, while Dutch children are suffering from pollution-induced asthma at rates higher than any country on the continent. Nitrogen levels, caused in part by hyperproductive Dutch dairy farms, when mapped from space resemble a wound over the country. To combat emissions, in 2019 Dutch courts delayed 18,000 construction projects and cut the national speed limit. The activist students say Wageningen\u2019s curriculum is still prioritising industry over the environment. To introduce new ideas to her peers, student Eva van Dijk, organises lunchtime lectures by Wouter van Eck and champions forest farming \u2013 where food is foraged or cultivated in ecologically diverse forest ecosystems. Far from feeding the world \u2013 Van Eck tells the students, European colonisers destroyed the world\u2019s indigenous food production systems. Eighteenth-century Europeans did not recognise the indigenous plants of the Americas, seeing instead only timber forests that needed felling. Now, he says, Europe is trying to export its broken agriculture system to solve a hunger crisis it created. Van Eck argues that the calculations used to bump the Netherlands up in the export rankings are misleading. They are based on the monetary value of exports rather than the quantity or nutritional value of the produce. The Dutch dairy industry, for example, buys huge amounts of fodder from Brazil, using up farmland that could be used to grow food for Brazil\u2019s native population. To Van Eck, the idea that the Netherlands\u2019 surpluses feed the world, is a hollow and dangerous lie. \u201cThe Netherlands is a black hole for food production,\u201d he says. \u201cWageningen is not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.\u201d Van Eck gets a rockstar reception from the auditorium full of students attending the lecture. A number of them surround him at the end to examine the baskets of forest-grown fruit and herbs he has brought along and ask him if they can organise internships at his forest farm. Activist students at Wageningen organise underground seed exchanges, encouraging farmers to bypass the highly regulated, industry-dominated seed market. Some organise events where they throw seed \u201cbombs\u201d into parks and fields to break the monotony of the Netherlands\u2019 controlled green spaces. The students believe the rational response to ecological crisis is to produce and consume less, even if it causes an economic backslide. This idea is catching fire around the world. Economists like Giorgos Kallis who champion \u201cdegrowth\u201d, say western economies have achieved an optimal state, and should stop chasing GDP-driven yearly growth and focus instead on limiting environmental damage. At last year\u2019s UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Greta Thunberg rebuked world leaders for continuing to pursue economic rather than ecological goals. \u201cYou are failing us,\u201d she said. The young Wageningeners are aware that they will live through an era of environmental calamity that will shape their entire lives. Their university years lack outward signs of frivolous indulgence and instead are characterised by astounding personal choices. At Droevendaal, an ecological complex near the university, Van Dijk tells me the students bulk order organic produce like cereal and rice and share it between houses to keep costs low. Their primary mode of transport is cycling. They spend their spare time cultivating vegetable patches in their gardens and eat omelettes made from fresh eggs from chickens roaming the area. Solar panels provide their energy. Unwanted clothes, books and scrap are traded in a shed called the \u201cGiveawayshop\u201d to minimise waste. The students\u2019 ideas, though, are untested. Van Eck admits in his lecture that his technique of farming is still a pilot project, and that he is not advocating for all farmers to turn their fields into forests. Scientists have raised questions about other alternative farming methods in the past. Many argue, for example, that some organic fertilisers and pesticides, though natural, can be harmful to the environment. Plus, lower yields on organic farms could mean having to use more land \u2013 which could lead to further deforestation. Disrupting food supply chains runs huge socio-economic risks, threatening millions of livelihoods around the world. In February, thousands of farmers in angry tractor convoys protested at The Hague, where parliament sits, fearing that debates about the environmental impact of Dutch agriculture could wipe out their businesses. On the apple orchard, the students agree that their experiments are only a starting point for the questions facing humanity. \u201cI am still figuring out what I think the ideal path is,\u201d said one, as I was leaving. \u201cOne thing is clear. The system we have now is not going to feed the planet without completely destroying the Earth.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2020.

Yes, 2020 is a leap year, which means we all get an extra day, and this year, for the first time in almost 30 years, 29 February falls on a Saturday. People born on 29 February will be able to celebrate their birthdays on the right day for the first time in four years. Being a \u201cleaper\u201d or \u201cleapling\u201d makes some feel special, but others are peeved about logistical pitfalls such as with driving licences or passports expiring on days that don\u2019t exist. We asked Guardian readers to tell us what they plan to do with the first Saturday leap day since 1992, when John Major was prime minister, Nirvana were in the charts and Donald Trump was just an unremarkable real estate scion with a penchant for parties attended by Jeffrey Epstein. A decent proposal An Irish tradition encourages women to propose on a leap day, and some make use of this opportunity. \u201cI\u2019m planning on proposing to my boyfriend,\u201d said Claire*. \u201cThis comes from a longstanding joke that whoever proposes first takes the other\u2019s surname. The ring has now been engraved with the date, so there\u2019s no turning back, and I don\u2019t think he thinks I would ever seriously go through with it.\u201d Ellie*, 53, said: \u201cI\u2019m proposing to my man, but as we are not jewellery types I put together a two-day trip to Edinburgh this summer as his \u2018engagement ring\u2019. We\u2019ve been together since 2009. On the 29th I\u2019ll get down on one knee and present a \u2018Clash of the Titans\u2019 card which I\u2019ve had printed with an itinerary for our trip.\u201d Leaper birthday bonanzas Many a missed birthday will be made up for on 29 February as leaplings celebrate a milestone they get to hit only once every four years. A positive side-effect of leaperdom is the slower ageing: it\u2019s common for leapers to insist their age changes only in a leap year. Amie, 35, from Norwich, said: \u201cI\u2019m going to be nine, the same as my daughter this year.\u201d Lucy Armfield, 42, from Southwick, West Sussex, will be throwing her son a party. \u201cArthur is turning eight \u2013 his second \u2018proper\u2019 birthday \u2013 so we are surprising him by taking him and his brother to see the School of Rock musical. We decided when he was born we would always have extra celebrations on a leap birthday. On the other years we talk about his birthday \u2018hiding, being secret and special\u2019. I think it makes him feel special.\u201d Bethan West, 39, from Fife, is adamant she will celebrate her 10th birthday rather than her 40th come Leap Day. \u201cThis is my big birthday as I will be turning 10 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cI have always had fantastic age-appropriate birthdays \u2013 my last was the ninth, which, had I not been born on a leap day, would have been in 1989, so my party was Little Mermaid- and Baywatch-themed.\u201d As she awaits the jubilee party extravaganza organised by her family, she bemoans the difference in treatment for leapers in Britain and the US. \u201cIn the US leapers get treated fantastically with free food, drinks and discounts in hotels and attractions,\u201d Bethan said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a UK leaper mission to be recognised properly, which we still haven\u2019t achieved.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re divorced now\u2019 Alas, leap days do not always end happily ever after. \u201cI\u2019m a leapling,\u201d Rachel* told us. \u201cEvery leap year day is special for me, however there was a disastrous one. Eight years ago my then husband woke me with a cuppa and lots of little parcels of party poppers, squirt string, party hats and flags. Oh how wonderful, I thought, there\u2019s going to be a surprise party. I waited all day, excited. \u201cBut no, these were my presents. I\u2019ve never felt so deflated. He thought they were celebratory \u2013 well, not without other people they\u2019re not. He just didn\u2019t get why I was pissed off. We\u2019re divorced now.\u201d Leaping into action For some, the bonus day is a chance to take some purposeful action. Caroline Hanks, 59, from Herefordshire, has decided to roll up her sleeves on the day she normally wouldn\u2019t have. \u201cWe are spending Leap Day 2020 finding out about how to manage grassland and livestock as part of the solution to the climate emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about healthy soils and the role of herb-rich grassland, wildflower meadows and livestock in regenerating healthy ecosystems in our wider landscape. \u201cWe are also discussing how to make sure we only plant the right trees in the right places to avoid damaging existing wildlife habitats and considering if natural regeneration of woodland has a role, too. Twenty-four hours won\u2019t be long enough, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d John Dunn, 62, retired and living in Bath, will join hundreds of thousands of runners and walkers at parkruns worldwide for the first opportunity to run the event on a leap day. \u201cAt my age it will be my first and last opportunity to do so. I will be running at the Bath Skyline parkrun.\u201d For Nelli Gronroos Steer, 35, a social media specialist from London, and her husband, Leap Day 2020 will mark the start of a new life. \u201cWe\u2019re moving out of the UK on Leap Day. We\u2019re leaping away, in sustainable fashion: we are taking ferries and trains all the way to Helsinki, Finland, where we\u2019ve decided to move to, mainly because of Brexit.\u201d Leap-a-versaries Ben Matthews, 48, from Swansea, will have his first \u201cproper\u201d wedding anniversary on Leap Day 2020. \u201cWe will be spending the day in north Wales riding the fastest zipline in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFor our anniversaries in the in-between years, rather than \u2018getting away with not celebrating\u2019, which many male friends congratulated me on, we decided that we\u2019d celebrate our anniversary whenever we wanted on the gap years and commit to making the official anniversaries special.\u201d Jane*, 64, from California, is celebrating her seventh \u2013 or 28th \u2013 wedding anniversary. \u201cWe got married on 29 February 1992. There were six other weddings that day, and we all had cheesecake wedding cakes.\u201d *(Some names have been changed.)", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Coventry drivers could get \u00a33,000 transport vouchers for ditching cars", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/coventry-drivers-could-get-3000-transport-vouchers-for-ditching-cars", "date": "2020-02-27", "transcript": "Drivers in Coventry could be paid up to \u00a33,000 a year in transport vouchers to ditch their cars under a UK-first scheme. The Transport for the West Midlands (TfWM) pilot project is designed to ease traffic congestion and improve air quality in the city. Those who scrap their cars will receive between \u00a31,500 and \u00a33,000 worth of mobility credits to spend using a smartphone app or Swift travel card, on public transport, taxis, bike shares or a car club. The offer is part of the West Midlands Combined Authority \u00a31m scheme which will be trialled in Coventry next year, and could be rolled out across the region if successful. Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor, said: \u201cInstead of asking people to trade in their old car for a new one, we are offering them credits to try something new \u2013 such as join a car-share scheme or take the bus or train. \u201cNot only will people be saving money on the cost of running and maintaining their cars, but they will also help the region ease traffic congestion and improve air quality in the fight against climate change.\u201d The trial has been funded by a \u00a322m grant given to the region by the Department for Transport to develop and test new transport technology and schemes. Motorists who are willing to give up their cars will be able to apply for the trial scheme later in the year. Jim O\u2019Boyle, Coventry city council\u2019s cabinet member for jobs and regeneration, said: \u201cThis is a great idea which provides incentives to motorists. The key now is to work up the scheme in a way that benefits people who may be dependent on using a vehicle as part of their daily responsibilities.

The judge who liberates Nigerians forgotten in jail", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/26/set-them-free-judge-liberates-nigerians-jail", "date": "2020-02-26", "transcript": "In a crowded prison courtyard in Suleja, Nigeria, a judge flipped through a battered folder detailing the case against a young woman who stood quietly before him in a faded pink dress. She was charged with \u201cissuing a dud cheque\u201d, a crime that carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. But she\u2019d already spent three years in prison awaiting the outcome of her trial. The judge, Justice Ishaq Usman Bello, sat at a long table surrounded by fellow judges and prison officials. From an awning hung a framed poster of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Last Supper and a broken clock. Inmates crowded in the cellblocks either side of the courtyard to watch the proceedings, their arms hanging through the bars. After several minutes of hushed discussion at the high table, Justice Bello leaned toward the microphone and spoke. \u201cIn light of the duration of detention exceeding the maximum penalty for the alleged crime, I hereby discharge you from this prison. You are free to go.\u201d The woman, who\u2019d been stoical before the pronouncement, collapsed to the ground and began to sob. She thanked God and the judge in equal measure, and the inmates watching from their cells erupted into cheers. By the end of the day, 13 other inmates had been released. Four had been in prison on remand longer than the maximum sentence for their alleged crime. The others had been imprisoned for failing to pay tiny fines for minor offences. They were just the latest beneficiaries of a mission to deal with Kafkaesque failures in Nigeria\u2019s justice system. In 2016, Justice Bello began visiting prisons in his own jurisdiction, and the following year a presidential committee on prison reform and decongestion was established, which is led by Justice Bello and funded by the federal attorney general. The judge has visited 36 prisons and ordered the release of 3,822 inmates \u2013 about 5% of the Nigerian prison population. \u201cIt is part of my statutory responsibilities as chief judge to visit the prisons and address some challenges,\u201d Justice Bello said. \u201cOne of them is congestion, others are when [defendants] stay in prison without going to court. There are many lapses that need to be addressed, so it has been my tradition as head of court to do that.\u201d Spending longer awaiting trial than the maximum sentence for the crime violates the most basic legal protections guaranteed to Nigerian citizens, not to mention one of the few principles of international law that can be considered truly universal \u2013 habeas corpus. Chukwudi, whose second name is being withheld because his trial is ongoing, spent nearly five years incarcerated before being released on bail in 2016. In 2012, Chukwudi was driving from the capital city, Abuja, to visit his family in south-eastern Nigeria when he was pulled over by officers from the Special Armed Robbery Squad (Sars). He was arrested and accused, though not formally charged, with purchasing a stolen vehicle. He denies the allegation. Chukwudi was taken to Sars headquarters in Abuja. It was almost a year before he was brought before a court to be formally charged. The first time he appears on official records is 5 March 2014, when he was sent to a medium security prison near the capital to wait for his trial. \u201cI was happy when I was brought to court because the pain of Sars is too much\u201d, he told me. \u201cIn Sars, you are relieved only by the mercies of God. I saw people die. It was survival of the fittest.\u201d Neither Chukwudi nor his family could recall the precise date he was arrested. Sars did not respond to requests for comment. Chukwudi hoped that once he was finally brought to court, his ordeal would soon be over. \u201cBut it happens not to be like that,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou discover that a whole lot of systems are involved.\u201d Like tens of thousands of Nigerians, Chukwudi was denied bail because he was unable to provide a guarantor. Despite Nigerians\u2019 constitutional right to bail, many judges fear defendants may disappear if released, and believe that \u201cremanding\u201d defendants in prison serves the greater cause of justice. Countless visits to court resulted in Chukwudi\u2019s case being adjourned, sometimes before it had even begun, forcing him back to prison while he waited for a new date. \u201cMost times you feel like crying,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cYou know you are returning to where you are coming from. Every time you go to court you must have prayed a lot, and every prayer is backed up with hope. You will tell your people: \u2018Today I am leaving.\u2019 Only for you to go to court to find the judge didn\u2019t sit. Only for you to go to court and they brought you too late, the court has finished sitting. Only for you to go to court and find that your prosecution council is not there. So the aim of going to court is wasted, and they have their cases adjourned for another day.\u201d By the time he was finally granted bail in November 2016, Chukwudi\u2019s father was dead, his job and home lost, and friends and family distanced from him. \u201cNormally if you come out of prison it should feel good. One experiences another freedom. But in Nigeria that is where another problem starts for you,\u201d Chukwudi said. \u201cAnybody who comes to know that you have been in prison doesn\u2019t want to relate with you. Even your own family members. The way they are seeing it, the name of the family has been put to shame because you went to prison. When I came out, I learned that nobody wanted to see me.\u201d These days he is the pastor of a church known as the Transformation Ministry that supports former inmates returning to civilian life. Eight ex-prisoners are currently benefiting from free basic accommodation. \u201cI just fixed two with laundry jobs, and am working on computer training for the others,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of giving back.\u201d Remand inmates make up about 69% of Nigeria\u2019s prison population. While this is not high compared to many western countries, the length of time they spend awaiting trial is. In prisons where this data is available, most defendants have been on remand for between one and four years, some for more than a decade. \u201cIn Rivers State, 14 people were awaiting trial for 15 years. Not one day were they taken to court,\u201d Justice Bello told the Guardian, shaking his head. \u201cWe had to release them.\u201d Because there is no systematic way to monitor cases, defendants may simply be forgotten in prison. Data collected by the legal aid organisation, Network of University Legal Aid Institutions, shows that there are more than 160 cases where defendants have not been assigned a date for their next trial. \u201cSome of them last attended court in 2017,\u201d the network\u2019s Charissa Kabir told me. Another factor that exacerbates crowding is the practice of imprisoning convicts unable to pay small fines for minor offences. Research by Prawa, a Nigerian security, justice and development NGO, found that up to 80% of inmates were living on less than $130 per month prior to arrest. Income lost during remand combined with legal expenses often leave convicts deep in debt and unable to pay, meaning many serve between six and 12 months in prison instead. Up to 90% of inmates the presidential committee has released fall into this category. \u201cFines are paid by the government, and sometimes Nigerian NGOs\u201d, said the committee secretary, Leticia Ayoola-Daniels. Numerous cases reflect extreme poverty. \u201cWe found a scenario where a pregnant woman was said to have stolen cassava, and she was there awaiting trial for almost four years,\u201d said Justice Bello. \u201cIt\u2019s lamentable.\u201d Shortly after arriving in prison, the woman miscarried. He worries about the damage prisons inflicted on defendants behind bars. \u201cTo be in prison is a very dangerous thing. Some of them have attained some level of mental deterioration because of the horrendous nature of the environment they live in,\u201d he said. The judge seems to be trying to activate the justice system by shaking its conscience rather than by devising a new judgment \u2013 the usual tactic for activist judges. He invites officials who have unresolved cases to prison to face defendants, and account for what went wrong. By admonishing lax lawyers and judges he turns turns lapses which previously went unnoticed into a source of personal and professional shame. \u201cThe visits do try to restore fairness, in the sense that they acknowledge that lapses in the administration of justice have resulted in the loss of freedom,\u201d said Melissa Omene, a lawyer who has worked across government and civil society justice reform efforts. \u201cAddressing a practitioner\u2019s failure to carry out his duty requires more than simply calling on him to do so. Did he fail to act due to a lack of interest or resources? Did he fail to act for political reasons, or fear? Each of these will require a different reform strategy.\u201d Justice officials need to be able to see into their own systems in order to detect and manage problems. To do that, they need better data. A quieter but potentially transformative piece of the committee\u2019s work is the rollout of a federal prison (now corrections) information management system (Cims) as part of its wider efforts to establish a national criminal justice database. Cims has been partially implementing in 16 states, but only one prison is making full use of the platform. It features an early warning system that alerts the attorney general if an inmate stays on remand beyond 90 days, and allows officials to identify and hold to account officials and departments that cause unreasonable delays. If well managed, Cims could regulate some of the chaos that currently governs the lives of inmates. At the very least, digital records will make it harder for them to officially disappear. But it\u2019s is only part of the solution. If not backed by political clout and people able to use the data, Cims risks remaining a technical solution to a political problem. Nigeria\u2019s justice system has been the subject of numerous reform efforts over the past two decades. Committees have been formed, new laws passed, presidents come and go, and people like Chukwudi continue to lose years of their lives to a system that cannot or fails to detect those who fall through its cracks. Despite Chukwudi\u2019s ordeal and everything he\u2019s lost, when he compares himself with other former inmates, he still considers himself one of the lucky ones. Every Sunday morning his congregation files into the little church he has coaxed to life. The room fills with people, music and choruses of prayer, and it makes him feel a part of something holy.

Living to 100 will soon become a routine fact of (long) life. Life expectancies have been rising by up to three months a year since 1840 and although gains in the UK began to slow in 2011, it is still estimated that more than half the babies born in wealthier countries since 2000 may reach their 100th birthdays. It is an impressive increase: in the early 1900s, the probability of a baby reaching 100 was 1%. A newborn in the UK today has a 50% chance of living to 105. There were 3,600 centenarians in 1986. Today there are some 15,000. You do not have to be a newborn to benefit from this trend of increased longevity, though. A 60-year-old in the west today has an even chance of living to 90 and a 40-year-old can expect to live to 95. But the longevity boost is not done yet: it is generally agreed that the natural ceiling to human life is somewhere around 115. Others say that even without cutting-edge AI or other technological wizardry, we could live far longer. Opinion broadly divides into three groups: the \u201clevellers\u201d who say we are at peak lifespan now. The \u201cextrapolators\u201d who argue that technology and education have made their biggest leaps but can squeak us up to a ceiling of 120 before levelling off for good. And the \u201caccelerators\u201d \u2013 those determined to defeat ageing, who believe we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in scientific and technological research that will increase longevity, pushing us into the realms of immortality. Why are we living so much longer? Life expectancy has been increasing since we cracked infant mortality in the 19th century. Economy, technology, healthcare and education have all combined with vaccines, safer childbirth and medical advances in the care of stroke and heart attack patients to keep the relentless pace of increasing longevity going strong. But the growth in life expectancy began to slow in 2011 in the UK and people live longer in more than two dozen other countries. There has not been a big medical or health gamechanger in the past couple of decades. While some argue that we should celebrate the longest lifespans that humans have ever attained, others warn that illness and infirmity risk turning long lives into slow, miserable declines. How to avoid this? How can I stay healthy for longer? In his essay on ageing, De Senectute, Cicero says there are four reasons why people write off old age: it stops you working, it makes your body weak, it denies you pleasure and every day is one step closer to death. Then he shows why each argument is wrong. \u201cThe old retain their wits quite well,\u201d he notes, \u201cso long as they exercise them\u201d. Dan Buettner coined the term \u201cblue zones\u201d for five regions he identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others (they are Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica, Loma Linda in California and Ikaria in Greece). The diets of those living in these regions, he discovered, consist almost entirely of minimally processed plant-based foods \u2013 mostly wholegrains, greens, nuts, tubers and beans. Meat is eaten, on average, five times a month. They drink mostly water, herbal teas, coffee and some wine. They drink little or no cow\u2019s milk. Other scientists have added different ideas to the mix. Sufficient sleep and a sense of purpose are important but exercise is key \u2013 at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week, plus twice-weekly muscle-strengthening sessions, to reap health and longevity benefits. Having said that, short bouts of light physical activity, such as walking and cleaning, have been shown to increase the lifespans of older people. And a study published last January found that simply moving instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day could reduce the risk of early death by 17%. Some research suggests that club sports such as tennis and soccer are best for longevity because they also encourage social interaction, another vital ingredient to longevity. What other ideas are there for prolonging healthy life? At conferences on longevity, it is immediately obvious during the morning breaks that the buffets remain largely untouched \u2013 and that everyone drinks their tea and coffee inky black, disdaining even a drop of milk. Most serious seekers of longevity also practice both calorific fasting and intermittent fasting. In a nutshell, the approach is to eat 30% fewer calories and fast for 16 hours a day, though this may not be appropriate for certain vulnerable groups. In essence, it means skipping breakfast and not making up for the missed meal during the day. No one knows quite why intermittent fasting works. The best guess is that it has something to do with metabolic switching and cellular stress resistance causing the body to increase production of antioxidants. Repeated studies on mice going back a century seem to prove that it works \u2013 on rodents, at least. Last December, the New England Journal of Medicine reviewed all the studies in this area and concluded that a combination of fasting and calorific reduction does slow ageing, extend lifespan and counteract age-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and stroke. \u201cAnimal models show that intermittent fasting improves health throughout the lifespan,\u201d the paper concluded. The problem with gauging its efficacy on humans is that, as the paper said: \u201cIt remains to be determined whether people can maintain intermittent fasting for years and potentially accrue the benefits seen in animal models.\u201d Are there any anti-ageing drugs in the pipeline? US scientists are raising funds to launch a five-year clinical trial of a product called metformin, commonly prescribed for pre-diabetics and diabetics. Longevity advocates believe it may have a side effect slowing the development of age-related diseases. \u201cI\u2019m not telling everyone to go out and take it until our clinical trial proves it does what I believe it does,\u201d said Dr Nir Barzilai, the director of the Institute for Ageing at New York\u2019s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cBut if our trials come back with the results I expect then, yes, I believe everyone should take this drug.\u201d Even more niche are the the promises of Dr Aubrey de Gray, a gerontologist who founded the Sens (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) Research Foundation with the goal of \u201cundoing ageing\u201d. \u201cSens is defined by a focus on repairing molecular and cellular damage rather than on merely slowing down its accumulation,\u201d he said. The logistics of indefinitely healthy ageing will, he believes, be simple and affordable: \u201cMostly it\u2019ll be injections once a decade.\u201d Can I tell how long I\u2019m going to live? The latest epigenetic clock, DNAm PhenoAge, will shortly hit the shelves. Epigenetic clocks \u2013 a form of molecular augury \u2013 were first developed in 2011 and claim to offer a glimpse into the future. By analysing the pattern of chemical chains that attach to the DNA in your cells, these clocks apparently reveal how swiftly you are ageing \u2013 and perhaps even how much longer you will live. The big sell with these tests is that while DNA is fixed at birth, our epigenetic patterns change according to our lifestyles. The promise of those who produce these clocks for commercial use is that they enable us to calibrate our ageing. The tests haven\u2019t been independently evaluated and do not need to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration but that has not stopped some life insurance companies using the tests to predict lifespans. Researchers have jumped on board, too, using the clocks to test anti-ageing drugs and to look for an anti-ageing diet. Can I live for ever? Talk of immortality was \u201coutlaw science\u201d until a couple of decades ago but now it is attracting serious interest and big bucks: in 2013, Google invested $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) in an entire division, Calico, which is devoted to \u201csolving death\u201d. The PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has given millions of dollars to De Grey\u2019s foundation. Instead of focusing on why, say, we get cancer or have a stroke and how to treat each distinct condition, this branch of medical research argues for all these conditions to be regarded as symptoms of one far larger and deadly disease: ageing itself. Instead of trying to treat all these different diseases that develop as people age, the argument goes, we should be trying to treat that one big disease. If we can do that, all the so-called age-related conditions that currently harm so many and cost so much will be \u2013 by definition \u2013 eradicated. No one is saying it is going to be easy. This branch of research attempts to tackle ageing inside every cell of the body. In other words, change the whole genetic makeup of the human species. There are plenty of claims that we can already slow down the ageing of cells \u2013 or senescence \u2013 but the most radical adherents claim that the first person to live to 1,000 has already been born.

In a hard-hitting report due to be submitted to the G20 group of leading developed and developing countries, experts said that issues including the climate emergency and mental health meant judging progress required a different yardstick of success. Against a backdrop of heightened political unrest in several major western nations despite continued growth in economic prosperity, Dennis Snower, president of the Global Solutions Initiative, a thinktank with links to the group of rich nations, said they should adopt a \u201crecoupling dashboard\u201d to assess wellbeing and environment alongside GDP. The report, shared exclusively with the Guardian, Die Zeit and Der Tagesspiegel, said there was an urgent need for all nations to use the dashboard to dramatically increase their focus on social prosperity, as a key tool in the fightback against growing political extremism across advanced economies. In an interview with the Guardian to mark the launch of the report, Snower said: \u201cThe financial crisis of 2008 made all these issues much more salient. Lots of people are now saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry but this system sucks\u2019. \u201cIn addition to being materially prosperous, we need empowerment and agency \u2013 that is the ability to shape our destiny through our own efforts \u2013 and we need solidarity \u2013 that is we need to be embedded within our social circles.\u201d In a proposal floated ahead of the G20 summit in Saudi Arabia later this year, the dashboard would include four separate measurements of economic and social prosperity: GDP per capita and environmental performance, as well as two new indexes assessing the \u201csolidarity\u201d and \u201cempowerment\u201d of citizens. All four dimensions would need to be in harmony to show a country was adequately serving the needs of its citizens, according to the proposals drawn up by Snower and Katharina Lima de Miranda, an academic at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The empowerment and solidarity indexes are drawn from existing major surveys of wellbeing compiled by the UN, World Bank and OECD, including assessments of job security, education levels, life expectancy, charitable activity, trust in strangers and confidence in government. Under the new dashboard, New Zealand, Finland and Iceland are among the most progressive nations on earth, while the US dramatically underperforms its level of GDP per head. India, China and Mexico rank among the worst performers on the dashboard of 35 nations. The report said that, over the past decade, the dashboard shows the empowerment of citizens and GDP levels in the UK have increased yet social solidarity has fallen, suggesting that the country has become more \u201cneoliberal\u201d. Although the plan could face resistance from some G20 nations and there is no guarantee the dashboard will ultimately be adopted, Snower said the proposal was the first stage in a drive to get countries to look beyond GDP as a signal of success. In the last four decades, globalisation and technological advances have generated significant growth in GDP, but have been accompanied by rising inequality, global heating and a sense of disempowerment among various groups. Several countries around the world are staging attempts to move beyond GDP and focus instead on the wellbeing of citizens. Last year, New Zealand\u2019s Labour coalition government unveiled what it said was a \u201cworld-first\u201d wellbeing budget, raising its spending on mental health services and tackling child poverty. Snower said that had nations monitored the wellbeing of citizens as much as GDP they would have had earlier warning signs about the fragmentation of society and rise of populist politics. He added: \u201cGlobalisation has costs that we\u2019ve been blind to, and solidarity and empowerment have suffered.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "River insects and lichens bucking trend of wildlife losses", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/river-insects-and-lichens-bucking-trend-of-wildlife-losses", "date": "2020-02-17", "transcript": "Freshwater insects, mosses and lichens are bucking the trend of wildlife losses in the UK and have expanded their ranges since 1970, according to a new study. Reductions in air and water pollution are the most likely reason. Scientists say their new analysis shows that amid big declines in wildlife, action can help to reverse the trend for some species. The work analysed millions of sightings of 5,000 different invertebrate species by volunteers over 45 years. The research also found that the average range of insects had increased over that time. This finding does not conflict with other reports of serious declines in insect populations, the scientists said. The new analysis considered only whether a species was present or absent from a site, while the other studies measured falls in abundance and, for example, a population could fall by 90% and still occupy the same range. The scientists also said much wildlife had already been lost by 1970, which means that date is a low baseline. The pressures on invertebrate life, as well as better studied mammals and birds, include destruction of natural habitats, pollution and pesticides and, increasingly, the impacts of the climate crisis. \u201cBy looking at long-term trends in the distribution of understudied species, we found evidence of concerning declines but we also found that it\u2019s not all bad news,\u201d said Charlie Outhwaite at University College London, who led the new research. The areas in which freshwater insects, such as mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies, were found plunged by 47% from 1970 to 1994, but have expanded strongly since and were 7% higher in 2015 than 50 years ago. \u201cThat coincides with the implementation of the [EU] urban wastewater treatment directive\u201d, which significantly cleaned up rivers, Outhwaite said. Mosses and lichens have expanded their average range by 36% since 1970, the study found. \u201cMosses and lichens are very sensitive to air quality and it seems like they have been improving\u201d since the Clean Air Act in 1956, she said. The 3,000 species of terrestrial insects analysed experienced a slight increase of 5% in their range since 1970. But Outhwaite said: \u201cWe just looked at range and not the number of individuals. So it\u2019s very possible that there are still huge declines happening in terms of the number of individuals.\u201d \u201cWe just don\u2019t have abundance data for [most invertebrate species], especially at a national scale,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to do the best we can by looking at their range size. But it\u2019s really important we don\u2019t over-interpret it and think everything\u2019s fine.\u201d The new work, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, also shows that the ranges of many insect groups in the UK have declined since the mid-2000s. Other research has shown big falls in insect populations since that time, which was when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced. \u201cThe trends in bees seen in this new study mirror the bee trends found in our 2019 research,\u201d said Gary Powney, at the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, which was not part of the latest work. \u201cThe rapid and substantial decline in these pollinators in the late 2000s is a major cause for concern.\u201d Other groups losing range in the new analysis included spiders and freshwater snails and mussels. The molluscs did not recover after 1994, Outhwaite said, \u201cso something else is driving that change, potentially invasive species\u201d. But fungus gnats and weevils showed strong expansion of their ranges. Determining the exact causes of changes is difficult, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s challenging because you have multiple threats happening at the same time.\u201d Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new study, said data collected by volunteer recorders had to be treated carefully. \u201cRecorder effort has greatly increased in recent years, along with the publication of new identification books, online guides, recording apps and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously the more you look, and the more experienced the recorder, the more you will find. The modelling purports to take this into account, but I do not see how.\u201d The relationship between the range and abundance of species is not clear, Goulson said, although they would be expected to track one another. But the new work suggests range could expand for some species while their abundance falls. \u201cAll in all, it\u2019s very puzzling,\u201d he said. \u201cThis kind of data is very messy in terms of biases, like sampling effort over time,\u201d said Outhwaite. \u201cBut the models are designed to try to take those into account, so they don\u2019t influence our trends.\u201d She also paid tribute to the volunteer recorders. \u201cOur study demonstrates the power of citizen science, as anyone can contribute to impactful research. There are over 80 recording schemes in the UK now, so there is definitely something for you if you are interested.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The milkman gets an eco-makover as refill service knocks on door", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/15/the-milkman-gets-an-eco-makover-as-refill-service-knocks-on-door", "date": "2020-02-15", "transcript": "The home delivery model pioneered by milkmen is getting a 21st century makeover as part of the war on plastic. A major new online service backed by the world\u2019s biggest brands will deliver products ranging from soft drinks to washing powder and shampoo in refillable containers to your front door. The Loop, which launches next month, is one of the most ambitious attempts yet to eliminate plastic waste from the weekly shop. It is backed by major consumer goods companies Unilever and PepsiCo, who have created eco-versions of popular brands including Tropicana, Persil and Hellmann\u2019s, to sell via the website. The service will also include products such as refillable Sure and Dove deodorant sticks, and pots of Signal toothpaste pellets, which do away with the need for plastic tubes. The delivery service, which bills itself as the \u201cmilkman reimagined\u201d aims to change the way households shop and consume amid growing concern about the global plastic binge. At first shoppers will only be able to buy from the Loop website but a partnership with Tesco aims to put dedicated aisles in its stores later this year. It operates in the same way as other online supermarkets except, when the shopping arrives, the groceries are in durable metal, glass or plastic containers that can be returned and reused. Afterwards the empties, like milk bottles, are collected from the doorstep, cleaned and reused up to 100 times. Supermarkets have already begun to gauge whether shoppers are willing to put in the extra effort required to make refill schemes economical in their stores. Last year Waitrose created dedicated areas in a handful of supermarkets where customers can replenish products ranging from wine and beer to rice and cleaning materials. Sainsbury\u2019s is to sell milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles this year as part of its plastic reduction drive. Tesco is eager to shrink its massive plastic footprint and has announced a series of initiatives \u2013 including the recent decision to banish shrink-wrapped multipacks of baked beans and soup from its shelves. Giles Bolton, its responsible sourcing director, thinks re-use schemes could have a big impact. \u201cLoop has the potential to fundamentally change the shopping basket and how customers shop,\u201d he said in a recent blog. There are also signs, spurred on by television programmes such as Blue Planet which exposed the detrimental effect plastic is having on the oceans, that people are trying to live more sustainably. Milk &amp; More, the UK\u2019s biggest doorstep delivery company, said that last year 70,000 new customers signed up to have their milk delivered in reusable glass bottles. Similarly this week Abel &amp; Cole, the organic box delivery firm, said it was rolling out a \u201cclub zero\u201d refill scheme, in which store cupboard foods such as lentils and porridge oats are delivered in reusable plastic pots alongside its vegetables and fruit. It said it had been inundated with requests from shoppers to take part in a small trial. Hannah Shipton, its managing director, said: \u201cClub Zero helps anyone looking to cut down on single-use packaging, particularly those without the ability to get to a zero-waste refill shop or those not wanting to jump in the car to get to one.\u201d Services such as the Loop are piggybacking on the growth of online food shopping in UK, where sales are expected to increase by 45% between now and 2024 to create a \u00a316.7bn market, according to IGD, the grocery industry trade body. The online model obviously means people do not need to return their old containers to the supermarket, but Loop customers are required to pay refundable deposits linked to the size of each container. In France, where the Loop service has already started with the Carrefour supermarket chain, the fee starts at \u20ac0.01 but rises to \u20ac19 for large plastic tubs containing a bundle of nappies, wipes and sanitary towels. The pricing and full details of the Loop\u2019s UK service will not be announced until nearer its 26 March launch date. The product range will be similar to France \u2013 where it launched last year with around 200 products \u2013 and prices are promised to be \u201ccompetitive\u201d. Mike Barry, a sustainability expert who spent 14 years at Marks &amp; Spencer latterly as head of its ethical scheme Plan A, is hopeful refill schemes such as the Loop will succeed but says the sheer volume of consumption on the planet presented a huge challenge. Plastic packaging is a \u00a3540bn industry and demand is still rising, particularly in Asia. \u201cThe new sustainable future has to cope with 7.7 billion people who are consuming trillions of items a year,\u201d Barry explained. \u201cLoop is an exciting alternative to today\u2019s approach to consumption but the big question is can it be scaled quick enough to stop the ocean pollution crisis?\u201d Barry said reuse systems like the Loop represented the \u201cgold standard\u201d but there was also an urgent need to reduce the overall plastic usage, for fewer types of plastic be used (so waste can be recycled more easily) and for low recycling rates to improve.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Durham's pioneering police scheme slashes reoffending rates", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/14/durham-pioneering-police-scheme-slashes-reoffending-rates-rehabilitation-programme", "date": "2020-02-14", "transcript": "Reoffending rates have been slashed in a pioneering police scheme in north-east England which experts say could lead to a transformation in how the justice system deals with violent crime. More than 2,660 offenders who have committed offences such as burglary and assault have taken part in an experiment in which they avoid prosecution if they take part in a rehabilitation programme for issues such as mental health and substance abuse. If they complete the four-month contract with police, they walk away without a criminal conviction. If they do not, they are prosecuted in the traditional way. The initiative by Durham constabulary is the longest-running and most advanced of its kind in England, with at least five other forces, including Surrey and Devon &amp; Cornwall, considering the introduction of similar schemes. The first results of the trial, seen by the Guardian, found a 15-percentage point drop in reoffending after two years among those who took part in rehabilitation compared with those who did not. Most of the 519 offenders in the first cohort of the trial had been arrested for violence, theft, drug possession or criminal damage. About half had no previous convictions but others had been arrested as many as 52 times. The results, which are part of a University of Cambridge study to be published in 2022, are the most significant indication to date of the long-term success of \u201cdeferred prosecution\u201d programmes in England. The findings will reopen the debate about whether such initiatives represent \u201csoft justice\u201d, as some critics claim, or are successful in reducing crime and cutting costs. The idea has gained traction with senior police leaders and is to be discussed by the National Police Chiefs Council later this month. Jo Farrell, the chief constable of Durham constabulary, said the current criminal justice sanctions were not effective for dealing with low-level offences such as shoplifting, assault or drug possession. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not saying is where people commit serious offences, they won\u2019t feel the full force of the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about trying to do things on the cheap or divert people away from court or prison. It\u2019s a cohort of people for whom this cycle will never end unless we do something different.\u201d Under the Durham programme, called Checkpoint, offenders spend four months with a police supervisor who helps them access support for issues including mental health, to drug or alcohol use, homelessness and communication skills. Of the 2,660 offenders involved in the trial to date, only 166 (6%) have reoffended. The initiative also involves the victim of the crime, consulting them on the progress of the offender\u2019s rehabilitation, although they do not get the final say on whether the offender is prosecuted. Durham police said only five victims had complained out of the 2,660 offenders who had completed the programme. Checkpoint costs the force \u00a3480,000 a year but an internal estimate suggests that for every 1,000 offenders it saves at least \u00a32m a year in reduced crime. A similar trial in the West Midlands, which ended in 2014, tracked 414 offenders over two years and found that the amount and severity of reoffending by those on deferred prosecutions was lower, or no worse, than those who were prosecuted. That study, by criminologists at Cambridge, has not yet been published. Prof Lawrence Sherman of the university\u2019s Institute of Criminology said there was mounting evidence against the prosecution of low-level offences such as theft or common assault. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive, it rarely results in a formal punishment, victims aren\u2019t satisfied with it. It\u2019s generally a pretty bad way to manage low-level offences which are the highest volume offences,\u201d he said. Sophie Gregory, criminology course director at Birmingham City University, described the Durham findings as significant and said: \u201cWe know that around two-thirds of women and a third of men are reportedly committing crime to fund addictions, so if we can go back to that root problem and help with some tailored support long term it has got to help reduce reoffending.\u201d The debate about rehabilitation was reignited by the terrorist attacks in London Bridge in November and Streatham this month, both carried out by men who had been recently released after prison sentences for terrorism offences. Boris Johnson also made \u201claw and order\u201d a key part of his 2019 election campaign, promising among other things to prosecute within a week anyone caught with a knife. But Farrell said such a blanket approach may not always be appropriate. \u201cWithin all offences, there\u2019s context. You get bold statements by politicians: \u2018Everybody who carries a knife must go to prison.\u2019 Policing is based on discretion \u2013 we have a lot of discretion and a lot of autonomy,\u201d she said. \u201cContext is everything and the situation you\u2019re dealing with and their background. Taking a very binary position on things strikes me as a not very intelligent way of dealing with an issue.\u201d Alex Mayes of the charity Victim Support said the one wish of those affected by crime was for the offender to stop offending. He added: \u201cWhere evidence shows offender management schemes to be effective at reducing reoffending, many victims of low-level offences may be open to credible and safe programmes. \u201cHowever, just as in the wider public, justice means different things to different victims of crime. For this reason, where these schemes are used, it is vital that all victims receive explanations as to their use, and that victims\u2019 ongoing feedback is sought in order to inform the process.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Wildfires are ruinous - so how to stop them happening in the first place?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/fighting-fire-australia-wildfires-limiting-impact-aoe", "date": "2020-02-12", "transcript": "Vast waves of fire have torn through Australia in recent months, leaving forests of skinned trees in their wake. The wildfires have been one of the most damaging in the country\u2019s history \u2013 more than 11m hectares (27m acres) have burned, killing 33 people and decimating wildlife populations. But they are just the latest in a succession of destructive blazes that have been flaring across the planet \u2013 even in the Arctic circle \u2013 in the past five years. The response from authorities, in Australia, the Americas and the Mediterranean often seems scrambled and ineffective. So what is to be done? Fire experts point to a host of techniques that can help prevent fires before they have even started. These range from deliberate off-season blazes designed to manage the landscape to using grazing animals to reduce flammable material, as well as requiring people to remove trees and brush that are too close to homes. Much of it draws on how our distant ancestors co-existed with forests and using agroforestry. Good fires The first thing to acknowledge is that firefighting doesn\u2019t work with mega fires and probably never will, says Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. He says pictures of air tankers are just \u201cgood PR\u201d for politicians. \u201cWe are almost fighting fires as we were 100 years ago except now we have bigger planes. All firefighters can do is protect the path of the fire and evacuate people. You have to wait for rain or wind to stop it.\u201d Rather than being a show of strength, firefighting should be seen as a last resort used only when preventive methods have failed, says Rein. Growing up in Spain, he was told that all fires were bad but after studying them he realised the importance of \u201cgood fires\u201d. \u201cIf we suppress all fires we are literally stopping life on Earth,\u201d Rein says. \u201cWildfires were created by nature and they have well-recognised benefits \u2013 fire regulates the carbon cycle and has shaped all ecosystems known to man except Antarctica. The number one thing we can do to stop megafires is to create a natural fire regime.\u201d Counterintuitively, this involves burning more fires, using a technique called prescribed burns \u2013 intentional off-season fires that burn up leaves and old wood and create breaks in the forest. Indigenous people know this and have been regenerating forests using fire-stick farming for thousands of years, but much of that knowledge has been lost now. Fires made out of season are often referred to as \u201ccold fires\u201d. They do not burn the canopy of trees, which means insects and other animals can take refuge without getting scorched. Many forests are reliant on fire to decompose dead wood and old leaves that otherwise lie on the forest floor. Some \u201cphoenix plants\u201d can only be regenerated by fire \u2013 sequoias, for instance, require fire to break open their cones so their seeds can spread. \u201cOur fire management techniques in California are probably similar to those in Canada, Australia and the Mediterranean,\u201d says Garrett Dickman, a biologist who has worked in forest management in Yosemite national park for 11 years. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple in that you only have a handful of management tools \u2013 you\u2019re either using fire, or you can use mechanical means. You can use livestock grazing too, which works pretty well in grass ecosystems.\u201d Fire management strategies vary in different countries \u2013 very generally, forests closer to the equator should have more wildfires and those farther away should have fewer. There are obvious exceptions such as the Amazon rainforest, which straddles the equator and should naturally have very few fires (tropical forests are normally too humid to sustain fires for long and their trees are not designed to withstand them). Many US fire-suppression policies were created following devastating wildfires in the summer of 1910 (the \u201cbig blowup\u201d) that ravaged large parts of Idaho, Montana and Washington. Forest rangers and ecologists understand the role of fires in shaping forests, but politicians have inherited this 100-year-old aversion to fire. There are signs this is slowly starting to change. In California the amount of land allocated for prescribed burns has doubled between 2013 and 2018. About 19,000 hectares are burnt each year, but experts say that number needs to be far higher. Concerns about smoke pollution and the liability associated if something goes wrong discourage landowners from preemptive action. Following a spate of fires in California between 2017 and 2019, there has been an effort to get rid of the barriers to prescribed burns, including removing liability for landowners and creating education programmes to help people understand their importance, though it is yet to be seen if these policies will be effective. Agroforestry Grazing animals help remove \u201cfuel\u201d from the forest floor and create natural breaks in woodland. Agroforestry systems \u2013 grazing animals and/or growing crops in forests \u2013 are part of cultural landscapes in Europe that are hundreds of years old. Having more people managing forests meant that small fires were less likely to get out of control. Because of lower population densities in North America and Australia, subsistence farming has had a less marked impact on forests. The slow decline of agroforestry was one of the factors that made the deadly 2017 wildfires in Portugal so destructive. Another issue is that ageing rural landowners \u2013 who often live next to forests \u2013 are not so active in clearing up brush from around their homes. The country also has large plantations of fast-growing (and flammable) eucalyptus trees grown to supply the country\u2019s significant paper pulp industry, which may have exacerbated the problem. However, small changes are starting to happen \u2013 authorities are seeking to reduce eucalyptus cultivation and plant more fire-resistant oak and chestnut trees. Rural properties are now required to clear undergrowth within 50 metres (164 feet) of houses. A four-year study looking at land use in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain found that grazing animals were effective at reducing wildfires. \u201cI get the impression that wildfires would still happen, but agroforestry is a way of minimising them,\u201d says Dr Paul Burgess, a reader in crop ecology and management at the Cranfield Soil and Agrifood Institute, who helped write the study published in Agroforestry Systems. But some are frustrated that these policies aren\u2019t being created faster. Greece, whose islands and coasts have been hit by increasingly ferocious fires, faced tough criticism of its firefighting system after Mati, a resort town east of Athens, was consumed by an inferno that left 103 dead in 2018. Following the tragedy, the European parliament called for tougher policies of prevention to be applied across the continent. \u201cThere were lessons to be drawn from Mati, but so far they have not been reflected in political action,\u201d said Elias Tziritis, a forest fire specialist at WWF Greece. \u201cThere has to be a lot more emphasis on forest management and prevention of fires, a lot more focus on thinking ahead and not what should happen when a fire actually occurs.\u201d People involved in EU land use policy are starting to recognise the importance of farming and forestry: agroecology and agroforestry have been identified as key sustainable agricultural practices in the European Green Deal, which commits at least 40% of the common agricultural policy budget to climate action. Burgess says: \u201cIn terms of agroforestry I think there\u2019s an increasing appetite for integrated land management. In the context of Brexit there are more opportunities for it, too, which will also improve biodiversity, carbon storage, windbreaks and reduce soil erosion. It\u2019s something the government is keen to look at, and I think we\u2019re moving that way.\u201d Marc Castellnou, an incident commander in the Catalan fire service who is also a fire analyst at the University of Lleida, says wildfires are essentially a problem of land management and rural policies. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to realise that climate change isn\u2019t just going to affect temperatures and sea levels \u2013 it\u2019s also going to change landscapes on a global scale. The land as we have known it is not going to stay the same because the climate is changing. That is going to mean different policies when it comes to water and farming,\u201d he said. Indigenous people knew the art of forest management but much of that knowledge has been lost. Martin Kealy, a chartered fire consultant and managing director of MKA Fire, says: \u201cIt\u2019s an art that would have been practised for thousands of years but when the Brits came and took over Australia, that knowledge was lost. The same happened in the US. \u201cThese wildfires have been going on for hundreds if not thousands of years. It\u2019s not something new and these fires will continue for hundreds or thousands of years \u2013 we just need to manage the land,\u201d he said.

Instead of a sugar tax, which the UK and other countries have chosen to impose, Chile has banned sales in schools and adopted stark black and white labels aimed at warning and educating families about the health dangers of junk food and drinks for their children. Unlike the UK\u2019s traffic lights, which may award a red label for sugar but also green for fruit content, Chile\u2019s ministry of health labels only deliver the bad news: high in sugar, high in salt or high in fat. Sugary drinks, unhealthy snacks and packaged foods must carry the front-of-pack labels. Chile\u2019s Law of Food Labelling and Advertising, which came into force in 2016, also restricts marketing to children of any such foods or drinks and bans them from sale in schools. When the ban came in, the people of Chile were consuming more sugary drinks per head than any other country in the world, and counting the cost in terms of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other health problems. Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health, publishing in the journal Plos Medicine, have found purchases of sugary drinks dropped by 23.7% during the first phase of the reforms. The largest changes were in the amount of sweetened fruit drinks and sweetened dairy drinks purchased. \u201cThis regulation is different because it is the first to require warning labels about excess levels of nutrients of concern, such as sugar or sodium, on the front of food and beverage packages,\u201d said first author Lindsey Smith Taillie, assistant professor of nutrition at the Gillings School. \u201cThe regulation includes the world\u2019s strictest limits on how and where food companies can advertise junk food to children. The reductions we observed in sugary drink purchases were markedly greater than those seen following the implementation of standalone policies \u2013 such as a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages \u2013 elsewhere in Latin America.\u201d The limits on acceptable levels of sugar, salt and fat have steadily dropped as tougher phases of the regulations were brought in. By the end of two years, the allowable amount of sugar in foods with no warning label will drop from 22.5g per 100g to 10g per 100g. Salt will halve from 800mg to 400mg per 100g. \u201cThis impact in the first phase is pretty impressive,\u201d said Barry Popkin, professor of nutrition at the Gillings School, who said it was having an effect on families\u2019 understanding of what constitutes a healthy diet. \u201cWe did focus groups with low and middle-income mothers and they were saying their kids were coming home and telling them to buy stuff without warning labels. \u201cIt is the first intervention we have seen showing potential for changing food norms. I think a lot of countries are going to look at this, because it is so impactful.\u201d Some already are. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about the Chilean regulations is how much they have already influenced international food policy,\u201d said Taillie. \u201cFrom our work with advocates and policymakers, we know that at least a dozen countries have directly used Chile\u2019s policies and the evaluation results to develop and inform similar policies. \u201cWe expect that in five to 10 years, much more of the world will look like Chile with regards to putting clearer labelling systems on food and drink packages to tell people which products are unhealthy and cut through the noise created by food marketing.\u201d Chile is classified as a high-income country by the World Bank, with sophisticated food systems in which retailers exert a lot of control over supply, very much like the UK and Europe. Popkin believes his team\u2019s analysis of their food warning labels will show significant impact on buying habits \u2013 unlike the traffic-light labelling in the UK. He thinks there will soon be evidence of positive effects on health but says the policies are aimed at long-term change, adding: \u201cWe will see a pretty immediate impact in the next few years on type 2 diabetes, but in overweight it takes time. We will get it in hypertension [high blood pressure] and diabetes but not quickly in weight.\u201d A separate study has shown that the sugary drinks levy in the UK appears to be a success, said researchers in Oxford, Cambridge and London, because many manufacturers had taken enough sugar out of their products to escape it. The analysis, also published in the journal Plos Medicine, shows when George Osborne, the former chancellor, announced plans to introduce the tax, about 52% of eligible soft drinks contained 5g or more sugar per 100ml and were liable for the tax. The levy came into force in April 2018, and by February 2019, only 15% of soft drinks were still liable. \u201cThe levy is an important policy as it both reduces the sugar level of many drinks and increases the prices of high sugar drinks, helping the public to make healthier choices. These population approaches are important not only for preventing disease but also for reducing health inequalities,\u2019 said Dr Peter Scarborough, associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford who led the analysis.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How millions use YouTube tutorials to perfect their trade", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/how-millions-use-youtube-tutorials-to-perfect-their-trade", "date": "2020-02-08", "transcript": "Holding an Allen key in a grease-stained hand, Jo\u00e3o Cruz looks every bit the professional bike mechanic. Wind back five years, however, and this 39-year-old former journalist barely knew how to fix a brake cable. \u201cTo be a good mechanic, you need tools and knowledge; I had the tools, but I needed to get the knowledge,\u201d said Cruz, owner of Velurb, a small bike rental business in the Portuguese city of Porto. In response, he spent the best part of a year trawling YouTube for tutorials on bicycle maintenance. Even today, he still regularly logs onto the video-sharing website for \u201ctips and tricks\u201d when faced with knotty technical problems. Cruz is not alone. Around the world, a growing cadre of entrepreneurs are turning to video tutorials posted on YouTube to help them learn their chosen trade. Another example is Holly Winter, a copywriter-turned-professional-dressmaker from Farnborough in Hampshire. The self-taught designer and seamstress treats YouTube much like a personal instructor, using it to train up in everything from boning corsets to fixing her sewing machine. \u201cWhenever I encounter something that I haven\u2019t done before or if I need to brush up on some skills, then there is always a YouTube tutorial for it,\u201d she says. As well as the sheer breadth of topics covered on the platform, the fact the information is free and readily available keeps her coming back. The appeal becomes especially clear when compared with the time and expense of traditional, in-person training options, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s only me working the job, so if I have to spend a day or more on a course, then there\u2019s no one else making wedding dresses. I mean, my brides aren\u2019t going to put their weddings on hold for me.\u201d The obvious upside of learning a trade face-to-face is the ability to asks questions in the moment. But what happens once the course is over? The advantage of YouTube, Winter counters, is the ability to post questions and receive responses long after the tutorial has been delivered and uploaded. Chinelo Awa shares this sentiment. Owner of Good Cake Day, a bespoke London-based cake decorating venture, she has found most YouTube experts to be \u201csurprisingly responsive\u201d. Her go-to YouTubers include Matt Adlard (AKA the Topless Baker), Joshua John Russell and Lindsey Ann, all of whom clock up tens of thousands of views for their instructional videos. \u201cIf you put a question in the comments, then they usually come back to you \u2026 but if you go on a day-course and have follow-up questions, you might not be able to ask the teachers,\u201d says Awa, who works part-time as a paralegal. Of course, not everything on YouTube is quality information \u2013 and not all its contributors are diligent at responding. Nor does the video-sharing platform offer the immediacy of interaction that some social media platforms do. Compared to Instagram\u2019s \u201clive\u201d service, for example, which Awa uses to take real-time classes with professional bakers like Yolanda Gampp, YouTube can feel a little static. That said, Awa still rates it as a safe space to perfect her trade: \u201cIf someone has thousands of followers on YouTube, it\u2019s easy to think that your questions can be stupid, but my experience is that people are happy to help.\u201d Tai Alegbe agrees. Learning a completely new skillset can feel intimidating, says the co-founder of Contingent, a financial technology start-up. So, the ability to kick off at the beginning and advance at his own pace takes the initial sting out of the learning process. In his case, the challenge at hand was to get up to speed with basic coding. His initial fears were eased after seeing that most of the coders on YouTube weren\u2019t tech geniuses, but \u201cnormal people\u201d. As he notes: \u201cGoing online and understanding that these experts are just like you really helps\u201d. YouTube, which is owned by Google, likes to promote its service as a practical tool for learning and not just a repository of teen vlogs and funny cat videos. According to the company\u2019s own statistics, nine in 10 users worldwide perceive its platform as a \u201cplace to learn\u201d. To drum home the point, it now boasts a dedicated \u201clearning\u201d channel for education-oriented uploads. \u201cYouTube opens us a world of learning that may not be otherwise accessible, whether it is supplemental education, professional and everyday skills or even how-to tutorials and life hacks\u201d, says Katie Kurtz, the company\u2019s head of learning partnerships. Independent research appears to give credence to the claim. Research by the Pew Research Centre found that \u201chow-to\u201d videos are what bring 51% of all US-based YouTube users to the site. Likewise, in New Zealand, 57% of millennials on YouTube see the site as a place to \u201caccess knowledge and learn new careers skills\u201d. In Australia, meanwhile, a similar proportion (54%) prefer to watch YouTube if they have a question rather than read a user manual or talk to someone on the phone. Charles Lomu in western Sydney fits that bill. A former high-school dropout, he describes how he used YouTube to commercialise his \u201cside hustle\u201d in barbering: \u201cI was doing haircuts until the early morning, but I never looked at it as a profession because I\u2019d never been to barber school. And then I turned to YouTube.\u201d Today, Lomu, who now runs his own barber shop, is using his skills to teach barbering to disengaged students at the local high school. Predictably, he has loaded up a series of online videos about the course. For young people who have grown up using YouTube to help with their homework or teach themselves how to play the guitar, turning to it to learn a trade marks a natural step. Such was the case for Andy Smith, a 31-year-old economics graduate, who recently founded Reco, an e-commerce service for plastic-free products. Realising he would have to teach himself some rudimentary programming, his immediate instinct was to search online for video tutorials. Learning a trade via YouTube isn\u2019t without its flaws, Smith says. First, there\u2019s the issue of quality control. Secondly, the task-specific nature of many instruction videos can lead to a piecemeal or patchy understanding. Smith\u2019s programming skills, for example, are still by no means \u201cin depth\u201d. That said, he feels he knows enough now to give clear instructions to any future contractors. \u201cHas YouTube made me into a Jack of all trades?\u201d he ponders. \u201cPerhaps. If anything, in fact, it\u2019s probably made me into a Jack of too many trades.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

India plans to double renewable energy capacity in just two years to 175 GW by 2022. Finland has meanwhile announced plans to give fathers the same parental leave as mothers: 164 days. What we liked Back to music, and a new study that pinpoints why high-tempo tunes are the best tracks to exercise to. We also like the idea of Chaucer in an app \u2026 What we heard Peter Ward wrote in from Peru: I\u2019m involved in rural Peru working with secondary students to re-value their intangible cultural traditions using innovative technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. Students first select examples of local intangible culture which are in danger of being lost or reduced to superficial shows for tourists, such as traditional dances and festivals. Then they develop investigative projects using project-based learning around questions such as: \u201cHow and why has the tradition changed?\u201d and \u201cWhy do people participate?\u201d. Finally, they develop apps to summarise their investigations and share their investigations back to their communities. The project shows the power of using new innovative technologies to promote respect and re-valuing of traditional cultures in a country with poor education outcomes, and where culture is all too often reduced to nothing more than a product to sell to tourists. Sounds remarkable Peter \u2013 good luck. Betsey Westendorf, meanwhile, returned to the theme of happiness that we raised a couple of weeks ago: If you define happiness as laughing all day long, then it\u2019s not as important as the items you mentioned. To me those items create happiness. There\u2019s no better sense of physical wellbeing than the day after a bad headache, and discovering a way to help your body not create headaches from tension to consumption is even happier. Accomplishing goals make many of us happy. Feeling safe even when scary things are happening is possible and can be learned. So we have a lot of power over our happiness, and it has little to do with the circumstances Where was the Upside?

These days Isis is the group fighting for survival. And the Yazidi aretaking steps to ensure that their culture is preserved in perpetuity, whatever happens next in the region. A group are in Britain this week to perform their distinctive choral works and hand over a musical archive to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Audiences with Prince Charles and MPs in parliament will follow later in the week as the culmination of a music project designed to record and protect the Yazidis\u2019 unique art form. But the project, delivered by the Amar foundation as part of a British Council initiative to protect heritage in conflict zones, is about more than just cultural preservation: it is therapy for people who have been through a collective trauma. Many Yazidi still live in camps. \u201cWhen you are enjoying music with other people, or making it in particular, you have to be absolutely present and forget about the past and the future and that is a healthy way of living,\u201d says Michael Bochmann, a virtuoso violinist and the music principal for the project. Bochmann\u2019s work in the camps celebrates the power of music to bring participants together, \u201cto the here and now\u201d. Music has gradually encouraged young women, in particular, to leave the isolation of their tents and to sing, dance and support one another. Students in five camps are learning to play the tambour, a sacred instrument, and the daf (a kind of drum). \u201cWe are nothing without a future and dreams,\u201d says Rainas Elias, 19, who was literally sold down the Euphrates river by Isis, and held captive until her family paid $12,000 for her release. Even then, she had to leave her daughter with Isis. \u201cWe hope one day those that committed these heinous crimes against us will be brought to justice,\u201d she says. \u201cWe now deserve a decent life outside Iraq. Our home in Shingal is still a battleground and there is no security. We can never live in peace there.\u201d Elias now lives with her father and mother and two younger brothers in a camp for displaced people. \u201cThe standard of living is very difficult,\u201d she says, \u201cand my father cannot work because he is sick.\u201d There are few employment opportunities. To this day, Elias has no news about what has happened to her sister, and to her two older brothers, who were 18 and 22 when they were separated. Chief among her hopes is that one day she will hear that they have been \u201cliberated\u201d. Until then, she finds some comfort in the ancient music which is central to the Yazidi life and monotheistic faith. \u201cThe project is part of our healing process,\u201d Elias says. \u201cI feel very happy joining the choir with my sisters.

So what happened next to Notre Dame's bees?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/31/they-survived-fire-and-lead-poisoning-so-what-happened-next-to-notre-dames-bees-aoe", "date": "2020-01-31", "transcript": "It is a crisp winter morning and the area around Notre Dame is sealed off as it has been since the fire last April that devastated the cathedral. Those in the know, however, especially those with the keenest of eyes, might spot some small movement high up to the south of the stricken and blackened structure. The bees of Notre Dame, whose escape from the inferno seemed almost miraculous, are thriving and conserving their energy ready to produce honey this summer, just as they have every year since they took up residence on the sacristy roof in 2013. Nearly 10 months after the Paris cathedral was ravaged by fire, the three colonies are healthier than ever, according to their beekeeper. Sibyle Moulin, who looks after the hives, spoke to the Guardian after she visited them for the first time in six months. Access to the site is restricted because the severely damaged 13th-century stone structure is still unstable and there is a risk from lead particles from the roof that was turned into dust in the blaze. Moulin, who had to undergo a health and safety course to resume visits to the honey bees, said the 30-45,000 insects in the three hives are absolutely fine. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with them at all. The behaviour of the colonies is perfectly normal,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not very active at this time of the year, but that\u2019s how it should be. They seem fine.\u201d When fire tore through the cathedral last year, most people feared the bees, which can number up to 50,000 per colony, had perished. Moulin\u2019s company, Beeopic, received calls of support from well-wishers all over the world, who were moved by reports that the bees had not abandoned their queens in the face of danger, but had gorged on honey and hunkered down to protect their colonies. Although untouched by the flames which destroyed the cathedral\u2019s famous roof structure, Moulin says she was initially worried the heat might have damaged the hives, given their position on the sacristy roof on the south side of the cathedral and approximately 30m (98ft) below the main roof. Another concern was that firefighters, whose priority was to control the fire, might have disturbed them in their frantic efforts to put out the blaze. \u201cOf course, my first thought was for the cathedral itself. My second was for the bees. I kept watching the television footage of the fire but the captions at the bottom always hid the sacristy roof, which is below the main roof, so I couldn\u2019t see if they\u2019d been touched,\u201d Moulin said. Drone footage in the aftermath of the fire showed the hives were intact, but it took several weeks of detective work to establish if the colonies had survived the proximity to temperatures estimated to have reached 800C(1,470F) at their peak. \u201cAn ounce of hope. The three hives are still in place \u2026 and visibly intact,\u201d Nicolas G\u00e9ant, head of Beeopic, tweeted hours after the fire was put out. \u201cAs for the occupants \u2026 the mystery remains. All that smoke, heat, water. \u201cWe will have to see if our brave bees are still with us as soon as we\u2019re given access to the site, which may take some time,\u201d he added. Two days later, G\u00e9ant announced: \u201cOur bees at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral are still alive.\u201d Moulin says beekeepers had to piece together clues in film footage taken of the cathedral. \u201cWe examined satellite images and we saw the hives were intact and hadn\u2019t been knocked over and there were no puddles of wax underneath them. As the wax melts at around 70C we knew they hadn\u2019t been affected by the heat. We weren\u2019t worried about the smoke, because we use it to sedate them so we knew they\u2019d just go to sleep around the queen. \u201cThen we were sent some film from some of the people working on securing the cathedral and we could see bees going in and out of the hives. We studied their behaviour and saw they were carrying balls of pollen on their feet which meant they were building up stocks of protein to feed the young. \u201cAs soon as we knew there were baby bees we knew it meant the queens were fine since they were producing them.\u201d It was good news, but Moulin could not be 100% sure of the health of the colonies until she was given permission to visit the devastated cathedral in July, three months after the fire. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to have been affected at all. Of course, there\u2019s lots of noxious material all around them, including the lead dust, but they\u2019re not like children; they won\u2019t be licking walls or touching anything other than flowers. The only thing they might come into direct contact with that might be contaminated is the water they drink.\u201d In July, Moulin retrieved 66kg of honey from the three hives, samples from which have been sent to laboratories in Canada to be tested for lead. Beeopic maintains the hives and bee colonies, but the honey produced from those on the roof of Notre Dame, and the 350 other hives in Paris that the company looks after \u2013 of a total of 700 dotted around the city \u2013 belongs to the owners of the buildings on whose roofs they sit, including that of Louis Vuitton on the Champs Elys\u00e9es and the nearby Grand Palais on the north bank of the Seine. The urban honey bees, of the Brother Adam Buckfast variety, were developed for their mild temperament in the 1920s by a Benedictine monk. The Notre Dame hives were installed on the cathedral roof in 2013 as a gesture to promote biodiversity. There are also hives managed by other companies on the Paris Opera buildings, the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, Coca-Cola\u2019s French headquarters and several banks. Moulin, who normally visits each hive at least once a month, hopes to remove the queens from the three Notre Dame hives this summer and replace them with younger royals. The queen bees can live for five years, while their worker bees have a lifespan of around 45 days. \u201cWe usually do this every year because when the queen bee is older there is a tendency for the colony to swarm, which tends to frighten people in the city, so we try to avoid it. The problem is that anything leaving the site has to be washed down and decontaminated, and I can\u2019t see myself putting the bees into the shower,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first the authorities wanted us to remove the hives, but they\u2019ve seen [the cathedral through the catastrophe and they\u2019re still there, so it seemed more intelligent to leave them alone.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How Finland starts its fight against fake news in primary schools", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/fact-from-fiction-finlands-new-lessons-in-combating-fake-news", "date": "2020-01-29", "transcript": "You can start when children are very young, said Kari Kivinen. In fact, you should: \u201cFairytales work well. Take the wily fox who always cheats the other animals with his sly words. That\u2019s not a bad metaphor for a certain kind of politician, is it?\u201d With democracies around the world threatened by the seemingly unstoppable onslaught of false information, Finland \u2013 recently rated Europe\u2019s most resistant nation to fake news \u2013 takes the fight seriously enough to teach it in primary school. In secondary schools, such as the state-run college in Helsinki where Kivinen is head teacher, multi-platform information literacy and strong critical thinking have become a core, cross-subject component of a national curriculum that was introduced in 2016. In maths lessons, Kivinen\u2019s pupils learn how easy it is to lie with statistics. In art, they see how an image\u2019s meaning can be manipulated. In history, they analyse notable propaganda campaigns, while Finnish language teachers work with them on the many ways in which words can be used to confuse, mislead and deceive. \u201cThe goal is active, responsible citizens and voters,\u201d Kivinen said. \u201cThinking critically, factchecking, interpreting and evaluating all the information you receive, wherever it appears, is crucial. We\u2019ve made it a core part of what we teach, across all subjects.\u201d The curriculum is part of a unique, broad strategy devised by the Finnish government after 2014, when the country was first targeted with fake news stories by its Russian neighbour, and the government realised it had moved into the post-fact age. Successful enough for Finland to top, by some margin, an annual index measuring resistance to fake news in 35 European countries, the programme aims to ensure that everyone, from pupil to politician, can detect \u2013 and do their bit to fight \u2013 false information. \u201cThis affects all of us,\u201d said Jussi Toivanen, chief communications officer for the prime minister\u2019s office. \u201cIt targets the whole of Finnish society. It aims to erode our values and norms, the trust in our institutions that hold society together.\u201d Finland, which declared independence from Russia in 1917, is on the frontline of an online information war that has accelerated markedly since Moscow annexed Crimea and backed rebels in eastern Ukraine five years ago, Toivanen said. Most campaigns, amplified by sympathetic far-right, nation-first and \u201calternative\u201d Finnish news sites and social media accounts, focus on attacking the EU, highlighting immigration issues and trying to influence debate over Finland\u2019s full Nato membership. Resistance is seen almost as a civil defence question, a key component in Finland\u2019s comprehensive security policy. Toivanen said: \u201cWe are a small country, without many resources, and we rely on everyone contributing to the collective defence of society.\u201d The programme, piloted by a 30-member, high-level committee representing 20 different bodies from government ministries to welfare organisations and the police, intelligence and security services, has trained thousands of civil servants, journalists, teachers and librarians over the past three years. \u201cIt\u2019s a broad-based, coordinated effort to raise awareness,\u201d said Saara Jantunen, a senior researcher from the defence ministry who has been seconded to the prime minister\u2019s office. \u201cLike virus protection on your computer: the government\u2019s responsible for a certain amount, of course, but ultimately it\u2019s up to the individual to install the software.\u201d For Kivinen, who returned to Finland after a career in international education to head the French-Finnish school in Helsinki and pioneer the information literacy programme in schools, no one is too young to start thinking about the reliability of the information they encounter. \u201cKids today don\u2019t read papers or watch TV news, which here are OK,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t look for news, they stumble across it, on WhatsApp, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat \u2026 Or more precisely, an algorithm selects it, just for them. They must be able to approach it critically. Not cynically \u2013 we don\u2019t want them to think everyone lies \u2013 but critically.\u201d Fake news, Kivinen said, is not a great term, especially for children. Far more useful are three distinct categories: misinformation, or \u201cmistakes\u201d; disinformation, or \u201clies\u201d and \u201choaxes\u201d, which are false and spread deliberately to deceive; and malinformation, or \u201cgossip\u201d, which may perhaps be correct but is intended to harm. \u201cEven quite young children can grasp this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey love being detectives. If you also get them questioning real-life journalists and politicians about what matters to them, run mock debates and real school elections, ask them to write accurate and fake reports on them \u2026 democracy, and the threats to it, start to mean something.\u201d He wants his pupils to ask questions such as: who produced this information, and why? Where was it published? What does it really say? Who is it aimed at? What is it based on? Is there evidence for it, or is this just someone\u2019s opinion? Is it verifiable elsewhere? On the evidence of half a dozen pupils gathered in a classroom before lunchtime, it is an approach that is paying off. \u201cYou must always factcheck. The number one rule: no Wikipedia, and always three or four different and reliable sources,\u201d said Mathilda, 18. \u201cWe learn that basically in every subject.\u201d Lila, 16, said she had grilled local politicians for a live panel discussion on the local radio station. Alexander, 17, said he had learned a lot from devising a fake news campaign. Asked why fake news mattered, he said: \u201cBecause you end up with wrong numbers on the side of a bus, and voters who believe them.\u201d Priya, 16, said education was \u201cthe best way to fight it. The problem is, anyone can publish anything. There\u2019s not much a government can do when they\u2019re faced with big multinationals like Google or Facebook, and if it does too much it\u2019s censorship. So yes, education is what\u2019s most effective.\u201d Part of that continuing education is also provided by NGOs. Besides operating an effective factchecking service, Faktabaari (Fact Bar), launched for the 2014 European elections and run by a volunteer staff of journalists and researchers, produces popular voter literacy kits for schools and the wider public. \u201cEssentially, we aim to give people their own tools,\u201d said its founder, Mikko Salo, a member of the EU\u2019s independent high-level expert group on fake news. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to vaccinate against problems, rather than telling people what\u2019s right and wrong. That can easily lead to polarisation.\u201d In the run-up to Finland\u2019s parliamentary elections last April, the government went so far as to produce an advertising campaign alerting voters to the possibility of fake news, with the slogan \u201cFinland has the best elections in the world. Think about why\u201d. Similarly, Mediametka has been developing and working with media literacy tools since the more innocent days of the early 1950s, when its founders were motivated mainly by fear of the irreparable damage that comic books might do to the minds of Finnish children. These days, the NGO, part-funded by the culture ministry, organises ed-tech hackathons with inventive Finnish startups in a bid to develop \u201cmeaningful materials\u201d for schools and youth groups, said its executive director, Meri Seistola. \u201cWe work with pictures, videos, text, digital content; get our students to produce their own; ask them to identify all the various kinds of misleading news,\u201d said Seistola: from propaganda to clickbait, satire to conspiracy theory, pseudoscience to partisan reporting; from stories describing events that simply never happened to unintentional errors of fact. Finland has something of a head start on information literacy, ranking consistently at or near the top of international indices for press freedom, transparency, education and social justice. Its school pupils have the EU\u2019s highest PISA score for reading. \u201cThe level of trust in national institutions, in the media, in society as a whole, does tend to be higher in the Nordic countries than in many others,\u201d said Faktabaari\u2019s Salo. \u201cBut that means we really need even greater vigilance now, to prepare ourselves for the next phase. Because we have more to lose.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

So what milk should we drink?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/28/what-plant-milk-should-i-drink-almond-killing-bees-aoe", "date": "2020-01-29", "transcript": "For environmentally minded consumers, the news is hard to swallow: almond milk is not healthy for the planet and the popular milk substitute is especially hard on bees. Our recent investigation into the connection between California\u2019s industrialized almond industry and a record 50bn commercial bee deaths created quite a buzz. The widely read story prompted one primary response from readers: \u201cWhat should we be drinking instead?\u201d This is a thorny question, and food sustainability experts are reluctant to single out any one plant milk as best because all have pros and cons. But we\u2019re going to try. One thing is clear. All milk alternatives are far better for the planet than dairy. A 2018 study by researchers at the University of Oxford showed that producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times more greenhouse gas emissions than any plant-based milk and it consumes nine times more land than any of the milk alternatives. (Land is required to pasture the cows and grow their feed, which the animals belch out in the form of methane.) Plant milks can, nevertheless, have a dark side, as when any crop is produced in mass quantities. It\u2019s important to consider not just whether they are grown using organic methods. Other factors include how the farming of the crop affects people and native habitats in developing countries, the carbon footprint and water use. And while each product has its trade-offs, some plant milks are more sustainable than others. Based on interviews with experts, here is a an environmental ranking of plant milks, from the disappointingly sour to the sustainably sweet. Coconut: \u2018An absolute tragedy\u2019 Coconut has a reputation as exotic and healthy, but for poor regions in the Philippines, Indonesia and India, where pickers are often paid less than a dollar a day, the palm groves are no paradise. Because coconut trees only grow in tropical climates, the pressure to meet global demand is causing exploitation of workers and destruction of rainforests. \u201cCoconut is an absolute tragedy and it makes me really sad,\u201d Isaac Emery, a food sustainability consultant. \u201cI love cooking with coconut milk but I don\u2019t feel good about buying coconut products. Farmers in Indonesia should be growing food to feed their families instead of meeting international demands.\u201d To avoid supporting unsustainable practices, choose coconut products that are certified Fair Trade. Almond: bad for bees While almond trees occupy smaller amounts of farmland compared with other crops grown for milk, this benefit is overshadowed by the negative impacts of almond farming in the US. Concentrated almost entirely in California\u2019s arid Central Valley, almonds are the largest specialty crop in the US and the orchards cover a region the size of Delaware. Almonds require more water than any other dairy alternative, consuming 130 pints of water to produce a single glass of almond milk, according to the Oxford study. Satisfying continual demands for larger almond crops is also placing unsustainable pressures on US commercial beekeepers. Nearly 70% of commercial bees in the US are drafted every spring to pollinate almonds. Last year, a record number \u2013over one-third of them\u2013 died by season\u2019s end as a result of these pressures and other environmental threats. Rice: a water-guzzler Although rice milk is ubiquitous as an inexpensive and widely available dairy alternative, it offers little in the way of nutrition or environmental benefits compared with other choices. Rice is a water hog, according to the Oxford study, plus it produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other plant milk. Bacteria breeding in rice paddies pump methane into the atmosphere and large amounts of fertilizer pollute waterways. Hazelnut: on the up For consumers who want the nutritiousness and tastiness of a nut milk but without the environmental impacts of almond farming, the hazelnut is a rising star. Like all nuts, hazelnuts grow on trees that pull carbon from the atmosphere and help reduce greenhouse emissions rather than increase them. Hazelnuts are environmentally superior to almonds in that they are pollinated by the wind rather than commercial honeybees and they grow in moist climates, such as the Pacific north-west, where water is less of an issue. Hemp and flax: niche contenders Another way to ensure sustainable choices is to choose milk alternatives made from what Emery describes as \u201cniche crops\u201d such as hemp and flax. They are grown in relatively small quantities in the northern hemisphere, which makes them more environmentally friendly compared with a monoculture operation. Both plants produce seeds that make for a milk rich in protein and healthy fats. Soy: back in favor According to the Oxford study, soy milk is the joint winner on the sustainability scale. Plus, soy is the only plant milk that comes close to offering a protein content comparable to dairy. It was the go-to alternative long before almond milk came into vogue \u2013 but then soy fell out of favor. \u201cSoy has a relatively high concentration of certain hormones that are similar to human hormones and people got freaked out about that,\u201d says Emery. \u201cBut the reality is you would have to consume an impossibly large amount of soy milk and tofu for that to ever be a problem.\u201d Recent studies have instead found that a moderate amount of soy is healthy, especially for women. The primary environmental drawback to soy milk is that soybeans are grown in massive quantities around the world to feed livestock for meat and dairy production. Large swaths of rainforest in the Amazon have been burned to make way for soy farms. The work-around for this is to simply do a little research and read the carton to find soy milk that is made from organic soybeans grown in the US or Canada. Oat: a humble hero Meet the winner: the unassuming oat. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the surge in oat milk popularity,\u201d says Liz Specht, associate director of science and technology for the Good Food Institute, a not-for-profit that promotes plant-based diets. \u201cOat milk performs very well on all sustainability metrics.\u201d Also: \u201cI highly doubt there will be unintended environmental consequences that might emerge when the scale of oat milk use gets larger.\u201d According to Bloomberg Business, retail sales of oat milk in the US have soared from $4.4m in 2017 to $29m in 2019, surpassing almond milk as the fastest-growing dairy alternative. But unlike almonds, there are already plenty of oats to go around. \u201cRight now, 50 to 90% of global oat production goes into animal feed,\u201d says Specht, \u201cso there\u2019s a huge existing acreage that we can safely steal share from without moving the needle at all on total production.\u201d Oats are grown in cooler climates such as the northern US and Canada, and are therefore not associated with deforestation in developing countries. The only drawback with this trendy and guilt-free option is that most oats come from mass-produced, monoculture operations where they are sprayed with the Roundup pesticide right before harvest. A study by the Environmental Working Group found glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and a possible carcinogen, in all the foods it tested containing conventionally grown oats and even in one-third of products made with organic oats. However, the popular Oatly brand oat milk company maintains its oats are certified glyphosate free. The bottom line: as long as it\u2019s not dairy Both Emery and Specht emphasize that whether it\u2019s coconut, soy or oat, consumers should drink whatever plant milk is most appealing to them and not fret over sustainability shortcomings, which are chump change compared with the environmental harms from dairy. \u201cDrink what you want,\u201d says Emery. \u201cIf you\u2019re going with plant milk instead of animal milk, you\u2019ve already addressed most of the environmental problems that your animal milk habit was causing.\u201d Follow these recipes to whip up a glass of hazelnut fig milk and other DIY plant milk varieties. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2020.

And then there is the perfect cup of coffee \u2026 Elsewhere, though not technically an Upside piece of work, our investigation into the ill-gotten gains of Africa\u2019s richest woman appears to have had tangible upside results as Isabel dos Santos was named as a formal suspect in a criminal investigation. Compare her to Britain\u2019s youngest MP, who has opted to give away half her salary. And to the millionaires of Davos, insisting that they pay MORE tax. Honestly, Isabel, how much is enough?

And China seems poised to slash the amount of single-use plastic that it churns out, as officials outlined a gradual ban. What we liked We were mildly encouraged by new research that has come up with a series of predictive tools that assess how likely a young person is to suffer from depression. Important, given how crucial prevention is as a tool to combat mental illness. We\u2019d also quite like to move to the Copenhagen neighbourhood built entirely of wood.

Colgate may be the big brand but see Kingfisher Toothpaste to find out about a UK company that\u2019s been at vegan toothpaste for years \u2013 albeit without flag-waving and claims to recyclable tubes as yet; though I saw a LinkedIn post on an independent developer of those recently too. Pretty sure the old-style metallic tubes would have been recyclable too (presumably not now used because they are prone to creasing and consequent leaking).

In her early 60s, she\u2019d recently lost a close friend, and had stopped working. \u201cI was at a crossroads, with a lot to deal with \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t at all sure a course could help.\u201d She went along to the first session, she says, with her arms folded, pretty certain she wouldn\u2019t be back. So what made her end up cancelling parties so she could get to the classes \u2013 and why is she now a stalwart of the ongoing monthly get-togethers with her other happiness graduates? In a nutshell, she says, the course helped her understand how to view life through a positive rather than a negative lens. It gave her strategies to cope when things seemed to be going into a downward spiral, as well as a supportive environment and the space to talk things through. \u201cIt sounds trite and airy-fairy, but it was anything but \u2013 it was really useful, and very genuine,\u201d she says. Newstead isn\u2019t alone in finding the course \u2013 entitled Exploring What Matters, endorsed by the Dalai Lama and run by the UK charity Action for Happiness \u2013 helpful. New research released on Tuesday has found its approach has a real impact, reducing anxiety and depression by up to 20%, and raising life satisfaction by about 15%. That\u2019s more than the psychological boost you get from finding a new job or a new life partner. And that makes it highly significant, explains economist Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, professor at Sa\u00efd Business School in Oxford and director of the Oxford University Wellbeing Research Centre, who conducted the study. \u201cWe know a lot about what drives wellbeing, and we know a lot about mental health issues in our society and the fact that they\u2019re on the increase, despite improving economic conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what hasn\u2019t been properly looked at until now is what can make a difference \u2013 what can move the dial on life satisfaction in a meaningful and sustained way.\u201d Like Newstead, he wasn\u2019t sure how much difference a short course of eight sessions could make when he started his randomised control trial involving 146 people. \u201cBut the results were really impressive \u2013 the course delivers significant improvements in wellbeing and reductions in mental health symptoms,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this intervention has huge potential and really does work.\u201d So how does the course work? Another of its graduates is Rebecca Newey, 47, who lives near Aldershot. She was feeling angry, suffering mood swings and snapping at her husband and two sons, aged 12 and 10, when she signed up for the happiness course two years ago after hearing about it from another mother at the school gate. \u201cThe sessions start with being mindful: you stop what you\u2019re doing and notice how you\u2019re breathing. And then there\u2019s a structured discussion about how to feel happier: so you\u2019re with a bunch of people who are all aspiring to be happier, and there\u2019s power in that.\u201d One of the most important things she learned, says Newey, was how to react to an event. \u201cYou choose how to respond to something, and your gut reaction isn\u2019t always the best way to react. You learn to take a moment to breathe, and to make a decision about what to do next.\u201d That knowledge continues to make a difference in her life. \u201cThe other day my car had a flat tyre. Two years ago I\u2019d have moaned and thought it was the end of the world: instead, I started to count my blessings. The previous day I\u2019d been on a motorway, so it was good it hadn\u2019t happened then; and it happened when my husband was around, so it wasn\u2019t leaving me in the lurch unable to pick up the children.\u201d So is finding happiness, in essence, a lot easier than we\u2019ve been led to believe? Mark Williamson, director of Action for Happiness, says maybe it is \u2013 though there\u2019s a caveat. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to suggest you can simply choose whether to be happy,\u201d he says. \u201cMany people are in difficult circumstances, and feeling happy isn\u2019t easy or straightforward. But what we do know is that we have the ability to make a difference to how we feel \u2013 there are tools that can help, and there\u2019s an awareness that can change things.\u201d The Action for Happiness website lists 10 \u201ckeys\u201d to a happier life, ranging from connecting with other people and giving time and money to causes you care about, to being open to new experiences and doing regular exercise. So far about 6,000 people have taken part in the happiness course at 250 locations, and after the research is released on Tuesday, its availability looks set to rise. Participants are invited to give a voluntary donation, because the ambition is to be inclusive, says Williamson. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to be just about happy and privileged people being a bit happier. We want everyone, including those on low incomes and from all backgrounds, to benefit.\u201d The charity also offers an app and an online calendar, both with simple tips to make life easier. None of what you learn is rocket science, says Newstead, but it is life-changing all the same. \u201cI still have bad days \u2013 everyone does,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now I think about something from the course, for example I remember three positive things in my life. And that really can make the situation better.\u201d How to be happy \u2022Every day, make a list of three things you\u2019re grateful for. You\u2019ll be more resilient and mentally healthier within 12 weeks, according to research for Action for Happiness. \u2022Say something positive to at least three people you meet today. \u2022Go out for a brisk walk. \u2022Do a mindfulness or happiness meditation \u2013 there are plenty online. \u2022Support a charity, cause or campaign you really care about. \u2022Notice when you\u2019re being hard on yourself or others, and opt to be kind instead. \u2022Plan a fun or exciting activity you can look forward to. \u2022Re-frame a worry: ask yourself, will this matter a year from now? Could it be an opportunity, rather than a difficulty? \u2022Find the joy in music: listen, sing, play, dance. \u2022Treat yourself: do something today that you know will make you feel good.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How a Belgian port city inspired Birmingham's car-free ambitions", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/how-a-belgian-port-city-inspired-birminghams-car-free-ambitions", "date": "2020-01-20", "transcript": "Birmingham \u2013 once, proudly, the UK\u2019s \u201cmotorway city\u201d \u2013 has announced plans to entice people out of cars and on to bikes and buses. If officials get their way, the city will be split into zones, and, rather than driving direct, motorists will have to use the ring road for all zone-to-zone journeys. Those travelling by foot and bicycle in the new Brum won\u2019t be inconvenienced: their journeys will be simple and \u2013 with fewer cars \u2013 safer. With cars out of the way, bus journeys will become swifter and more reliable. The Birmingham transport plan, launched last week, was influenced by Ghent\u2019s zone-centred traffic circulation plan of 2017. This medieval Belgian city \u2013 a quarter of the size of Birmingham \u2013 demonstrated that it was possible to switch attitudes overnight. Streets were blocked to motorists one Sunday evening and \u2013 to the disappointment of the waiting media \u2013there was no wailing, no gnashing of teeth, no gridlock. Motorists have since found that, while their journeys are longer in distance, they take less time because there are fewer fellow travellers on the roads. Motor vehicles used to make up 55% of trips in Ghent \u2013 that number has now fallen to 27%. Retailers and restaurants that had warned of Armageddon discovered that takings did not plummet. \u201cActually the economic situation has improved,\u201d says the Green politician who led what had been controversial changes. Filip Watteeuw, deputy mayor of Ghent, points out there \u201chas been a 17% increase in restaurant and bar startups, and the number of empty shops has been arrested\u201d. A year after the imposition of the traffic circulation plan \u2013 in news that may encourage similarly minded politicians around the world, Watteeuw was re-elected with an increased majority. Another advantage of the intervention is that it is remarkably cheap to implement; Ghent\u2019s plan cost just \u20ac4m (\u00a33.4m) to implement. By comparison it costs an estimated \u00a320m-\u00a330m to build just one mile of motorway. \u201c[A city\u2019s] best car plan is a bike plan,\u201d he said. \u201cProviding more space for walking and cycling leads not only to more people walking and cycling, it also makes space for people who really need to use their cars.\u201d A great deal of Ghent\u2019s traffic congestion was found to have been caused by an excess of short car journeys \u2013 as planners had accurately modelled. \u201cWe had people complaining that a drive of 300 metres became a car journey of two kilometres,\u201d remembers Watteeuw. \u201cWe had to explain that we don\u2019t want people to use a car for 300 metres: they should walk.\u201d In Birmingham 25% of car journeys are one mile or less. Thanks to new infrastructure, bicycle use in the city is rising but from a pitiful low of just 1% of all trips. Birmingham city council wants this to rise to 5% by 2023, but if it successfully introduces its circulation plan it might be surprised by far greater success. Ghent\u2019s plan had imagined a cycling modal share of 35% by 2030, up from 22% in 2016. Instead, after an explosive 60% rise in cycle use, the target was reached last year, 13 years earlier than planned for. Ghent now has cleaner air: nitrogen oxide levels have dropped by 20% since 2017. It\u2019s also a quieter city. \u201cOne resident described me as the best orchestral composer the city has ever had,\u201d said Watteeuw. Before the introduction of Ghent\u2019s circulation plan, all that could be heard was the cacophony of cars, complained the resident, but \u201cnow he hears birdsong\u201d, Watteeuw said. \u201cInstead of car noise,\u201d he adds, \u201cpeople can now hear each other talking and children laughing.\u201d For Mel Jones, Birmingham city council\u2019s head of transport planning, taming cars can\u2019t come soon enough. \u201cGrowth in Birmingham\u2019s population will result in 1.2 million additional daily trips across our highways network by 2031,\u201d she says. \u201cAccommodating all these trips by private car is simply not sustainable.\u201d Road widening is off the table, she adds. It\u2019s expensive, unpopular \u2013 and doesn\u2019t work. \u201cWe need to look at ways of keeping the city moving in a sustainable and efficient way,\u201d says Jones. Birmingham plans to remove one of the most significant incentives to motoring: car parking. Businesses will be incentivised to remove parking spaces through the introduction of an annual \u00a3500 per space workplace parking levy, and the city will build 12,800 new homes on former car parks. \u201cValuable land in short supply [should be] used in the most productive way possible,\u201d the council says in its 36-page plan. \u201cReducing pressure on kerb space\u201d will \u201cprovide improved penetration and accessibility by public transport in the city centre,\u201d promises the plan. \u201cPublic transport and cycling provision will be prioritised over car parking provision.\u201d The \u201callocation of road space will change away from single occupancy private cars,\u201d the council says, because the priority should be \u201cmoving people, not vehicles\u201d. Freight deliveries will be restricted to out-of-hours, and there will be a blanket 20mph speed limit across the city\u2019s local roads. Birmingham must \u201cbuild a future in which the car will no longer be king\u201d, says Waseem Zaffar, the city council cabinet member for transport and environment. Cars, he adds, are \u201cbad for the health of ourselves and our families, bad for our communities and bad for business as measured by the millions of pounds of lost productivity caused by congestion\u201d. Watteeuw advises Birmingham\u2019s councillors not to stagger any changes. \u201cIn Ghent, we implemented the plan as a whole overnight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was technically and politically the easiest way.\u201d The Birmingham transport plan goes out to public consultation soon. Watteeuw \u2013 who received death threats before the implementation of the plan \u2013 urges the residents of Birmingham not to allow loud voices and vested interests to derail the process. \u201cTalk to people, but be persistent, and don\u2019t give in on the plan\u2019s principal benefits,\u201d he says.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Silver Sharers: the site helping older renters meet their match", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/18/silver-sharers-the-site-helping-older-renters-meet-their-match", "date": "2020-01-18", "transcript": "It\u2019s not just Generation Rent that struggles with insecure lets, unscrupulous landlords and bad accommodation. There are more than 400,000 people aged over 60 living in private rented accommodation, up more than 60% from 2007. Research predicts a third of over-60s could be renting privately by 2040, as rising divorce rates and sky-high property prices take their toll. For some older renters, the prospect can be depressing as it could mean poor-quality accommodation, insecure tenancy, isolation. But a new service is dedicated to matching older homeowners with lodgers of a similar age. Since opening for business last week, Silver Sharers has signed up more than 500 prospective landlords and renters, with six members close to signing tenancy agreements. Suzanne Noble, the site\u2019s founder, said: \u201cI\u2019m 58 and I share my flat with my lodger, Ameet, 52. Despite my initial reservations about living with someone my own age, I\u2019ve discovered I like our setup far more than I would have imagined. Ameet and I often share meals together, we have mutual interests and, when I just want to have a chat, he\u2019s available. \u201cThe situation worked out so well that when my 62-year-old partner wanted to move into London to be closer to where I live, I helped to find him a similar arrangement and he now shares with a couple in their sixties. Now I\u2019m helping others to do the same via my website.\u201d In Paddington, west London, more than 20 putative renters and lodgers recently braved the wind and rain to turn up to the first Silver Sharers event, meeting potential matches over a glass of wine and a chat. Noble said: \u201cThis looks like fun \u2013 as if it\u2019s a matchmaking, dating game \u2013 but it\u2019s actually a massive relief for a lot of the people here to realise that they\u2019re not the only person their age to have to rent a room. \u201cOlder people are rightly nervous of using the usual websites to find rooms because of the scams,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, most homeowners on those sites overwhelmingly specify that they only want to live with younger people because most of them are young themselves. \u201cThe feeling can be mutual. A lot of older people don\u2019t want to rent from younger people either because they want their home to be a quiet, sedate space.\u201d The benefits are obvious: the number and proportion of people aged 50+ living in the private rented sector has reached a record high but one third of older private renters have borrowed money or cut back on spending in the last 12 months to meet their payments. At the same time, more than two thirds of homeowners aged over 65 have at least two spare bedrooms, with many not only grateful for the financial help but the company of a like-minded lodger. There is also the question of dignity. Trudy, 68, said she finds having to rent a room a degrading experience. \u201cI\u2019m humiliated by the fact I have to rent at my age but it\u2019s the hand that life has dealt me,\u201d she said. \u201cI owned my own house when I was married but gone are the days when the sale of a family home meant a divorcing couple could buy two smaller properties,\u201d she said. \u201cMy ex-husband and I are both renters now. We had sizeable deposits from the sale of our family home in 2010 but mortgage advisors decided that my single income was too low for a mortgage. In my ex-husband\u2019s case, they said he was just too old for a mortgage.\u201d For Trudy and her generation, renting is often harder than for younger age groups. Their standards are higher and they want secure, long-term arrangements. Niki, 62, sold her flat in Muswell Hill and moved to Cyprus in 2011. When she found herself unable to get work abroad, she returned to the UK. \u201cBecause of ageism in Cyprus, my work just dried up there,\u201d she said. \u201cI came back to the UK but can\u2019t afford to pay rent anywhere central without using up all my savings. \u201cMost adverts on house-sharing websites specify maximum ages of around 40 for tenants. I\u2019m also scared of being scammed on these websites. I want to do what I\u2019m doing tonight: meet a homeowner that I have interests in common with so we can form a long-term, respectful bond.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The eight-year-old has been up since dawn, collecting firewood, fetching water. Now she\u2019s ready for school in a crisp white shirt and navy-blue skirt in her family\u2019s muddy, two-room shack. In the narrow porch there\u2019s a pile of rags, some carrier bags, a few bowls and a couple of plastic chairs. In a UK home it would look like stuff waiting to go to the tip. Here, it represents this family\u2019s entire earthly possessions. Liberia is one of the poorest countries on Earth, and the Kamaras are one of its poorest families. They eke out a living growing vegetables on the land around the shack. In families that hover as close to subsistence as this one, sending their children to school makes little sense. Learning to read and write, to do addition and subtraction, might be an investment in a long-term future, but it doesn\u2019t put food on the table today or tomorrow. And yet Massa is setting off on the 40-minute trek to school. This morning it\u2019s dry: when the rain is pouring down, as it often does at this time of year, Massa carries her uniform in an old carrier bag to keep it dry, and changes into it when she reaches school. As we walk she speaks of the subject she likes best (English), her friends, and how she hopes one day to move to the city. At the Vorkor public school in a village near the regional centre Tubmanburg, smoke is curling from an open-sided \u201ckitchen\u201d, where several women are busy over a fire preparing today\u2019s dinner in vast pots. In a couple of hours\u2019 time, Massa, who has an old margarine tub in her bag, will line up with her classmates to have it filled with rice and beans. At Vorkor, mealtime isn\u2019t just an important part of the pupils\u2019 day: it\u2019s the most important part of the day. And it\u2019s because her family know she will receive a nutritious meal here that they make sure Massa never misses school. Three thousand miles away, at roughly the same time, pupils at Good Shepherd primary in west London are also sitting down to their lunch; and though they don\u2019t know Massa and haven\u2019t even heard of Vorkor school, pupils at the two schools are crucially connected. Because students at Good Shepherd are fundraisers for Mary\u2019s Meals, the NGO that funds school dinners at Vorkor and 2,357 other schools in 18 countries across the world. And while the charity\u2019s supporters come from across the entire community, in the UK and elsewhere, there\u2019s something particularly heartwarming about the idea of kids in one part of the world trying to make things fairer for children somewhere else. That\u2019s very much how it\u2019s seen at Good Shepherd primary, according to the school\u2019s headteacher, Imogen Lavelle. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s our duty to help schools in countries such as Liberia,\u201d she says. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve raised more than \u00a33,000 \u2013 the children have had own-clothes days, wear-your-pyjamas-to-school days, cake sales.\u201d That \u00a33,000 will go a long way: it costs Mary\u2019s Meals the astonishingly small sum of \u00a313.90 to feed a child for a whole school year, so the Good Shepherd is feeding a school of roughly the same sort of size as it is, around 250 pupils, from one end of the academic year to the other. That means a lot to Good Shepherd pupils such as Nathan Olano, 10, who\u2019s in Year 6. \u201cWe know how hard it would be to do our lessons without our school dinner,\u201d he says. And indeed, research for Mary\u2019s Meals among the schools where it is working bears this out: in one survey, the percentage of teachers agreeing that \u201cchildren in my class never complain of hunger\u201d increased from 7% to 87% after the introduction of Mary\u2019s Meals, while 98% of pupils said they found it easier to concentrate on their lessons once they had a full stomach. It gives children at Good Shepherd plenty of food for thought. \u201cI sometimes think about what it would be like to go to school and get no lunch,\u201d says Nathan\u2019s classmate Darcie Meade, also 10. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019ve had no breakfast either. Raising money for schoolchildren in countries like Liberia has made me a lot more aware of how the world is stacked against some communities.\u201d Evi Chaudhari, also 10, says it\u2019s given her hope \u2013 not just for children like Massa, but for her entire generation across the planet. \u201cIt makes me feel that if we can change the world while we\u2019re still kids, how much more can we do when we\u2019re older?\u201d Mary\u2019s Meals operates on a simple model. It was in Malawi in 2002 that a former fish farmer called Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, who\u2019d reinvented himself as an aid worker, had a conversation with a boy whose mother was dying of an Aids-related illness. MacFarlane-Barrow asked what he could do to help, and the boy replied that what he needed was easy: food to eat, and a school to go to. MacFarlane-Barrow launched Mary\u2019s Meals as a result. It now feeds more than 1.5 million children daily, with a budget of around \u00a326m, almost 90% of which comes from donations. \u201cOne meal for one child costs just 7p \u2013 that\u2019s pocket money even the youngest children have,\u201d says Kim Webster, a spokesperson for Mary\u2019s Meals. At a time when development often seems overwhelmingly complex and expensive, the easy digestibility and comparative cheapness of the need to feed and educate children is a big part of its success. And Mary\u2019s Meals manages to keep overheads low by recruiting volunteers \u2013 in practice these are usually mothers or grandmothers with kids in the relevant school \u2013 to run their kitchens. There\u2019s still, though, a long way to go. Unesco estimates that across the world 258 million children between the ages of six and 17 miss out on school because of poverty. It\u2019s children who bear the brunt of global poverty, every which way you look: they make up 30% of the world\u2019s population, but account for 50% of its poorest people. Many of these children are in Africa, where 228 million live in what the UN classes as extreme poverty; in sub-Saharan Africa, one child in three is stunted due to malnutrition. Even in the regions and schools that Mary\u2019s Meals support, the terrain and weather conditions sometimes make food deliveries impossible. On one recent morning in Liberia, a river connection to a remote local school was impassable because of rains. Bags of porridge, rice and beans that had been stacked up on the bank for the short voyage were loaded back into a vehicle. Across the water we could see the faces of children who would be getting no school dinner until the water receded. Food is not the only challenge for young people in Liberia. One of the kindergarten children at Kondh school in Bomi County is Blessing Johnson, four. Her mother, Ma-tenneh, died of Ebola the day after she was born; a week later, her father, Molu, died of it, too. Blessing is being raised by her mother\u2019s sister, Zoe, who already has four children of her own; to know her niece is getting fed at school makes a huge difference to the family. Before Ebola, of course, there was civil war, 14 years of it, in which more than 200,000 Liberians died and more than 1 million were uprooted. At another school, there is a boy who\u2019s much older than anyone else called Waharbu Zinah. He\u2019s 19, but he\u2019s only been at school for six years. At the age of three he was kidnapped from his village by soldiers, and even after the war ended in 2003 he was effectively enslaved. \u201cI looked after the man who had been the boss-man of the soldiers; I had to fetch and carry for him,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was just a small kid \u2013 I had no chance on my own.\u201d He finally escaped when he was 13, and settled in Lowah; he works on a farm to support himself. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see my parents again \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea what happened to them. The only way I can have a future is if I provide one for myself \u2013 and I\u2019m doing my best to do that.\u201d Getting fed at school, he tells me, is the deal-breaker that makes it possible for him to afford to be educated, and furthers his dream of one day going to college. Seeing Waharbu\u2019s tall frame squeezed behind a dilapidated desk, paying careful attention to the young man just a few years older than him who\u2019s teaching reading from the school\u2019s single blackboard, is a humbling experience. He may not be the sort of pupil the children at the Good Shepherd have in mind when they\u2019re fundraising, but what Mary\u2019s Meals is offering him is the most important gift of all: a second chance.

Seventy-eight of the UK\u2019s 154 public universities have joined the divestment campaign, either divesting or pledging to divest hundreds of millions from the fossil fuel industry. Although some of the universities have only withdrawn from certain fossil fuels \u2013 such as tar sands or coal \u2013 others have already divested from all fossil fuels as part of what campaigners say it is an accelerating process of delegitimisation of the industry. Chris Saltmarsh from the campaign group People &amp; Planet said excluding the industry from universities was now \u201ca mainstream and majority position\u201d. \u201cThat universities across the sector are now divesting so fully and quickly demonstrates how far the fossil fuel industry\u2019s social license has been eroded over the last seven years. It is increasingly common sense on UK campuses that these companies can play no productive role in solving the climate crisis.\u201d Saltmarsh warned that those institutions that held out against divestment would be harshly judged by history. \u201cUniversities not yet divested can now choose to stand with their students on the right side of history or be forever known as complicit in the crimes of climate breakdown.\u201d In the past year a flurry of major academic institutions \u2013 from University College London to York University \u2013 have pledged to divest completely. However several major universities, including Cambridge, are still subject to vociferous campaigns by students and staff over their links to the fossil fuel industry. A Guardian investigation last year revealed that just 20 fossil fuel giants are linked to a third of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis. And as awareness of the industry\u2019s role in the climate crisis has grown, it has come under growing pressure in the UK with leading arts institutions facing calls to end their sponsorship deals and protesters targeting individual companies. Saltmarsh said: \u201cWildfires are wreaking destruction across Australia, the Amazon and beyond while fossil fuel companies profit from the extraction to blame for this devastation.

The turn of a decade is always a great time for taking stock, for predictions and forecasts about the new era to come. In case you missed it, the Upside published its review of the super-trends of 2010s over the Christmas period \u2013 and asked readers what they thought the dominating tendencies of the 2020s would be. There were some thought-provoking responses. John Simke predicted that the 2020s would mark the end of seven decades of overenthusiastic consumerism: By 2030, buying consumer goods will not only be looked down on, increasingly it will not be done, particularly in the \u201crich\u201d world. This will go far beyond \u201cconscious consumption\u201d to complete cessation of consumption. This will be led by the younger generation but will be picked up by everyone. Our economy will shift from being consumption led to being savings and investment led, as we spend trillions of dollars on a new energy system and climate change adaptation. Obviously this will be driven by the need to mitigate climate change. Kevin Fisher in Los Angeles forecast a series of \u2018ends\u2019. The end of work as we know it, the end of human contact, the end of disease: I think even in the next decade we will see more and more diseases eradicated completely and as we start to treat illness with in-body genetic engineering we will see hereditary conditions also disappear. Robbie Morrison in Berlin is buoyant about prospects for a more open society: I predict \u201copen\u201d will become a super\u2011trend: more specifically, open civil society organizations \u2026 and open analysis in pursuit of solutions to our existential crisis of sustainability. It was the open\u2011source world that bequeathed the ethos, the community norms, the decision processes, the copyleft and permissive open licensing models, the versioning and issues tracking tools, the concept of predominantly online collaboration, and the web platforms in support. So I see this fledgling super\u2011trend in the raft of new self\u2011organizing civil society communities confronting climate change, including Extinction Rebellion, GermanZero, Fridays for Future, and Scientists for Future. To this end, I\u2019ve embarked on trying to build a community to analyze future zero\u2011carbon energy systems thus, with some background here. And finally, Tom Forster ran through an exotic list of predictions including skyrocketing pet ownership, drug liberalisation, the return of the city state, anti-fashion, nationalist art \u2013 and my own favourite, ocean travel: I think ocean/rail liners will start targeting #generationeasyjet, diversifying their onboard services to subcontract for millennial appetites such as rage rooms, food/beer markets, vegan cuisine, axe throwing, escape games, gin tastings, etc. As for me, I predict a giddy torrent of optimistic journalism.

Automakers GM and Ford made more than 1,500 temporary workers permanent members of staff under a new union deal. British baker Greggs gave its 25,000 staff a bonus of up to \u00a3300 each, as the company continued to thrive. What we liked?

Dulal Mondal, 70, a farmer, points halfway up the tree about two feet off the ground to indicate where the waters came the last time the area flooded. \u201cNext time if heavy rain comes I don\u2019t think water will recede as there is no natural draining or anywhere for it to go,\u201d he says. Mondal lives in the Jessore district of Bangladesh where increased levels of salt in the water, uneven rainfall and flooding are creating great uncertainty for a whole farming community. Bangladesh is one of dozens of countries on the frontline of the climate emergency. Here global heating is no theoretical calamity of the future, but a very real, present danger. By 2050, it is predicted that one in seven people in the country will be displaced by climate breakdown. The sea level is projected to rise by 50cm over this time period and Bangladesh may lose approximately 11% of its land. Deadly storms are usually a question of when, not if. Here, the climate crisis is so palpable that the debate is not about restricting carbon emissions or preventing global warming but about how to adapt to the change and survive in times of unpredictable weather. For example, Mondal says that where once his peers would farm mainly rice, now they have taken to fishing. They use floating cages, allowing fish to breed in a secure area. Also, if water levels rise, the cages will too, so flooding is less of an issue. \u201cAbout 20 to 30 years ago there would be a minimum of two crops per farming family but now because of waterlogging we have no more than one,\u201d he says. Each cage is owned by one home and yields about 15,000 taka (\u00a3135) in additional income for the families a year. It\u2019s also a consistent source of food, which could be vital if natural disaster hits. \u201cIn the last two years there was not too much rain but two years ago we were flooded,\u201d Mondal says. \u201cWe worry about the future. If there is heavy rainfall the water could remain logged for a long period of time and we would have to take shelter on main road. We would stay there with our remaining belongings.\u201d This farming evolution is just one element of a whole range of climate change adaptive practices taking root across southern Bangladesh, an area long prone to cyclones, rising sea levels and drought. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is investment in long-term development, to help people adapt to the effects that climate change is having now and help them to not only survive but thrive in their new climate reality,\u201d said Adib Hossain, the head of programmes implementation at Practical Action, one of the charities helping to make changes. In this part of Bangladesh they have helped introduce effective fertilisers to increase crop growth as well as growing fish in cages and vegetation in sacks or beside rivers \u2013 a novel farming technique known as a \u201cdyke garden\u201d. The cages are made using cheap materials. Bamboo poles form an outer frame that can float and is covered in netting. They have a top cover to prevent fish jumping and escaping, or being caught by birds. With a capacity of one cubic metre, they hold up to 300 fish at a time. These cages are used for two growing seasons each year. The fish can be fed on scraps and waste \u2013 duckweed, oil cake, kitchen waste, rice bran and snails \u2013 and in just a few months they grow to full size. A woman standing beside Mondal goes down in a small wooden boat and pulls up the mesh cage, within which fish jump up and splutter around. She drops the net and they swim around once more. For the worried farmers in this area, the introduction of these cages has been reassuring, a constant amid a lot of inconsistency. In the nearby district of South Atulia another innovative technique has been employed. Land here is being used for fishing, with pools of water separated by a cracked mud path and spiky vegetation. Omal Biswas, 48, has three daughters and an adopted son. He used to farm rice once a year and during the monsoon he would fish in freshwater. Now he is able to make more money with dyke gardening techniques, growing vegetables around pools of water used for fishing. Omal has just harvested a crop, he says. They grow bottle gourd, chillis, indian spinach, red amaranth, sponge gourd, ridge gourd and tomatoes. \u201cBefore this technology was used I would yield around 20-25,000 taka a year but last year I harvested 120,000 taka through using different varieties of vegetables and growing more in the year. \u201cNow I can grow vegetables while fishing but I used to rotate the land. I eat the vegetables too,\u201d he adds. He adds that the additional income helps give them a better quality of life and now he has been able to buy six cows. \u201cThe cost of living is rising and the cost of production is increasing so it is a good portion of revenue,\u201d he says. Practical Action isn\u2019t the only charity supporting farmers. The National Agriculture Technology Program (NATP 2) by the World Bank has also helped people adopt resilient farming methods. Farmers have deployed ancient agricultural methods such as floating beds, which involve sowing crops onto floating islands made of the fast-growing water hyacinth. Crops such as cucumbers, gourds and eggplants flourish. Beds are raised so as to lie above the reach of tidal surges. In between, trenches serve as pools to farm fish and ducks. Others have turned to shrimp farming after land was flooded but Practical Action has helped people do this in a more effective way. Rubina Khatun is one woman who has benefited from this. \u201cThe cyclone affected my family. I swam across flood waters with my two sons and took refuge on the road and sheltered in a shop we own for two months. Then we returned to our home,\u201d she says. Shrimp farming is now a major source of income for her family. The technique used to farm the shrimp more effectively includes using deeper water so the temperature does not change as quickly, and adding a fertiliser made from oil cake, date juice and sugar cane among other things. \u201cI am not sure what I would do without it now,\u201d Khatun says. \u201cBut this type of farming is weather dependent. We need rain. If there is less rainfall salinity increases.\u201d Despite efforts to improve the situation, Bangladesh remains at the mercy of sharp changes in weather patterns. Deep uncertainty persists for millions, even if these newfound techniques are helped to mitigate environmental impact. \u201cI am worried,\u201d Khatun says. \u201cToo much or too little rain, both are problematic.\u201d For her, however, the concept of climate change is a world away. \u201cI can feel it in terms of rain but I am not aware of this. I have heard non-government-organisations talking about it but just as a concept. All I know is shrimp farming is a major source of income out of all the ones remaining, so it\u2019s a reassurance.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The prefecture in north-east Japan will forever be associated with the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on 11 March 2011, but in an ambitious project the local government has vowed to power the region with 100% renewable energy by 2040, compared with 40% today. The 2011 accident, triggered by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, sent large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 residents. The 300bn yen ($2.75bn) project, whose sponsors include the government-owned Development Bank of Japan and Mizuho Bank, will involve the construction of 11 solar and 10 wind farms on abandoned farmland and in mountainous areas by the end of March 2024, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. A 80km grid will connect Fukushima\u2019s power generation with the Tokyo metropolitan area, once heavily dependent on nuclear energy produced at the prefecture\u2019s two atomic plants. When completed, the project will generate up to 600 megawatts of electricity, roughly two-thirds the output of an average nuclear power plant. Despite the Fukushima disaster, the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, Japan\u2019s conservative government is pushing to restart idle reactors. It wants nuclear power, which generated almost a third of the country\u2019s power before Fukushima, to make up between 20% and 22% of its overall energy mix by 2030, drawing criticism from campaigners who say nuclear plants pose a danger given the country\u2019s vulnerability to earthquakes and tsunami. All of Japan\u2019s 54 reactors were shut down after the Fukushima meltdown. Nine reactors are in operation today, having passed stringent safety checks introduced after the disaster. Renewables accounted for 17.4% of Japan\u2019s energy mix in 2018, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, well below countries in Europe. The government iaims to increase this to between 22% and 24% by 2030 a target the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has described as ambitious but which climate campaigners criticise as insufficient. Abe insists nuclear energy will help Japan achieve its carbon dioxide emissions targets and reduce its dependence on imported gas and oil, but his recently appointed environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has called for the country\u2019s nuclear reactors to be scrapped to prevent a repeat of the Fukushima disaster. \u201cWe will be doomed if we allow another nuclear accident to occur. We never know when we\u2019ll have an earthquake,\u201d Koizumi said when he joined Abe\u2019s cabinet in September. The government is unlikely to meet its target of 30 reactor restarts by 2030 given strong local opposition and legal challenges. Japan faces mounting international criticism over its dependence on imported coal and natural gas. It received the \u201cfossil of the day\u201d award from the Climate Action Network at last month\u2019s UN climate change conference in Madrid after its industry minister announced plans to continue using coal-fired power. Japan is the third-biggest importer of coal after India and China, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Its megabanks have been urged to end their financing of coal-fired plants in Vietnam and other developing countries in Asia.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Life for retired opera singers in the house that Verdi built", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/life-for-retired-opera-singers-in-the-house-that-verdi-built", "date": "2020-01-04", "transcript": "Renato Franco Perversi and Irena Domowicz are squabbling over who does the better rendition of the Neapolitan classic, O Sole Mio. Perversi, 87, sings deep, while Domowicz, who says you must never ask a woman her age, immediately replicates the kind of performance she might have given during her career as a mezzo-soprano. \u201cThere is more theatre in here sometimes than in the outside world,\u201d she joked. Hardly surprising. The pair are among the 60 retired opera stars playing out their days in an elegant mansion in Milan founded by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. Verdi, famous for compositions including La Traviata, Aida and Otello, was in his 80s when he conceived the idea of a refuge for musicians who, he said, \u201care not favoured by fortune, or who, when they were young, did not possess the virtue of saving\u201d. He did not want to be thanked for his generosity, and so stipulated that the home be opened after his death. The composer died in 1901, and the first nine guests moved into Casa Verdi a year later. For the next few decades, royalties from Verdi\u2019s 27 works paid for the residents\u2019 keep, including medical costs, and the building\u2019s maintenance. Today most of the costs are covered by investments made by the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation, with residents paying according to their means. \u201cThe motives for which Giuseppe Verdi chose to build this house are still valid,\u201d said Roberto Ruozi, president of the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation. \u201cIn the sense that there are numerous personalities who have dedicated their lives to music, who need to enter into a retirement home as they no longer have the economic means to sustain themselves, or who have complicated family lives.\u201d Over the last 117 years, Casa Verdi has hosted 1,500 guests from across the musical spectrum, some of them famous, others less so. Perversi played the violin at La Scala for 10 years, while Domowicz toured with philharmonic orchestras across the globe. Another resident is 94-year-old Bissy Roman, a musicologist who was teaching well into her 70s. \u201cMusic is my life and I am very lucky to be here with other musicians,\u201d said Roman. Casa Verdi is not so much of a \u201crest home\u201d in the traditional sense. The sound of music is everywhere. On the morning the Guardian visited, guests were wrapping up a singing session around the piano. Instruments fill the rooms, including a wooden spinet gifted to Verdi to practise on as a child, while concerts are a regular occurrence. The home is also a museum to Verdi, containing items of his clothing, letters and paintings he commissioned from poor artists. The composer is nearby, having been laid to rest in Casa Verdi\u2019s courtyard alongside his wife, the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi. When the sculptor and politician, Giulio Monteverde, wrote in a letter to Verdi: \u201cTell me the truth. What is your favourite work?\u201d, the maestro replied: \u201cThe home I built in Milan for retired musicians.\u201d The only big alteration to Casa Verdi came in 1999, when it was opened up to 20 music students, an initiative aimed at assisting young people as well as bringing the generations together. The two groups mix and the older musicians give the young people invaluable guidance. \u201cFor the elderly people, the youngsters are injections of life and vice-versa, for the young people, the elderly are their teachers,\u201d said Ruozi. Roman said that one of the best things about living in Casa Verdi was the students. Among her favourites is Corrado Neri, a 25-year-old singer and composer from Sicily. \u201cWhen I first came to Milan I really struggled to find a place to stay and study,\u201d said Neri, who through Roman\u2019s connections has been collaborating with a music company in New York. \u201cI had applied to Casa Verdi and two years later they called to say there was a place. It was the best thing that could have happened to me. These people are my family and best supporters, I have learned so much from them.\u201d Perversi has been a resident since early 2016. \u201cThere are no words to describe Verdi\u2019s generosity \u2026 we still feel him around us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary place to live, and yes, even though these are our final days, Verdi has given us the possibility to live well.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The 31-year-old has spent the past hour riding prone on a soft-top board at the Wave in Bristol, a new artificial surfing lagoon that caters for people of all abilities and needs. Paralysed from the chest down since she fell from a balcony when she was 22, she credits her passion for water sports and snow sports with fuelling her physical and mental rehabilitation. Yet Elwes, who lives in London, had never before tried surfing. \u201cI love stuff when it\u2019s \u2018on\u2019 the water \u2013 it\u2019s my happy place,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first [after the accident] I was very wobbly but skiing and wakeboarding has given me strength. Most of all it\u2019s helped me mentally, emotionally and with confidence. Having these kinds of experiences is a total gift.\u201d The Wave was conceived by Nick Hounsfield, a former osteopath who is also the director of British Surfing. Opened in October, it is the first wave pool in the UK painstakingly crafted with people with disabilities in mind: smooth access ramps, dedicated changing facilities, beach wheelchairs and specially trained surf coaches are among its features. \u201cFrom day one, our aim was to make sure the space was accessible physically and in terms of culture, to make sure that all people have the same opportunities on site as each other and to normalise being around people who have got physical or mental health issues,\u201d Hounsfield says. By coincidence, half a dozen experienced adaptive surfers, among them men and women with physical, visual and learning impediments, also arrive to surf on the same day as Elwes. Louis Sutton, a 19-year-old who has autism, cerebral atrophy, cerebral palsy and dyspraxia, has come with his mother, Suzanne. Sutton\u2019s combination of illnesses makes it difficult for him to navigate social situations, Suzanne explains, and he lacks the balance and coordination to play sports such as basketball and football. But he surfs with enviable poise and style, carving down the green faces of waves in the advanced section of the lagoon. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why, we don\u2019t know how; all we know is that his physiotherapist has said surfing is now officially part of his treatment. It\u2019s like the messages to the muscles have started working,\u201d she says. Furthermore, regular surfing has a profoundly positive impact on his behaviour and happiness. Academic evidence to support water-based healthcare \u2013 so-called blue health \u2013 is growing, according to Dr Easkey Britton, a marine social scientist who collated the findings of 33 studies featuring more than 2,000 people. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something about [being on, in or near] water that benefits how we feel in our bodies,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the context of a physical disability, it\u2019s the sense of freedom from gravity which takes the pressure off joints. For some amputees it really reduces the dependency on narcotics and pain medication. And mentally, psychologically, it has this huge effect on mood and wellbeing.\u201d Britton ascribes this to the soothing sensation of water over the body and says three publications due out next year will further support the evidence in relation to adaptive surfing, in particular. Cornwall is already ahead of the curve: since 2010, NHS doctors have been prescribing surfing for children who are vulnerable to mental health issues. For Bruno Hansen, a yachtsman and four-time adaptive surfing world champion, the logic is simple: \u201cWe come from a womb where we\u2019re in water and we\u2019re made up of, what, [up to] 75% water? So I think we\u2019re water creatures deep down.\u201d Watching Elwes surf, Hansen recalls how he was paralysed in 1998 in a carjacking in South Africa and, a few years later, paddled into the ocean to drown himself. Instead, he says, he inadvertently caught a wave that \u201crebooted\u201d him. \u201cWhen I broke my back I thought: I can\u2019t surf, I\u2019ve got no job, I can\u2019t captain a boat, and no girl\u2019s ever going to want me \u2013 what\u2019s the point of life?\u201d he says. \u201cBut that all got wiped away by catching one little wave, like these beginner waves. So, to me, the healing power of surfing is way beyond what people realise.\u201d The problem in Britain is that surfing is often inaccessible. Ethan Jolosa, 14, and his mother, Leah, frequently make a three-hour round trip to the Gower Peninsula in Wales, where Ethan learned to surf with supervision from the charity Surfability. \u201cWhen you go to the beach, sometimes they have massive steps, it\u2019s uneven, the shore is a long way away,\u201d Leah says. \u201cBut here [at the Wave] it\u2019s very flat and calm and accessible. They have four lifeguards for each group, they have slipways into the water; they\u2019ve really thought about people\u2019s adaptive needs.\u201d Elwes describes a feeling of empowerment after her surf: she was offered a choice of boards before being safely propelled into whitewater waves by a team of three coaches, who swiftly came to her aid on the sole occasion she wiped out. \u201cIt was truly an inclusive experience,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish the whole world was designed [accessibly] like this.\u201d After two hours in the water, Sutton offers the most telling verdict yet. \u201cIt was good,\u201d he says \u2013 three words that delight his mother because he is usually reluctant to talk to strangers. \u201cSurfing gives him something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes him feel, I don\u2019t know, maybe part of life.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The unsung heroes who really deserve new year honours", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/26/the-unsung-heroes-who-really-deserve-new-years-honours", "date": "2019-12-26", "transcript": "Year-end, and it\u2019s gong season again, another chance for the authorities to confer honours on the prominent, successful people in our society: sports stars and national treasures, cultural bards and civil servants and businesspeople.

Do add your own nominations in the comment thread. Alison Inman Nominated by Leah Jeffery \u201cAlison is the former president of the Chartered institute of Housing, and is a Women\u2019s Aid supporter, tireless carer and champion of women\u2019s rights \u2013 particularly the vulnerable. \u201cI would love to see her in a position to drive the discussion forward in the House of Lords. As the social housing crisis deepens, I think having a voice with real experience would also be beneficial in providing an honest perspective and genuine passion for change.\u201d Calvin Eaton Nominated by Adam Smith \u201cCalvin started a non-profit called 540WMain [as in \u2018540 West Main\u2019] that is located in the Susan B Anthony neighbourhood of Rochester, NY, US. It is a neighbourhood that has a high poverty rate and has a lot of social challenges related to poverty. \u201cThe mission is to enrich the historic district as well as connect greater Rochester to the neighbourhood by curating accessible event space and high impact/low cost single session courses based in the arts, wellness and antiracism. \u201cFrom his humble storefront, he is working to help improve the lives of everyone who lives in that neighbourhood and beyond. He doesn\u2019t let the daunting challenges of poverty stop him. He just opened up his space and works every day to make a positive impact in people\u2019s lives.\u201d Andrew Davis Nominated by Juanita Bullough \u201dSince 1974, my friend Andrew Davis has been running the Wythenshawe Development Trust (now Wilmslow and District Recycling). He drives his van to collect donations of unwanted furniture and goods, which he passes on to the homeless and low-paid in north Manchester and Cheshire. \u201cHe also has stalls at a local market where he offers household goods to the less fortunate, and holds a weekly drop-in session at his HQ in the old scout hut in Lacey Green, Wilmslow. He is helped by a team of volunteers, many of whom are unemployed and/or have mental or physical health issues, giving them a purpose and enabling them to go out and meet people. \u201cHe relies solely on his supporters and odd grant aid and always helps others rather than himself. He deserves a medal \u2013 but if you asked him, what he really would prefer is a few thousand pounds to recondition the engine in his van. And by the way, he\u2019s over 80.\u201d Sixto Rodriguez Nominated by Mallory Bagwell \u201cThe musician Sixto Rodriguez (see the movie Searching for Sugarman), his destiny was out of sync with his fate. Fame and fortune have evaded him for most of his life. He probably won\u2019t accept a knighthood, but for the Queen to receive a \u2018Rodriguez\u2019 award could be every bit as notable. The man has taken nothing yet given the world much.\u201d Anna Tembo Nominated by Zoe Jones \u201cWhat makes Anna truly extraordinary is her role as the vice-secretary of Ongolwe Women\u2019s Development Association. The organisation brings together over 90 women\u2019s groups to share learning, empowering them to take control of their own development and to have a voice in their communities, meaning that Anna\u2019s personal success is radiating out in ripples. \u201cAs well as transforming her own family farm, volunteering in her community and supporting women\u2019s groups across Ongolwe ward, she has started up her own shop, and is in the midst of creating a community Keyhole garden, with the help of her neighbours, for all to use. \u201cHer perseverance in the face of a changing climate is inspiring to us all, and yet volunteers like Anna go largely unrecognised. The hundreds of women that Anna supports gain not just farm skills so they can feed their families all year round, but are also encouraged to set up their own businesses. They gain in confidence and prosperity, participating in decision-making in the home and in their communities. She is a shining example of how development begins within, and how one woman can have an enormous positive impact on those around her, when she has the opportunity to thrive. Andreas Bummel Nominated by John Vlasto \u201cWith very little budget, Andrew Bummel has been quietly advocating a world parliament [via the realistically achievable interim step of a United Nations parliamentary assembly] for over a decade. Despite the nationalist headwinds, he has won the support of the European, Pan-African and Latin American parliaments, and over 1,600 serving and former members of parliaments from all around the world, as well as numerous other notable figures (like the Dalai Lama). \u201cWe, the people of the world, face a global environmental crisis, and [the Upside notwithstanding], we are not tackling it effectively. Our economy has globalised, our impact on the environment has globalised, but our politics remains stubbornly and even increasingly national. National sovereignty was a solution to 17th-century religious wars in Europe, it is not the solution to the 21st-century global environmental crisis. Global problems require global solutions. Solutions, to be effective, must be enforced. Enforcement, to be legitimate, must be with the consent of the people. We need more effective and accountable global governance. We need a world parliament. \u201cAndreas, in his quiet modest way, may be the person who saves the planet. He certainly deserves a knighthood for trying.\u201d Alice Webb Nominated by Hilary Day \u201cAfter losing her job with a big local company through mental ill health, Alice decided to use her talents to set up a self-help, peer-supporting, creative charity offering free workshops for anyone in and around Cambridge dealing with mental health issues. \u201cThe local services for mental health had all but collapsed due to lack of funding, and what there was required referrals from the local NHS services. Alice\u2019s idea sidelined all that \u2013 self-referral was fine, no requirement to sign up for a course and complete it for the statistics, and workshops were free. \u201cRunning on a shoestring for the past nine years, Alice has inspired people to support the charity to give their time and talents, and was offered a home for the workshops in the local Methodist Church. There is also an allotment for gardening and making up vegetable boxes for people in the area who don\u2019t have gardens but who want to grow things. \u201cWhy is all this so special? Because it works. Alice was very clear from the start that the charity should be run by its members for its members. Everyone involved in the charity has to have direct experience of mental ill-health themselves, or through a family member or friend. Members can decide when to attend the workshops and how often to suit their current health condition. \u201cIt works well \u2013 a friendly environment, a chance to chat and socialise, and a reason for leaving the four walls of the house on a regular basis with no demands made of you. The charity offers a chance to build inner strengths and self-confidence through being with other people who understand exactly what you are feeling because they have been there, or somewhere like it, themselves. \u201cMany times, Alice has wanted to stop her work due to her own health needs, but she\u2019s continued and has the love and respect of many in our community. Her story and that of the charity she set up deserve to be told.\u201d John Pilger Nominated by John Powell \u201cJohn Pilger has done a huge amount of work, often at risk to his life, to expose shonky and shoddy politics and politicians. Without his documentaries and newspaper columns we would be much less informed about corruption, including the support, by the CIA, of dictators on all continents. \u201cPilger is a strong critic of American, Australian and British foreign policy, which he considers to be driven by an imperialist agenda. Pilger has also criticised his native country\u2019s treatment of indigenous Australians. He first drew international attention for his reports on the Cambodian genocide.\u201d Max Roser Nominated by arch-optimist David Alcock How about Max Roser and his team at Our World in Data, which exists to conduct research and disseminate data to make progress against the world\u2019s largest problems? And Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling-R\u00f6nnlund, Mikael Arevius and the rest of the team at Gapminder, who are carrying on the legacy of the late Hans Rosling by promoting a fact-based and overwhelmingly positive (they would say \u2018possibilist\u2019) world view [see also their 2018 book Factfulness].\u201d Bridget Nodes Nominated by Lindsay Viljoen \u201cBridget is a volunteer dog walker at the Dogs Trust Shoreham-by-Sea. She is there every off day (she works as a nurse) walking the difficult dogs that the other walkers can\u2019t walk. This provides the staff with precious extra time to spend with the dogs who need more attention.\u201d Matty Healy Nominated by Lisa Gobin \u201cMatty Healy, singer of The 1975, sings about what matters to the youth, and what should matter for everyone: climate change. His collaboration with Greta Thunberg, the single Love It If We Made It \u2026 the world would be a better place if his message got to more people. Keep up the good work, and thank you for reporting what most media don\u2019t cover.\u201d Fadil Elamin Nominated by Christine Ro \u201cFadil Elamin is one of the few children\u2019s dentists in Sudan. He\u2019s working under very challenging circumstances, from political unrest to frequent power outages. So his and colleagues\u2019 research, showing the effectiveness of a dental hack that doesn\u2019t require electricity, is especially useful.\u201d Gina Miller Nominated by Rhiannon Pugh \u201cI would nominate Gina Miller for her brave attempt to uphold British democracy.\u201d Jess Philips Nominated by Mike Moule \u201cI would nominate Jess Phillips for her courage, her honesty and her ability to maintain calm and dignity when all around her the world falls apart. She stands apart from many of our self-serving politicians and is a tribute to those who seek social and political change without reverting to slander.\u201d Martyn Goss Nominated by Liz Vizard \u201cMy nomination is for Martyn Goss, who has recently retired after nearly 30 years working as first social responsibility officer and later director of church and society for the Exeter diocese. Unfailingly committed to justice, peace and care for the environment, he has been and still is an inspiration to Exeter people, of all faiths and none, who care about these issues. He did win a Church Times green champion award in 2017, but if knighthoods were on offer to such as he, he would be a strong contender (though no way would he accept one!).

In an unprecedented act, we are going to tell you about a piece we haven\u2019t even published yet. With the decade about to turn, there have been a slew of articles about how terrible the 2010s were, sort of like the 1970s with extra carbon dioxide or the 1340s without the plague. Ever one to champion the underdog, we asked Guardian writers to look for the silver lining and pinpoint the super-trends of the twenty-tens (for that is what they are called) that were full of progress, promise or at least didn\u2019t result in people calling each other rude names or telling barefaced lies. The answers in no particular order: renewables, streaming, veganism, environmental activism, poverty reduction, smartphones, mental health awareness, trans issues, anti-plastics, women\u2019s sport (particularly football). Read the full piece on Friday 27 December. After two days of Christmas, you\u2019ll want something to cleanse the palate. Back to the here and now. As this is our last newsletter of 2019, we thought we\u2019d do two lists: the best pieces of the week, and the best pieces of the year. So without further ado, this week we gave you: \u2022 The simple fix that helped end the world\u2019s first climate change war. Three-minute read \u2022 Dreaming of a green Christmas. Four-minute read \u2022 We opened our doors to a Syrian refugee family. What happened next? Two-minute read \u2022 An entire series on how to be hopeful. A lifetime\u2019s work \u2022 How I escaped the vicious cycle of homelessness. 90-second read And this year, we particularly enjoyed giving you: \u2022 How to play cricket with only one arm. Five-day test \u2022 The kindest thing I ever saw. Five minutes of life affirming joy \u2022 The rise and rise of Bangladesh. Three-minute read \u2022 The age of the four-day week? Four days \u2022 How to plant billions of trees. Ages Lucky numbers There has been a sharp fall in the number of journalists killed worldwide this year, though 49 is clearly 49 too many. Meanwhile, most indicators affecting the poorest people on the planet are moving in the right direction, according to the World Bank. What we liked A new collaborative US project to examine the homelessness project and tease out solutions. This short piece from CNN on the 71 species discovered in 2019. And the New York Times listed its five heroes of 2019, sort of the Greta Thunbergs you probably haven\u2019t heard of yet. Oh, and this was very Christmassy and uplifting, and nicely written too \u2026 What we heard Last week we asked for your highlights of 2019. Here are a few: When my 11 year-old granddaughter finally reiterated one of my constant comments about (how we should) care about the environment to save it for her children and grandchildren. Unfortunately (her plan) was that she was not going to have any children because of what\u2019s happening today! Fiona Gray It\u2019s been a sublime to ridiculous year for me. Wonderful and a little terrible. My youngest child left home and my son is in London so I sold up, and left Wellington, New Zealand for \u2026 Wellington, Somerset. I was invited by NHS for a routine breast screen about three months after my arrival. I\u2019m careful of my health so along I went. They found a cancer. It\u2019s treatable, I\u2019ve had a small surgery and am now having chemotherapy. It\u2019s not fun. I will need radiation after that. However, work (I\u2019m a mental health nurse) has accommodated me with flexible hours, reduced patient contact and alternative administrative type work. People have been kind and supportive. I facilitate a therapy group at the hospital and now more than ever I\u2019m practicing what I preach \u2013 staying in the moment, self soothing, fully participating in whatever I am doing, radical acceptance. By focusing on others I keep my spirits up. I am so grateful! Thanks NHS! My care has been exemplary. I came across this quote just after my diagnosis: \u201cThe Buddha called sickness, ageing, and death \u2018heavenly messengers\u2019 because they can powerfully guide us toward awakening.\u201d I look forward to the end of my treatment , and the spring, and 2020! Jennifer Davidson, who wins the hole punch prize for best email My first granddaughter was born! Vilma Kalman And finally, we are indebted to Huw Morgan for sending us four Christmas carols, rewritten for an environmentally anxious age.

Where was the Upside? All across this great, good earth, where the vast majority of people lead wholesome, unremarkable lives in the hope that tomorrow will be a bit better than yesterday. Thank you to all of you for reading and supporting The Upside and the Guardian throughout 2019 \u2013 it\u2019s made our work possible.

In the hot Darfur fields farmed by Adam Ali Mohammed, these green shoots are alternating rows of lentils and melons. \u201cWe tried lentils before, but there was not enough water,\u201d the farmer says. Here in the Sahel, water is the key to life, but there is precious little of it \u2013 just 20cm of rain a year \u2013 and it is the source of much of the conflict. The climate crisis is making marginal existences even more fragile. It is no future threat here, with the Sahara marching southwards, temperatures rising and precious annual rains becoming ever more erratic. But a new approach is bearing fruit. The seasonal river that runs by El Fasher, the capital of Sudan\u2019s North Darfur state, has been transformed by community-built weirs. These slow the flow of the rainy season downpours, spreading water and allowing it to seep into the land. Before, just 150 farmers could make a living here: now, 4,000 work the land by the Sail Gedaim weir. Crucially, the weirs are not just promising a more bountiful future, but a more peaceful one. Communities of farmers and nomadic camel herders, deadly enemies during the war, are coming together to plan and build them. This has often meant meeting face to face for the first time since the conflict began in 2003, but recrimination has turned into cooperation over shared water, and even resulted in wedding invitations. \u201cThere was a lot of killing here \u2013 there isn\u2019t enough time to tell you about it all,\u201d says Sheik Abdoelhman Saeed, part of the Sail Gedaim weir committee. \u201cBut now we are planning among ourselves to reach new areas with weirs.\u201d Millet and sorghum were the staples, but Ali Mohammed has been able to expand into cucumbers and okra, lemons and grapefruit, and is trying sunflowers for the first time, all of which are valuable cash crops. \u201cYou give me the seed, and I will test it,\u201d he says. Millions were forced to flee the violence in Darfur that killed as many as 400,000 people during a decade of conflict from 2003. Many people remain in huge camps today. \u201cBut if the fields are green like now, nothing could force me to go anywhere else,\u201d says Ali Mohammed. The weir project on the Wadi El Ku river has also brought women, who do much of the farming work, to the fore. \u201cBefore, I was not able to sit with these men, and to speak like this,\u201d says Azaz Mohammed, as the dam committee from 22 villages meets, sitting on carpets in the shade of a tree and sharing a meal harvested from the surrounding fields. The weirs are a \u201cpioneer project\u201d, says Enaam Ismail Abdalla, director general at the ministry of production in North Darfur, adding that the timing of the rains has completely changed due to climate change. The weirs are enabling people to return to their villages and adapt to the changing climate, which would otherwise drive them away once again, she says. She hopes they will be replicated in other parts of Darfur, Sudan and beyond. The collaborative climate-proofing provided by the Wadi El Ku project shows a way to tackle the complex mix of climate impacts, conflict and migration that are thought to be rising around the world. The Darfur conflict was labelled \u201cthe first climate change war\u201d by some observers, with the then-UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon saying in 2007: \u201cAmid the diverse social and political causes, it began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change.\u201d Research has shown that climate impacts such as drought and increasing temperatures increase the risk of armed struggles, particularly in regions where populations are already divided. Bitter divisions are starting to dissolve 50 miles (80km) north of El Fasher along the Wadi El Ku, where the next phase of the project is taking place. Until very recently, project staff needed a convoy of dozens of heavily armed soldiers to visit. \u201cNow we can go on our own: that is a real sign of improvement,\u201d says Atila Uras, head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Sudan, which oversees the \u20ac16m EU-funded project, which is aiming to help 180,000 people. In the semi-desert encampment of Mamora, the pastoralists are reluctant to talk about the war. But after a traditional greeting meal of camel milk and goat meat inside an ornately decorated tent, Omer Ali Mohammed says: \u201cFor sure, during the conflict there was a breakdown of relations between the different communities.\u201d He is a former member of the Rapid Support Forces, a government paramilitary group that grew out of the Janjaweed militias used by the former Sudanese regime to fight rebels in Darfur. In April, a revolution deposed President Omar al-Bashir after a 30-year rule. He is now in jail in Khartoum and faces genocide charges at the international criminal court in the Hague. \u201cThe government fuelled us to fight against each other, but we have realised we were being misused,\u201d says another Mamora nomad, Mohammed Ahmed. \u201cWe got sick of the conflict. Now we want to live in peace. Our fathers and grandfathers used to live in peace.\u201d The Wadi El Ku project began work in this area in September with a six-day peace conference of seven pastoralist groups and 44 farming villages. \u201cAt first, they were all very angry and shouted a lot. The farmers said these [pastoralists] have killed our people,\u201d says Awadalla Hamid Mohamed, of NGO Practical Action, which is implementing the UNEP project. \u201cBut we gave them time and the tensions slowly reduced. It took two months,\u201d says Hamid Mohamed, who managed to escape from Janjaweed kidnappers nearby in 2015, when working on the early part of the project. \u201cThey realised coexisting was good for them,\u201d he says. The nomads need clear routes for their 600-mile (1,000km) migrations, which were getting blocked by farms, while the farmers need milk, meat and safety for themselves and their crops. The nomads also say that they feel marginalised, with little access to medical care and deaths during childbirth common. The key was enabling the communities to come to an agreement on how to share the water and land. \u201cThere are layers and layers of conflict, so we started with what they could agree on, and everyone agrees there is a problem with the environment, with water by far the biggest priority,\u201d says Uras. \u201cBut if you look like you are dictating things, that is a killer.\u201d The peace meeting led to a breakthrough: for the first time in years, the nomads invited farmers to a wedding in September. More than 800 people attended, including many young people who had never met, with some guests travelling from 25 miles (40km) away. \u201cIt was an opportunity to rebuild the old relations,\u201d says Ibrahim Abdalla, the nasir (leader) of the pastoralists. In nearby Kafod, the hundreds of donkeys gathered on the edge of the town show it is market day. Farmer Abdelrahman Hamad grows potatoes, radishes and onions on the Wadi El Ku, which runs nearby, and says he lost people to the conflict: \u201cBut the project has brought us together. Now I can go to the pastoralists\u2019 area no problem. There were a lot of problems to overcome, of course, but everybody needs peace.\u201d Downstream, at the village of Shagra, a colourful crowd of women and children have gathered to see the star entertainer Sasa. As the crowd processes around her, clicking their fingers above their heads, she sings a favourite tune: \u201cLook at the widows and the little children / They have drained our tears / Forwards, oh Darfur.\u201d The gathering is celebrating 9,000 new trees being planted by a local women\u2019s community association, replacing the many destroyed for firewood during the war. The shady spot is a now a meeting place, and the gum arabic trees a future source of income. \u201cThe men tried to plant trees \u2013 they failed,\u201d says Fathia Hamed Xagod, chair of the women\u2019s association. They lacked the patience, she says. In El Fasher, Fuzia Abass, chair of the Women\u2019s Development Association Network, says the Wadi El Ku project is having a big impact on women\u2019s lives. More widespread access to water means much less time carrying it to their homes, while the greater incomes from the farms means more girls are going to school. \u201cBut while women are doing most of the work, the men are dominant in the decisions,\u201d she says. The Wadi El Ku project has not been trouble-free. In 2018, the long Korga weir, built five miles from El Fasher, was sabotaged. \u201cAll the communities upstream and downstream had agreed to the weir, whether they benefited or not,\u201d said Adam Mali, a member of this weir\u2019s committee. \u201cIt worked really well in the first year and everyone was very happy. But then a few people [downstream] became jealous.\u201d A night-time raid with a mechanical digger fatally weakened the weir. Despite repairs, when the unusually intense rains came this year, the resulting torrent ripped a 50-metre hole in the structure. This ruined its impact and forced farmers to abandon the unwatered fields. The prime suspects were linked to the deposed regime, but with no witnesses, they were released from police custody. But the revolution has brought new people to power. The new deputy wali (governor) of North Darfur, Mohammed Ibrahim Abdelkareem, says: \u201cThis sabotage was a crime. We have issued a decree to protect all the projects \u2013 the current ones and all the future ones.\u201d His office will also fund the restoration of the Korga weir. \u201cThese projects contribute to the repair of Darfur society. Water projects are usually in the areas where the war happened.\u201d This represents a significant change in tone, says Uras: \u201cI have met a few walis, but this is the first time I have heard one talk about peace.\u201d Omer Abdelrahman, at the groundwater and wadi directorate in North Darfur, is clear about the critical importance of such water projects: \u201cWater is the key to our life \u2013 if we are breathing, we need water. If it is not equally shared, then again we will have more war and more killing.\u201d But Hamid Mohamed, from Practical Action, is cautious about the future. \u201cSecurity is 99% better now. But the situation is still fragile \u2013 the tension is still there \u2013 and nobody really knows what is going to happen tomorrow.\u201d \u2022 The UN Environment Programme assisted with travel for the Guardian This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Here's how to make it come true", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/16/dreaming-of-a-green-christmas-heres-how-to-make-it-come-true", "date": "2019-12-16", "transcript": "Are you dreaming of a green Christmas? Households and individuals across the UK are turning their backs on the vulgarity of Christmas consumerism and waste by cutting back on obvious and most visible areas of excess such as unwanted gifts, plastic trees and decorations and unrecyclable wrapping paper. But the scale of our extravagance remains shocking. The Bank of England has calculated that the average UK household will splurge \u00a3800 extra in December on food and drink as well as gifts. Included in this is an average of 17 gifts bought per individual, according to online retailer Amazon. And according to a recent study by waste management company Biffa, the UK creates 30% more waste than usual over Christmas. This includes an estimated 227,000 miles of wrapping paper and 1bn cards that end up in the bin. An estimated 20% of gifts \u2013 some 120m items \u2013 will be headed for landfill on Boxing Day, according to the UK Gift Card &amp; Voucher Association. To make the most of the festive season without costing the earth, there are numerous other steps consumers can take to reduce their mountain of food waste, opt for the most carbon-efficient cooking, lighting and heating and even trim tedious miles spent on the motorway. The charity Oxfam helped blaze a trail with its range of poverty-busting ethical gifts including the \u201cvirtual goat\u201d. Today, there is greater recognition the value of swapping physical gifts for more meaningful and useful experiences, and even investing time in volunteering. Which is more eco-friendly \u2013 a real or an artificial tree? Fresh trees are the more eco-friendly choice, as long as they are from a sustainable source. There are now well over 400 Christmas tree growers across the UK registered with the British Christmas Tree Growers\u2019 Association, where trees are grown to guidelines governing sustainable cultivation. Look also for the FSC certification logo or Soil Association organic certification which means that no pesticides have been used during growing. You could also choose a tree with roots so that it can be replanted and enjoyed year after year. Artificial, plastic trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have less environmental impact than natural alternatives, depending on how they are disposed of. However local charity shops may accept them for resale if they are in good condition. A 2-metre (6.5ft) artificial tree has a carbon footprint equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is burned. Many consumers are also now opting to rent trees \u2013 complete with lights and decorations. Check your local garden centres or plant nursery, which will usually also deliver and collect the tree to save you the hassle. Among alternatives, Waitrose is selling a 30cm-high \u201cedible\u201d rosemary tree, shaped like its traditional counterpart, which can be used as a decoration or a Christmas table centrepiece. Friends of the Earth suggests that in smaller spaces indoor plants such as yucca or palm trees could be perked up with decorations. An estimated 8m trees decorated homes and offices across Britain last year, of which only 10% were recycled. The rest went into landfill, a wasted opportunity to create biomass that would have provided nutrients for depleted soil. Many local authorities and garden centres will be recycling Christmas trees in January. What alternative gifts would be better for the planet? Buy less and buy local. Each Christmas, a staggering 4,000 tonnes of products arrive in the UK by container from China. Presents bought locally means you will be supporting small suppliers and makers, while minimising your carbon footprint. Initiatives such as Small Business Saturday help, but support local retailers at other times too. Through its #AirWeShare campaign the environmental charity Hubbub urges shoppers to consider more environmentally friendly options for online shopping, including switching to a click and collect service to reduce the amount of city centre deliveries. The Carbon Trust says gifts that don\u2019t consume electricity, such as toys and books, tend to have a lower carbon footprint than those that do. Buying good quality toys means they can be passed on to friends, family and charity shops, giving them a second or even a third life. And think whether you have to buy physical gifts? Could you buy an \u201cexperience\u201d instead? Try gift tokens, cinema tickets, museum membership and so on. Sponsor an animal, buy some rainforest to protect, or even have a stab at making your own, including foodie gifts such as chutneys and cookies. Emi Murphy, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cChristmas presents don\u2019t need to cost the earth. By shopping around a little you can find unique gifts that support the fight against the climate crisis, keep plastic out of our oceans and boost tree cover.\u201d Deck the halls with boughs of \u2026 anything eco-friendly? Choose decorations wisely and keep them to use again. As tinsel can\u2019t be recycled, try to limit how much you buy, and keep what you have to use year on year. Most tinsel sold in the UK is made in China (and of dubious quality), although John Lewis\u2019s is made in a factory in Wales (which churns out 12,000km a year, enough if laid end to end to get from the UK to South Africa). Wrapping paper is one of the most wasted materials at Christmas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates that last year\u2019s wasted paper would be enough to wrap up Guernsey. If we all recycled just half the 8,000 tonnes produced we\u2019d save 25,000 trees. When wrapping steer clear of anything shiny, plastic-lined or decorated with glitter, which are not recyclable. Try the \u201cscrunch\u201d test \u2013 anything that doesn\u2019t hold its shape when scrunched into a ball is not recyclable. Use salvageable materials like newspaper, brown paper, textiles, string, raffia (made from bark which regenerates) and vintage ribbon. Wrapping in newspaper (try the distinctive Eyewitness photo double page spread in the middle of the Guardian which my family has been doing for years) looks better than it sounds. Increasingly popular and Instagrammable is wrapping with brightly coloured fabric \u2013 based on the traditional Japanese art of furoshiki. Ditch the commercial Christmas crackers which are typically dusted with glitter (containing microplastics) and contain ghastly plastic toys that nobody wants anyway. Make your own (Lakeland and Hobbycraft do handy packs of \u201cfill your own\u201d) and invite your guests to make their own hats. What\u2019s the best thing to do for homeless people this Christmas? Homelessness has reached epidemic proportions in the UK, where half of the homeless people are in London. Official figures show that at least 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018 \u2013 a 22% increase on the previous year and the largest rise since records began in 2013. Homelessness charities say you can best help by donating directly to them in order to maximise resources. St Mungo\u2019s, for example, says \u00a325 would pay for a health check, \u00a350 could fund a counselling session or \u00a3100 could buy resources for the charity\u2019s Recovery College. Petra Salva, director of rough sleeper services at St Mungo\u2019s, said: \u201cRough sleeping is harmful and dangerous at any time, [but is] increased when temperatures drop dramatically over times such as Christmas. I would encourage people to contact StreetLink to help connect someone with their local service as soon as possible. Giving money and food is a personal choice; we would encourage people to contact charities like St Mungo\u2019s to see how they can help people in the long term.\u201d Where can I volunteer? Check out whether local charities, old people\u2019s homes, homeless shelters and food banks could do with a spare pair of hands. The Trussell Trust welcomes volunteers over Christmas for its 1,200-strong network of food banks across the UK, to help hand out a record number of emergency food parcels. The national food redistribution charity FareShare seeks volunteers at its depots across the UK to help sort food donated by supermarkets and to drive it to recipients such as charities and community projects serving up meals. You can also help FareShare by choosing a green token through its Community Matters \u201cgreen token\u201d scheme on Waitrose.com over Christmas. A similar scheme is FoodCycle, which welcomes volunteers for its 34 projects across the UK. Loneliness is always an issue at Christmas. You can volunteer or donate to Age UK, which says there are 1.4 million \u201cchronically lonely\u201d older people in England alone. What can I do to reduce my carbon footprint in the kitchen? If you are stuck when choosing what to cook, the Carbon Trust points out that turkey has a lower carbon footprint than beef, while vegetarian and vegan options are even lower than that. If you can\u2019t steer clear of red meat make sure it\u2019s British. Don\u2019t overdo the cheeseboard, which has a high carbon footprint. Don\u2019t preheat the oven for too long, or leave it on after the meal is prepared to keep food heated. And eat up those leftovers. What about plastics? It\u2019s hard but not impossible to have a plastics-free Christmas. Food packaging is tricky, but supermarket chain Iceland is offering customers the choice of a plastic-free or reduced plastic packaging Christmas dinner this year. It is selling 18 Christmas products that are completely free from plastic packaging, including stuffing balls and black forest layered pavlova. Selfridges is removing plastic packaging from its own brand range of Christmas food, switching to home compostable alternatives for 90,000 mince pies and 3,000 Christmas cakes. Dispense with plastic cling film by using reusable beeswax-covered cotton cloths, available from Waitrose and Lakeland. And make you sure you recycle aluminium \u2013 popular as mince pie wrappers \u2013 correctly. A new campaign from the Co-op chain aims to stop tonnes of aluminium \u2013 including mince pie wrappers, from being dumped into landfill. Its research shows that more than one in five (22%) of UK adults do not recycle household aluminium and that more than 3,000 tonnes could end up in the general household waste. How can I reduce my travel? Hundreds of thousands of people will be criss-crossing the UK over the holiday, driving significant distances to visit family and friends \u2013 what some environmentalists refer to as \u201clove miles\u201d \u2013 adding to greenhouse gases and congestion. Avoid air travel if at all possible. Where a large number of people are travelling, the Carbon Trust advises people to check to see whether they can share a car or take public transport (though the railways are not for the faint-hearted at this time of year). Use car sharing websites and apps such as Liftshare and GoCarShare \u2013 sharing a journey means a lower carbon footprint for each passenger, less traffic on the roads, splitting fuel costs and hopefully enjoying some company. It urges people to consider a Skype chat rather than a visit. Can I offset my Christmas? Everything seems to be carbon-offsettable these days (you can even offset fake news now by paying to support its antidote \u2013 Guardian journalism). Offsetting Christmas is slightly harder (despite what companies offering opportunities to do so might say). With tree planting all the range now, you could forgo the palaver of getting a Christmas fir and dedicate a tree to a loved one \u2013 it\u2019ll offset some carbon emissions, too. * * * Reading list Turning the Tide on Plastic by Lucy Siegle Veganish by Jack Monroe * * * Useful blogs 21 eco-friendly Christmas tips from Friends of the Earth Plan for a less wasteful Christmas from Recycle Now The Sustainable Christmas Guide from the Sustainable Restaurant Association Organic Gift Guides from the Soil Association", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The Upside's best things that happened in 2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/13/the-best-things-that-happened-in-2019", "date": "2019-12-13", "transcript": "How\u2019s it been for you?

So it IS possible \u2026 Oh, and as pointed out by Beautiful News, everything that kills children is in decline. What we liked In a week, a year, a decade of division, kudos to the BBC\u2019s Crossing Divides series, which found 10 reasons why Brits are actually not that divided. We also liked this New York Times piece about people hosting recently released prisoners to give them a stable re-entry into civilian life. What we heard Our recent piece on biochar generated a prodigious response from you lot. New Yorker Miguel Hoffman wrote in from El Salvador: Biochar can be a wonderful component to a climate change mitigation program. However, it does not make sense, as some would suggest, to grow, kill and then char trees. So, we ask, what other sources could be pyrolysed and charred? The answer just might be at our fingertips and within reach all over the impoverished world. Throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America, stagnant or semi-stagnant lakes, lagoons, canals and reservoirs have become home to massive and persistent infestations of the beautiful violet flowering plant the floating water hyacinth. Why does it reproduce at such great velocity? Because nature assigned it a double role: to suction every type of contaminant in its midst and to absorb all the carbon dioxide it possibly can. Essentially, its purpose in this world is to decontaminate waterways and decarbonise the atmosphere. Not bad for such a maligned \u201cpest\u201d! There is an added bonus to the water hyacinth. The plant has high levels of cellulose, oils and lipids and low level of lignin. The cellulose, oils and lipids are the components for biofuels. The low level of lignin makes the other components accessible for production of a perfect substitute for fossil fuels. Cyrus Forouhar wrote in on a recently revived laptop: I have an idea for what should be covered: The short lifespan of smartphones and laptops that invariably end up in a tip because manufacturers make it hard, or very expensive, to change batteries and carry out repairs, in the expectation that consumers will throw them away and upgrade to the latest offering. Case in point: I have a five-year-old MacBook that was reborn when Apple fitted a new (and expensive) battery. I am pretty sure that in a few years when I have to change the battery again, I will not be able to find a replacement anywhere and a perfectly good machine will end up in a council dump, a huge and unnecessary waste of materials and resources. We need to dramatically slow down strip mining the planet to produce new shiny gadgets. And Bev Colgan from the western US got in touch early with her Christmas wish: Hello Upside Santa, What I would like from you this year is to free up a few elves to start a project that gives low- or no-cost loans and knowhow to people in working-class neighbourhoods like mine for little solar projects. We have so much sun out here in the western US! And here in my neighbourhood are plenty of people who have the skills to build a solar car port to charge an electric car, or install a few solar panels to heat a garage/workshop in the winter, or put in an a solar-powered attic exhaust fan. But they, and I, don\u2019t have the extra couple thousand bucks to pay for materials, or any clue, really, about how to successfully set about it. And most of my neighbours believe that solar is very expensive and only for the rich people. I\u2019d love for your elves to do a successful pilot project and then watch the ripple effect. Saving the planet \u2013 and money \u2013 is always good news. Finally, Dieter Lehmkuhl wrote in from Berlin: I just read your article Good company: the capitalists putting purpose ahead of profit.

In fact, after a short spell in jail, he is back at his home in Amsterdam. \u201cBob is a character from Twin Peaks, a murderer who creeps into the skin of innocent people and makes them do terrible things like murder,\u201d says Koning. \u201cThere\u2019s a Bob in me who says \u2018kill this person\u2019, that sort of thing. If I take my medicines, Bob is quiet.\u201d Koning is a beneficiary of a growing tendency in the Netherlands to avoid jailing people unless it is necessary. One key aspect of this is a prodigious programme of care in the community for people with psychiatric problems. \u201cWe work on two aims: number one, preventing another crime, and then on psychiatric suffering and the social problems that come with it,\u201d says Hommo Folkerts, a forensic psychologist and outreach worker who helps Koning. \u201cWe don\u2019t treat people with just depression \u2013 it\u2019s people with psychotic vulnerability, autism, severe learning difficulties, often in combination with severe personality disorders, addictions, financial problems, no good home or links with family, and often they are traumatised. \u201cNobody would approve of the crimes or violence they have committed, but there is a very sad world behind them. If you want to mend all this, it will take a long time.\u201d In 1988, the UK criminologist David Downes contrasted a relatively humane Dutch prison system favourably against those in England and Wales. Today plummeting prison sentences have left the Netherlands with an unusual problem: it doesn\u2019t have enough inmates to fill its prisons, even after renting out places to Norway and Belgium. Since 2014, 23 prisons have been shut, turning into temporary asylum centres, housing and hotels. The country has Europe\u2019s third-lowest incarceration rate, at 54.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. According to the justice ministry\u2019s WODC Research and Documentation Centre, the number of prison sentences imposed fell from 42,000 in 2008 to 31,000 in 2018 \u2013 along with a two-thirds drop in jail terms for young offenders. Registered crimes plummeted by 40% in the same period, to 785,000 in 2018. Miranda Boone, a professor of criminology at Leiden University, has studied the collapse in the prison population. \u201cThere is no doubt that the prison population has been reduced very significantly in the last 13 years \u2013 an amazing and, in the western world, unparalleled development,\u201d she says. Half of the people in Dutch prisons have received a one-month sentence, she says, and almost half entering detention in 2018 were actually awaiting trial. Experts attribute the decline to a variety of factors, including more sentencing before reaching or outside of the court system \u2013 such as fines \u2013 than other countries and the use of court-ordered mediation. But there is also a special psychological rehabilitation programme known as TBS. \u201cTBS is a rather unique institution in the world,\u201d Boone says. \u201cIn many countries there\u2019s a choice: people can be held accountable for their deeds and are sentenced to prison, or not, and be put in a psychiatric institution. We have a psychiatric institution that is part of the criminal justice system for people who can be held not [accountable] or only partly accountable.\u201d Unlike high-security hospitals in the UK or the Netherlands, TBS has very specific conditions. People must have committed a crime with a minimum prison term of four years and have a high chance of recidivism: the programme works on specifically on their reintegration into society. If this is not deemed possible, or they refuse to cooperate, they can eventually move to a normal high-security hospital and be confined indefinitely. There were 1,300 people detained with a TBS ruling in 2018: people stay in a treatment centre, sometimes after a jail term, and are treated for the psychological conditions that are thought to have played a role in their crime. Every two years, judges assess whether the treatment should be extended, and the average stay is two years. For Bas de Vries, 30, Amsterdam\u2019s Inforsa mental health clinic has helped him to build a life again after a traumatic experience in his past led him to commit a violent, schizophrenic attack. \u201cThe most important thing in TBS is working on yourself to be able to re-enter society,\u201d he says, from his sheltered home attached to the clinic. \u201cI took a really difficult path. I was ashamed of what had happened and I didn\u2019t really talk openly about it. At a certain stage I started to talk about it, and now I am where I am.\u201d Like other TBSers, he has periods of leave, and he now has a paid job and is moving back to his home town and completing a qualification as a personal trainer. \u201cI don\u2019t think stronger prison sentences are black and white,\u201d he says. \u201cIt depends on the person \u2013 some people need it and others don\u2019t.\u201d Melina Rakic, a psychiatrist and director at Inforsa in Amsterdam, says that TBS cases are always complex \u2013 because of psychological disorders but also people\u2019s backgrounds. \u201cA large proportion of cases are \u2018have-nots\u2019. These people are on the one hand extremely dangerous, like the woman this morning, who started a fire for the nth time,\u201d she says. \u201cThey hurt themselves and other people, but these are also people who alongside their personal disorder or psychosis often often grew up with a mother who was an addict and a father who disappeared without a trace, with no money, or no food, or no winter coat \u2026 or nobody who says \u2018it\u2019s cold outside \u2013 take your jacket\u2019. If you don\u2019t have these things as a child, you don\u2019t learn how to make attachments.\u201d It is difficult to compare figures between those sentenced to a jail term and those offered TBS, but in Inforsa\u2019s experience, its treatment has an effect in reducing recidivism. \u201cThere are often calls from broader society or here in the Netherlands that we need to punish people or punish them harder,\u201d says Rakic. \u201cBut we know that for these people, punishment doesn\u2019t help. They end up in prison, they get out, then within a few months they have committed another crime.\u201d Miriam van Driel, De Vries\u2019s TBS psychologist, believes a humane approach is simply the most logical. \u201cThe way you treat people \u2013 also in prison \u2013 makes a big difference in how they return to society,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you treat them like dogs, people will behave like dogs but if you treat them as human beings, they will behave like human beings.\u201d Gijs Weijters, senior researcher in recidivism at the WODC, points out that suspended sentences are becoming more common in the Netherlands, increasing the role of the probation service. \u201cA large proportion of prisoners stay only for a short period and this is now seen as problematic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know that prison is not good for your life, you may lose your job or your house, and it\u2019s questionable if short sentences help.\u201d Other reasons for the decrease are a decline in the numbers of young men, and a sharp decrease in the juvenile crime rate \u2013 partly because of an obligation for police to provide an advocate for arrested juveniles, partly because property is better protected and also, says Weijters, \u201cbecause juveniles spend more and more time online\u201d. However, there are complications. There is a lot of public concern about psychiatric patients who sometimes do not come back from periods of parole, especially after one raped and killed a young woman, Anne Faber, in 2017. A police union has repeatedly raised concerns about crime that is simply unregistered, such as drug crime, and a report in Amsterdam said the city could not tackle drug-related criminal activity. It has led some experts to wonder if the Netherlands\u2019 low prison population might be a result of failures in crime detection. \u201cWe try to give rehabilitation opportunities, through our TBS institution,\u201d says Boone. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t prosecute serious criminal behaviour, then that\u2019s not a reason to be proud.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Unpaid internships combined with skyrocketing rents means often only the wealthy can get a foot in the door and there is a huge lack of diversity \u2013 journalism in Britain is 94% white, 86% university-educated and 55% male. A social enterprise is trying to tackle the problem by matching established journalists who have a spare room with interns who otherwise would not be able to afford accommodation. PressPad has so far supported 50 young journalists, giving them a place to stay during unpaid internships or work experience as well as valuable support and mentorship. It now hopes to crowdfund \u00a330,000 to hire a coordinator to help expand its operation. A large proportion of the UK\u2019s media industry is based in London, where a month\u2019s unpaid internship can cost \u00a31,019 according to research by the Sutton Trust. The BBC journalist Olivia Crellin founded PressPad in 2018 after hearing stories of aspiring journalists unable to afford the costs of starting out. She found that many of her colleagues were keen to improve access to the industry, and a quick Facebook post led to 20 willing hosts. Crellin said: \u201cI had no idea if it would work or if people would be interested in it. Journalists work long hours; it\u2019s a very demanding career. So the idea of taking a complete stranger, including one who is likely younger and in need of mentorship, into your home is quite a big ask.\u201d PressPad has about 150 hosts on its books, all of whom are verified media professionals and will soon undergo DBS checks. Interns get their first two weeks of accommodation for free and are charged \u00a3150 a week after that, half of which is given to the host, but interns can apply for a means-tested bursary if they are unable to afford this. Media organisations can also buy PressPad \u201ccredit\u201d that can be used to fund accommodation for their interns. Annissa Warsame, 20, was one of PressPad\u2019s first interns. She stayed in Greenwich, south-east London with the journalists Kate Middleton and Meirion Jones while she completed an internship at Shine A Light, an investigative journalism project from openDemocracy. Warsame, a history and politics student from Birmingham, said she had no London connections to stay with so discovering PressPad was a stroke of luck. She said: \u201cKate and Meirion knew that they weren\u2019t just offering a place to stay but they were cultivating this experience that would be something I could look back on when I\u2019m hopefully a more established journalist.\u201d Warsame asked for their advice and feedback after work each day and they had Sunday dinner together. She keeps Middleton and Jones updated on her life and has returned to stay with them for another work experience placement. \u201cThey said the door is always open for me. It\u2019s really nice having that kind of connection.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The results are remarkable | Natalie Foster", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/10/town-gives-families-500-dollars-month-results", "date": "2019-12-10", "transcript": "On a recent Saturday morning, for the first time in months, Tomas had time to go to the pool with his kids. He sat at the edge of the water breathing in the smell of chlorine and realized suddenly that his kids had learned to swim, while he had been working. This poolside revelation was generated in no small part with the power of cash. Since February, Tomas and more than 100 other families in Stockton, California, have been receiving $500 a month with no strings attached. The policy experiment is part of the historic Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (Seed) project, led by one of the youngest mayors in America, Michael Tubbs. As the name suggests, this guaranteed income program works to demonstrate what is possible when people who are struggling to make ends meet have the cash on hand they need to feel and be in charge of their own lives \u2013 and the Economic Security Project, the organization I co-founded in 2016, is pleased to be Seed\u2019s first backer. All told, the project will run for 18 months, but we have already gleaned useful insights. With this extra $500, the most valuable thing that people are buying is time. Time to parent, time to rest, time to be part of a community and time to figure out the next move. Tomas had previously been so busy working side gigs he had no time to spend with his kids at the pool. Another participant quit her second job driving for Lyft; simply having one job instead of two opened up all kinds of time and space in her life. That $500 also afforded participants the time they needed to take big steps forward. One participant, Jovan, saved the $500 month after month until he had enough for a down payment on a larger rental home for his family. Sheila used to describe her emotional state as the \u201cstraight line emoji\u201d. With that extra $500 a month, Sheila says that her stress has reduced and her sleep has improved and now she\u2019s the \u201chappy face emoji\u201d. The \u201ctime tax\u201d of poverty is not to be underestimated. People juggle the logistical chaos of holding down multiple jobs. They navigate the financial necessity of overtime. They lose hours to the inefficiencies of public transportation. Five hundred dollars a month doesn\u2019t fix income insecurity or solve important structural problems, but for the majority of families in Seed, that $500 represents a 30% increase in monthly income, and that buys a lot. A big, important and sometimes messy part of why guaranteed income works - and why it\u2019s working in Stockton \u2013 is trust. For the most part, trust in American society works in direct proportion to how much money you have; the larger your bank account, the more trust you are allotted. Our entire social safety net system is largely based on not trusting people who don\u2019t have financial resources. While there is next to no scrutiny about how wealthy people spend their money, there are elaborate rules and mandates about what you buy with your food stamps and who can live with you in government-subsidized housing. The Seed project money comes with no restrictions. Our pilot project is predicated on the idea that people experiencing poverty know best what they need or don\u2019t need, and can be trusted accordingly. It would have been impossible to anticipate the incredibly wide range of things that people did with the money. People put extra food on the table, people moved, people worried a little less and they put in fewer hours at work and a few more hours with their family and friends. One mom bought her daughter a pair of shoes for her birthday, free from worry about whether or not she could afford it. For her, that purchase was about a lot more than shoes \u2013 it was about feeling like a good parent who provides for her child, and there is no government program for that. People are working; the economy isn\u2019t. That imbalance came through loud and clear as we got more information about how the $500 was impacting people\u2019s lives in Stockton. There has been much hyperbolic hand-wringing about how cash transfer programs like Seedwill spur everyone to quit their jobs and no one will work ever again. I think most people would be hard pressed to stand behind that position after hearing from the Stockton participants. In fact, Tomas used the money to buy time to figure out his next career move. He not only spent more time with his kids, he researched, prepared, applied for and got a better-paying, salaried job with real advancement opportunities. There\u2019s no way that he would have had the hours in the day to do that if he didn\u2019t have the extra time and money that came with that prepaid debit card. Monthly guaranteed income is a way to start to rebalance the economy. The majority of Seed participants are working. Of course, a monthly income floor doesn\u2019t solve all America\u2019s problems alone \u2013 it needs to be part of a larger reimagining of our social contract that includes high-quality jobs, stronger unions and reining in the cost of healthcare, education and housing. Big solutions to big problems don\u2019t come out of white papers or speeches, they come from the hard work of organizing, advocating and demonstrating what\u2019s possible. Stockton is now a proving ground for innovative ideas that can be replicated across the country \u2013 keep your eyes on it.

Sound familiar? Still, it\u2019s always inspiring to hear that the Upside is not alone: indeed there is a vibrant ecosystem of local journalists around the world seeking out what works in their community and trying to spread the word. My own particular favourites from this week: Tea after Twelve, a Bonn-based operation which publishes in English; Outlier Media, a community self-help grapevine from Detroit; Rubryka, a promising Kiev-based startup (which is only worth clicking through to if you read Ukrainian). And perhaps boldest of all, Takie Dela, a Russian outlet that connects journalists to social problems and charities trying to fix them, in a media environment that can only be described as hostile. Prague has not deflected us from some meaty journalism this week: it\u2019s been a big year for exploring alternative economics, outdated metrics like GDP, growth and the primacy of profits. So this week we took a look at the 20-year drive for ever lower prices and the lazy assumption that all consumers want is cheap stuff. That\u2019s certainly not the case in France, where Jon Henley uncovered a movement determined to pay fair prices. You\u2019d be surprised just how many French people are on board.

You may be interested to know about the development of Gas groups (Gruppo di Acquisto Solidale, or solidarity-based purchasing) all over Italy, something that started around 20 years ago. Here\u2019s a link (in English). The Gas experience may be worth exploring in a future Upside article. Obviously, Italy\u2019s different from the UK in that many people living in towns and cities still have links to villages where their ancestors came from, thereby facilitating the search for locally-sourced, organic produce. Local GAS groups that source products from areas where there have been earthquakes or other natural disasters often offer a solidarity lifeline by offering stricken producers higher prices so that they can get back on their feet again.

But there is no Wheels on the Bus, no Wind the Bobbin Up. Instead, the women work their way through folk songs, lullabies and gospel, switching from Spanish to Hebrew to Igbo and Zulu and deftly following the group\u2019s leader as she introduces rounds and three-part harmonies. This is a singing class designed not to entertain the babies \u2013 though they are perfectly happy as they chew on miniature maracas \u2013 but for the women themselves. Melodies for Mums, run by the not-for-profit social enterprise Breathe Arts Health Research, aims to help new mothers with postnatal depression (PND), or those at risk of it, combat their symptoms by singing songs specially chosen to improve confidence and help them bond with their babies. No musical experience is necessary. Since the programme began two years ago in Southwark, south-east London, 150 women have taken part. Now it is being expanded to reach hundreds more, as the sessions become part of a big study \u2013 funded by a \u00a32m grant from the Wellcome Trust \u2013 into how arts interventions boost physical and mental health, and how they could be scaled up to become NHS treatments \u201cOur long-term hope is that we can roll this out as a national programme that would be commissioned by the NHS as a new clinical service, so it\u2019s not just seen as a nice, arty project that some mums might do, but as something underpinned by research showing it\u2019s a very effective clinical treatment,\u201d explains Yvonne Farquharson, Breathe\u2019s managing director. That could mean some women with PND wouldn\u2019t need to use other NHS services, saving it money in the long term, she says. Earlier research, which inspired the Breathe programme, found that mothers with moderate to severe symptoms of PND who did group singing saw a significantly faster improvement in their symptoms than a control group. The new study will test the impact and mechanisms involved further, with academics measuring women\u2019s levels of the stress hormone cortisol and the \u201clove hormone\u201d oxytocin to assess bonding with their babies, and evaluating levels of depression, anxiety, coping, loneliness and social support. While some participants have a formal diagnosis of PND, others have milder symptoms. \u201cThey are finding it a struggle to cope,\u201d says the project manager, Tim Osborn. Nine weeks into the current course, the women who speak about their experiences don\u2019t describe themselves as being depressed. But for Bekki, whose son Henry had open heart surgery at 11 days old and spent five weeks in hospital, the sessions have been part of her recovery from that trauma, helping her build a bond she felt she had missed out on. \u201cHe was cared for by a lot of people in those early weeks and I felt like he didn\u2019t necessarily need me,\u201d she says. \u201c[Here] it\u2019s just me and him. It\u2019s like a little escape.\u201d She appreciates the way the singing is for the women, rather than the usual nursery rhymes, and that there\u2019s none of the endless competitiveness of some mum and baby groups. \u201cIt\u2019s like a release of the tension,\u201d she says. Devlin\u2019s daughter Leonora was born weighing just 2.55kg, was not gaining weight and suffered from jaundice. \u201cI was having a lot of anxiety and feeling a lack of control,\u201d she says. Constantly seeing different midwifes who all commented afresh on Leonora\u2019s size only made things worse. \u201cYou\u2019re already feeling really stressed that you\u2019re not doing a good job and then the system is pouring salt in your wounds a little bit,\u201d she says. The singing, she says, helps not just because it gets her out for a walk and into a community, but because it becomes \u201calmost meditative\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re singing these really silly songs, but you don\u2019t have to talk and say, \u2018what\u2019s your problem, why are you here?\u2019 You just share space.\u201d PND affects one in 10 new mothers, and many more suffer from symptoms like anxiety, low mood and struggling to bond with their babies. But they often find effective support is lacking and their symptoms are missed. About a third of the women Breathe screens who are eligible for Melodies for Mums are not in touch with support services, Osborn says. The new research project, run by Kings\u2019s College London and University College London, will be the world\u2019s largest study into the health impact and scalability of arts interventions. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing growing interest in using the arts for supporting mental and physical health,\u201d says Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL, and one of the leaders of the Melodies for Mums strand (others will look at stroke and Parkinson\u2019s disease). \u201cThere\u2019s a wealth of anthropological and psychological research on the benefits of singing for individual mental health, mother-infant interactions and infant development.\u201d A recent study with older people in Kent found group singing had a significant effect on mental health and quality of life, including reducing anxiety, depression and loneliness. At the children\u2019s centre, Farquharson says the difference in the women is noticeable as the course progresses. \u201cYou start to see a spark in their eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cFriendships blossom, people walk in with their heads held higher.\u201d Hannah, who signed up after struggling with breastfeeding and her son Kit\u2019s sleep, admits she was sceptical about whether singing would make her feel better. \u201cBut actually it really does,\u201d she says, as she prepares to head out into the dark of the late afternoon. \u201cYou really do feel lifted by the end. A bit lighter.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

They found the health benefits of clean air were \u201calmost immediate and substantial\u201d and stretched into the long term, saving billions of dollars. The review examined the evidence for the reduction of illness after levels of toxic air were reduced. It showed dramatic reductions in asthma and children missing school, heart attacks and the number of small and premature babies. \u201cI was surprised at how rapidly the benefits arise,\u201d said Prof Dean Schraufnagel, at the University of Illinois at Chicago and lead author of the report. \u201cOur findings indicate almost immediate and substantial effects. It is critical that governments adopt and enforce World Health Organization guidelines for air pollution immediately. \u201cSweeping policies affecting a whole country can reduce mortality within weeks. Local programmes, such as reducing traffic, have also promptly improved many health measures.\u201d Schraufnagel said the findings made sense. With coronary heart disease, for example, low oxygen levels are a key factor and can be made worse by a bad air day. \u201cThat could tip you over and cause a heart attack immediately,\u201d he said. The researchers also said health benefits accrued, even when air pollution below WHO levels were cut. A global review earlier in the year concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. The World Health Organization says air pollution is a \u201csilent public health emergency\u201d, with more than 90% of the world\u2019s population breathing toxic air. The report, published in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society by international experts from the Forum of International Respiratory Societies, found the benefits of cleaner air begin in the first week. When indoor smoking was banned in Ireland, the reduction in secondhand smoke led to deaths across the entire population falling 13%, heart attacks by 26% and strokes by 32%. After a 17-day traffic shutdown in parts of Atlanta during the 1996 Olympic Games, children\u2019s visits to clinics for asthma dropped by more than 40% and to emergency departments by 11%, the report found. Factory and traffic shutdowns two months ahead of the Beijing Olympics also cut asthma and heart attacks. Other industry shutdowns have had dramatic effects, the scientists said. An eight-month smelters\u2019 strike in the south-western US caused overall death rates to drop by 2.5%, while a 13-month closure of a Utah steel mill resulted in hospitalisations for pneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis and asthma being cut by about half, and days of school missed by children fell by 40%. Women who were pregnant during the mill closure were less also likely to have premature births. Indoor air pollution from solid fuel burning was a serious hazard too, and pregnant women in Nigeria given clean-burning stoves had healthier babies and fewer deaths in the first week of the baby\u2019s life. The benefits of cutting air pollution persist in the longer term and is very cost effective, the researchers said. The US Clean Air Act is estimated to have saved $2tn in the 25 years after it became law, 32 times more than associated costs. \u201cWhat are we waiting for? Here\u2019s the evidence,\u201d Schraufnagel said. \u201cIf it is competing interests or commercialism [blocking action] then we have to tell the people, and the people then can come out strongly and tell politicians we want cleaner air.\u201d He said legal air pollution limits exist in many countries but that enforcement is often poor. Levels of nitrogen dioxide in the UK, emitted mainly by diesel vehicles, have been illegally high in most urban areas since 2010. But despite the government having been defeated three times in the high court on the issue, relatively little progress has been made. Schraufnagel said the biggest health benefits came from tackling the biggest pollution problems. However, reductions in toxic air, even below WHO guidelines, continued to cut disease.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How millions of French shoppers are rejecting cut-price capitalism", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/04/french-shoppers-rejecting-cut-price-capitalism-nicolas-chabanne", "date": "2019-12-04", "transcript": "The biggest-selling new food brand in French commercial history began life four years ago with a simple sum. Nicolas Chabanne was trying, without much success, to persuade supermarkets to sell less-than-perfect fruit and veg. \u201cSomeone said, would I please have a look at milk,\u201d Chabanne said. \u201cSo I did. It was an absolute disaster. Dairy farmers were desperate, losing money on every litre; prices were being driven down mercilessly by the big retail groups.\u201d Chabanne did the arithmetic: a mere eight cents (6.8p) a litre was the difference between a milk producer going bust (or worse: the suicide rate among French dairy farmers is 30% higher than in the general population) and making a decent living. \u201cThe average French consumer buys 50 litres of milk a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat meant that if consumers spent just \u20ac4 more on their milk per year, the producer might actually survive. I was convinced people would be prepared to do that.\u201d His hunch has proved right. French consumers have bought 123m litres of milk labelled C\u2019est qui le patron?! (Who\u2019s the boss?) since its launch in November 2016, making it the fourth-biggest milk brand in France, outsold only by the most cut-price supermarket-own brands. CQLP, run by a cooperative of 7,500 members who have each paid \u20ac1 to join, sets more than just the price of its products. From honey to steak, flour to apple juice and sardines to chocolate, the 30-plus similarly sustainable lines it has launched so far are produced to specifications decided democratically by consumers. Many have enjoyed remarkable success, with overall sales exceeding their target 10 times over, Chabanne said. CQLP\u2019s organic butter has become the country\u2019s most popular brand and the fastest-growing new organic product in France; its free-range eggs, launched in January last year, ditto. As with all of the cooperative\u2019s products, neither was advertised on TV, promoted in-store or pushed by a sales team. The movement is a response to the long-term squeeze that big retailers have been able to put on suppliers in many developed economies over the past two decades. The competition for space in supermarkets is so intense that farmers often find themselves accepting derisory prices for their produce. In Paris last week angry farmers blocked roads and faced off against police as 1,000 tractors from across northern France tried to converge on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in a protest aimed at putting pressure on supermarket chains ahead of annual price talks. Demanding an urgent meeting with President Emmanuel Macron and government action against falling supermarket prices, rising costs and cheap imports, unions said in some regions one in three French farms were operating at a loss or only just breaking even. Consumer revolt The basic assumption by supermarkets is that all consumers want competitively priced produce. The cheaper, the better. CQLP might have just rewritten that rule. In just three years, CQLP has won over nearly 11.5 million French consumers \u2013 about one in five adults. It has also boosted the incomes of more than 3,000 farmers and manufacturers, all of whom benefit from the pledge emblazoned in big, bold capitals on the brand\u2019s packaging: \u201cThis product pays its producer a fair price.\u201d \u201cI have to say this doesn\u2019t feel like a fad,\u201d said Chabanne, 50, who talks with almost evangelical conviction about the movement. \u201cI do think we\u2019re talking here about a fairly profound shift in consumer attitudes \u2013 a realisation, essentially, that the big supermarket chains had forgotten what really matters.\u201d Unarguably, \u201ca whole lot of consumers now want to behave more responsibly\u201d, he said. \u201cThey would prefer, if possible, to buy healthy, quality food, produced ethically, transparently and with respect for animal welfare and the environment by people who get a fair price for it. And they\u2019re willing to pay a bit more for that.\u201d C\u2019est qui le patron?! is \u201cbasically about consumers both taking control of what\u2019s on our plates, and supporting producers\u201d, he said. \u201cThere will always be people, for all kinds of reasons, for whom price matters most. But there are also more and more who feel maybe slightly guilty when they shop for food \u2013 and would like to do better.\u201d The idea is not completely new, with echoes of the fair trade movement that rose to prominence towards the end of the last century. The brand effectively applies the principles of fair trade, usually associated with developing countries, to a domestic market. It is a concept with proven appeal: roughly $9bn worth of Fairtrade products were sold globally in 2017, sourced from 1.66 million farmers, with 2,400 companies, including major multinationals, paying licence fees to their national Fairtrade chapters to use the mark on their products. C\u2019est qui le patron?! sees international potential in its brand. It is early days, but Eat\u2019s my choice in the US, Wie is de baas? in Belgium, \u00bfQuien es el jefe? in Spain and, in the UK, The Consumer Brand are all now in varying stages of their development. \u201cBritain has exactly the same supply-chain issues as France,\u201d said David Poussier, who heads the UK operation, which aims to have its first product questionnaires ready by mid-December. \u201cFood retail is a massively opaque business, consumers are growing more and more aware, and many have real questions about what they\u2019re buying.\u201d He pictures the brand\u2019s archetypal target customer as \u201cperhaps the couple in their mid-30s, working parents, young kids, highly conscious of the climate crisis, the need to eat healthily, of animal welfare, single-use plastics in packaging, the plight of the farmer \u2026 but maybe unable to afford full organic. Well, we\u2019re the answer.\u201d Poussier said he has had an overwhelmingly positive response already from UK producers \u2013 particularly smaller farmers and food-processing companies who maybe cannot sell all their output on the local market, but are wary of dealings with big supermarket chains. To develop each new product, CQLP asks consumers to vote from a list of potential lines on its website: current options include salt, rice, mustard, olives and tinned tuna. Once a product is selected, consumers decide on its specifications, packaging and price by completing a multiple-choice questionnaire. For CQLP potatoes, for example, consumers, armed with an online briefing on the basics of potato production, must choose where and under what conditions they want them grown and stored, whether they should be organic, what the sacks should be made of (plastic or paper) and the price the producer should get: market, break-even, fair or \u201cpermitting investment\u201d. Every decision is made by a majority of votes cast online, with the cooperative\u2019s paid-up members, who set the key parameters and overall direction, each having one vote just like everyone else. CQLP covers its core running costs \u2013 relations with producers and retailers, quality control \u2013 with a flat levy of five cents on every euro earned. Chabanne could ask for no greater validation of his idea than the fact that all bar one of France\u2019s notoriously aggressive, commercially cut-throat supermarket chains are now convinced of CQLP\u2019s approach and stock its products \u2013 and that some of Europe\u2019s biggest food multinationals, giants such as Danone and Nestl\u00e9, are in talks to develop CQLP-label products based on the same core principles. \u201cIt took a little while,\u201d said Chabanne. \u201cBut in the end they got it pretty quickly. At the end of the day, we answered a lot of questions they were asking about consumer behaviour. Ultimately, this newfound desire of consumers to make sense of what they eat \u2013 literally, to help create it \u2013 has an unarguable logic. And the success of the products themselves did the rest.\u201d Back in France, Chabanne is working on the next move. CQLP already has an app that allows consumers to locate its products in nearby shops \u2013 and ask managers to stock them if they don\u2019t. He now wants to go further, with another app that will allow users to scan thousands of non-CQLP products and check them against the cooperative\u2019s standards, as assessed by volunteer panels of expert consumers. Even if the process can necessarily only work with firms that agree to it, many \u2013 given the brand\u2019s success \u2013 appear likely to do so. Long-term, Chabanne hopes the app will change big food\u2019s behaviour. \u201cThey will learn clearly, unambiguously, what consumers want and expect of their products,\u201d Chabanne said. \u201cIt\u2019s a logical next step, because what drives CQLP is this goodwill army of consumers, hundreds and thousands of active volunteer ambassadors, who share, inform, pass on, visit stores, talk to managers, hang out with producers \u2013 who, basically, have decided, together, that things have to change.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Biochar may not be a silver bullet to combating the climate emergency, but it certainly ticks a lot of boxes. A form of charcoal created via a special chemical process, biochar is not much to look at, resembling the aftermath of a particularly good barbecue. But it is already heating homes in Stockholm, feeding cows in Lincolnshire, and nourishing trees near Loch Ness. \u201cWhen you look at the range of benefits it has, it is quite phenomenal,\u201d says Marc Redmile-Gordon, senior scientist for soil and climate change at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). While stressing that biochar is only part of the solution, he adds: \u201cIf we stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow, we\u2019ll still have a lot of carbon dioxide removal to be doing, and this is one of the most effective ways we can achieve that.\u201d Following biochar\u2019s recognition in the IPCC 2018 report, earlier this year Redmile-Gordon launched the society\u2019s first trials to see how the material could improve plant growth. He estimates planting 10-20kg of biochar in your garden could offset the carbon from a five-mile return commute in a car for a month. Biochar is a form of charcoal produced when organic matter \u2013 for example wood, leaves or dead plants \u2013 is heated at high temperatures with little or no oxygen in a process called pyrolysis. The normal burning or decomposition of these materials would release large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Instead, creating biochar traps this carbon in solid form for centuries; it becomes a carbon sink that can be buried underground. This is nothing new \u2013 in Stockholm they have already developed technology to trap the heat generated in the process and put it to use, so now the focus is on what benefits biochar can bring once it is in the ground. Although results vary depending on the type of biochar and soil used, Redmile-Gordon says this stuff can \u201calleviate some of the stresses that come from climate change\u201d. Biochar is full of xylem vessels and capillaries \u2013 channels that \u201ccan carry nutrients, air, water and house the biology that make for a healthy soil ecosystem\u201d, he says. This means that in waterlogged clay soil it can reduce and redistribute water content, whereas in sandy soil affected by drought it can increase water-hold potential. While scientific research has established the benefits of biochar in theory, deploying it in a way that makes a real difference is a challenge. One of its most obvious uses is in tree planting, which is poised to become a major activity in the UK over the coming years. The Conservatives have pledged to plant 30m trees a year, the Liberal Democrats have promised 60m a year, while Labour\u2019s manifesto pledges an ambitious tree-planting programme. \u201cThey bandy around these big numbers, but will they actually talk about the survival rates?\u201d asks James MacPhail, commercial director of Carbon Gold, which sells biochar products for use in soil everywhere, from people\u2019s back gardens to Ascot racecourse. Up to 80% of trees planted along the HS2 rail route died after last summer\u2019s drought. For MacPhail, this suggests not enough is being done to ensure tree growth: \u201cIf you plant 1m trees, great, but if 800,000 die, was it really worth it? If you can just do one thing to guarantee the survival of a tree going in the ground then maybe trees can save the planet.\u201d Research suggests biochar could be just the thing. Dr Saran Sohi leads the UK Biochar Research Centre in Edinburgh which is injecting biochar made from forestry residue such as bark around tree roots as part of a tree-planting project near Loch Ness. \u201cIt really does seem to offer some quite marked benefits in terms of tree health, early stage growth and nutrient management,\u201d says Sohi. \u201cTurning this particular part of the tree into biochar allows the nutrients to be returned to the forest sites in the process of replanting.\u201d Other projects are making strides in integrating biochar into farming, too. Richard Copley is part of the Innovative Farmers network, and received funding to trial feeding biochar to some of his cows this year. As both a farmer and a tree surgeon, Copley was keen to use the waste from his tree felling in a useful way, and he noticed the positive effects of biochar on his animals immediately. Biochar is alkaline, so it balances the highly acidic diet of cows. Evidence suggests it is beneficial for microbial activity \u2013 like putting a probiotic into your stomach, according to Copley. Trials elsewhere have suggested biochar could reduce methane emissions, something Copley hopes can be explored later, as well as trialling the material on other animals such as chicken and sheep. Meanwhile, Donna Udall, a researcher from Coventry University, is exploring whether manure from the biochar-fed cows is more effective as a fertiliser than biochar by itself. In some instances biochar can reduce crop yield by absorbing the nutrients needed by the plants \u2013 biochar as part of manure could be the solution. While academics and researchers are optimistic about the benefits of biochar, they are not blind to the risks either. \u201cIf we\u2019re wrong, and we spread hundreds of thousands of tonnes of charcoal over the UK, we can\u2019t get it back out of the ground. We\u2019ve got to be right. The stakes are really high,\u201d says Udall. Sohi adds: \u201cThis makes the government a bit anxious, which is why I think starting slowly and getting comfortable with the technology first is probably a good idea.\u201d Not only that, but there are also practical problems with trying to acquire the vast amounts of biochar needed to make a real impact. Udall says: \u201cIn order to scale up the technology, you\u2019d have to plant woods everywhere, and obviously you can understand the impact that would have on the land that we need to grow crops.\u201d Only when farmers, food producers and other industries start putting their biomass waste through a pyrolysis process as standard would there be enough biochar to roll it out on a wide scale, says Udall. But eventually biochar could be made from green waste in urban areas \u2013 everything right down to the banana skin lying on your desk, she adds. The key is working out how the source material affects the resulting biochar after pyrolysis, something which still needs substantial investigation. But with some estimates suggesting biochar could offset 1bn tonnes of carbon a year, it\u2019s easy to see why people are getting excited about it. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 November to make clear that Marc Redmile-Gordon emphasised that biochar has the potential to alleviate some, but not all, of the stresses of climate change", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Buy Nowt protest urges Yorkshire shoppers to ignore Black Friday", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/28/buy-nowt-protest-urges-yorkshire-shoppers-to-ignore-black-friday", "date": "2019-11-28", "transcript": "It was six years ago that the American shopping concept of Black Friday really took off in the UK, when a woman trying to get a cheap TV in a Belfast branch of Asda broke her arm in a stampede.

Now one city in Yorkshire is fighting back against the pressure-selling \u201cshopocalypse\u201d. Buy Nowt Friday in Bradford encourages residents to enjoy a day without spending any money. The event, at the former Forster\u2019s Bistro in Centenary Square, is hosted by Bradford Credit Union and the art charity Artworks Creative Communities, which four years ago came up with the idea of creating a Currency Free Zone on Black Friday. This year they are also putting on a free event in nearby Keighley on what has become known as Cyber Monday. Black Friday began in the US in the 1960s, pushed by retailers keen to encourage consumers to begin their Christmas shopping early, the day after Thanksgiving. Opponents to the concept came up with International Buy Nothing Day, a protest against consumerism that spread to the UK under the banner \u201cEscape the shopocalypse\u201d. It encouraged consumers to swerve the \u201cabsurd dystopian phenomenon\u201d and the \u201crabid free-for-all\u201d that had created a \u201cbrand of shoppers who will trample and fight each other to get their hands on next year\u2019s landfill\u201d. Ian Brewer, a financial inclusion officer at Bradford Credit Union, said Buy Nowt Day was Yorkshire\u2019s riposte to Black Friday and aimed to encourage people to save their money rather than spend it on things they didn\u2019t need. People on lower incomes could feel under pressure to take advantage of the offers, he said. \u201cPeople feel disenfranchised if they are seeing all of these discounts and they can\u2019t partake, so we are offering the chance to come down and make Christmas cards, do other crafts and listen to music, as well as get debt advice.\u201d A band called Issimo will play a set, including a track called Money, about the victim of a loan shark. Brewer stressed the event was not anti-business. \u201cWe are not anti people taking advantage of the discounts on Black Friday. We are just saying: do a budget beforehand. Work out what money you\u2019ve got between now and Christmas. If you\u2019ve got disposable income and you want to take advantage of Black Friday, great.

It met its 2020 target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26% four years early; more than 40% of all journeys in Nottingham are made on public transport and solar panels have been installed on more than 4,000 council houses. Energy consumption of council buildings has been cut by 39% and it is on track to generate 20% of its energy from low-carbon sources by next year. And last year the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded that the city\u2019s air pollution had fallen so much that a Clean Air Zone was not needed. The council\u2019s vision and tenacity was recognised on Tuesday night when it was named the overall winner in the Guardian\u2019s Public Service Awards. \u201cThis has been the year when argument over the climate crisis finally ended and the imperative for radical action became widely understood,\u201d says the Guardian\u2019s public services editor, David Brindle. \u201cMany public services are still barely off the starting blocks in the race to tackle the emergency, but Nottingham has shown what can be done through inspired leadership and gritty determination,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cIn scrutinising every aspect of its own practice, and taking bold steps to shape behaviour in the wider community, the city council has truly set the bar for excellence in how public agencies must respond to the threat to the planet.\u201d Making the carbon neutral commitment was only possible, says Sally Longford, the Labour council\u2019s deputy leader and portfolio holder for energy and environment, because of the work that had gone before \u2013 especially the efforts of her predecessor in the environment role, councillor Alan Clark, who died in 2017. \u201cHe was determined to make progress and drove forward quite a lot of the early development,\u201d says Longford. \u201cWe got a lot of stick over the years. People thought we were anti-car, because we introduced various schemes to try and reduce car usage and congestion.\u201d But it has paid off. \u201cWhen I was talking to the officers about how far we could push this they were confident we could go further than other councils because of all the work we\u2019d already done.\u201d One policy in particular, its workplace parking levy (WPL), was a \u201cgamechanger\u201d according to Longford. Introduced in 2012, the WPL is aimed at employers providing 11 or more commuter parking spaces, with an annual rate of \u00a3415 per space. It is still the only such scheme in the UK and has not only tackled congestion and pollution but netted the council \u00a361m for improving and \u201cgreening\u201d public transport. That money has helped with the redevelopment of Nottingham station, an expansion of the tram network that runs on green electricity from the council\u2019s own energy company, and the council\u2019s fleet of 58 electric buses that has reduced carbon emissions by more than 1,050 tonnes. \u201cWe have a positive attitude to these things because they pay for themselves,\u201d says Longford. \u201cWe\u2019re putting solar panels on anything that doesn\u2019t move, really, because it saves us money in the long run and helps support other work we\u2019re doing.\u201d The energy and transport teams have won funding from central government, Europe and other sources, and the savings the energy team generates means it actually makes a profit for the council that can be used to cross-subsidise crucial departments such as children\u2019s services. Next year the council will be going out across the city to talk about what it is doing. \u201cWe have a lot of people who live in quite deprived circumstances and it\u2019s not their highest priority,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to pay their bills and feed their families, but they will also be the people who will be the least able to cope in warmer climates. We have a duty to help people in all parts of the city adapt and find ways to improve their lifestyle.\u201d Nottingham\u2019s policies have not only benefited the environment but have also made a difference to people\u2019s lives, says Longford. \u201cA lot of quite hard decisions were made but people have been brave enough to give it a go. I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Climate champions runners-up Mayfield and Easthouses Development Trust: River Esk cleanup project \u201cWhat has wings and spends most of its lifetime in the River Esk?\u201d volunteer Joy Godfrey asks in the first video she made with the Mayfield and Easthouses Development Trust to highlight sewage pollution near Dalkeith, Midlothian, caused in part by increased heavy rainfall. \u201cA sanitary towel,\u201d she answers with a grimace, fishing one out of the water. Within a week, the film, in which Godfrey also shows off slimy clumps of blackened wet wipes, tampons and a condom, had been viewed 2,000 times. A second film, in the Mary Burn tributary, quickly attracted the attention of the local member of the Scottish parliament. The campaign eventually led to a cleanup operation that saw Scottish Water remove more than 3,000 bin bags of sewage debris. Godfrey and the trust have continued to monitor the waterways and press for further action, and are working to build public awareness of good flushing habits \u2013 part of the current problem is that the sewers were not designed for wrongly-flushed sanitary products. Meanwhile, the issue of sewage pollution has been raised in the Scottish and Westminster parliaments. \u201cIn June 2018 just about every other rock was covered with a wet wipe,\u201d Godfrey says of the part of the river near her house that inspired her action. \u201cIt really stank \u2013 it just smelled dirty and rotten. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being affected by a problem and speaking from there that gives you power. To go into the river, hold these things and say \u2018this is disgusting\u2019 is much more effective than standing on the bank.\u201d Norfolk county council: Norfolk assistance scheme Norfolk county council\u2019s Norfolk assistance scheme used to provide new white goods and vital household items such as beds and sofas to individuals and families in crisis. In 2017-18, the average cost was \u00a3755. Under the scheme\u2019s new reuse development project, applicants now get quality reused items from partners including charities the Benjamin Foundation and Emmaus Norfolk and Waveney instead. This more than halves the average award cost and means the scheme, which last year made 1,118 awards, can help more people while also supporting local charities and reducing the burden on landfill. The scheme went live in July, after pilots that ran from December 2018 showed the new average award was just \u00a3308. Another benefit is that people are now getting higher quality furniture, explains one of the scheme\u2019s officers, Christina Campbell. \u201c[Before] we had to go to the low end of the market, and a lot of those items didn\u2019t have a long shelf life, so they would end up in landfill,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we supply better quality items they\u2019ve got a lot more life in them.\u201d The new system also empowers applicants by allowing them to decide how to spend their award. At Emmaus there\u2019s a dedicated team for the system, which gives roles to formerly homeless volunteers who have been supported by the charity. \u201cNow applicants are entitled to go and choose the items, they can have their own tastes,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of it.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Good company: the capitalists putting purpose ahead of profit", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/b-corps-captalism-for-an-environmentally-endangered-age", "date": "2019-11-24", "transcript": "In a volatile world jolted by protest, revolt and environmental alarm, capitalism is showing signs of twitchiness. For decades, business has been all about maximising profits and keeping owners happy. Now, thousands of companies and organisations are experimenting with broader values \u2013 purpose over profit, staff and communities ahead of shareholders \u2013 in order to meet the mood of the times. Driving this shift in consciousness is a phalanx of upstart, sustainable businesses. They cluster under different groupings \u2013 Conscious Capitalism, B Corp, The B Team, Just Capital \u2013 but all share the same central objective: to reshape capitalism for an environmentally endangered age. The best of these boast laudable motivations. In the past, if you wanted to change the world, you went into politics or joined a campaign group. Given the shift of power and resources to the private sector over recent decades, the smart money is increasingly on business to deliver solutions. Not business as usual, that is. Plastering products with eco labels or providing perks to employees will make not a jot of difference if, behind the scenes, companies are still happily burning fossil fuels and browbeating suppliers. \u201cIf businesses really want to be part of this movement for change, then great. But that change has to be radical and transformational. If not, it\u2019s empty words and spin,\u201d says Katie Hill, a spokesperson for the ethical certification body B Corp, which now counts over 3,100 registered members in over 70 countries. For a flavour of the changemaking businesses, she points to B Corps\u2019 latest Best for the World list. The selection includes a US bank that specialises in financing community-based enterprises, a locally owned windfarm in Australia and a zero-waste Argentinian restaurant chain. (Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, recently announced that it too had been certified as a B corp). To date, founder-led businesses, cooperatives and employee-owned firms have tended to dominate such listings. Most are small, which makes sense. The larger the organisation, the harder it is to keep its mission clear and its values consistent. Small may be beautiful in ethical terms, but it\u2019s not ideal for effecting large-scale change. If endemic poverty is ever to be reversed or global heating resolved, then big business also needs to embrace this more inclusive approach to business. There are signs of that happening. Natura, the huge Brazilian cosmetic brand, and its subsidiary The Body Shop, for example, now feature among a growing roster of multinational B Corps. The purpose-led business agenda received a shot in the arm this summer when the Business Roundtable, a grouping of some 200 top US companies like Amazon, Apple and GM, committed to \u201clead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders\u201d. Even the financial markets are beginning to prick up their ears. Take the rapid rise of the sustainable debt market, which has now passed the $1tn mark. Only last month, beverage giant PepsiCo issued a $1bn \u201cgreen\u201d bond to fund environmental programmes \u2013 a move unthinkable just a few year ago. \u201cIf the old economy makes a change, then that\u2019s how you change the world,\u201d said Dutch sustainable business expert Roeland Dikker Hupkes. Of course, the buy-in of big business comes with risks. Greenwashing is perhaps the most obvious, but some practices are more subtle. After the Fairtrade organic chocolate brand Green &amp; Black\u2019s was taken over by food giant Kraft, for example, it started to produce confectionary that was neither organic nor Fairtrade-certified. Corporations are aware of a growing clamour, from consumers, employees, regulators, and even some investors, for business to demonstrate a social purpose beyond profitmaking. But can leopards change their spots? Most of the frontrunners in the \u201cpurpose economy\u201d were set up to solve a specific social or environmental problem. Only then did they go about putting together a business to deliver it \u2013 not vice versa. In that sense, it\u2019s a question few of them have had to ask. Take Fairphone. Located in Amsterdam, this hyper-ethical phone manufacturer insists on only using metals and other materials that are sustainably sourced and can be traced back to their origin. It\u2019s a commitment that grew out of the firm\u2019s origins as a campaign group against abuses in the telecoms supply chain. \u201cBack then, we decided that we were not really creating any alternatives, so instead we should become part of the industry ourselves,\u201d explains Eva Gouwens, the chief executive of the maverick phone brand. Yet retrofitting a traditional profit-maximising company is a different story altogether. The Belgian materials firm Umicore offers a very rare example of success. Once a dirty, old-school smelting firm, it has reinvented itself over the last decade or so into a pioneering recycler of waste metals. With ever lower margins in the smelting business, Umicore\u2019s motivation was as much economic as it was environmental. The same cold logic enjoys growing traction in other old-school industries, from energy firms facing peak oil to carmakers confronting ever stricter eco standards. Also pushing companies to transform is a growing awareness among individual business leaders about the destructive route down which shareholder capitalism has pushed the planet. As Douglas Lamont, head of the UK beverage brand Innocent Drinks (now part of Coca-Cola), recently told a roomful of fellow executives at B Corps\u2019 annual European summit: \u201cWe are the first generation of leaders who cannot say we didn\u2019t know [about the climate emergency] \u2026 and we are also the last generation who can do anything about it.\u201d The growing demand for a fairer, more caring form of capitalism has also given rise to a related phenomenon: the emergence of the purpose-driven consultant. Over recent years, a cottage industry of advisory firms has sprung up, all promising to help companies on this \u201cjourney\u201d (a favourite phrase) towards a more purposeful, less profit-centric model of business. In the spirit of business-as-unusual, their approach is refreshingly unorthodox. \u201cBold\u201d, \u201cheartfelt\u201d and \u201cemotionally involved\u201d are among the defining characteristics that sustainability expert Ed Gillespie associates with this new breed of consultant. To get the ball rolling, for example, conventional companies may well need a dose of shock therapy, according to Gillespie, who styles himself as an \u201cinsultant\u201d: \u201cSometimes this will involve making clients feel very uncomfortable and might even lead to losing pitches, which most consultants are too chicken to do.\u201d Another hallmark of these challenger consultants is their focus on the motivations and mindsets of individual decision makers. Alter how executives think and changes in business strategy and values will follow, the logic goes. David Rosenberg is one such proponent of this more personal approach. An associate at the advisory firm Better Future (also a certified B Corp), he is involved in taking corporate executives on \u201clearning journeys\u201d to overseas locations that lie \u201coutside their comfort zone\u201d. Past examples include home stays for cocoa-sector execs with smallholder farmers in Africa, and for bankers with their microfinance customers. \u201cYou confront them with challenges rooted in observable realities, [which] gives them fresh perspectives on their impacts in the world and presents opportunities for positive change,\u201d says Rosenberg. For now, the companies and consultants pushing to reset capitalism occupy the fringes of the business mainstream. This is not surprising: attachments to shareholder capitalism and the pursuit for profit run deep. But change is in the air. And it\u2019s this cohort of dissenters and disruptors who are pointing the way. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

In September, my family started swapping present lists. I saw my first Christmas tree of the year a few weeks ago, before Halloween. And now it\u2019s mid-November, well, it\u2019s wall-to-wall ads on telly, and festive lights on every high street. Of course, it\u2019s cliched to be cynical at Christmas. So instead of moaning about how the festive season gets longer every year, let\u2019s celebrate all the great things that are still to come before we even get to the mulled wine. There are elections in half a dozen countries, including Dominica, Namibia and Uzbekistan. More people have voted in elections this year than ever before. And that\u2019s before we get to Britain\u2019s very own thrilling, if possibly inconclusive, general election on 12 December (full results available on Friday the 13th). There\u2019s a vital global climate summit in Spain (after Chile had to pull out): another chance to correct our over-carbonated course. We get a new European commission at the start of December, and Scotland is scheduled to hold a citizens assembly on its future. Pope Francis is in Thailand and Japan, while Nobel prize winners receive their awards in Stockholm and Oslo. In sport, there\u2019s the culmination of the F1 season, the Davis Cup, and, yes, the beach soccer world cup in Paraguay (a land-locked country not necessarily noted for its beaches). In more eclectic matters, it\u2019s national tree week in the UK next week, along with Thanksgiving and Black Friday (otherwise known as Buy Nothing day) and then a big moment for facial hair everywhere on 1 December, as Movember morphs into Decembeard. It is only when all this is said and done that it will be time for all that goodwill towards men stuff. Of course, there will be a steady pulse of Upside journalism between now and then too.

I have two friends from Syrian Kurdistan, brothers, who arrived after crossing to Greece in rubber dinghies and have made new lives. They already own a house and a car and are pursuing a good education while doing several part-time jobs to realise their dreams and help their family in Syria.

That was fine by me. I believed pessimists lived in a constant state of pleasant surprise: if you always expected the worst, things generally turned out better than you imagined. The only real problem with pessimism, I figured, was that too much of it could accidentally turn you into an optimist. But accidental optimism is not one of the known dangers of pessimism, a list that does include career impairment, poor health and early death. Optimism, by contrast, is associated with better sleep and lower levels of cardiovascular disease. One study this year claimed that people who describe themselves as optimists had 35% fewer strokes than those who didn\u2019t. Another, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science last summer, found that compared with pessimists, the most optimistic subjects lived 11-15% longer lives on average. One of that study\u2019s authors, clinical research psychologist Lewina Lee, described optimism as \u201ca psycho-social asset that has the potential to extend the human lifespan\u201d. She also suggested that a more positive outlook could be learned. \u201cInterestingly, optimism may be modifiable using relatively simple techniques or therapies,\u201d she said. But how does a pessimist go about transforming himself into the glass-half-full type? I decided to spend a week trying. Day one Before I go in search of the bright side, I need to make sure I actually count as a pessimist. I had always considered myself more of a realist, someone who sees the glass as comprised of approximately 50% water. What\u2019s wrong with that? \u201cA certain amount of stoicism is a good idea to help you cope with disappointment,\u201d says the author and psychotherapist Philippa Perry. \u201cThe trouble is, if you are always looking at the ditch instead of the road ahead, you tend to end up in the ditch instead of where you wanted to go.\u201d But being relentlessly optimistic sounds as problematic as being a full-time pessimist \u2013 both demonstrate a poor understanding of how odds work. Routinely expecting good outcomes just seems wrong. \u201cWe tend to confuse the familiar with what is right,\u201d says Perry. Maybe I am more optimistic than I think, but I don\u2019t even know how you would define optimism for scientific purposes, much less measure it. There are, it transpires, two main types: dispositional optimism and the \u201cexplanatory style\u201d. Dispositional optimism can be described as the sense that more good things than bad things will happen in the future; explanatory or attributional optimism is more concerned with the causes behind good events, and the extent to which we view them as controllable and stable. Dispositional optimism is commonly quantified using a questionnaire called the Life Orientation Test \u2013 Revised (LOT-R). It is one of the measures used in Lee\u2019s study and versions of it are widely available online. The LOT-R consists of a series of statements (eg \u201cI rarely count on good things happening to me\u201d), that are rated on a five-point scale running from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d. I always think tests like this just measure my tendency to fence-sit \u2013 I don\u2019t \u201cstrongly agree\u201d with anything. But the results were unequivocal: I scored nine out of a possible 24, with the average somewhere between 14 and 15. \u201cYou are quite pessimistic,\u201d is the diagnosis. Day two When it comes to improving my outlook, it is hard to know where to begin. I contact Lee to find out how scientists do it. \u201cThe Best Possible Self (BPS) intervention is the most widely studied training for increasing optimism,\u201d she says. As Lee explains it, the exercise involves identifying some personal, professional and relationship goals, and then imagining a future in which those goals have been reached and everything has turned out as well as possible. In one study, participants were asked to turn this BPS into a coherent and personal story, and then imagine this story for five minutes every day over two weeks. I find a version of the exercise online that encourages me to write continuously about my future BPS for 15 minutes. This is what I end up with: \u201cI have become a bestselling novelist, and I am so much in demand as a public speaker that I now employ someone to read and answer my emails. He is called Charles and even though this is his only duty, I pay him an absurdly generous salary, because that is what I am like. Thanks to my extreme generosity, Charles has come to regard me as foolish and out of touch. He has recently started to steal small amounts of money from me, along with some of the free luxury items I am often sent as a result of being a celebrated writer, which Charles thinks I will not miss. \u201cHe is right. I am not really interested in unsolicited luxury items, since I have everything I want already: an enviable career, rippling abdominal muscles, a special room for my awards. And I never have to spend a second reading or responding to emails. Every morning I wake up feeling excited about the challenges that lie ahead, and every night I go to bed grateful that the only real source of anxiety in my life is the upcoming talk I need to have with Charles about him taking the piss.\u201d I\u2019m not supposed to worry about taking steps to achieve this goal, which is good, because I can\u2019t think of any. Day three One of the simplest strategies for increasing optimism is avoiding the company of other pessimistic people. I figure that I have a headstart here, in that I already avoid the company of most people. The doorbell rings. I think: this can\u2019t be good. Then I think: stop that. The man at the door has a package for me. My wife passes through the kitchen as I\u2019m opening it. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my gratitude journal,\u201d I say, holding up a slim notebook with the words \u201cStart with gratitude\u201d written on the cover in a self-helpy calligraphic font. \u201cStupid,\u201d my wife says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be positive about my journey,\u201d I say, \u201cthen you and I might have to stop hanging out.\u201d \u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d she says. I don\u2019t disagree with her; the idea of a gratitude journal sounds stupid to me, too. If I dropped dead tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone finding it among my effects. But Perry is adamant about the benefits of the practice. \u201cThis is scientifically proven stuff. It\u2019s fun, really,\u201d she says. Life coach and psychologist Dr Sally Ann Law offers similar advice. \u201cDevelop a habit of making a note at the end of each day of at least three things that went well,\u201d she says, \u201cto help train your brain to notice the good stuff rather than focusing on the not-so-good stuff.\u201d To overcome my resistance to the idea, I have ordered a ready-made \u201cfive-minute daily\u201d journal with blanks to fill in. At the beginning there is a lined page headed: \u201cMy Thoughts\u201d. I write: \u201cThis is never going to work.\u201d Day four I spend five minutes thinking about my Best Possible Self, putting off my difficult talk with Charles for another day. In my gratitude journal, under the blank space headed \u201cI am thankful for \u2026\u201d I write: \u201cA small child in a pushchair said hello to me in the street yesterday, and I said hello back.\u201d It is only a small thing, but it made me happy at the time and it makes me happy again thinking about it. Without the gratitude journal, I would have probably forgotten about the moment. I am pleased, but I can\u2019t believe I have got to come up with another one tomorrow. There are endless online articles compiling strategies to increase optimism. One of the odder ones involves giving my pessimism a name \u2013 something such as \u201cMr Negative\u201d \u2013 so that I can catch myself falling into habitually disempowering patterns. I tell myself there is no way I\u2019m naming my pessimism, before realising I already have: Charles. Other advice includes the acquisition of a positive mantra \u2013 something inspirational I can repeat to drive out pessimistic thoughts. My gratitude journal has similar epigrams at the top of each page: \u201cEvery day may not be good but there is something good in every day.\u201d Another one, attributed to the entrepreneur Mary Kay Ash, catches my eye: \u201cAerodynamically the bumblebee shouldn\u2019t be able to fly, but the bumblebee doesn\u2019t know that so it goes on flying anyway.\u201d I am afraid I seized on this one for pessimistic reasons: it sounds like bollocks, and some casual research proves it is. Under the space in my gratitude journal headed \u201cThings I want to remember from today \u2026\u201d, I write: \u201cBumblebee flight does not violate the laws of physics.\u201d I think: progress. But here is another inspirational quote I found \u2013 it comes from Michael Jordan, perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time: \u201cI\u2019ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I\u2019ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I\u2019ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I\u2019ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.\u201d Those lines seem tailor-made for the reluctant optimist, because they encapsulate something counterintuitive about outlook: we tend to think of pessimists as being better prepared for setbacks, but in truth it is the optimists who prove more resilient. \u201cOptimists tend to interpret adversity as being a discreet and temporary state,\u201d says Law. \u201cPessimists, however, tend to interpret adversity as being pervasive and permanent: \u2018It\u2019s all really horrible and that\u2019s probably just the way it will always be.\u2019\u201d This has an effect on more than just your outlook. Studies have shown that optimistic students spend more time preparing for exams than their pessimistic counterparts. I copy out the Jordan quote into my gratitude journal under \u201cNice things I heard today \u2026\u201d I feel silly doing it, but it uses up a big chunk of the page. Day five I try to spend five minutes reflecting on my BPS, but the whole scenario is getting away from me. I imagine that Charles has taken to hiding my things in weird places, and then claiming that I put them there and forgot about it. When I finally sit him down for our stern talk about taking the piss, he changes the subject and asks me to co-invest in his podcast start-up. I tell him I\u2019ll think about it. In my journal, under the heading \u201cThings I did for myself today \u2026\u201d, I write about spending an hour tidying my desk for the first time in months, but I don\u2019t mention I was basically avoiding other, more pressing work. I feel I as if I am covering for my own failure and then trying to get credit for it by writing it down. That could describe my whole career. I re-read a strategy that Law emailed me at the beginning of the week. \u201cBecome as self-aware as possible about the language you use in your own head when you\u2019re thinking about some adversity or setback,\u201d she wrote, suggesting that when I catch myself using words such as \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cdreadful\u201d, I should replace them with words such as \u201cchallenge\u201d and \u201cunhelpful\u201d. I visualise finding my desk tidy in the morning, and how pleased with myself I will feel. Later, in the middle of cooking dinner, I discover that I have failed to buy a key ingredient. \u201cWell,\u201d I say, staring into the fridge, \u201cthis is a complete and absolute challenge.\u201d Baby steps. Day six I sleep badly and wake up with a familiar sense of foreboding. Visualising a Best Possible Self strikes me as a waste of time, a way of deliberately courting disappointment. Besides, I am avoiding Charles. By the afternoon I am in a dark and self-defeating mood. In my journal, under the heading \u201cI am grateful for \u2026\u201d, I have absentmindedly scrawled: \u201cGet cat food.\u201d I think about an article from the publication Trends in Cognitive Sciences I read that suggested dispositional optimism is at least partly inherited \u2013 to some degree, you either have it or you don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t. Law suggests I should not expect too much from a mere week of accentuating the positive. \u201cRemember that although our brains are plastic and therefore we can change to some extent, we have to be realistic,\u201d she says. Perry concurs. \u201cChanging a thought reflex or a pattern is a bit like going to the gym,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t go to the gym once and expect to leave with a six-pack, but if you go regularly and keep it up, changes do happen.\u201d After I actually go and buy the cat food, I feel a bit better. Day seven There can hardly be a less scientific measure for increased optimism than a second go at the LOT-R test. It has got only 10 questions, four of which are fillers (eg, \u201cI enjoy my friends a lot\u201d) that don\u2019t count toward the result. It can easily be gamed. But I didn\u2019t expect my score to change at all and it did: I got 14, which is about average. I was conscious of no difference beyond thinking about my answers more carefully, in the context of what I had learned. Perhaps, for the pessimist, greater self-awareness leads inexorably to optimism. As Perry put it: \u201cWhen we become more aware of our typical response, we can recognise what we are in the habit of telling ourselves. When we are aware of a habit, we then have a choice about whether to change it or not.\u201d Once you accept that at least a portion of your pessimism is just a story you tell yourself \u2013 and an inaccurate one at that \u2013 it\u2019s hard to hang on to it. With that in mind, it is time to sit down and have a little talk with Charles.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The Copenhagen house that's probably the best children's home in the world | Clare Considine and Helen Russell", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/copenhagen-childrens-home-support-uk", "date": "2019-11-20", "transcript": "A dolls\u2019 house with shutters on the windows and tendrils of ivy painted on the walls stands opposite a dressing table adorned with stickers, trinkets and coloured hair-clips. The room\u2019s occupant is gesturing with sparkly nails, giving a tour of the premises and explaining how she picked out her own furniture and fittings from Ikea when she first arrived. This is Josephine Schneider\u2019s House \u2013 a grand, 13-roomed residence built in 1906 in a leafy suburb of Copenhagen, funded by a Danish philanthropist of the same name to care for children who don\u2019t have parents or whose parents can\u2019t look after them. Our nine-year-old tour guide has lived at Josephine Schneider\u2019s House for two years. \u201cI like it here,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI get to play with the bigger girls \u2013 they\u2019re 13 \u2013 and we all got to go to Majorca this summer.\u201d An annual \u201cfamily\u201d holiday is a Josephine Schneider\u2019s tradition, along with celebrating Christmas, Easter and the myriad festivals that make up the Danish calendar. This set-up could not be further from what many young people currently experience within the UK\u2019s care home system, where 73% of homes are run for profit. Privatisation and a target-driven culture have seen nurture replaced by the very worst of institutional cold-shouldering for some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children. At the same time, the number of children in care in England is increasing sharply. But a British social entrepreneur is so impressed with the Danish model that he wants to import it to the UK, with the first facility set to open in Surrey in 2020. Emmanuel Akpan-Inwang \u2013 founder and director of the Lighthouse charity \u2013 was teaching English at a Birmingham secondary school in 2011 when he noticed a gross disparity in achievements. Only 4% of those from children\u2019s homes were achieving five A* to C grades in English and maths at GCSE (levels nine to four), compared with more than 60% among all children. He decided to look into a new approach, dedicating evenings and weekends to research. He called on help from fellow teachers and a broad spectrum of experts; volunteered in a cross-section of UK homes; went full-time and funded in 2017; and, perhaps most importantly, spent two summers visiting lauded examples of residential care in Germany and Denmark. At Josephine Schneider\u2019s House, staff and children sit down to eat together at a vast oak dining table with proper place settings and candles \u201cfor extra hyggeligt\u201d in winter months. Once a week, the older children cook for everyone. \u201cNothing fancy, just pasta or burgers or pizza, mostly,\u201d explains Alexander, a boy of 18 who has lived at Josephine Schneider\u2019s for seven years. It was these communal moments that struck Akpan-Inwang when he first visited back in 2017. He found daily routines peppered with opportunities to build relationships. \u201cAt every single home that I visited in Denmark and Germany, every meal was shared,\u201d he recalls. \u201cEverybody sat down together, including the cleaner.\u201d In UK homes, \u201cChildren were often coming in, making their own dinner and taking it up to their room to eat,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe difference was how much time and effort was invested in getting to know the children.\u201d Josephine Schneider\u2019s is run by pedagogues \u2013 degree-qualified carers trained in behavioural sciences and in working with conflict. In the UK, very few children\u2019s home staff are graduates. In Denmark, all carers in children\u2019s homes complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in pedagogy, with most pursuing further training. Newly qualified pedagogues earn 26,000 Danish kroner per month pre-tax (about \u00a33,000), and this rises after a few years to a top income bracket of 35,000 Danish kroner per month. Pedagogues in Denmark are highly respected professionals, protected by unions and properly supported with monthly supervision and ongoing training. As a result, staff retention is high \u2013 at Josephine Schneider\u2019s, four of the 10 pedagogues have been there for 20 years and two for 30. This allows lasting relationships to form and ensures that placement breakdowns are rare \u2013 children stay for an average of 13 years. With a sense of stability in young people\u2019s lives, time and energy are freed up to focus on the higher goal of education. Danish pedagogues work with the council and social workers with the sole concern of ensuring the best outcome for each child. \u201cThe children all go to local schools. And whenever anyone new arrives we invite the whole class over, so they can see that it\u2019s not like Oliver Twist,\u201d explains Annette Olsen, manager at Josephine Schneider\u2019s. \u201cSometimes it would be easier just to say, \u2018You\u2019re feeling sad today? OK, stay home,\u2019\u201d says Sanne Juel, one of the home\u2019s pedagogues. \u201cBut we want them to be educated so they\u2019re not sad for the rest of their life. So we have to put the work in, now.\u201d In UK homes, Akpan-Inwang explains, \u201cSometimes getting up and going to school isn\u2019t even on the agenda.\u201d With education comes self-worth. And when it comes to imbuing children with innate confidence, the devil is often in the detail. Akpan-Inwang points to examples from ensuring cupboards are stocked with a specific chocolate bar that a child might like, to allowing them to decorate their own rooms. Another of the children\u2019s rooms at Josephine Schneider\u2019s House looks like something out of an interior design magazine. Inspirational quotes are framed around a dressing table, sheepskin rugs line the floor, a balcony looks out over a leafy green suburb. The older teenagers have their own floor and a \u201ccommon room\u201d with a cosy L-shaped sofa, PlayStation, Nintendo and stylish nesting tables. \u201cWe believe that just because you were born into a bad environment it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have nice things,\u201d explains Juel. Next year, Lighthouse will launch its first home in the outer London borough of Sutton, with plans to open two more in the London area over the next four years. It is looking for experienced professionals who will undergo extensive training in social pedagogy. The Lighthouse architect has been provided with photos from Josephine Schneider\u2019s House. He is working with a team of advisors including former Ofsted inspectors and young people who have experienced residential care. At the heart of their collective vision for Lighthouse is the exclusion of anything with the slightest whiff of institution. This includes, Akpan-Inwang explains, \u201clocking things away in drawers, telling young people they can\u2019t go into certain places, the jingling of keys \u2026 \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve met lots of social workers or youth workers who spent time working in residential care, faced frustration and left,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create an environment where those people can stay, grow and develop.\u201d The end result will \u2013 he hopes \u2013 be a place that young people naturally gravitate back to. He recalls a dinner at Josephine Schneider\u2019s when a boy who\u2019d left for university came back for the evening to seek advice from the pedagogues on what courses he should take. \u201cThey\u2019d looked after him since he was eight years old. These were the people he went back to for reassurance and support.\u201d In the UK, children in care are often left to fend for themselves in an unregulated semi-independent sector within days of turning 16. The fallout is bleak: care leavers are 15 times more likely to end up in the criminal justice system and 25% of homeless people have come through care. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t do it to their own children but we do it to some of the most vulnerable children in our society,\u201d says Akpan-Inwang. And so Lighthouse plans to open semi-independent accommodation for over 18s within walking distance of the Sutton home. Of course, Denmark and Britain are very different places, requiring nuanced approaches. When Lighthouse was looking for its residential site, careful risk assessments were carried out to ensure there was no gang activity in the area. Plus, in the UK only about 10% of looked-after children are in children\u2019s homes (90% are in foster care), meaning they often have the most profound difficulties. At Josephine Schneider\u2019s House, conflicts seldom escalate. \u201cIf there\u2019s a disagreement, we\u2019ll talk it out,\u201d says Juel. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to be friends, that\u2019s fine. But they have to respect each other and be kind.\u201d Children are given space to calm down if they need to, with a walk around the expansive garden (complete with sleeping shelter and fire pit \u201cfor cook-outs\u201d) or a session on the punchbag in the basement. \u201cBut we don\u2019t tend to need this much,\u201d explains Juel. Josephine Schneider\u2019s House specialises in children who turn their anger inward. \u201cThat is our challenge,\u201d she continues. \u201cChildren with aggression issues tend to be referred elsewhere.\u201d Akpan-Inwang visited a home in the north of Denmark where children had \u201csome of the most extreme behaviour\u201d, but he returned satisfied. \u201cEven those children were doing fantastically well. It gave me a lot more confidence about what we\u2019re implementing in the UK.\u201d It\u2019s worth bearing in mind that a typical UK placement in 2014 cost about \u00a32,900 a week, or roughly \u00a3150,000 a year; and costs have been rising year on year since then. At Josephine Schneider\u2019s House, it\u2019s 720,000 Danish kroner (about \u00a383,000) a year. However, Akpan-Inwang points out that with better planning, these costs can be reduced and money provided by the local authority will stretch further as there\u2019s not a goal to make a profit: \u201cAdditional funding isn\u2019t going back into the pockets of shareholders, it\u2019s going towards making sure young people get the best experience possible.\u201d As Akpan-Inwang and his team work hard to bring their vision to life, they hope others will follow their lead. \u201cWe want to work with other parts of the sector to innovate together.\u201d The past five years have seen a 20% increase in the number of children in care in the UK. So the Lighthouse vision is needed now more than ever. \u201cThere are no short cuts when it comes to children\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cI see more and more in the UK and elsewhere a move towards quick fixes, patching people up. But you only have one chance at childhood. And if you get it wrong, you\u2019re going to get an adult who needs more help and has problems later on. Taking a short-term approach to the welfare of children is a real failure of vision.\u201d Not something that\u2019s going to happen on Olsen\u2019s watch.

For every day of the year, the graphic design student, then aged 20, decided to design an emoji that reflected the culture of his home country, Ivory Coast, and the wider region of West Africa. \u201cI wanted to create a project to promote African cultures to change the image the Western media have of Africa: hunger, poverty and wars,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to show a different and positive side.\u201d Adopting a different theme each week, he shared his daily designs on Instagram. He started with food and drink \u2013 a topic that everyone identifies with. \u201cPeople love to eat,\u201d he said. He began sharing designs of foutou, (a bowl of mashed plantain and cassava) and gbofloto (fried dough balls) online. One of his favourite images, showing a plastic bag bursting with purple liquid, represents bissap (dried hibiscus flower juice). \u201cI have memories related to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen sell it in little plastic bags outside of schools, and I bought it from kindergarten to high school.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell his teachers or classmates at Abidjan\u2019s Institute of Sciences and Communication Techniques about the project \u2013 but people soon noticed as it grew in popularity online. People began sending requests for new designs \u2013 anything from hairstyles to forms of transport. \u201cI received congratulations and encouraging comments from many people across Africa and the diaspora, telling me my work is important and I should not stop,\u201d he said. An advertising agency sent Grebet an Apple Mac so that he could create designs for iOS as well as Android phones. This year he launched a compilation of the images, which have since been downloaded more than 100,000 times. Grebet\u2019s designs aren\u2019t official emojis, because they have not been approved by the Unicode Consortium, a California-based organisation that reviews requests for new designs and sets standards for characters across different programmes and platforms. Grebet is working on a submission to the body. For now, images from his app, Zouzoukwa \u2013 which means \u201cpicture\u201d in B\u00e9t\u00e9, the language of the B\u00e9t\u00e9 people from the south-western Ivory Coast \u2013 can be used as stickers or standalone images. The number of official emojis has increased rapidly over recent years \u2013 a greater range of skin tones are now available, as well as icons that represent different types of disability, such as canes or wheelchairs, and symbols that are gender neutral. But vast areas of life remain unrepresented. \u201cI think [Zouzoukwa designs] became popular because they fill a gap in digital communication for Africans. My work helps us to communicate more clearly, using emojis that represent how we live and what we want to say,\u201d Grebet said. One of his favourite designs is \u201cYou saw that?\u201d, a facial expression that he says is used in Ivory Coast and means something similar to \u201cI told you so\u201d. After posting it online, people elsewhere in West Africa began sharing the meaning of the expression in their home country. \u201cMy [Instagram] followers from Cameroon commented that they also use this gesture, but as a warning sign, like, \u2018If you do that, you will see what I will do,\u2019\u201d he said. Another of his favourites is the Zaouli emoji design, a mask and dance from the Gouro people of Ivory Coast. \u201cI love [the Zaouli design] because it\u2019s a mix of many arts: painting, sculpting, music, dancing \u2013 and because I like its appearance too,\u201d he said. Tech companies should do more to make sure their products are representative, said Grebet, but he added: \u201cAt the same time, I think it\u2019s not really their role, but today with social media we have tools to make our voices heard and impact [what] these companies create. He cited the example of the campaign group Emojination, which pushes for greater representation among the official set of emojis and helped Rayouf Alhumedhi, then a Saudi student in Germany, get approval for the the hijab emoji. Grebet has now created 376 different designs, and he hopes to keep going by creating images for countries across Africa. \u201cMy biggest dream right now is to travel to more African countries, discover their cultures, turn their popular and traditional cultural elements into emojis,\u201d he said.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Reforesting the UK: 'Trees are the ultimate long-term project'", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/16/reforesting-the-uk-trees-are-the-ultimate-long-term-project", "date": "2019-11-16", "transcript": "\u201cThis whole area wants to be a wood,\u201d says Edward Milbank, sweeping his arm across the former hill farm in Northumberland. Small saplings of birch have invaded the cleared ground, but many more trees are being pushed into the soil by hand. The bracken and rhododendron that had overrun the hillside took heavy machinery three months to rip out. \u201cWhen you disturb the soil, it becomes a wood very quickly,\u201d says Milbank. \u201cBut the Forestry Commission forced us to put in Scots pine as well. The entire area could be birch without spending a penny, but you have to be seen to be doing something to justify the [planting grants].\u201d This former sheep and cattle farm, Doddington North, is being converted into England\u2019s largest private new woodland in 30 years, with 680,000 trees being planted over the 350 hectares. Moving down the hill, Milbank points and says: \u201cThe reason we were able to raise the investment is that \u2013 sitka spruce.\u201d The commercial timber tree will occupy 40% of the land, with native broadleaf trees such as birch, alder, aspen and oak on about a third and the rest managed as open grassland. Milbank, whose company Pennine Forestry is running the project, hopes it will encourage more wildlife, such as the red squirrels that live in an adjoining wood, and the kestrels that already fly overhead searching for the shrews that dart between tussocks. The UK needs 1.5bn more trees, according to the government\u2019s official climate change advisers, to suck up carbon dioxide and help restore wildlife. But the question of how they will be delivered \u2013 private or public, commercial or wild \u2013 remains open, despite the pioneering effort at Doddington North, which should be completed this winter. James Trayte, who leads the team of planters, has done more than most. He reckons he has planted more than 2m trees in his 12-year career. Out since dawn, he has planted about 2,000 so far today, plucking the two-year old sitka saplings from bags around his waist, then prodding them into the hole he makes with a deft twist of the planting spade. \u201cIt was pure love at the start, getting paid to walk around on the hillsides, battling the weather.\u201d After 12 winter seasons, the best time to plant trees, he is more blunt about the motivation. \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal job and my elbow is going. What brings me back now is the money.\u201d Milbank says: \u201cMost local people have been incredibly supportive of the project, but not everyone. They thought we were taking away good agricultural land to put in trees.\u201d But, if the national tree target is to be met, he says: \u201cThere will have to be some land that comes out of agricultural production and goes into forestry.\u201d Much of the timber \u2013 and the carbon it contains \u2013 gets locked up in new buildings, he points out. All the saplings planted are UK grown, but global heating is already exerting an influence. \u201cWe take them from nurseries in the south of England, as that will be the climate we have here in the north in the future,\u201d Milbank says. Very few plastic guards are used, though that has meant killing deer that would destroy the saplings and putting up fences. \u201cIt will be lovely to have deer back in here in 10 years\u201d, when the trees are established, he says. Milbank is clear that management is essential to create and maintain woodland, such as removing some trees to let light through the canopy, a task that large wild herbivores would have done in the past. He thinks rewilding 25% of the nation, as proposed by Rewilding Britain, is unrealistic: \u201cI can\u2019t see land just being left \u2013 we are too small an island, with 66 million people.\u201d Rebecca Wrigley, at Rewilding Britain, says: \u201cWe are not suggesting people are taken off the land across the country and that everything is fully rewilded. We\u2019d like to see a mosaic, maximising rewilding but also production where that is necessary. Rewilding has to work for people and nature, economy and ecology.\u201d But she thinks management is a forestry mindset and often not necessary: \u201cWoodlands have been doing OK for millions of years without human management, though obviously you need fully functional ecosystems.\u201d The government is not far off track in delivering the 11m trees over five years in England that it promised to fund in 2017: 3.6m were planted in the last two seasons, about 2,300 hectares. But, overall, planting in England fell in 2019. There was a jump in UK figures, thanks to Scottish planting, but only to 13,400 ha. That is well below the 20,000 ha target set for 2020 by the government advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. It wants 27,000 ha a year by 2030, a level not seen since the 1970s, when huge monoculture plantations fuelled by tax breaks earned forestry a bad name. \u201cIt is wildly optimistic,\u201d says Milbank, but not impossible. \u201cIf the incentives are there, farmers will follow.\u201d Mark Bridgeman, the new president of the CLA, the Country, Land and Business Association, and whose Fallodon Estate is near Doddington North, agrees. \u201cRight now it is not going to happen. It\u2019s about creating a market for timber,\u201d he says, noting that the UK imports 80% of its timber. \u201cThat is ludicrous \u2013 we have one of the greatest climates for growing trees.\u201d But both say the government now has a perfect opportunity for change with the proposed post-Brexit subsidy regime potentially providing public money for public goods, such as carbon removal, flood protection and cleaner air \u2013 all things that trees can deliver. \u201cTrees are the ultimate long-term project,\u201d says Bridgeman. Sitkas double their weight \u2013 and carbon removal \u2013 between the ages of 30 and 40, but the cost of planting is upfront, creating a financial obstacle. A new \u00a350m government scheme launched last week makes a start on tackling that, with people planting trees able to get regular payments for carbon storage. Another obstacle is the cost of getting permission to plant trees. \u201cIt was blooming hard to get Doddington North through,\u201d says Milbank, whose company spent \u00a3125,000 and 18 months preparing the planning application. \u201cThere should be a presumption in favour of planting,\u201d not against it, says Bridgeman. John Tucker, at the Woodland Trust, a charity that has planted 10m native broadleaf trees in the past two years, agrees. He supports the Doddington North project, despite its commercial timber component, saying: \u201cWe need more trees, full stop \u2013 of all sorts.\u201d All projects now have to meet the UK Forestry Standard, he adds, meaning no monocultures or ugly clear-cutting. Back on the chilly Northumberland hillside, Milbank is confident there is change in the air, \u201cClimate change is now at the forefront of people\u2019s minds and I think the political will is there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be easier to plant trees in future.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Greta Thunberg sparks surge in sailboat hitchhiking", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/greta-thunberg-sparks-surge-in-sailboat-hitchhiking", "date": "2019-11-15", "transcript": "Hitching a ride on a sailing boat across the Atlantic might sound like a far-fetched endeavour reserved for the famous and well-connected. But Greta Thunberg has now managed it twice in three months \u2013 and her antics appear to be inspiring a growing, if nascent, movement in sail-hitching. Maritime hitchhiking has hitherto been reserved for sailors looking for experience on different routes and vessels. But after Thunberg\u2019s transatlantic adventures, numbers have boomed. Daniel Krause, a full-time \u201ccruiser\u201d, helps to run the Sailboat Hitchhikers and Crew Connection Facebook group, which has sharply increased to nearly 21,000 members since Thunberg\u2019s voyage. \u201cIn the past couple of weeks it has skyrocketed,\u201d he said. People use the site to find crew members for their boat, or to find a vessel to hitchhike on. \u201cIt\u2019s mutually beneficial,\u201d says Krause. \u201cYou get a mostly free ride and the owner gets someone who can do nightshifts or who can help out with docking, anchoring and boat manoeuvres.\u201d In most instances, hitchhikers just pay for transport to and from the boat, any visas they might need, and contribute to boat running costs like food. However, Krause has found many of the group newbies don\u2019t have previous sailing experience. \u201cMany people don\u2019t understand about the movement of a boat on the ocean which can overwhelm people with seasickness and make them feel trapped because it\u2019s a very small space and you could be out there for days if not weeks - and once you\u2019re out, it\u2019s almost always too late to turn back,\u201d he says. \u201cSailboats can only go with weather and wind. Hitchhikers need to be aware that there are forces way bigger than the will of the people on the boat; it might be that the weather decides for you where you go.\u201d There are dozens of Facebook groups and sites offering similar services. SailingNetworks was set up in 2004, originally branded as Crew Reunited to help boat crews stay in touch after a voyage. Now budding crew members set up profiles on the site to find captains willing to take them on. According to company director Jeremy Pocock, \u201cyounger people are seeing the opportunities to explore by getting on a boat as much more realistic than they might have done in the past\u201d. He advises that anyone considering boat hitchhiking goes for a test run first, and then goes for a drink with the captain and crew afterwards, to ensure compatibility with both the vessel itself and the other personalities on board. Lawrence Herbert, a 22-year-old psychology graduate, is currently hitching rides on boats around the world to build up his already quite extensive sailing experience. He\u2019s had some scary incidents over the years, which he says beginners might not be prepared for. \u201cI\u2019ve had a big sail stuck at the top of the mast with too much wind which was pretty terrifying. Someone had to go up to the top of the mast in pretty bad weather and cut the sail down, which is about as bad as it gets.\u201d He\u2019s currently en route to Southampton, where he\u2019s got a place on a boat heading across the Atlantic to Saint Martin in the Caribbean, and has noticed a huge increase in aspiring boat travellers this year. \u201cI do think the Greta Thunberg effect is huge. There\u2019s an enormous amount of people in Gran Canaria [a popular hub for people seeking passage across the Atlantic], many who don\u2019t have sailing experience, just trying to get on a boat.\u201d He says these people often exchange cooking skills for passage. The demand could indicate commercial potential for an eco-friendly transatlantic sailing service, says Ross Porter, founding director of ethical travel company VoyageVert. \u201cThere\u2019s no ticketed, fossil-fuel-free way of getting across the Atlantic. Now there\u2019s all of this exciting technology that can be harnessed and applied to a problem that we have in the world, which is moving people sustainably over long distances.\u201d He is seeking funding to build a sustainable sailing ferry capable of transporting 200 passengers 480 nautical miles in 24 hours - meaning it could transport people from Southampton to New York in around eight days. Porter eventually envisions this as a fleet which could sail a vast network of routes across the globe \u2013 and become the future of travel. A similar revolution is already underway in the shipping industry, which accounts for 2.5% of global carbon emissions, with companies developing strategies to transport goods on emission-free sailing vessels. For Krause, the increased interest in sailboat travel is a logical consequence of eco-friendly lifestyle trends that have grown in popularity in recent years. \u201cPeople want to downgrade their consumerism and also travel sustainably, and that\u2019s the perfect combination on a sailboat.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Was it when Donald Trump started talking about his wall? Or when Nigel Farage put that nasty poster up in 2016? Earlier? The Arab Spring? The Afghan wars? When the EU expanded into eastern Europe? Even earlier still? Enoch Powell? Windrush? The hostility towards Jews, Huguenots and people of colour through the ages? Of course, immigration has been an emotive subject for as long as people have moved from one community to the next. Britain\u2019s election will be no different, as was made palpably clear this week. Part of the reason is that people are mostly unaware of the benefits that newcomers bring. Politicians do not see many votes in praising the new skills, manpower, job creation, competitive edge and cultural diversity that immigration promises. And there are few newspaper articles that dwell on all the ways that immigration enriches us. The Upside has done regular work on this over the past 18 months , and this week was no different, as we covered the amazing story of the teenager who ran from poverty and despair in west Africa \u2013 and now wants to run for Spain. And this in a week in which one of the world\u2019s most famous, inspiring refugees was finally given his freedom \u2013 after six years in detention.

What we liked This piece in the Conversation about a zero-emission research station in Antarctica. The subhead could have been \u201cEmissions: if we can cut them there, we\u2019ll cut them anywhere.\u201d And while we\u2019re on the subject of sustainability, we were mildly encouraged by this from the Sydney Morning Herald: the world\u2019s most sustainable retail mall. Finally, this New Yorker piece about how to have a great idea. What we heard Carlosthepossum wrote below the line under the Behrouz Boochani piece: All the very best to you, Behrouz. You are symbolic of several dimensions that are wrong with our society The oppression of people is one and as a Kurd you have experienced that all your life. On top of that we live in an age where journalists are regularly vilified for doing their jobs. These are dangerous times for speaking truth to power and you have done an amazing job, with the help of the Guardian \u2026 Most of all, however, for me you symbolise hope. You have shown how to stare down adversity, a lesson we all need to learn in these often dark times. Andrew Fynn wrote in with some profound thoughts. Fifty years ago Allan Savory realised that the cause of the massive global problems of desertification \u2026 was not what it might have seemed to be. He also saw that just knowing the range of potential tools-as-solutions would not solve the actual root cause. Instead he came to the conclusion that we all have an onboard genetically hardwired framework we use to make all decisions. And we don\u2019t know we are using it. While useful for the kind of simple goals that we share with other animals \u2013 it is not fit for purpose for managing complex natural ecosystems or complex man-made systems. Savory developed holistic management, teaching that teaches, that this framework is relevant for everything we manage. If my hunch is correct, Allan has stumbled across something with profound potential to improve human management of systems, ecosystems, resources, people, companies, and organisations. What I am hearing is that when you shift to managing via a properly developed holistic context, conflict and unintended consequences disappear. Where was the Upside?

He is still running these days, just a lot quicker. Despite never having competed in track events until he was 15, the 19-year-old Ivorian has been winning middle-distance races all over Spain. He competed in 11 races during 2018-19, winning five \u2013 and was crowned Andalusia\u2019s 5,000m champion. Next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics will be too early for him, but Paris 2024 remains an aspiration. \u201cHe\u2019s young, but he\u2019s distinct and the fastest I\u2019ve seen in 35 years,\u201d says Paco Vall\u00e8s, his coach. \u201cI had faith my running would save me,\u201d says a smiling Yossodjo in Seville\u2019s Mar\u00eda Luisa Park, as he recounts his rise from destitution. \u201cI want to show the people of Spain that migrants can add to the society.\u201d Yossodjo was 14 when he left Ivory Coast after his father died and his mother could not care for him and his four siblings. He walked, hid in forests and foraged food from trees and garbage dumps, before eventually making it to Morocco in November 2014. He waited there for an opportunity to cross the Mediterranean, until a smuggler took pity on him and charged him half the \u20ac3,000 price to leave. When he reached Spain in 2016, he was immediately detained and after 10 days was sent to a centre for minors in Seville. Yossodjo had always loved running as a child, so when a friend of his social worker introduced him to a local athletics club, he did not look back. Within a year he had finished second in Spain\u2019s national youth 3,000m final. \u201cIt was a major shock to go from jail to racing in the championships in just one year,\u201d says Yossodjo. Of course, he still has a way to go to become an Olympian: his fastest time for 5,000m is a little over 15 minutes, meaning he would need to shave an improbable two minutes off that to qualify for Paris. The 1,500m might be more realistic, but he would still need to trim his record of four minutes by about 30 seconds. But that might not be his biggest problem. His status remains unsettled, so he is not qualified to run for Spain. An eclectic group of supporters including his coach, volunteers and a not-for-profit organisation have gathered around Yossodjo to help him with any needs. During the day he studies Spanish, and at night works as an orderly at a nursing home. He has been able to obtain a residency card, which allows him to live and work. Under Raindrops, a scheme fostered by the not-for-profit Di\u00e1logos Para Construir, Yossodjo speaks at youth homes, for social work programmes, and at public schools to tell his story and encourage other migrant youths to take up athletics. Every afternoon he trains for a couple of hours. If he can meet the 1,500m time, his coach says, Spain will also grant him citizenship to compete \u2013 and although the pressure is intense, Yossodjo understands he is running for his future. \u201cI will never forget my country, or that I am African, but my future is in Spain,\u201d he says.

The \u201cgreat October\u201d marking the events of 1917 used to be commemorated every year on 7 November, thanks to a quirk of chronology dating back centuries. This was not lost on the locals, with their well developed sense of irony: even the calendar was against them. Of course, 1917 was not the only November revolution that upended the region. Another uprising 30 years ago this weekend upstaged the Bolshevik festivities and steered a swathe of eastern Europe on to a new course. But for better or worse? Much has been made of the disillusionment gripping the region, but as our central and eastern European correspondent, Shaun Walker, found out, in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, people have never had it so good. The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 was perhaps the most Upsidey revolution in history.

Francisco S\u00e1nchez Molina wrote in from Helsinki: Warm greetings from the Wolf Action Group in Helsinki, Finland. We are a small NGO that works on sharing science-based information about the wolf as a social and family-oriented animal in order to influence attitudes and reduce unnecessary fear and hatred towards wolves. We are writing to you to propose that the Guardian\u2019s The Upside could write about the topic of wolf hate in Finland. In this otherwise peaceful, uncorrupted and well-educated country, poaching is the biggest cause of wolf mortality. Even though wolves are strictly protected by European law and Finland promotes itself as a destination for lovers of nature and the great outdoors, wolves are being legally hunted down. In fact, Finland was recently taken to the European court of justice over the way its authorities seem to easily hand out wolf-killing permits without sufficiently justifying their decisions. The present situation for the wolves in Finland is so severe that if public opinion doesn\u2019t change, Finland could be left with no wolves at all. Where was the Upside?

NGOs and organisations involved in carbon offsetting have seen as much as a fourfold increase in investment from people who want to try to mitigate their carbon footprints. Agencies who work with large corporations have also seen a spike in investment in carbon offsetting over the last 18 months. ClimateCare, a company that provides programmes to help organisations offset residual carbon emissions, has seen the amount of carbon offset increase from about 2m tonnes to 20m tonnes in that time, according to its chief executive, Edward Hanrahan. Smaller organisations have also reported massive spikes in offsetting. Caroline Pomeroy, the director of the NGO Climate Stewards, which offsets emissions for individuals and small businesses, said income from individuals offsetting had increased by 156% year on year, and that there had been an 80% increase in income from businesses and charities offsetting. Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent \u201ccredits\u201d from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Carbon offsetting has been controversial, with some critics saying it allows big polluters and individuals to buy carbon credits in exchange for a clean conscience while continuing to fly, drive and use fossil fuels. But in the past 10 years, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been created and participating companies and NGOs are theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers. The organisation Gold Standard was set up by the environment group WWF and other NGOs to ensure the integrity of projects that reduced carbon emissions and to ensure they contribute to sustainable development. Sarah Leugers, its communications director, said: \u201cEveryone should be looking to reduce their emissions as much as possible first, but for most of us it is impossible at this time to reduce them to zero, so taking accountability and financing the reduction in emissions somewhere else in the world is a way to accelerate the path to a low carbon economy.\u201d Hanrahan said large organisations were being driven to be responsible for not only the emissions that they created as a company, but also so-called \u201cScope 3 emissions\u201d from the use of their products, by a combination of consumer pressure and governments pushing for corporations to become more accountable for their impact on the climate. Leugers said transformative projects were those that improved cooking facilities in the developing world, for example by providing biogas stoves and projects that improved access to clean water, thus reducing greenhouse gases from burning firewood to boil water. \u201cThese are life-changing for people in the developing world and have real impact on reducing carbon emissions,\u201d she said. Gold Standard has reported a fourfold increase in income from individuals and small businesses paying for carbon offsets through its platform. \u201cPeople are willing to take action and are looking for ways to take action. We see it as a way that someone can feel empowered and reduce their carbon footprint,\u201d said Leugers. Climate Stewards funds a project in Nepal paid for by the purchase of carbon offsets, where 240 fuel-efficient cooking stoves have been built for remote communities. Each stove saves 6.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year per household and the stoves last for about 10 years. The price for a tonne of CO2 is not set globally, and varies between offset suppliers on the voluntary market. The US Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 assessed that for every tonne of CO2emitted into the atmosphere, we sacrifice between $11 and $212 in environmental degradation and negative social impacts. David Hughes, the chair of Climate Stewards, said: \u201cThis year, the whole business of carbon offsetting has suddenly taken off. It has been so gratifying to see a lot of individuals choosing to offset over the last 12 months \u2013 the numbers have more than doubled. \u201cWe are seeing the Greta effect, the impact of Extinction Rebellion, the impact of the words of David Attenborough, the school strikes, all of these coming together.\u201d But Hanrahan said while voluntary carbon mitigation and individual actions were laudable, ClimateCare was clear in its call for mandatory carbon pricing and mitigation for large corporations and industries like aviation. \u201cOur position is that this should not be an optional or voluntary thing. Expecting individuals to be able to make fully informed decisions about such a specialist, complex area is madness,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want is a scenario where corporates are mandated to pay a price on carbon that reflects the societal cost of dealing with climate change and carbon emissions, and to pay for mitigating their emissions.\u201d Case study Flying to and from Malaysia to visit his family each year was causing increasing concern to Shanon Shah, a freelance writer from London. Through his partner, an Anglican priest, he was introduced to Climate Stewards, and began to see a way in which he could compensate for his carbon footprint. \u201cBut then I thought, it isn\u2019t enough to offset the flights that I am going to take in the future, as I take them. I sat down and tried to remember all the flights I had ever taken in my life. \u201cAnd bit by bit I accounted for my flying in the past. Every few weeks when I got a paycheck I offset a few of the past flights that I had made over a particular period. Over the course of six or seven months, I managed to offset all the flights I can ever remember taking. That was around 35 flights.\u201d Shah is continuing his mission to reduce and mitigate his own emissions. \u201cFrom now on, every time I book a flight I offset it.\u201d But Shah thinks the airline industry itself has to be made accountable for its emissions. Emissions from international aviation are not included in national inventories of their emissions, and under the Kyoto protocol \u2013 something there is growing pressure to change \u2013 aviation is not subject to VAT or fuel tax. \u201cIt has excluded itself from all these environmental protocols, and there should be more pressure to make their emissions accountable,\u201d said Shah. \u201cBut in the meantime I think that this is something I can do as an individual.\u201d In Stoke-on-Trent, Daniel Charlesworth, 24, who works for the police, has made a similar decision. He has chosen to offset all his car travel. \u201cI have been researching electric cars for months, but there is a lot of life left in my car and I cannot afford an equivalent electric car,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I have begun offsetting my journeys each month and set up a direct debit, I think it amounts to about \u00a37 per month. \u201cI know that even if you have thousands and thousands of individuals like me doing the same it is not going to make a huge difference, but I feel I have a personal responsibility to be accountable for my emissions. And if what I am doing leads others to do it as well, it can help to drive change.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "On top of the world: Europeans say they are happier than ever", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/on-top-of-the-world-europeans-say-they-are-happier-than-ever", "date": "2019-11-08", "transcript": "Europeans are happier with their lives than they were five years ago, according to a survey in 32 countries that hints at broad levels of satisfaction despite one of the most turbulent periods of postwar history. The Eurostat survey found that self-reported levels of satisfaction rose in all but three countries surveyed (Lithuania, Sweden and the Netherlands). It found the most content Europeans are in Switzerland, Norway, Finland and Austria. Across the EU28, satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 rose to 7.3 in 2018, from 7 in 2013. Lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded in Bulgaria, Croatia and Greece, though even here, people felt better about their lives than in 2013. The findings are something of a surprise given the social and political convulsions across Europe in recent years. The continent has been unsettled by waves of protest, mass immigration, a series of inconclusive elections and the rise of populism. Yet at the same time in most European countries, people live longer, enjoy greater prosperity and better health than at any time in history. The Eurostat survey uncovered clear evidence that life satisfaction depends to a certain extent on wealth, education and age. Of young people, 11% declared a low level of life satisfaction, compared with 30% for people over 75. Not surprisingly, satisfaction levels among the richest 20% were on average more than a whole point higher than those among the poorest quintile (7.8 against 6.6). Rich Finns were the most satisfied subgroup in the survey, poor Bulgarians the least. People with children, and people with degrees generally scored higher than average. \u201cThe mean rating for people with tertiary education is about one point higher than the one for respondents whose highest educational level is lower secondary education,\u201d the report said.

A Dutch start-up, the Amsterdam municipality and the regional water board launched the Great Bubble Barrier, a simple device that channels rubbish \u2013 especially small pieces of plastic \u2013 to the side of the Westerdok canal where it can be retrieved. Tests have shown it can divert more than 80% of flotsam. \u201cMore than two-thirds of plastics in the ocean comes out of rivers and canals \u2013 so if you have to intercept it, why not do it in the rivers?\u201d says Philip Ehrhorn, co-inventor of the technology. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a physical barrier in a canal: it has to be open for wildlife and recreation.\u201d The hope is that the innovation will help to address the mounting crisis of plastic waste in the ocean. Estimates suggest as much as 8m tonnes of plastic ends up in the world\u2019s seas each year \u2013 the equivalent of one truckload of old bottles, trays and containers every minute. The bubble barrier is a long, perforated tube running diagonally for 60 metres across the bottom of the canal. Compressed air is pumped through the tube and rises upwards, and then the natural water current helps to push waste to one side. It is trapped in a small rubbish platform on the side of the Westerdokskade at the tip of Amsterdam\u2019s historic canal belt. Ehrhorn, a German naval architect and ocean engineer, got the inspiration from a water treatment plant he saw while studying in Australia in 2015. \u201cAt one stage they aerate the water, and on a big surface put air bubbles like a big jacuzzi,\u201d he said. \u201cThe small plastic pieces that people throw in the toilet all collected in one corner and that was the kind of spark for me. If you can guide plastic to the side, can\u2019t you do it in a more directed way and on purpose in a river?\u201d At the same time, three keen Dutch amateur sailors and friends, Anne Marieke Eveleens, Francis Zoet and Saskia Studer, were discussing the problem over a beer in Amsterdam one evening and came up with the idea of a curtain of bubbles that sifts out waste but lets fish and boats through over a beer one evening in Amsterdam. The two teams came together to work on the idea, with the help of a \u20ac500,000 Postcode Lotteries Green Challenge award and other prizes. The first operational barrier in Amsterdam \u2013 due to run 24 hours a day for three years \u2013 aims to supplement dredging operations, which currently collect 42,000 kg of larger plastics from the Dutch capital\u2019s waterways each year. Bubble barrier waste will be separately collected, then analysed by plastics action group Schone Rivieren (Clean rivers). Marieke van Doorninck, head of sustainability for Amsterdam council, hopes it will be a successful example. \u201cAmsterdam\u2019s canals have enormous appeal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you think of them, you don\u2019t think about plastic bottles and bags in the water. The bubble barrier will mean fewer plastics reach the ocean, and is a step towards better regulation of our ecosystem, to the benefit of man, beast and environment.\u201d In the small, waterlogged country, this kind of innovation is welcome. Bianca Nijhof, managing director of the Netherlands Water Partnership, who organises the Amsterdam International Water Week conference, running this week, added: \u201cThe Dutch live with the water and don\u2019t fight against it: 50% of the country is below sea level, more than half is prone to flooding and in 2018 we had severe drought,\u201d she said. \u201cThis special relationship with water combined with an entrepreneurial mindset mean that innovation is at our core. The bubble barrier is one solution for clean water for all.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Money and maps: is this how to save the Amazon's 400bn trees?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/06/local-tribe-save-amazon-indigenous-peruvians", "date": "2019-11-06", "transcript": "The first thing Ram\u00f3n heard about the deal was the televisions. A number of families from the Ash\u00e1ninka indigenous group had received them from outsiders, in exchange for land. Loggers were interested in the mahogany, oak and tornillo trees that grow to impressive heights in this part of the rainforest around Cutivireni in central Peru. The loggers had other means of persuasion, besides bribery. They might offer to build a school or a meeting house in exchange for timber. When the work ran over budget, they would demand money \u2013 and since the Ash\u00e1ninka had none, they would take more trees to service the debt, according to Adelaida Bustamante, the community treasurer. And if that failed, they used violence. In 2014, four forest defenders from the Ash\u00e1ninka were murdered for their campaign to keep loggers off their land (Ram\u00f3n asked me not to use his real name). Conflict such as this \u2013 over land, timber and forest \u2013 has taken on huge significance in the global struggle to confront the climate emergency and keep the world from overheating. According to the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change report, halting deforestation is essential to prevent climate catastrophe. A study this summer indicated the huge potential of tree planting and retention for stabilising the world\u2019s climate. But in the Amazon, remote communities come under sustained pressure \u2013 financial, physical and, yes, televisual \u2013 to clear their land and surrender their trees. Almost 60% of Peru (675,000 square kilometres, or 260,000 square miles) is covered by Amazon forest. Peru\u2019s primary forest, where you find the lofty hardwoods so prized by commercial timber traders, is shrinking at an alarming rate: Global Forest Watch reported that Peru lost 140,185 hectares (346,405 acres) of primary forest in 2018. Ash\u00e1ninka territory spans a protected area of primary forest across the east of Peru, near the border with Brazil, so their lands are effectively a buffer zone. Ram\u00f3n discovered that, besides TVs and other gifts, people in the Cutivireni area were being offered a derisory price for their timber. He persuaded the community not to sell their part of the forest, and insisted they give back the TV sets. The loggers retreated, but it was pretty clear they would not give up. Working in secret, for fear of retaliation from the loggers, Ram\u00f3n tried to come up with a long-term strategy for preserving the rainforest. He spoke to a Welsh anthropologist, Dilwyn Jenkins, who had been living in the region and studying the Ash\u00e1ninka people for decades. Jenkins, who died in 2014, suggested the community contact Cool Earth, a rainforest charity set up in 2007 by MP Frank Field. Cool Earth, which also has projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, offers finance and training to indigenous communities to support them in protecting their areas of the forest. The charity sets up funding for community associations, on condition that the whole group decides how they will spend it (in this remote region, the money is mostly wanted for emergency healthcare). It also uses satellite maps to show locals the extent of forest clearance in their area, and the speed with which the rainforest is disappearing. \u201cThe most effective strategy to conserve the rainforest, in any part of the world, is to empower indigenous groups who are motivated in the same direction,\u201d says Tony Juniper, former director of Friends of the Earth, Cool Earth ambassador and author of Rainforest. \u201cIt\u2019s a tried-and-tested strategy in South America. It has worked in Brazil, Colombia and Peru: if you look at maps of the forest in those countries, you will see that the areas under indigenous control are best protected.\u201d The Ash\u00e1ninka know all about external threats. For years they survived a terror onslaught from the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who targeted young men to join their ranks and occupied villages that then came under retaliatory fire from government forces. In the 1990s, after the guerrillas were defeated, narco-traffickers slipped into their place, offering a high price for remote land for cultivating coca. They restored an airstrip that missionaries had built in Cutivireni in the 1970s and used it to transport drugs and weapons. After the years of conflict, the Ash\u00e1ninka face a new threat. The greatest driver of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is now subsistence farming, and as the population grows in these more peaceful times, there is an urgent push to grow more food. A study published in May this year, by Princeton University, on biodiversity loss in Peru, showed that in the western Amazon, smallholder \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d agriculture is the \u201cprimary driver of forest destruction\u201d. The main method of farming among the Ash\u00e1ninka involves felling trees to make a clearing, creating space in the sunlight where their food crops can grow. In 2016, wildfires caused a spike in deforestation rates in Cutivireni \u2013 fires that may have been started by burning to prepare the ground for planting. So part of the Cool Earth project involves giving local people the information they need to make their farming practices more efficient and less destructive. Director Matthew Owen says that while campaigns against industrial-style palm and soya plantations are working, the focus must now switch to smallholders\u2019 agriculture, which is responsible for keeping deforestation emissions stubbornly high. \u201cFiguring out how to support better lives while keeping the forest standing deserves some of the innovation billions that go to carbon storage and better batteries,\u201d Owen says. This much is clear from observations on the ground. After a long walk through the cool of the Cutivireni forest, past towering tornillo trees and mashonastes with their great buttressed trunks, dangling orchids and tree ferns \u2013 suddenly, a clearing. It looks like the aftermath of a battle: trees slashed to the ground lying, some half-burned, where they fell. Between the trunks sprouted yuca plants, the staple foodstuff of this region, as well as bananas and sweet potatoes. \u201cPeople in remote areas have an obsession with growing yuca,\u201d says Aurora Lume, an agronomy graduate and member of Cool Earth\u2019s field team who grew up in the region (her family had to flee their village when guerrillas moved in). \u201cA family of three will clear a hectare of forest to plant this crop. But the soil only has a useful life of two years. After that, they will move on and clear another patch.\u201d The agronomist is helping Ash\u00e1ninka people in this area to boost the productivity of their land for food crops. Cool Earth also pays a coffee technician to visit the villages and advise on how to improve the quality of their coffee and cacao yields \u2013 these could be a useful source of income. Coffee grows better in the shade, so a successful coffee business keeps the forest canopy intact. The Cool Earth team convened a meeting in the tiny settlement of Tankoari, before a crowd of about 50, including children, and the chief. As woodsmoke billowed, Bustamante gave the villagers a severe lecture about the new clearings we had walked through. There had to be better planning, she insisted, if they were to continue to receive funding. Lume then unfurled the instrument that will enable this planning: a large satellite map. The map showed the area across the Ene river almost entirely stripped of forest after a government-sanctioned land-grab by farmers from the Andes in the 1980s. On the Cutivireni side, the picture was more varied: dark brown patches showed dramatic forest clearance from 2016, mostly caused by fire, and pale patches indicated the areas where crops were growing. Analysts at Cool Earth made these maps from data produced from Landsat images by Matthew Hansen at the University of Maryland. Campaigners, NGOs and investigators increasingly use Hansen data to compile evidence of large-scale clearance by multinational companies. But satellite mapping is also proving a powerful way to demonstrate to local communities the effect of their farming methods. The villagers at Tankoari were impressed: they had not realised the bald patches were so numerous, or so close together. \u201cThe people were taken aback by what they saw,\u201d Daylar Capaquia, a field officer with Cool Earth, told me later. The Ash\u00e1ninka territory runs eastwards almost to the border of the Otishi national park, more than 3,000 sq km of pristine forest, and they had a sense of the forest rolling on indefinitely. \u201cNow the Ash\u00e1ninka are realising their situation and understanding how precarious their environment is,\u201d says Capaquia. \u201cThe mapping exercise is a new beginning, there\u2019s a transition under way.\u201d The Cool Earth funding agreements are, in theory, conditional on keeping the trees standing. \u201cThere will be a challenge,\u201d says Capaquia. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve agreed where they can cut down trees to grow food, they must stick to that.\u201d The challenge was uncomfortably apparent as the meeting continued against the rhythmic sound of axe against tree trunk, followed by the slow, tearing noise of a 100ft tree crashing to the ground. Before the satellite mapping project, the boundaries between what is protected and what is not were never clear. Jaime Pe\u00f1a, a conservationist and forest expert from Cutivireni and adviser to Cool Earth, has been monitoring incursions into pristine forest for more than a decade. \u201cWe were clearing areas to grow subsistence crops, without planning or oversight,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too heavy handed, but people have to understand that if they continue to clear at the present rate, in 15-20 years, they will have no forest. Mapping is helping villages to plan how they use land. It is creating the groundwork for a new chapter.\u201d In the areas where Cool Earth is working with communities, planning and managing cultivation has reduced forest loss by half. The power of community engagement is being taken more seriously: the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Programme (Programa Nacional de Conservaci\u00f3n de Bosques) in 2010, rewarding communities who succeed in curbing deforestation and managing sustainable farming systems in their territory with annual payments and technical support. As reports show an increase in illegal mining in southern Peru, with devastating results, the forests of Cutivireni have a much better prospect of survival.

It is next door to the squat, concrete Olivia sports hall, where the Solidarity trade union movement held its first congress in 1981, heralding the beginning of the end for communism in the region. The economic demands of Solidarity, which had sprung up at the huge Gda\u0144sk shipyard and was led by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, rippled through Poland and then the rest of central and eastern Europe during the 1980s. By the end of the decade, borders were open, regimes collapsed and the Berlin Wall, concrete symbol of 45 years of European division, was being pulled down. What happened next was extraordinary, painful and unpredictable, as an entire region lurched into uncharted territory. Progress was fitful, messy and often unevenly distributed, sowing the seeds in some countries for the recent rise of populism. But 30 years on from the heady days of autumn 1989, a range of metrics demonstrate that the transition from communism to capitalism has been a remarkable success. Central and eastern Europe over the past 30 years has witnessed one of the most dramatic economic spurts of growth that any region of the world has ever experienced. People live longer, healthier lives. Air quality is better, and individuals are on average twice as wealthy. \u201cThis is the golden age for the region,\u201d says Marcin Piatkowski, a Polish economist who recently authored a book called Europe\u2019s Growth Champion, about the meteoric rise of Poland\u2019s economy over the past three decades. \u201cThe whole region has been successful, as reflected in the fact that on average, no Bulgarian, or Romanian or Pole has ever lived better than they do now, both in absolute terms and in relative terms compared to the west.\u201d Such optimism often feels misplaced, given that many people in the region still feel left behind. But the statistics show that since 1990, the Polish and Slovak economies have grown more than sevenfold, and those of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and the Czech Republic more than fivefold. At the same time, the nations remain some of the most equal in the world, as measured by the Gini coefficient (one of the leading measures of wealth distribution). There have been benefits when it comes to quality of life, too. In 1990, the average Hungarian, Latvian or Romanian did not live to see their 70th birthday, and life expectancy in other east European countries was not much better. Since then, longevity has surged as much as 10% in some parts of the region, and east Europeans are now more likely to be nearer 80 than 70 when they die. Grabski, born in Gda\u0144sk in 1968, has a story similar to many of the generation of Polish entrepreneurs in the years after the collapse of communism. Young and enthusiastic as the transition came, he eagerly sought out any economic opportunities going. His first business involved repeated trips to Hamburg, where he would sleep in the car and return with a carload of spare automobile parts, which he could sell on for a profit. Later, he invested money in an internet startup, and then into construction. He now runs one of the city\u2019s biggest companies. The \u201cshock therapy\u201d reforms that speedily pushed Poland and other countries in the region into capitalism have come in for criticism, but Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland\u2019s reforms, still believes they were the best option for the country in the circumstances. \u201cIf you move fast from a bad system to a better one, you release new forces for growth,\u201d he says in an interview at the Warsaw School of Economics, where he is now a professor. While communism left the region an economic basket case, it did also provide some of the seeds for growth: well-educated societies with low levels of inequality. And crucially, unlike in Russia and Ukraine, central European countries largely avoided a situation where a few people walked off with the majority of the prized former state assets. Particularly in Poland, the transition led to a class of entrepreneurs like Grabski, rather than a small group of oligarchs. \u201cWe had the Solidarity movement in the factories and they were like a watchdog. So directors couldn\u2019t go into shabby deals like in Russia,\u201d says Balcerowicz. Life under capitalism Fifteen years after the transition, Poland and seven other former communist east European countries joined the EU. With much of eastern Europe becoming part of the single market, it could be integrated into western European supply chains. For smaller businesses, it also meant operating in an improved institutional setting and convergence with EU standards. \u201cJoining the EU was the key moment, not because of subsidies, but because of frameworks: anti-monopoly rules, environmental protection and so on,\u201d says Grabski. In some countries in the region, these institutional frameworks are still under attack from governments, but the situation compared with neighbouring Ukraine, for example, where the courts, police and tax authorities are hopelessly dependent on political and big business interests, is incomparable. Life under capitalism was not rosy for everyone. At the vast Gda\u0144sk shipyard, where Solidarity was born, the majority of orders came from the communist bloc and dried up after the transition. The shipyard was kept afloat with government subsidies, but these were deemed unfair according to EU competition laws. The shipyard was divided into several private enterprises, and little actual shipbuilding is still taking place. Many other communist-era factories across the region have gone the same way, unable to adapt to market conditions. But in place of the hulking shipyard, a number of smaller companies building yachts have sprung up in Gda\u0144sk and elsewhere on Poland\u2019s Baltic coast, and many of them have become successful. However, if there is one factory that symbolises both central Europe\u2019s growth over the last three decades and the potential pitfalls going forward, it is not the Gda\u0144sk shipyard but the Audi plant at Gy\u0151r, in north-west Hungary. Audi first invested in the site in the early 1990s when it was a moribund heavy machinery factory for mainly communist bloc clients. Things took off when Hungary joined the EU in 2004 and could be integrated fully into the manufacturer\u2019s supply chain. Today, Audi Hungaria is a modern-day capitalist version of a Soviet monogorod, or one-factory town. The vast complex on the outskirts of Gy\u0151r is a set of nondescript white hangars linked by an internal road system, and the plant has its own restaurants, medical clinic, fire station and postal service. Every single Audi TT in the world is assembled here, while engines for many other models are also produced and shipped to Germany and elsewhere for assembly. In one vast hall, giant yellow Japanese robots whoosh and whir their way through the process of assembling the car bodies, cutting, welding, applying adhesives and piecing the cars together with minimal human input. Workers scurry between the halls, many with colour-coded polo-shirt collars denoting their status on the assembly line. The plant has over 13,000 employees, and when subcontractors and affiliated businesses are taken into account, it is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 people in Gy\u0151r work in the automobile industry, which could amount to as much as half of the working-age population. While Poland is more diversified, by virtue of being the region\u2019s biggest economy, for smaller countries in the region, the dependence on the German car market is huge, and some worry about the effects of a slump in the market on places like Gy\u0151r. \u201cIf Volkswagen can\u2019t sell to China, Slovakia gets hammered the next day,\u201d says Piatkowski. Going forward, the key will be moving away from an economic model of western European countries outsourcing production to the east, and towards one that sees ideas and innovation developed inside the region. Only in this way, analysts say, will the countries of the region be able to fully close the gap in wealth and living standards with the other half of Europe. So far, however, there is little sign of the spending on research and development, or institutional reforms, that would be required for such a long-term shift. \u201cSmart people across the region understand that the growth model is over, but whether real change is politically feasible is another question,\u201d says Milan Ni\u010d, head of the central and eastern Europe programme at the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWhat I see is that businesses are looking for loopholes rather than changing the overall policies.\u201d This kind of supply-chain relationship amplifies regional disgruntlement at being regarded a \u201csecond-tier\u201d backwater by \u201cold Europe\u201d. Thirty years since the Velvet Revolution, some of those who helped bring down communism in 1989 are now supporters of populist governments who accrue political capital by attacking the EU. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy, one of the organisers of the pan-European picnic in 1989, which presaged the fall of the Berlin Wall by allowing hundreds of East Germans to cross the Iron Curtain from Hungary to Austria and onwards to West Germany, complains that western Europe treats the new states like \u201cthe doormat of Europe\u201d, with a condescending and patronising attitude. Additionally, while the statistics may show that on average even the poorest parts of society are better off than they were 30 years ago, this is little comfort to those in former industrial areas or rural regions where there is an overwhelming sense of decay; indeed, that decay can feel ever more pressing when compared to the progress experienced in shinier areas. Not everyone is convinced that the impressive statistics tell the whole story. Jolanta Banach, a former Polish finance minister from a leftist party, puts much of the popularity of the country\u2019s current populist government in smaller towns and villages down to the unequal access to public services and infrastructure: while big cities in Poland are now linked by modern fast trains, public transport in rural areas is often poor, an issue across the wider region too. Public health and education services are generally in better shape than 30 years ago, but also remain underfunded. \u201cWhen you look at the Gini factor, it\u2019s not so bad, but that hides a lot of things. What you don\u2019t see in the statistics is the uneven access to public services and infrastructure,\u201d says Banach. The introduction of freedom of movement with EU accession has also led to millions of central and eastern Europeans heading west over the past 15 years. On the one hand, this has provided opportunities and experiences that were unimaginable to the previous generation who were stuck behind the Iron Curtain, but it has also combined with declining birth rates and a fear of immigration to contribute to shrinking societies. In the three decades since independence, the populations of all the region\u2019s countries have shrunk. Latvia has lost more than a quarter of its population, Bulgaria and Romania around a fifth. With higher salaries a short and easy flight away, the process was inevitable. In parts of the region, this has led to chronic shortages of doctors and other skilled workers. In the long run, if the countries of central and eastern Europe can continue to catch up with the west, many of the emigres will be drawn back. With Brexit stalking the UK, there are already anecdotal signs of an incipient return. There are flights from London and other western European hubs to dozens of cities in the region, often cheaply. \u201cWe haven\u2019t lost these people,\u201d says Piatkowski. \u201cThe form of emigration has changed. In the 19th century a redneck from the Polish mountains would move to America and you\u2019d never hear of him for 100 years. Now you can get a \u20ac20 Ryanair flight back to Krak\u00f3w.\u201d As the economic gap between the east and the west of the continent continues to narrow, it is possible that many of these people will eventually return to their home countries, bringing with them money, skills and networks developed during their time abroad. For all the problems, Piatkowski says it\u2019s worth acknowledging just how fast things have improved. Poland has moved from 25% of German income levels 30 years ago to 60% today. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect Poles to completely catch up with Germans within one generation. It\u2019s only natural for people to aspire to a good life as quickly as possible. But it\u2019s just unrealistic for this to happen. The whole region has been the dark periphery of Europe for the last 1,000 years,\u201d he says. Wa\u0142\u0119sa, Solidarity\u2019s leader and post-communist Poland\u2019s first president, who was in charge when the shock therapy reforms were made, has become a marginal figure on the Polish political scene, and his cantankerous criticisms of the current government are sometimes seen as counterproductive even by the opposition. But he is still respected for his role in bringing the country out of communism. Reflecting on today\u2019s economy, he thinks neoliberal economies require regulation to make sure they stay fair. \u201cWhen there was a communist bloc, the two systems were keeping each other in check to some extent,\u201d he says in an interview at his office in Gda\u0144sk. \u201cNow there is no control over the development of capitalism. It\u2019s like a road without traffic lights or road signs.\u201d However, looking back at the economic transition, famously compared by him and others to turning fish soup back into an aquarium, the 76-year-old feels there are plenty of reasons to look positively on the past three decades. \u201cAlready the fish are swimming, and they\u2019re doing all right now,\u201d he says, with a smile.

What we liked The UN has launched plans to mark its 75th birthday next year, asking people to come up with three things that can save the world.

Kudos to Positive News for a long read on co-housing: sort of like an estate where everyone has to talk to each other. And this was illuminating: the rise and rise of biochar. What we heard Lots of you wrote in about cargo sailing ships. Robert Melotti said: I really like the piece on sail cargo: we did something similar a while ago. I think an interesting commercial venture in the making is taking place in Australia right now. Government funding is just around the corner apparently, and plans for much larger sailing container vessels as well. Zdravko Podolski got in touch from Croatia: I really enjoyed your article on sail-driven transport. Can I draw your attention to the fact there is a shipyard in Europe, in Croatia in fact, that is capable of building clipper-sized sailing ships. One was just recently launched. It may warrant an article. And John Lucas sent an idea from Toronto Sailing vessels may well have a useful role but won\u2019t scale to anything like the volume needed. Just look at a photo of London docks in the age of sail \u2013 then multiply by a few hundred! Has any organisation considered building undersea gliders for cargo? Steve Kirby is frustrated: I\u2019ve just enjoyed your Winds Of Change article about sailing ships once again being used to deliver goods across the oceans. I would be interested if you would be able to investigate why many thousands of new homes are being built without solar thermal or PV panels on their roofs. Constant frustration to see new estates being constructed without a solar panel in sight. Surely it would be very easy and cost-effective to install solar as part of a new-build project of multiples of homes. Installing electric boilers would also make sense, especially as the use of gas is to be phased out in the coming years. Where was the Upside?

She was arrested and expelled. Her life trajectory seemed destined for a downward arc. Henrietta had been in eight foster homes since she was 14. At the time she threatened her schoolmate, she was living alone in a hostel, scared, angry and alienated. But now she sits in Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s office block in London\u2019s Canary Wharf, where she has been setting up a new role of careers consultant for young people in care for E&amp;Y Foundation. She will take on the full-time role herself in January. \u201cIt seems so far-fetched, me working in Canary Wharf with all these smart, white, middle class people. It\u2019s taken a lot of getting used to and I still have wobbles, but I\u2019m basically now all \u2018Let\u2019s do it!\u2019,\u201d she laughs. The turnaround in her life over the past four years has been startling: she founded and runs two businesses, has joined other company boards and is a regular public speaker. The turning point was a chance meeting with the Agency, a social enterprise that works with deprived youngsters across the UK, encouraging them to create projects to solve the problems in their own community. Based on a hugely successful Brazilian initiative to help young people in the favelas, the Agency has spent almost 60,000 hours supporting and working with more than 250 young people to raise money, set up projects and create jobs. Today, parliament is hosting a celebration of the Agency\u2019s work, giving politicians the chance to meet some of the young protagonists and discuss their enterprises and initiatives. The Agency is of course not alone in nurturing young British entrepreneurs. But its approach is novel. It uses government data to pinpoint areas of multiple deprivation and then targets young people who understand the area best, approaching them in parks, on the street, in chip shops and at bus stops. \u201cWe ask two questions,\u201d said the movement\u2019s Brazilian founder, Marcus Faustini. \u201cWho is the most talented young person you know who should be in this project? And who are the ones who are not engaged at all, who you imagine won\u2019t have any ideas? Because we want both of them.\u201d These schemes tackle raw issues head on, including knife and gang crime, mental health, loneliness among care leavers, lack of employment and training opportunities and negative perceptions of young black men. Henrietta met the Agency by chance when she was 21. After threatening her schoolmate, she had spent two years in the pupil referral unit and two more in a hostel where the atmosphere was so threatening that the kitchen was often spattered with blood from fights. The day she met the Agency, she was sitting in the lobby of the Battersea Arts Centre in south London, crying. \u201cWandsworth council had been paying my rent late for four years and, at 21, the arrears they\u2019d accumulated were suddenly my problem,\u201d she remembered. \u201cI was on my own, \u00a32,000 in debt, with an eviction letter in my hand.\u201d But then what Henrietta describes as a miracle struck: the Agency came to talk to her. \u201cThey changed the direction and course of my life. It\u2019s 100% because of them that I\u2019m here now,\u201d she said, gazing out over Canary Wharf and grinning fit to burst. The Agency works by paying young people a small stipend to compete to participate in a three-part programme. They must identify a social need in their community, come up with a business idea to solve it and pitch their ideas to a panel of industry experts. Three successful bidders are awarded \u00a32,000 each year to get their ideas off the ground. Those who are not successful are encouraged to join other schemes or offered support but no funding to continue with their own idea. Henrietta\u2019s project was Redefine, a theatre company for care leavers. \u201cWhen my project was chosen by the panel, for the first time in my life I felt proud of myself. I felt autonomy, responsibility and a sense of agency. I\u2019ve always had external agencies \u2013 be it a teacher, a social worker, a sexual adviser, a counsellor, a mental health therapist \u2013 talking for me, but this time I could talk for myself,\u201d she said. One weekday evening in Walthamstow, a deprived area of north-east London, a group of local teenagers are just setting out on their own journey with the Agency. Just 15, shy, gawky Ciaran makes a conscious effort to maintain eye contact and speak clearly. Using his own experience of knife crime and gangs, he is working to set up a sports club that provides a safe space for young people to talk about knives and gang membership, then offer them a route out. \u201cI joined a gang because I wanted a second home,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what my sports club will give these children: the chance to swap their gang for other groups that really will help them get the best out of their lives.\u201d Faidat Ope is 19 and has come down for the workshop from Moston in Manchester, where the Agency has a thriving programme. \u201cThey recruited me outside the KFC,\u201d said Ope, who has started a business to encourage young women to go into elite sport. \u201cI had literally no intention of turning up, but when I heard what they were offering, I just thought it was too good to be true.\u201d The Agency believes in giving its proteges freedom to build teams, test ideas, make it happen. With that freedom comes responsibility. \u201cAnd the young people always rise to the challenge,\u201d said Roisin Feeny of the Battersea Arts Centre, one of the key forces behind the social enterprise. \u201cThey grab that responsibility and work like they\u2019ve never worked before because they are proud of their own idea, which has been born from their own imagination, passion, dedication, frustrations and hard work.\u201d The Agency UK is a Battersea Arts Centre and Manchester\u2019s Contact programme devised in partnership with People\u2019s Palace Projects. This year\u2019s programme in Waltham Forest was funded by and part of the Mayor of London Borough of Culture.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Winds of change: the sailing ships cleaning up sea transport", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/sailing-ships-cleaning-up-sea-transport-oceans", "date": "2019-10-23", "transcript": "They fan out across the seas like a giant maritime dance, a ballet of tens of thousands of vessels delivering the physical stuff that has become indispensable to our way of life: commodities and cars, white goods and gas and grains, timber and technology. But shipping \u2013 a vast industry that moves trillions of pounds-worth of goods each year \u2013 is facing an environmental reckoning. Ships burn the dirtiest oil, known as bunker fuel; a waste product from the refinery process, literally scraping the bottom of the barrel, the crud in crude. It\u2019s so thick that you could walk on it at room temperature. As a result, shipping is a major polluter \u2013 responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions. Not surprisingly, innovators are starting to wonder if there is another way. \u201cAround 90% of everything we consume [in Britain] spends some time at sea, so we urgently need to make the transportation of goods more sustainable,\u201d says Will Templeman, an environmental scientist-turned-entrepreneur. Templeman\u2019s eureka moment came during a visit to the supermarket when he was agonising over the food miles in his trolley. He wondered if it would be possible to transport things such as coffee and chocolate with zero emissions. Then he remembered that this was how goods used to travel. By sailing ship. A quick online search revealed that a Dutch company was doing exactly that. The owners of Fairtransport were inspired to revive sail cargo after witnessing at first hand the yellow smog caused by commercial vessels. They restored two ships, a 70-year-old minesweeper renamed the Tres Hombres and a wooden ketch called Nordlys that dates back to 1873. Templeman arranged to board the Tres Hombres, sailing from the Azores to the Netherlands. \u201cI was watching the ocean and it came like a ghost ship through the dawn mist. It looked like a pirate vessel. I was so excited.\u201d He dreamed of launching his own ship but realised that the first step was to make full use of the sailing vessels already in service. He set up as a broker and together with his business partner, Will Adeney, went in pursuit of products to sell. They found their perfect olive oil in Portugal and arranged to have it shipped to Devon on board the Nordlys. They later sourced coffee beans in Colombia, and shipped them to Europe on the Tres Hombres. Their business, Shipped by Sail, was born. It joined a growing network of brokers and sailors passionate about transporting goods by wind power. The next step: to boost demand for this kind of transportation. \u201cConsumers already understand organic produce and fair trade, and the next step is clean transport,\u201d says Cornelius Bockermann, who founded Timbercoast, a German sail cargo company that has restored a schooner from 1920, and is now refitting a second. Clean transport is the missing link, as many so-called sustainable or ethical goods are currently carried on ships that pollute the air and sea. The perfect example of this is plant-based meat, shipped around the world from California. British couple Marcus and Freya Pomeroy-Rowden built their ship, the Grayhound, as a replica of an 18th-century lugger, and carry cargo between the UK and France, bringing West Country ale to Brittany and French wine to Cornwall. They supply small businesses along the way, for example providing wines to Dibble &amp; Grub on the Isles of Scilly. The couple enjoy the lifestyle of spending months at sea, making a living, while making a difference. Marcus says they\u2019re bringing trade back to a human scale. \u201cWe\u2019re taking quality products and transporting them direct to a distributor. We can understand and explain the whole chain for our products, from manufacture to the table.\u201d In France, TransOceanic Wind Transport has developed a labelling system with a voyage number, allowing the customer to see how products reached them. Broker Alex Geldenhuys launched New Dawn Traders in the UK about six years ago and is still developing her \u201cvoyage co-op\u201d model, bringing together farmers, ships and buyers. Geldenhuys has been inspired by local food communities and vegetable box schemes and wants to extend that movement overseas, building relationships with distant farmers to bring ethically produced, high-quality produce to the UK with a carbon footprint that is close to zero. She is seeking \u201cport allies\u201d to promote the idea in coastal communities, encouraging customers to pre-order products from the ships and turning collection events at the docks into celebrations of the whole process. A few weeks ago a French schooner, De Gallant, sailed into Bristol laden with produce from Portugal; the first time a tall ship had brought cargo to the city for decades. It was an emotional moment for Geldenhuys and the climax of years of work.\u201cIt was beautiful to watch her sailing in under the suspension bridge,\u201d she says. Local people milled around the ship, sampling olive oil, almonds and wines. Geldenhuys acknowledges that currently she can only deliver to her customers twice a year. Templeman says: \u201cRestaurants and other businesses need a regular supply to be reliable. So we\u2019re warehousing goods.\u201d Olive oil on De Gallant was transported by electric van to a restaurant in Bristol. The biggest challenge for sail cargo is scale. There are currently only a few small ships operating. Most companies feel that the time is ripe for expansion and have plans to build larger vessels. One of the founders of Fairtransport, Jorne Langelaan, has set up a new venture called EcoClipper to facilitate emission-free shipping worldwide. He is planning for more sailing ships running more routes more frequently. In Costa Rica, Canadian Danielle Doggett is building a sailing ship called Ceiba, which looks set to become the largest in the world. The project uses tropical trees that have fallen in storms, and more trees are planted as the building proceeds. Ceiba will be able to carry 250 tonnes of cargo (Tres Hombres and De Gallant take 35 tonnes), which is equivalent to around 10 containers. Yet this is still much smaller than the historic tea clippers, such as the Cutty Sark, and dwarfed by the largest modern container ships, which can carry more than 20,000. The shipping industry knows that change is on the horizon. From next year new regulations will further limit sulphur oxide emissions from ships. The International Maritime Organization has announced its ambition to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The world\u2019s largest shipping company, Maersk, has gone further, pledging to be carbon-neutral by 2050. Templeman acknowledges that the largest companies want to make their fleets more energy-efficient, but points out: \u201cWe\u2019re coming from the opposite direction and offering emission-free shipping right now, while asking what sail shipping could have been with another 100 years of development.\u201d Marcus Pomeroy-Rowden adds: \u201cWe\u2019re waving a flag to say the world can\u2019t carry on as it is. We\u2019re also showing what can be done in a different way.\u201d Bockermann stresses that industrial shipping is only cheap because it externalises the environmental costs. \u201cWhat you normally pay a shipping company doesn\u2019t account for the damage to the environment, pollution or health. Our costs are comparatively high but if you had to pay for the damage of conventional shipping then we wouldn\u2019t seem expensive.\u201d Geldenhuys adds: \u201cWe might not be the solution to how everything is shipped in the world but we can make people think about what they\u2019re buying and how it\u2019s getting here. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. But we can all do something. We don\u2019t need one solution to everything, we need a thousand solutions that can exist simultaneously.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

One Young World\u2019s 10th annual summit will welcome young delegates from more than 190 countries as well as political and humanitarian leaders, including the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, Sir Richard Branson, Sir John Major and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \u201cOur young delegates are founders, activists and entrepreneurs in their own right, united by a common goal to resolve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges \u2013 from climate change and violent extremism to sexual violence and poverty,\u201d said Kate Robertson, a cofounder of the UK-based not-for-profit organisation. In a world where the most recognisable climate activist is a 16-year-old girl from Sweden, Robertson said: \u201cAt the heart of every global threat is a failure of leadership. This new generation is the most informed, most educated, most connected generation in human history.\u201d The organisation estimates that almost 21 million young people have been impacted by its ongoing programme of mentoring across the world. The Duchess of Sussex, the singer Ellie Goulding, the supermodel Leomie Anderson and Edward Enninful, Vogue\u2019s editor-in-chief, will also attend the annual four-day summit, which will be London\u2019s largest and most international event since the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The summit will also feature speeches from 30 global chief executives, including Alan Jope of Unilever, James Quincey of Coca Cola, Bram Schot of Audi, and Feike Sijbesma from DSM. They will be speaking to some would-be leaders of the future, among them: Madhav Datt Datt founded Green the Gene as a small environmental club in his school when he was eight years old. The organisation is now one of the world\u2019s largest youth-run environmental non-profits. It has projects in 62 countries and has mobilised more than 7,000 young people, all under 24, to build tangible solutions for communities facing acute climate crisis. Now 23, Datt has created a number of technology and data projects to address specific problems, including low-cost water filtration units, providing safe water to more than 40,000 people in rural Tanzania, recycling 3,000,000+ litres of swimming pool water annually in Haryana in India and planting more than 1,500,000 trees in Gambia and 600,000 in India. As a software engineering intern at Google, Datt developed machine-learning algorithms for Nest thermostat energy demand response programs, to reduce energy used by home heating/cooling systems during peak demand times. I learned about the climate crisis at firsthand: the water level in our local dam had fallen by 2ft, which meant our water and electricity was severely rationed. There was nothing abstract about the issue for me. Starting the environmental club, planting trees and talking to local shopkeepers about plastic bags were things I couldn\u2019t not do. One of the biggest things that being young gave me was the power to go up against huge issues because I simply didn\u2019t appreciate that they were widely regarded as impossible problems. Bella Burgemeister Burgemeister was 10 when she decided to write a book to help school-aged children understand the climate crisis. The book, now in its second edition, is in every school in her community in the south-west of Western Australia. In the past three years, Burgemeister has spoken to 5,000 children and 8,000 adults in schools, conferences and meetings. She is a climate activist and organiser. It was tough, aged just 10, to get my head around things like economic growth and responsible consumption but it\u2019s important that children understand these issues because for most of my life, the major political parties have done as little as they can get away with when it comes to climate change. Young people like me are the ones who will live with the consequences of inaction on climate. That was a huge motivator for me. Some politicians and local councillors said I was too young but I didn\u2019t care: I knew what I was doing was right. Edgar Edmund Edmund founded Green Venture Recycles, a company that turns plastic waste into affordable building products, when he was 14. The Tanzanian company has already turned more than 20m plastic bags into 20,000 bricks. I was 12 when I became aware that climate change was causing the floods that regularly destroyed my community. The flood waters were always full of plastic waste. When I was 15, I had a lightbulb moment: I realised that plastic was harder after being heated, which meant I could use the plastic waste to rebuild my community\u2019s homes strong enough to withstand the floods. It was one solution to two problems. I asked myself whether I was too young to deal with this but I realised that if I had to wait for someone else to solve the problem, it would be too late. I designed my first machine using $20 of savings. It took me a year of hard work but after I\u2019d finished, I took it to a science fair and won $100. I used that money to make a more efficient machine which was nominated for a prize in South Africa. I won $15,000 in that competition and used it to create an electric machine. Then I was invited to Sweden and won $7,000 and met investors who helped me get the machine into production. Brighton Kaoma Growing up in the Zambian city of Kitwe, 12 -year-old Kaoma saw the impact of climate breakdown firsthand: as floods and droughts began to destroy his community, he found he was having to walk an extra mile to fetch water and suffered repeated respiratory infections because of the toxic emissions from nearby copper mines. When he was 14, Kaoma asked a local radio station if he could present a show on the environment. Environmental Watch became one of the station\u2019s most popular programmes, educating listeners about the problems affecting them \u2013 from global heating and deforestation to pollution \u2013 and how they could help. Now 25, Kaoma has founded Agents of Change Foundation, training young people to be agents of change in their community. It has trained 260 children so far, many taking up leadership positions in their own communities. I mobilised my community, we planted trees, I organised marches, opened conservation clubs in schools across the area. By the time I approached the radio station, they had already heard about me and my work. Being so young meant I was free-spirited: I wasn\u2019t afraid on my programme to call a spade a spade. I called to task multinationals and government. People said I was too young. They threatened me by saying my life would be affected by getting on the nerves of everyone from government to local business. But I was fearless. I was too scared of my future, living in a world with no resources other than those that had been polluted, to let them scare me. Noga Levy-Rapoport Levy-Rapoport, 17, is a core UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal. She led her first London climate strike at 16. I have aways been aware of climate change but we all grew up being told that if we recycled more and switched off the lights, we would save the planet. I realised as I got older that that\u2019s wrong. I realised that I couldn\u2019t plan my future 20 to 30 years ahead because the world was going to hit a brick wall: it would descend into chaos. Young people have so much power because we\u2019re so angry. We\u2019re growing up in climate change and amid political disasters. There\u2019s always a risk that adults will think that we will sort this out but we\u2019re really clear: we don\u2019t have time for us to grow up before a solution is found. We\u2019re very clear that it\u2019s your mess and you must clear it up. Kehkashan Basu Winner of the 2016 International Children\u2019s Peace Prize, Kehkashan Basu has been campaigning on behalf of children\u2019s rights, gender quality and climate change since she was 8 years old. When I was 8, I planted my first tree and began talking to the children and grown ups around me about environmental issues. I realised that the children were so much more responsive and enthusiastic than the adults I was speaking to, so I determined to work with children instead, informing them about environmental issues and what they could do about it. Young activists have an advantage over adults because we have an uninhibited view of the world. We\u2019re not affected by cynicism or by awareness of how big problems are. We are determined to solve problems and are truly open to new solutions. The world needs more of that attitude.

The unit will bring together six universities and charities across the UK and the US to share expertise, ideas and resources to increase the scale of research. The hope is to improve understanding of how cancer arises, develop tests and imaging techniques and design clinical trials to speedily bring innovations to the public. The earlier cancers are detected, the easier they can be treated and the better the chance of survival. At present, there are routine screening programmes in the UK for bowel, breast and cervical cancer, while targeted screening for lung cancer is being piloted. But while experts say these programmes save lives there is more to be done: current methods do not pick up all cases while for many cancers no screening technologies exist. \u201cThere\u2019s still a major unmet need,\u201d said Prof David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, which is part of the alliance and is contributing \u00a340m over the next five years. \u201cIn fact around half of cancers are still diagnosed at an advanced stage and the outcomes for those people are very poor.\u201d The \u00a355m collaboration, dubbed the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED), will also delve into knotty issues such as why many people skip screening appointments, and explore how new techniques can be made easily accessible. \u201cWith this alliance one of the things that we are very committed to is taking things all the way through from the bench to the bedside,\u201d said Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald of the University of Cambridge, another of the UK institutions. There are even hopes it might one day be possible to offer a tailored approach to prevention whether through surgery or drugs.\u201cThere could eventually be drugs that we can give you that nip things in the bud because we can predict what is likely to go wrong in you,\u201d said Crosby. The alliance is looking to develop simple detection techniques based on blood, urine or even nasal swab samples, as well as working with sophisticated imaging techniques such as hyperpolarised MRI \u2013 this allows researchers to investigate how cancer cells generate energy and is showing promise in prostate cancer research. Prof Robert Bristow of the University of Manchester, which is also part of the alliance, said another project involves collecting pre-cancerous cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells from individuals with tissues at high risk of cancer and 3D printing them. This will allow scientists to change conditions such as oxygen levels or nutrients to explore what might trigger cells to become cancerous \u2013 potentially shedding light on the characteristics of early cancers and even ways to prevent them. \u201cIn a human being we never get to see a cancer being born,\u201d said Crosby, adding that established cancers might behave differently to early ones. \u201cIf you can essentially give birth to a cancer in a piece of synthetic human tissue in the lab, you can see what it is like on day one and hopefully be able to detect and intercept it,\u201d he said. The researchers acknowledged that some routine screening programmes, including for breast cancer, have been criticised for over diagnosis \u2013 a situation where cancers that would not have caused harm are found, often leading to unnecessary treatment. However, they say the alliance will explore techniques that will be better able to find problematic cancers, and distinguish them from those that are harmless \u2013 such as the use of MRI imaging to detect prostate cancer rather than traditional biopsies. They are also looking at ways to identify people at high or low risk of certain cancers, meaning those at high risk could be offered more frequent screening than those at low risk. The announcement of the alliance comes just weeks after it was found that cancer survival rates in the UK, while improving, are lagging behind those of other countries such as Norway, Canada and Australia. Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of early diagnosis, said that is down to a number of reasons, including a lack of diagnostic staff that delays diagnosis. \u201cGPs need faster access to smarter tests, so that they only need to send people at the highest risk of cancer to hospital for further investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cACED will aim to fast-track development of these types of tests and get them into clinical practice as soon as it is safe to do so.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Big oil to be eclipsed by the sun", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/big-oil-eclipsed-sun-renewables-revolution-fossil-fuels-upside", "date": "2019-10-18", "transcript": "Oil has been a game-changer for humanity. It turbocharged more than a century of growth and destruction: people got bigger, went further, stayed warmer and lived longer. Oil powered travel, exploration, science, industry and innovation.

It is clear that we cannot go on like this. That is why it was heartening this week to learn that renewables were experiencing such strong growth that demand for oil might peak in the next decade. Barely a week goes by without some new renewables record being achieved. In London, environmental activists are glueing themselves to trains and railings to urge the transformation that can halt the climate crisis. It may be quietly and slowly happening already.

Improbably, she presses on a pedal under a desk, like a driver pulling away in first gear. Magnetic pulses pass through an electromagnetic coil which is held to a patient\u2019s head. Clicking sounds fill the room and the patient\u2019s neural activity is temporarily altered over the course of a few minutes. A brain scan is visible to her right, the target area already visualised. \u201cThe neuronavigation tells you whether or not you\u2019re at the right place,\u201d Gallop says of the process, known as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). \u201cIt\u2019s replicable so you know when the participants come in the next time, you\u2019re stimulating the same area.\u201d Gallop\u2019s work carries deep personal significance: \u201cMy sister had anorexia so I was exposed to family therapy from a young age. And truthfully, it really exposed me to how treatment is very difficult \u2013 making a full recovery from anorexia is very difficult.\u201d New treatment innovations are urgently needed for eating disorders, which affect an estimated 1.25 million people in the UK. Hospital admissions have almost doubled in the last six years and patients are sent hundreds of miles away from home for treatment. Earlier this month, new figures showed that one in six consultant posts in eating disorder services are vacant. Patients with eating disorders are twice as likely to die prematurely than the general population. Results from the project, led by the psychiatrist Prof Ulrike Schmidt at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\u2019s College London, have been cautiously promising. \u201cOur brain imaging and behavioural studies suggest that the way in which rTMS might work is by reducing activity in a brain region \u2013 the amygdala, involved in anxiety and threat responses \u2013 and dampening patients\u2019 emotional arousal, stress and anxiety,\u201d says Schmidt. She says rTMS seems to affect attention, allowing patients to look towards food rather than away from it. It also appears to influence their choices, shifting towards \u201chigh-calorie tasty foods rather than their typical anorexia very low-calorie choices\u201d. Ultimately, she says, that means patients become more relaxed around eating. One participant credited rTMS for helping to dim the \u201cpunishing thoughts and catastrophic guilt\u201d she had endured in her 30 years with anorexia. \u201cWhilst the difference is small, it is hugely significant. It has allowed me to eat morsels of food that would have not only been immediately dismissed before the therapy, they would have made me want to scream,\u201d the patient said. It is relatively early days for rTMS (which has also been trialled in bulimia), which the researchers emphasise currently works best alongside traditional talking therapy. A 2018 randomised controlled trial showed 45% of those with anorexia receiving real rTMS reached normal weight 18 months after the study, compared with about 10% of those who received a sham treatment. However, participant numbers were small and there was a placebo effect during treatment. \u201cOne needs to exert a degree of caution here,\u201d Schmidt says, warning about the unrealistic promises some private rTMS clinics are making to patients and families. \u201cOnly proper large-scale trials will be able to answer the question of whether the early encouraging results of rTMS treatment in anorexia nervosa hold up to further scrutiny.\u201d The huge demand for treatment, and the paucity of existing services, appear to be stimulating an array of experimentation in the field. A second \u201cneuro-hack\u201d under development involves deep brain stimulation (DBS), an established surgical procedure in Parkinson\u2019s. Seven people with longstanding and severe anorexia have been recruited to a pilot study at the University of Oxford \u2013 preliminary results are expected towards the end of 2020. The aim, explains one of the investigators, the psychiatrist Rebecca Park, is to stimulate a brain region called the nucleus accumbens, the \u201chedonic hotspot\u201d which is central to reward processing. \u201cIn eating disorders, what is rewarding in life changes,\u201d Parks explains. \u201cIt\u2019s as if reward becomes warped towards pursuit of thinness. The eating and exercise rituals, obsessions and habits that characterise the disorder become entrenched over time.\u201d The DBS process, which can trigger complications, involves implanting electrodes into the brain that are linked by extension leads to an implanted pulse generator (in the form of a rechargeable pacemaker) placed beneath the skin below the collarbone. The researchers quote \u201can overall risk of stroke of less than 1%, a haemorrhage-causing death of 0.01% and a risk of wound infection of 5%\u201d. There are concerns about trialling a treatment that is so invasive and experimental without definitive data to support its use. The team\u2019s ethical framework will include \u201cchecks and balances at all stages, supported by an independent ethicist who will act as a patient advocate\u201d. Park concedes \u201cthere is a risk of instilling false hope, as DBS is not a magic bullet and is unlikely to help everyone\u201d. Nevertheless she believes that evaluating it ethically for anorexia is a step in the right direction.\u201d A third group of researchers based in Barcelona are innovating in a completely different space: a video game with built-in biofeedback that rewards emotional control. On a virtual tropical island, gamers enjoy sun and sand before experiencing tumultuous storms. The app is connected through Bluetooth to a single sensor that transmits heart rate and heart rate variability data from participants to the device. If participants can regulate their reactions and remain calm, their cardiac response is registered by the sensor, which rewards them by dissipating the storm. If they cannot regulate their emotions, the storm intensifies. This is biofeedback \u2013 gameplay dynamically adjusting to reactions. Improving this sort of emotional control can help those with eating and gambling disorders, conditions which both affect impulse control and emotional regulation, says Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez-Aranda, head of the eating disorders unit at Bellvitge University hospital in Barcelona, who developed the game along with colleague Susana Jim\u00e9nez-Murcia. None of these innovations can mask a shortfall of funding and expertise, as evidenced by the deaths of Averil Hart, who endured \u201cclear failures of care\u201d, and Hannah Bharaj, who was denied anorexia treatment. A recent Commons report concluded a lack of understanding was costing lives. Making the most of emerging technologies also means training health professionals and funding resources. Meanwhile, trials like the one at King\u2019s College London will continue to search for treatments. Gallop, whose sister did eventually recover, aims to trial TMS in younger people, who she believes might respond especially well because of their brain plasticity. \u201cI think it gives parents hope,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially if your child has already gone through an unsuccessful trial of talking therapy, you kind of feel like you\u2019re running out of options.\u201d For these families, the hunt for a cure must continue.

Talks are under way to determine which African country Love &amp; Wealth will make its screen debut in, but it is hoped the show will be distributed to as many English and French free-to-air channels as possible on the continent. \u201cIssues of sexual reproductive health, or gender, affecting youth as well as adults, cut across all sub-Saharan Africa, therefore we believe this show will be well received by and relevant to a wide audience on the continent,\u201d said Gosia Lukomska, the director of integrated media at Peripheral Vision International (PVI). She said her team had intentionally watched Nacer Contigo with muted audio, so that even those who understood Spanish would not know the original plot and dialogue. \u201cThis way, the footage was sort of \u2018tabula rasa\u2019 [a blank slate] to us, we were not influenced by the original story and could create our own from the visuals available,\u201d Lukomska said. When PVI tested the show in east Africa, viewers did not find anything unusual about a Venezuelan actor having a Ugandan name such as Wasswa, and remembered the characters\u2019 titles well, according to the NGO. Sex education is a controversial topic in Uganda, where the average woman has more than five children. Civil society groups have launched a lawsuit against the government over its failure to issue a comprehensive sex education policy in schools, after a crackdown on reproductive education. A report recently linked a lack of sex education to a rise in teenage pregnancies and new HIV/Aids infections in adolescents. Telenovelas have proved to be successful imports in sub-Saharan Africa. Robert Mawerere, the head of programming at NTV, one of Uganda\u2019s most popular broadcasters, said Ugandans loved telenovelas, whether they were Mexican, Filipino, Indian or Chinese, \u201cas long as they are romantic, dramatic and with fantasy\u201d. William Nyombi, the program manager for Marie Stopes Uganda, said they could be an effective way of getting across messages related to social behavioural change. \u201cA young person (or) a lady will tell you a whole story of a telenovela, so it has impact,\u201d he said.

They list as their political heroes progressive leaders such as Jacinda Ardern and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And they plan to juggle their new roles as elected officials with university exams and shifts at McDonald\u2019s. The record number of young New Zealanders, some still in their teens, who surged to victory in the country\u2019s local government elections on Saturday \u2013 in what was dubbed a \u201cyouthquake\u201d by commentators \u2013 were not lured by dreams of high-profile posts in national politics. Instead, they ran for roles on New Zealand\u2019s city and district councils or community boards \u2013 where elected officials have always tended to be older, white and male, and where elections have been treated with apathy by voters of all ages. \u201cIt\u2019s about representing our planet and representing a whole group of people who aren\u2019t currently strongly being heard around the council table,\u201d says Sophie Handford, 18, who was the youngest to be elected on Saturday, winning a seat on the lower North Island\u2019s K\u0101piti coast district council. \u201cObviously our planet doesn\u2019t have a physical voice,\u201d she says. \u201cI see the extreme importance of raising issues related to the planet and our climate at all levels.\u201d Inspired by the climate change activism of the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, Handford took a gap year after she finished high school in 2018 to lead New Zealand\u2019s school student strikes over inaction on global heating. Her progressive agenda included boosting mental health support and tackling youth homelessness. The so-called \u201cyouthquake\u201d in Saturday\u2019s election did not reflect a large boost in overall voter turnout. Preliminary figures showed 44% of New Zealanders cast ballots \u2013 just two percentage points higher than at the 2016 local government elections. Youth voting figures were not available on Wednesday. But the number of elected officials under 30 doubled according to preliminary figures, from 14 to 30 after the ballot, and the cohort under 40 increased by a half, to 91 from 59 last election. In previous local government elections, more than 90% of those elected were over 40. The number of women elected also grew \u2013 from 19% of the country\u2019s mayors in 2016 to 25% in Saturday\u2019s poll. On Monday, Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s Labour prime minister, noted the increase. \u201cIt certainly seems a bent of environmentalism across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that there was actually quite a bit of change in these elections.\u201d \u2018Put your hand up and get into it\u2019 On Saturday afternoon in Rotorua, a lakeside town in the North Island, Fisher Wang, 19, has just finished his shift at McDonald\u2019s when he learned that taking a gap year to run for office had also paid off for him. A few weeks before he was due to leave home for university this year, he says \u201cthis thought came into my head\u201d. \u201cIt was like, Fisher, is that really what you want to do? Do you really want to go and study law and do all that for the rest of your life?\u201d Meeting Ardern during her 2017 election campaign \u201creally fuelled the fire\u201d to get involved in politics, says Wang, who hopes to champion environmental and youth issues as a Rotorua Lakes councillor. He was \u201cstarstruck\u201d when the prime minister rang to congratulate him after Saturday\u2019s result. \u201cShe talked about her journey into politics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe advice she gave me was to enjoy it, put your hand up and get into it.\u201d Wang says he will continue to work at McDonald\u2019s on his days off, adding that it was a good opportunity to hear from his constituents. Feedback while hitchhiking Another successful candidate who said victory would not change his habits was the new mayor of the South Island city of Dunedin, Aaron Hawkins \u2013 one of the country\u2019s youngest elected mayors. Hawkins, 35, is already a familiar sight on the city\u2019s roadsides because he hitchhiked to work as city councillor \u2013 a practise he would continue despite the offer of a mayoral car. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 15 minutes and you get unfiltered feedback from people who probably aren\u2019t ever going to turn up to a council annual plan process or a bylaw review hearing,\u201d says Hawkins, who travelled to work on Wednesday with a beekeeper. \u201cGetting those perspectives from people about what they think\u2019s going well or not well in the city is great.\u201d A two-term councillor, Hawkins was in 2014 one of only two local representatives in New Zealand aged under 30, and has worked to support other young candidates entering politics. \u201cThere\u2019s a willingness in the wider community, not just among fellow young people, to see those perspectives represented in local decision-making,\u201d he says. \u201cThe climate strike movement has been incredibly helpful in that, with thousands of young people marching in the streets, demanding that we do better and demonstrating leadership.\u201d For the youthful newcomers, raising their profiles and convincing sceptical voters had at times been a challenge. Tamatha Paul, 22, who was elected to the city council in the capital Wellington, says she and 60 volunteers had run her campaign with military precision. Over six months, they had visited each home in her ward multiple times and texted voters with personalised updates on issues they cared about. \u201cWith political parties, often they have access to pre-existing data that will tell them who in the ward already supports them and they\u2019ll just revisit those homes,\u201d says Paul, a former student leader who has worked on prison and marijuana law reform campaigns. \u201cI wanted a mandate and I didn\u2019t just want it to be progressive residents, I wanted every resident I could sway while retaining my own values.\u201d On the campaign trail, Handford, 18, says she was often asked about her life experience and credentials. \u201cMy response was, well, don\u2019t I bring a different perspective? And maybe that perspective is what we need,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at what life experience and credentials have done for us so far, maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider the way we look at governance.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Rise of renewables may see off oil firms decades earlier than they think", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/rise-renewables-oil-firms-decades-earlier-think", "date": "2019-10-14", "transcript": "The world\u2019s rising reliance on fossil fuels may come to an end decades earlier than the most polluting companies predict, offering early signs of hope in the global battle to tackle the climate crisis. The climate green shoots have emerged amid a renewable energy revolution that promises an end to the rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, before the fossil fuels face a terminal decline. The looming fossil fuel peak is expected to emerge decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies, which are betting that demand for polluting energy will rise until the 2040s. But energy experts are adjusting their forecasts as clean energy technologies, including wind and solar power, emerge faster than predicted and at costs that pose a direct threat to coal-fired electricity and combustion-engine vehicles. In the UK, renewable energy projects generated more electricity over the last quarter than fossil fuels for the first time since the country\u2019s first public power plant fired up in 1882. It is a marked change from only 10 years ago, when gas and coal generated more than 70% of the UK\u2019s electricity. The pace of progress has raised hope that the global groundswell of climate protest could spark fresh political will to accelerate the energy transition in time to keep global temperatures from rising to levels that could trigger a climate catastrophe. The UK Labour party has promised a Green Industrial Revolution to create almost 70,000 new jobs while working to create a carbon-neutral economy by 2030. In the US, the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aims to virtually eliminate the US\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade. Within the energy industry, experts believe the rapid rise of renewable energy in recent years may soon seem glacial compared with the changes to come. Michael Liebreich, the founder of the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), says the substitution of old technology with new is always \u201clike waiting for a sneeze\u201d. \u201cThe first 1% takes forever, 1% to 5% is like waiting for a sneeze \u2013 you know it\u2019s inevitable but it takes longer than you think \u2013 then 5% to 50% happens incredibly fast,\u201d he says. The world is about to enter this period of rapid transformation, he says. This change promises to upend the fossil fuel producers that fail to adapt at pace, and bring the rise of carbon emissions to an end. A growing number of energy experts agree. \u201cOver the next decade we\u2019ll see a far quicker than expected rollout of a number of clean energy technologies, which will almost certainly mean global emissions plateau,\u201d Liebreich adds. The rollout is expected whether politicians increase their ambition or not, because the economics of clean energy are now too strong to ignore. Earlier this summer, BNEF reported that not only was renewable energy cheaper than building a new gas or coal plant, but it would soon be cheaper than using existing thermal plants too. This economic tipping point means it would save money to shut existing coal-fired power plants down and build new renewable energy projects from scratch. Abundant clean electricity could help remove the emissions from the world\u2019s transport and heating systems too. By 2030, BNEF expects demand for road fuels to peak, while coal is expected to peak by 2026. DNV GL, a global energy advisory, believes that by the same year oil will no longer be the world\u2019s biggest energy source, and by the end of the 2020s the world\u2019s demand for crude will begin to fall. \u201cIt provides a lot of hope,\u201d says Seb Henbest, the lead author of the BNEF report. \u201cIt provides a counterbalance to the doom and gloom we face, partly because it includes up-to-date data which tells a slightly different story.\u201d It is a cautionary tale for fossil fuel companies that believe the world\u2019s demand for polluting energy will continue to rise until the middle of the century. It is also a new narrative of hope, he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot further on than we were. And yes, we need to go faster. And yes, it\u2019s difficult and complicated. But at the same time we now live in a world where two-thirds of the global population live in a country where wind and solar power is the cheapest form of new electricity capacity. We have the tools to do this,\u201d he says. Chris Stark, the head of the UK\u2019s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, says the precedent set by the renewables industry proves that emerging technologies to capture carbon emissions can follow suit. \u201cEven 10 years ago we were looking at a very different trajectory for global temperatures. We\u2019ve moved on to a trajectory that today looks like 3C of warming [above pre-industrial levels], but prior to this we were on track for more than that; 4C, possibly even higher,\u201d he says. The progress to date is not yet enough to meet global targets set in the Paris climate agreement, but a plateau in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 could play a major role in averting catastrophic global heating above 3C. It also proves that further ambition could bring the world closer to the sub-2C goal. \u201cThis change is a testament to new climate policies, and the work that has been done around the world. We need to do more of that,\u201d he adds. The UK plans to lead the world\u2019s future climate ambitions. Next year, Glasgow will host the UN\u2019s 26th Conference of the Parties climate talks, known as COP26, to set out a roadmap that keeps rising temperatures well within 2C above pre-industrialised levels. Claire Perry MP, the president for COP26, says the climate talks are \u201cwhere the rubber hits the road on the historic Paris agreement\u201d. She adds that \u201cexpectations are rightly high\u201d due to the \u201cmounting public concern over climate change\u201d, but the UK is ready to deliver on those expectations.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "In search of 'smart chewing gum' to help women conceive", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/10/in-search-of-smart-chewing-gum-to-help-women-conceive", "date": "2019-10-10", "transcript": "Conical flasks of green liquid jiggle in rotating trays while women in white lab coats study yellowing yeast samples. One has grown into the shape of a smiley face. On the other side of the laboratory, something important is happening with vials, pipettes and foil-covered bottles containing what looks a lot like urine. The aim is to produce a chewing gum that accurately predicts the female fertility cycle. \u201cWe need to see if the active ingredient survives in chewing gum, then we\u2019ll add flavours,\u201d says one of the researchers, Anett St\u00e8ger. A team of 13 students from the University of Copenhagen is on a mission to create a product to help women improve their chances of getting pregnant. Biotechnology and molecular bioscience students have been working together to create a \u201csmart chewing gum\u201d that will change colour to show where women are in their menstrual cycles. The plan is to replace baker\u2019s yeast with human hormone receptors that can measure the oestrogen, LH and progesterone that are present in saliva when a woman is ovulating. The project, nicknamed \u201cOvulaid\u201d, was started as a Danish entry into iGEM, the world championship in synthetic biology, which starts in Boston at the end of October. The researchers are an international bunch, with scientists from Nepal, India, Germany and Hungary as well as Denmark. Seven are women. \u201cThe competition can get quite intense,\u201d says St\u00e8ger, who is Hungarian. \u201cWe\u2019re working 40 hours a week on this, on top of our normal studies \u2013 so the drop-out rate is usually high. But we\u2019ve only had one person leave. It\u2019s a project we\u2019re all really passionate about.\u201d A fellow team-member, Hitesh Gelli Praveenkumar from India, first came up with the idea of a diagnostic gum when the group began brainstorming in February, before Benedicte Smith-Sivertsen, a Dane, suggested it could help women conceive. \u201cMy sister was going through fertility treatment at the time,\u201d says Smith-Sivertsen, \u201cand I was surprised by how hard it was \u2013 all these huge syringes and peeing on sticks every day. I just thought, why hasn\u2019t anyone made this easier?\u201d Most over the counter ovulation tests currently monitor LH levels, with higher end and more expensive ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen. \u201cBut we thought, what about a chewing gum that could do all of that, as well as measuring progesterone (which helps the uterus prepare for pregnancy) at a fraction of the cost?\u201d says St\u00e8ger. There is clearly some work to be done. A prototype tastes a bit like wax. The researchers are working on a smartphone app to accompany the chewing gum for easy interpretation of the colour results and the gum is biodegradable. \u201cThe plan is that the gum will be very discreet in terms of packaging, available in supermarkets in a variety of flavours, and much, much cheaper than existing ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen that you pee on,\u201d says St\u00e8ger. The hope is that Ovulaid will also have a developing world application. \u201cWe\u2019ve conducted research with gynaecology clinics in rural India, where many hospitals don\u2019t have the resources for regular fertility testing,\u201d says Gelli, \u201cso there\u2019s a real excitement about the gum.\u201d They\u2019ve also looked into the impact it could have on areas such as Africa, where infertility is taboo. However, the market that may prove trickiest is Europe because the gum will contain a genetically-modified biosensor, and GM is tightly controlled in the EU. As part of the project, the team surveyed 1,500 women, 90% of whom said they still would like to use the product despite the fact that it contains GM elements. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had hundreds of women getting in touch telling us they love the idea,\u201d adds St\u00e8ger. Dr Shabana Bora, a fertility specialist at the Lister Fertility Clinic in London not involved in the project, expressed cautious optimism about the work, saying \u201csince many existing ovulation tests create a lot of plastic waste, a biodegradable gum could help be a more eco-friendly, cost-effective alternative.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

It\u2019s a public holiday in Bangladesh, the one time of year the 25-year-old can leave the mayhem of the city behind and see her family: her mother, her aunt. And her daughter. \u201cThere she is!\u201d Her little girl is standing in front of the two-bedroom tin hut in a remote village 200km (125 miles) north of Chittagong, south-east Bangladesh. Mother and daughter embrace. If she could, the young seamstress would still live here. The air is fresher, there is more space, and some of her friends still live in the village. There\u2019s just one problem: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any work.\u201d Agriculture has ceased to be a feasible source of income. Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees \u2013 it is spun in the textile looms of the city. And so this family copes as best it can, the older women raising the child while Tasnia works six-day weeks, sewing T-shirts and jeans for global consumers, for about 8,400 taka (\u00a380) a month. These three generations are a neat microcosm of an entire nation. The older women, who grew up in the years after independence in 1971, worked in unpaid labour, trying to survive in the grinding poverty for which the country became renowned in the 1970s. The young girl, a 21st-century child, schooled and spirited, will in all probability enjoy better prospects. And in the middle, Tasnia Akter, from the \u201cfactory generation\u201d, one of approximately 4.5 million textile workers who have transformed the fortunes and reputation of Bangladesh. The crucial question is this: is Akter a glorious paragon of the \u201crise and rise\u201d of Bangladesh, with its 50-year journey to becoming a middle-income nation powered by hard-working women? Or is she a sickening example of an exploited labourer who ruins her health for companies making high margins and consumers who buy cheap jeans? The answer: perhaps a bit of both. \u201cSure, Tasnia suffers a lot, she has to support her family \u2013 but I had to suffer much more,\u201d says her aunt, Honufa Begum. After her husband died, Begum worked as a maid in Chittagong. \u201cJust provide food and lodging for me and my daughter,\u201d she recalls asking the family. They did. But they did not pay her. Begum did not complain. \u201cI am uneducated,\u201d Akter explains, sitting on a bed in her aunt\u2019s house under a fan. \u201cIn the city I could work as a maid. But I don\u2019t want to be a slave. I don\u2019t want to always be on my toes, waiting for orders. At least when I come home in the evening from the factory, I am done for the day.\u201d Changed fortunes When the history is written of how much of humanity was lifted out of poverty in the decades after 1980, Bangladesh will provide one of the biggest chapters. GDP has soared vertiginously since 1980. The number of people living below the poverty line has fallen from more than 44% in 1991 to less than 13%. Numbers for neonatal and maternal mortality have dwindled. Family sizes have fallen. People now live on average one-third longer than they used to 40 years ago \u2013 a gain in longevity that is practically without rival anywhere in the world. But it has not come without tragedy, toil and exploitation. Six years ago, the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Dhaka, killing more than 1,100 people, injuring more than 2,300. Rana Plaza became synonymous with textile workers\u2019 atrocious working conditions; for the blood, sweat and sacrifice so easily overlooked by western consumers hunting bargain T-shirts on the high street. Bangladeshi workers are still among the lowest-paid in the world. Over the years, however, activists, workers and researchers have fought for at least some change in the garment industry. The minimum wage has doubled. Safety improvements have been made. Many workers are able to put a little aside to ensure that their children get a proper education. And for Akter and the millions of other women who make up around 80% of the textile workforce, the industry represents a possibility to earn money. They can attain at least some economic freedom in a society where women typically are housewives; where the only option in the countryside is to marry. The vast industry generates myriad sub-industries too. The market along the dusty main road in Chittagong is usually bustling with people. Opposite the Clifton garments factory, Jallal Uddin, 38, is selling cake, bananas and tea to the workers on their way home. The father of two has had his stall for eight years now. He is proud of not having accumulated any debt. His formula is simple: the more garment workers there are, the more business for him. Tasnia Akter has been working for her factory for the past four years. The small premises is owned by one of the country\u2019s big manufacturers: there are more than 30,000 employees, with brand customers such as WalMart and H&amp;M. For Akter, working in the factory means progress: it is a means of paying the debts of her family, to support her seven-year-old daughter, and to earn a living after her husband left her \u2013 a fate that many garment workers share. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d she says. She sends around 2,000 taka home every month, as well as the occasional windfall: a rice cooker is stored in her parents\u2019 cupboard; the company awarded it to her for not missing any days and for working quickly. But if she can\u2019t save anything for herself, is she really getting on? Is progressing from slave-like working conditions to meagre salaries really enough? Or is the country\u2019s sweatshop image still accurate today? Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a thinktank in Dhaka, shakes his head. \u201cNot at all.\u201d The economist believes that \u2013 at least in a broader sense \u2013 the textile industry has lifted millions out of poverty. In the 1980s, workers lived in shacks and toiled in factories with no toilets or safe drinking water. Now even a cursory look at their lunch boxes will show they are eating better than in the past, he says. But he adds that many workers are malnourished and some still sleep on the floor. \u201cMost workers can\u2019t save anything for their post-work years.\u201d Nevertheless, there are small indications that the quality of life is improving. \u201cWorkers like to spend the last penny for the betterment of the family: some send their children to private kindergarten, or to private tutors.\u201d It was the Rana Plaza disaster that arguably triggered the biggest safety improvements. Following a broad deal between unions and more than 200 garment companies such as Primark and H&amp;M, more than 1,600 factories were inspected and hazards identified and dealt with. Factory owners invested in fire doors, sprinkler systems and electrical upgrades. Some tore down factories and built them anew to keep their business going. A general manager of the company where Tasnia Akter works says the new rules of business are simple: \u201cNo compliance, no contracts.\u201d \u201cIf you compare pre-Rana Plaza and post-Rana Plaza, the one thing that really has changed is safety,\u201d says Kalpona Akter (no relation to Tasnia), a labour activist and executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity (BCWS). Between 2005 and 2012, more than 500 workers died in textile factories. After 2014, the annual number of fatalities has remained \u201cwell under 30\u201d, according to the Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights at New York University . \u201cWorkers are now more aware of their rights,\u201d says Kalpona Akter. When she founded BCWS in 2000, few workers knew they had any rights at all. \u201cNow workers perhaps won\u2019t die in the factory \u2013 but they will nevertheless slowly die of malnourishment,\u201d Hasan Maruf Rumi says. The activist and politician explains how it is impossible to feed a family on the new minimum wage of 8,000 taka. While the minimum wage has indeed been doubled, it is still only half of what the unions had suggested \u2013 and far from a living wage. A study by CPD found that the overall cost of living for garment workers had increased by 86% between 2013 and 2018, with food costs up 57%. Last December the influential manufacturers\u2019 association BGMEA made it clear that owners would close factories if the minimum wage increased further. It called on brands to increase their prices as a result. Nothing happened. When asked how much she thinks she deserves, Tasnia Akter says: 10,000 taka, around \u00a396. In Chittagong, many workers live near the factories. The streets, turned muddy by the rain, are lined with corner shops, barbers and vegetable sellers. Nadira Begum, a 26-year-old sewing operator, shares a room with her three-year-old daughter in a compound with other families. Her husband shows up from time to time; he has another wife as well. \u201cAs soon as there is a raise, everything gets more expensive,\u201d she says. She already pays around 3,000 taka per month for the room. While Begum earns about nine times as much as her mother, she is unsure whether her purchasing power has gone up much. She does have amenities such as a fan and a fridge. She joined the union after it helped her when she was about to be fired for being pregnant, she says. Now she has lost her job. Begum believes it is primarily because she is a union member. But she doesn\u2019t seem too fazed. One thing that has changed is her self-assurance, the pride in her abilities: \u201cI am not worried. I am a skilled worker; I will just go and get another job.\u201d \u2022 Tasnia Akter\u2019s name has been changed This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

When the militants cut the cables in July 2016, he was ready. \u201cReading gives me the feeling that I\u2019m still a human being, especially when living under Isis, because knowledge has no limits,\u201d he said. \u201cEven under the airstrikes, I used to put my earphones on, listen to music and read.\u201d Jaleeli downloaded files in English because Arabic is severely underrepresented on the internet. Now that the city has been liberated from Isis, he and a team of student translators at the University of Mosul are setting about redressing that imbalance. Together, they are making Wikipedia pages, academic articles and seminal works covering science, literature and philosophy available to Arabic speakers in attempt to confront lies with logic and pit critical thinking against propaganda and fake news. Just 0.6% of internet content is available in Arabic, despite it being the fourth most common language among internet users. Ideas Beyond Borders (IBB), the organisation behind the House of Wisdom 2.0 translation project, plans to narrow this chasm and democratise access to knowledge for the Arab world. The organisation\u2019s founder, Faisal Saeed Al Mutar, grew up under the regime of Saddam Hussein. \u201cIt was kind of the motherlode of misinformation,\u201d the 28-year-old recalls. Now he wants to arm Iraqi and Arab young people against the authoritarian regimes and extremist groups that silence diverse narratives and allow violence to thrive. So far the organisation has added more than 2.1 million words to Arabic Wikipedia, including entries on female scientists, civil rights, religious diversity, evolution and conspiracy theories. The response has been remarkable. Since launching in 2017, IBB has attracted more than 1 million followers to its Facebook page, and draws more than 40,000 views across its online channels a day. It has also translated books, including Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker and Waking Up by Sam Harris. Requests are flooding in and IBB is doubling the team of 60 translators to work with six more universities across Iraq as well as branching into Kurdish and Farsi. Every week, the team posts about a different female scientist on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to raise the understanding of people here that women can do anything,\u201d said Shahd Shahin, 25, who recently graduated after suspending her studies for several years when Isis shut down schools and universities in Mosul. At the time, Shahin was too terrified to leave the house, so she stayed inside, reading works about science and space downloaded on her phone. \u201cI had my books. When I read I used to go to another world.\u201d Momen Mohamad, a third-year student, spends two hours a day translating articles for the project. He will be paid a small stipend but money is not what motivates him. \u201cI want to do something good as a person from Mosul and show the world that we can achieve things,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing through a really tough time helped us understand the world better and look to improve our knowledge.\u201d IBB makes material available via PDFs, which can be downloaded for free. But on the street readers are finding their own ways to spread the word. \u201cPeople have started unofficially printing our books or distributing them via Telegram and other platforms to avoid censorship,\u201d Mutar said. What started as a translation project is rapidly becoming a youth movement, he added. \u201cThese are people who have every reason to feel hopeless \u2013 all they have known is war and destruction \u2013 yet they wake up every morning and translate stories about culture and diversity because they want to be part of a solution that makes their country a better place.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Can\u2019t remember? There may be a reason for that. These are such serious times that it\u2019s getting harder to find the humour. Once upon a time, newspapers crackled with jokes, mixing up the serious stuff with light-hearted whimsy, satire and irreverence. These days, not so much. Aside from occasional oddities and political sketches, our news media seems less attuned than ever to the the bizarre, the comedic, the absurdities of modern life. Things are so serious that comedians are becoming politicians. Why? Have we lost our funny bone? When did everyone start taking themselves so seriously? Saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the first episode of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. In honour, the Upside has been trawling around, looking for the new Ernest Scribblers of this very earnest age. You can read our suggestions in What we liked, below. But first, a quick round-up of top Upside offerings of the week: 1. The women taking the plastic out of periods. Two-minute read. 2. Why Finland\u2019s schools are so great. Three-minute read. 3. How the participatory budget in Paris works. Three-minute read. 4. Hitching to work: could it catch on? One-hour commute. What we liked My colleague Marina Hyde is always funny \u2013 though be warned: she is fabulously rude too. A jolly Sydney Morning Herald piece ripped into a new TV hit. There was plenty of value to be had in a British prime minister mentioning \u201ckangaroo\u2019s testicles\u201d in a speech. A pub had a party at which everyone was called Nigel. The Economist had fun examining the far-fetched prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s border moat. One-minute read (paywall). The New Yorker still maintains a daily commitment to satire. A protest stunt backfired \u2013 literally (video). Lucky numbers Long one of the most alcoholic nations in the world, Russia has become more abstemious over the past decade and a half, with booze consumption falling by almost half. Longevity has increased by 10% over the period from 65 to about 71. In the UK meanwhile, deaths from breast cancer have almost halved over the past 30 years. What we heard Mich\u00e8le Sanniti inquired via email: I would love to read an article on what can be done about the huge amount of plastic that we generate everyday by using milk and orange juice cartons. Alternatives, campaigns, are the supermarkets working on this? Well, of course we have written various pieces on this, for example here, here and here. Still on the theme of all that unnecessary plastic: Thanks for a great article about environmentally sound menstruation products. I have been using the same 6 pads since 2002 or thereabouts. They are in cotton, and I just wash them in the washing machine and then use them again. They have little buttons on their wings to keep them tethered during use. Probably not great for the manufacturer, but multi-use pads is probably by far the most environmentally friendly menstrual protection. Name supplied Where was the Upside?

People send them in from all over the world \u2013 plastic applicators polluting the environment, blue, orange, green, purple and yellow. \u201cThat\u2019s a rainbow of plastic pollution,\u201d says Daish, 27, a campaigner seeking to persuade companies and governments to remove plastics from women\u2019s sanitary products. \u201cThis is a global issue, but period products aren\u2019t talked about much; they need to be stopped at source.\u201d Sanitary products are the fifth most common item found on Europe\u2019s beaches, more widespread than single-use coffee cups, cutlery or straws. Some 200,000 tonnes of material is believed to end up in UK landfill every year. The water engineer Hazem Gouda has estimated that 700,000 panty liners, 2.5m tampons and 1.4m sanitary towels are flushed down the toilet every day in the UK. Daish is neither the first nor the only woman taking a stand against this. But, finally, there are signs that the government and the retail industry are taking the problem seriously. Last month, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first company to stop producing plastic applicators for its own-brand tampons, removing 2.7 tonnes of plastic annually. \u201cThis move shows that people power has a huge impact. It speaks volumes,\u201d says Daish, who is putting pressure on other big names, including Procter &amp; Gamble and Boots. \u201cPlastic tampon applicators are used for seconds, yet take centuries to break down, and they have avoidable impacts on the environment.\u201d The Scottish government has also taken a stand, with a \u00a3175,200 campaign in partnership with Zero Waste Scotland to encourage women to try free samples of period pants, menstrual cups and reusable sanitary pads. In Wales, Caerphilly council has taken the decision to devote all of its period poverty funding to eco-friendly products \u2013 a UK first. Alternatives are starting to catch on: there are products with cardboard applicators, as well as reusable versions and non-applicator tampons. Another option is the silicone menstrual cup that is inserted into the vagina to collect blood flow. Menstrual cups can be used for 10 years and cost about \u00a320 \u2013 that equates to 16p for each menstrual cycle. But there is still a lack of information comparing sanitary products. \u201cDespite the fact that 1.9 billion women globally are of menstruating age, spending on average 65 days a year dealing with menstrual blood flow, few good-quality studies exist that compare sanitary products,\u201d says Prof Penelope Phillips-Howard from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and the lead author of research on the subject, published in the Lancet Public Health. Over 10 years, a menstrual cup is estimated to create 0.4% of the plastic waste generated by single-use pads and 6% of that produced by using tampons. \u201cMenstrual cups will contribute to decreasing pollution of plastic waste from monthly use of disposable sanitary products,\u201d adds Phillips-Howard who found that awareness about cups was extremely low, even though 199 brands are available in 99 countries. The Women\u2019s Environment Network (WEN), which coined the term \u201cenvironmenstrual\u201d in 2004, is noticing real momentum for change in the UK. \u201cAfter Blue Planet II, people realised the sheer scale of plastic pollution in our seas, our soil and our own bodies. Women seem happier to talk about periods \u2026 they had previously been seen as taboo,\u201d says Kate Metcalf, WEN\u2019s co-director. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go, but it\u2019s becoming more mainstream and the Women\u2019s Institute just joined our coalition, so our reach is spreading.\u201d According to Metcalf, period education is \u201cpatchy and outdated\u201d. WEN is collaborating with the UK-based nonprofit group City to Sea, which campaigns to prevent plastic pollution at source, to create a schools programme called Rethink Periods. It is training 600 teachers across England to get the message across to adolescents. Crucially, says the campaign\u2019s national coordinator Clare Marshall, lessons are accompanied by a free box of period pants, menstrual cups, organic cotton disposables and reusable pads, so that pupils can see and feel the products. \u201cGirls and boys are often shocked to find out that certain products contain plastic,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cThey are keen to find out what they can do, so we highlight how Ella Daish is successfully taking on the big guns; hopefully teenagers will listen up.\u201d Alec Mills, the co-founder of Dame, a company that produces the world\u2019s first reusable tampon applicator, says the onus is on government to provide sustainable menstrual products in schools. \u201cThere\u2019s a perfect storm of cultural change \u2013 people are more prepared to talk about their periods, plus there\u2019s this enormous plastic-free environmental drive,\u201d he says. \u201cFinally, women are questioning the products they are using \u2013 now is the time to create positive changes and let the concrete set on a young generation making new habits.\u201d But there is concern about the Westminster government\u2019s new Period Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Procter &amp; Gamble which already supplies free Always pads and Tampax tampons to school pupils. \u201cOur calculations show that it would be cheaper in the long term for government to promote reusables and plastic-free alternatives,\u201d says Ruby Raut, the founder of Wuka period pants, which can be worn for up to eight hours and then washed. \u201cThis is simply not in line with the government\u2019s call for all schools to become plastic-free by 2022.\u201d Raut, Mills and Daish joined others to sign an open letter demanding that the Department for Education offers free sustainable alternatives to girls in English secondary education. The winner of the tender to provide free sanitary products in schools is due to be announced imminently, and campaigners want to see a substantial commitment to plastic-free products. The concept of plastic-free periods is nothing new. Susie Hewson founded Natracare in 1989, producing plastic-free, organic cotton tampons and pads that are home-compostable. \u201cWe won\u2019t compromise on the materials we use or how they are sourced, but for big brands developing new markets, in India, for example, plastic is cheap to produce and light to distribute,\u201d she says. Hewson adds: \u201cThe damage from our throwaway culture and unfettered growth is accumulating somewhere \u2013 there are consequences for everything we do.\u201d She is calling for full disclosure of ingredients on product packaging to be a legal requirement. \u201cLegislation is the biggest innovator \u2013 there\u2019s a pressing need to reduce how much plastic we stick down the toilet.\u201d Daish agrees: \u201cWe should know exactly what is in the products we put in and around such an intimate area of our bodies for extended periods of time; I wouldn\u2019t put a plastic bag down there, I\u2019m sure a lot of people wouldn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a human rights issue.\u201d Her goal is for all period products to become plastic-free: \u201cWe can all make a difference and change our habits \u2013 I just want to keep pushing for change.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The younger children are having a snack before starting their after-school activities. Upstairs a group of 12-year-olds are in a craft class, cutting patterns and making clothes on sewing machines. Outside, children play in an enormous outdoor space, equipped with a climbing frames, football pitches and basketball courts. \u201cHey, Petteri,\u201d one boy yells casually at the principal, Petteri Kuusim\u00e4ki. \u201cNext year can we start school a bit later, at 10am?\u201d Kuusim\u00e4ki jokes with them. It\u2019s all first names here. The Finnish education system is the envy of the world. Along with Tove Jansson\u2019s Moomins, Nokia phones and Iittala glassware, it has become one of the country\u2019s most celebrated exports \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why. Its students consistently score well at the top end of the Pisa international league tables, and as Kuusim\u00e4ki walks me round his school he describes a kind of education utopia \u2013 a place where teachers are highly trained, revered and trusted, and children\u2019s wellbeing is paramount. There are no Ofsted-style inspections, no streaming by ability, no national exams until 18, no school uniforms, no school league tables and no fee-paying private schools. At its party conference this week, Labour committed to follow Finland\u2019s lead and not only scrap Ofsted but abolish private schools by forcing their integration with the state sector. Explaining the policy, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4: \u201cIn some countries, it is not allowed to charge for education in any form \u2026 in Finland, for example.\u201d The British Labour party is far from alone in its enthusiasm for the Finnish education system. Every year hundreds of delegations of teachers and policymakers from all over the world pour into Helsinki to see this nirvana for themselves. So popular has it become that international visits are strictly regulated and have to be paid for \u2013 a presentation costs \u20ac682 (\u00a3607) per hour and a school visit \u20ac1,240. In the past two months there have been groups from Israel, Brazil, China and Korea. In the coming weeks there will be visits from New Zealand and Lithuania. Meanwhile, Finland\u2019s influence is spreading far and wide. Last month a school opened in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam based on the Finnish curriculum and pedagogical approach, with Finnish staff on the teaching team. Kuusim\u00e4ki tells me Finland\u2019s schools are well-funded and built around the principle of equality of opportunity for all pupils. He is baffled when I try to explain that some state schools in England are so strapped for cash that they are asking parents for donations. \u201cAs you may know, everything is free in Finland,\u201d he says, university included. There is just one fee-paying school in the country, the International School of Helsinki, which has mainly catered for international employees of Nokia and other industries. Otherwise, charging fees is illegal and parents are happy by and large to send their children to their local school. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have bad schools,\u201d Kuusim\u00e4ki says. In class children are listened to and respected, school lunches are free, detentions are rare and exclusions pretty much unheard of. Kuusim\u00e4ki gave his last detention 15 years ago, and is visibly horrified at the idea of excluding a child from school. \u201cAs a principal, you can\u2019t think like that. We are responsible for these children and their lives. We can\u2019t give up.\u201d But things are changing slowly. Schools are becoming more diverse \u2013 20% of pupils at Lintulaakson school are from immigrant backgrounds, elsewhere it is 75%. The curriculum has been revised and Kuusim\u00e4ki says more has had to be done to stretch gifted children. A compulsory pre-school year for six-year-olds has been introduced to help with school-readiness, and there is talk of starting even earlier, while the minimum school leaving age has recently been raised to 18. Meanwhile, parents \u201cshopping for schools\u201d is on the increase. Finnish education experts would be the first to admit they do not have all the answers and methods in one country do not always translate to another. John Jerrim, professor of education and social statistics at the University College London Institute of Education, does not believe England should be looking to Finland. \u201cIts Pisa scores have actually been in decline. And there is no reason to believe their high scores on international tests are due to their schools. So there is no reason to try to copy Finland.\u201d Not even on outlawing school fees? \u201cThe resource will just be shifted elsewhere,\u201d Jerrim says. \u201cThere are lots of potential unintended consequences, for example, pushing up house prices near good schools.\u201d In 2013 the celebrated Finnish educator Pasi Sahlberg paid a visit to Eton College, the most famous of the UK\u2019s ancient, elite boarding schools. Once a maths and science teacher in Helsinki, Sahlberg now tours the world spreading the word about the wonders of Finnish education and advising on education reform. \u201cIt was like going 200 years backwards in time,\u201d Sahlberg recalls of his visit. \u201cI remember thinking while walking the corridors of Eton and watching students there that even if I had a chance to enrol my own kids to that school I would probably say \u2018no, thank you\u2019.\u201d With its illustrious history, bizarre uniforms and \u00a340,000 a year fees, Eton \u2013 which educated the current British prime minister and many before him \u2013 is a million miles from the modern egalitarianism of Finland\u2019s schools. \u201cI am often asked by people what is the most important thing I learned in school,\u201d Sahlberg says. \u201cI say that to learn to understand that there are different kinds of people in this world and that regardless where we come from we can be in same school and learn in same classroom. Eton boys won\u2019t learn that in their school.\u201d Like Jerrim, Sahlberg is sceptical about other countries trying to simply copy the Finland model. \u201cThere are so many myths about what the Finnish system is and is not. This idea of copying has done a lot of damage.\u201d Finland\u2019s schools are rooted in the country\u2019s distinctive history and culture; the population is small (5.5 million), and taxes are high. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to Finland and cherry-pick the things that seem to be interesting and say, \u2018We want to do like Finland is doing\u2019. It\u2019s much more complicated than that.\u201d He also thinks it\u2019s unrealistic for Labour to promise to abolish private schools. \u201cIt\u2019s come too far this whole private education thinking. It\u2019s very hard to remove it altogether.\u201d It would be better, he says, for Labour to focus on strengthening the existing state sector in England, which has become fragmented through academisation and free schools. \u201cJust abolishing something, saying private schools should be made illegal, it\u2019s not going happen.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "When all else fails, there is always art", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/upside-when-all-else-fails-there-is-always-art", "date": "2019-09-27", "transcript": "Wherever you travel as a journalist, however dicey the destination, there is usually an Upside tale to be found in art. I have a few personal favourites: Bosnian war art, the humour of the Mitki in the late Soviet period, the only artist in the Falkland Islands \u2026 This week, our Africa correspondent, Jason Burke, discovered that even in a country as demoralised as Zimbabwe, contemporary art thrives. His article prompted responses from readers pointing out that this is not limited to the capital, Harare. Pip Curling wrote in: I worked at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe and was on the board of trustees there too. I personally collected a body of work that told the story of the country from the late 1980s to probably 2007 when hyperinflation hit. My collection is sometimes the work of rural, self-taught and unsung artists which have never been seen because of the political situation. Misheck Gudo came as a young man from a small village in the eastern districts of Zimbabwe to try his luck in Harare. Often the self-taught artists tell a narrative more than they might attempt to expose an emotion or a feeling. The works are usually self-explanatory and require no verbal input from the artist. Myth, legend and proverb sometimes play their part. Misheck made this painting after the heavily contested general election in Zimbabwe in 2005. Art gives us that chance to stand back, take stock, see the context, the wider picture \u2013 a vital safety valve in societies that are seething with antagonism and dispute. In another furious week in the UK, the Turner prize comes as welcome relief. In Latvia, they\u2019re trying to use culture as a unifying force.

Nearly a hundred people enjoyed a 20-minute show of upcycled secondhand clothes and eco-fashion on Saturday 14 September, in the setting of the upstairs floor of Chippenham Library.

The Countdown Global Mental Health 2030 project is aimed at improving the sketchy data for illnesses like depression and anxiety, and establishing proper metrics so that countries can be compared with one another. A scorecard will be produced every two years, so that the best performing countries can be held up as examples to the rest. The broad aim is to pinpoint successes and failures in treatment and encourage states \u2013 and donors \u2013 to invest in what works best to deal with illnesses that afflict hundreds of millions of people. \u201cWhen it comes to mental health, all countries are developing countries,\u201d said Shekhar Saxena, a Harvard professor who is leading the project in conjunction with the World Health Organization, the Lancet and other civil society NGOs. \u201cThere will be comparisons across countries and across time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to measure how much progress we have made, and establish how we allocate resources.\u201d The problem is that information on the mental health of nations is patchy, unreliable and hard to compare from one country to the next, making it difficult to set targets. There are no blood tests or X-rays that identify these types of illnesses, and much of the data rests on self-reporting or extrapolation of surveys. A tracker measuring the deleterious effect of disease on society \u2013 the global burden of disease \u2013 has operated since 1990, but its mental health component is shot through with uncertainty. Some countries have relatively robust assessment approaches, including doctor surveys and cohort studies. But many poorer countries do not. Additionally, the WHO collects information on services available in each country \u2013 the Mental Health Atlas \u2013 but here there are also big gaps. D\u00e9vora Kestel, the WHO director of mental health and substance abuse, says the aim is a \u201cmore real mapping of the situation\u201d. \u201cI am convinced that many countries are not even aware of the mental health burden in their population. So we need a stronger argument. If they do things that are doable in terms of funding they will be able to improve the mental health of the population \u2013 and also the economy of the country.\u201d The countdown metric is being unveiled at the \u201cGoalkeepers\u201d summit on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. Kestel said that if mental health needs were more accurately pinpointed it would help donors make more judicious investments to improve global mental health outcomes. Victor Ugo, a Nigerian who set up a mental health self-help group in Nigeria because of the lack of services and treatments, said a clearer picture of the prevalence of illness \u2013 and the shortcomings of treatment \u2013 could spur the authorities into better responses. \u201cThis will mean that we can see where we are \u2013 with data, policies and programmes and funding within the African states. That will help us demand better accountability and better systems.\u201d This article is part of a six-month global series on mental health.

Dr Ayo Ajeigbe received the patient at his private practice in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital, in his customary welcoming manner. But there was, it turned out, nothing wrong with the man. And when Ajeigbe asked why he was there, he simply replied: \u201cI just wanted to see what a psychologist looked like.\u201d Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Mental health professionals are rare in Nigeria, as they are in many other developing nations. In Africa\u2019s most populous nation \u2013 a country of more than 200 million people \u2013 there are an estimated 150 practising psychologists. If mental health treatments are patchy, inadequate and underfunded in most western nations, they are practically nonexistent in the majority of lower- and middle-income countries \u2013 more than 100 countries worldwide. Here mental health provisions are the poorly resourced afterthought of health budgets that are in any case likely to be meagre. So what is to be done? Ajeigbe decided that a partial answer lay in the voluntary sector. A year ago, he agreed to head up the Abuja section of Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (Mani), a burgeoning user-led organisation fast emerging as a multi-pronged solution to Nigeria\u2019s mental health crisis. Mani was launched in 2016 by Victor Ugo, a then medical student from Lagos who had suffered from depression, as a response to the lack of mental health support in Nigeria, where an estimated 7 million people have the same condition. Ugo\u2019s vision was to drive change by raising awareness and dispelling stigmas that exist around mental health issues in Nigeria. And on Wednesday, he will appear at the annual Goalkeepers event on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, to make the case for more funding and fairer treatment for mental health. \u201cIf you have depression,\u201d says Latifah Yusuf Ojomo, the deputy head of Mani\u2019s Lagos team, \u201cpeople can cast you as mad, which means that the majority of people who have mental health issues in Nigeria do not understand, or want to accept what they are feeling.\u201d From the outset, Ugo decided that if Mani was to have any significant impact it would need to focus attention on the country\u2019s most populous demographic. \u201cYoung people [in Nigeria] are much more open to learning new things,\u201d explains Ugo, \u201cthey are much more focused on ways to change.\u201d Mani needed a \u201ccool factor\u201d, something Ugo says was sorely lacking in the mental health sector: \u201cSymposiums, that was all that was happening with mental health in Nigeria, just more and more symposiums, people would give a lecture saying we need to increase awareness, but nothing was happening.\u201d Ugo and a small band of medical students took to social media, sharing stories and launching online campaigns. Then in October 2017 they hosted their first event, not a symposium as Ugo is keen to point out, but a food fair: \u201cWe just said come and you can taste different delicacies, play games and talk about mental health in a cool way.\u201d The event was a huge success, and evolved into a series of monthly workshops focused on topics such as depression and anxiety. As Mani continued to grow in numbers, these meet-ups became known as \u201cconversation cafes\u201d, held in restaurants, parks and cafes, and eventually spreading to cities all over Nigeria, including Abuja and Ibadan. Each month, a different topic is selected \u2013 childhood trauma, the benefits of mindfulness, relationship strains, the reactionary attitudes of the \u201cvillage\u201d \u2013 a case study is presented and discussion groups form. Two years later, Mani is now a leading voice on mental health issues in the country, with more than 1,500 volunteers and active in 13 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states. Ugo is still taken aback by what the project has achieved. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were going to end up here; in fact, I feel like we have been a hundred times more successful than we expected at the start.\u201d Despite the initial success, Ugo knew that still more needed to be done. \u201cWe thought if we don\u2019t balance this with some kind of help, we will cause more harm than good.\u201d So, in 2017, Mani launched a 24-hour mental health support service to run alongside its awareness campaigns. The service allowed people to reach out over WhatsApp or Twitter for emergency help in the form of advice, counselling and supportive listening. An emergency response team was also created via a network of volunteer counsellors. Mani also launched a confidential 24-hour suicide hotline. Attempted suicide is a criminal offence in Nigeria, punishable by up to one year in prison. Currently, only 3.3% of Nigeria\u2019s total health budget goes towards mental health, which leaves the public system chronically understaffed. It also leaves Mani with a limited pool of professionals to recruit. As a solution to this, Mani launched a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d system in which mental health professionals educate volunteers in subjects such as active assistance and safe talk (a programme that teaches participants to recognise and engage individuals who may be a suicide risk). Ajeigbe explains: \u201cWhat we do is train people in fundamental mental health skills, so if I train 10 people, they can in turn reach 100 people.\u201d Mani\u2019s volunteers come from a diverse range of backgrounds. Alle Ayodele, the head of the organisation\u2019s Oyo state chapter, was studying microbiology when he decided to volunteer for Mani after coming across its support team on Twitter. He had been impressed by its speed and professionalism in responding to a series of suicide notes that were trending: \u201cMani took them really seriously, as soon as someone posted a note they stepped in.\u201d Ekene Okeke, from Lagos, has a background in sociology and criminology. After suffering from depression and connecting with Mani on Twitter, she decided to volunteer for it. Okeke was recently called out on an emergency where a woman had high levels of anxiety and had been alone for several days. \u201cI dropped what I was doing, and spent hours talking with her, I even went and bought her ice-cream.\u201d It\u2019s moments like this, Okeke says, that make volunteering so rewarding: \u201cIn the end, the woman was able to calm down and has since reached out for help.\u201d Informal mental health support networks like this are becoming more prevalent around the world, as people realise that health systems cannot cope with mental illness, and that society will have to come up with other strategies. Examples include park bench psychotherapy in Zimbabwe, a peer-support initiative in Kenya, community-based self-help in Pakistan and the Phola organisation in South Africa. In Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city, Mani has launched a training programme for schools. The programme will include a series of \u201cmental health clubs\u201d where students are taught about coping mechanisms, the effects of bullying and consent workshops. Mani also trains teachers and parents on children\u2019s mental health, the latter a group that Ugo identifies as especially crucial. \u201cCulturally, young people are not allowed to speak up,\u201d explains Ugo, \u201cyou have to listen; respect is really crucial. If I need help, I ask my parents and they decide if I need help.\u201d When Mani\u2019s WhatsApp service began in 2017 it immediately identified an issue. \u201cMany more females seek help than men,\u201d Ajeigbe explains, \u201cthis is because according to societal norms men are supposed to be emotionally strong.\u201d About 85% of the initial calls were from women, so Ugo and his team researched how their service could appeal more to men. \u201cWe read that men are much better at using test-based services,\u201d says Ugo, who immediately incorporated a test into the programme. This resulted in a 40% increase in men reaching out. Recruitment of volunteers is one area where Mani does not need to worry \u2013 it currently has 500 applications waiting to be processed. \u201cThe good thing is that many people who talk to us end up volunteering for us,\u201d says Ugo. More than 10,000 people have now spoken with Mani using its WhatsApp service. The success of Mani may have exceeded Ugo\u2019s initial expectations, but he is not one for complacency. He has now set his sights on persuading the government to change the national policy on mental health. He is also seeking a broader funding base, as 90% of the costs of the organisation are borne by the founders. \u201cAt the moment we are still very much self-funded, Ugo says. \u201cThis is a big challenge, considering how much more impact we believe we can make, and the speed with which we are growing our network across Nigeria.\u201d \u2022 Mani can be contacted at contact@mentallyaware.org and on +234 805 1493163 \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

And soon that noblest of human qualities will be available in emoji form, following a global effort to find the most appropriate icon. A coalition of charitable and peace-building organisations in Finland are leading the quest to crowdsource an emoji to be added to the thousands available to smartphone users. Ideas for the emoji mooted on the campaign\u2019s Instagram include a vine of leaves cast across a love heart, two people from different ethnicities clasping hands in front of a heart, and a love heart with a plaster placed upon it. \u201cIn our modern digital communication culture, emojis are an essential way of expressing human feelings beyond words,\u201d says Tuomo Pesonen, from the Evangelical Lutheran church of Finland, which came up with the idea and is one of the founding organisations of the #forgivemoji campaign. \u201cWe were surprised to realise that the official emoji selection has dozens of different cats and even two designs of zombies, but there isn\u2019t an emoji for forgiveness.\u201d He explained how the campaign will strive to promote a message of peace and mutual understanding across the world and that it was hoped a future emoji would help encourage people to carry forgiveness into their every day communications. Campaigners will urge managers of the emoji list at the Unicode Consortium to add the winning idea to the collection, which is used by millions of smart phone users across the world. There are thousands of emojis, from yawning faces, to falafels, mischievous sloths and prosthetic limbs, and of course the ubiquitous smiling turd. A new \u201cdrop of blood\u201d icon was also introduced this year following a campaign by Plan International UK, a girls\u2019 rights charity to introduce a period-themed emoji. But of all the weird, wonderful and miscellaneous icons, none appear to equate to saying sorry. Antti Pentik\u00e4inen from the Deaconess Foundation, a non-profit organisation helping disadvantaged people, said reconciliation was key to sustaining peace. \u201cWithout it, conflicts continue in cycles and get worse,\u201d she said. \u201cWe urgently need to learn better how to reconcile. These skills are needed everywhere. Different ways to encourage apologising and forgiveness are an essential part of it, and this includes the social media environment.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Half-finished canvases lean against walls. The bustle and noise of the city is far away. Gresham Tapiwa Nyaude and Helen Teede are among a new wave of young artists in Zimbabwe who are attracting attention from collectors and curators worldwide. Both now work in a converted house surrounded by forest, a 40-minute drive from the capital, Harare. Almost two years after Robert Mugabe, who died this month, was ousted in a military takeover, Zimbabwe is enjoying an unlikely boom in contemporary art, despite an economic crisis and unstable, sometimes violent, politics. The success is linked to its problems, the artists say. \u201cWe want to talk about the time we are living in [in our paintings] \u2026 It comes out abstract and indirect but we have a collective responsibility to address what we know, what we see \u2026 There is source material in every day,\u201d Teede, 31, told the Guardian. Valerie Kabov, who runs the First Floor Gallery in the centre of Harare and represents many emerging artists, said the post-Mugabe boom had been \u201cunequivocal\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of international collectors coming and there is interest growing all the time \u2026 For a very small population of artists, the number of internationally successful artists that have emerged from Zimbabwe is really extraordinary.\u201d Kabov attributes the depth of talent in Zimbabwe to a tradition of education and intellectual inquiry, and \u201cliving in a really interesting matrix\u201d. \u201cThey cannot make work that is not important because there is nothing in their lives that is not important. There is none of this navel gazing. Here everything is real. The work comes from a really strong place emotionally \u2026 You add a little bit of skill and \u2026 boom!\u201d Art from across the African continent has enjoyed a surge of international interest in recent years, with works newly visible in art shows, featured in the specialist media and sought after by major institutions. In Cape Town, on one of the world\u2019s most recognisable waterfronts, a vast new art museum, the biggest ever in Africa, opened in 2017. The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa has already been described as \u201cAfrica\u2019s Tate Modern\u201d. There are also new museums in Marrakech and Lagos. Last year, the prestigious Frieze magazine published a long report on contemporary art in Zimbabwe. The South African Goodman gallery is opening in London next month with a show that includes works by Kudzanai Chiurai, one of Zimbabwe\u2019s best known contemporary artists. Another well-known artist, Misheck Masamvu, won fame when Zimbabwe invested in a pavilion at the Venice Biennale art fair in 2011. Since 2012, Kabov has travelled to international art fairs to represent her artists and boost the international profile of the country in the contemporary art world. \u201cZimbabweans themselves are not aware of the extreme talent in their midst, because it is not considered an indigenous tradition,\u201d she said. The devastating economic legacy of Mugabe\u2019s 40 year rule means artists in the former British colony face many obstacles: a lack of exhibition spaces, limited opportunities to sell their work and difficulties getting basic supplies of artistic materials. Teede is concerned that the lack of a major domestic art market will mean that little work currently being produced remains in the country. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a crazy amount of talent here \u2026 But all the best work that is being produced at this super exciting time is being sold overseas and that is a big loss. In 50 years maybe there will be a museum and it will all have to be brought back,\u201d she said. Many aspiring artists attend workshops run by the National Gallery, founded in 1957 and housed in a Le Corbusier-inspired building in the centre of Harare. Nyaude, who studied at the National Art Gallery for two years and was picked to exhibit at the high-profile New Museum Triennial in New York last year, said one factor driving the boom was economic. \u201cYou have a possibility as an artist to do pretty well and there is so little other opportunity so if you have a drive to make art, that\u2019s a push factor,\u201d he said. Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former spy chief and senior ruling party official who was confirmed as Mugabe\u2019s successor in a contested election last year, had promised voters he would make Zimbabwe \u201copen for business\u201d. But foreign investment and re-engagement with the international community has been stymied by widespread human rights abuses. \u201cLiving in Zimbabwe, you are affected by the politics every day, not directly, but it is there \u2026 The absurdity of the situation defies language. You can\u2019t speak about politics directly here.Painting is a way of working things through that you can\u2019t think through logically,\u201d said Nyaude, 31. Amanda Mushate, a 23-year-old artist represented by Kabov, said the biggest obstacle she faced was reconciling her creative ambitions with the expectations and habits of her friends. One recent painting, entitled WhatsApp Gold, was inspired by the intensive use of social media of many of her peers. \u201cThe biggest difficulty as an artist is to be myself, to be the real me in my social life,\u201d Mushate said. \u201cOther girls of my age, they are interested in their careers and don\u2019t understand me being an artist. If they came to appreciate what I do, that would be my biggest achievement.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

It\u2019s the latest of a succession of strikes on Fridays led by schoolchildren \u2013 but this time adults are invited to join in. What will happen? Millions are expected to take to the streets in more than 130 countries, with support on this occasion from unions, churches, and local community groups. Some are calling it the biggest mass protest in the history of the climate crisis. How can you get involved? Possibly the best place to start is by consulting the Fridays for Future map, which details what is going on and where in more than 130 countries \u2013 and thousands of locations \u2013 worldwide. Hovering over the pin brings up basic details of where the action is happening. It\u2019s worth noting that timings will vary from city to city and that some countries (notably New Zealand and Italy) have put back their protests until Friday 27th. More detailed information can be found by searching Twitter for a city or location near you and adding the hashtag #climatestrike. Another useful global resource is the global climate strike website which offers ideas on how to organise workplace or lunchbreak action, as well as how to add banners to websites and social media pages, if digital solidarity is as much as you can manage. Friday\u2019s action is expected to be widespread in many countries with plenty of regional happenings to draw people who don\u2019t want to waste all that carbon by travelling. There will be an estimated 800 actions in the US, 400 in Germany, and scores more in the UK, Australia, France and Belgium. In all, 13 Indian cities and 12 Indonesian ones are taking part. Of course, the major capitals are the places to head for the biggest crowds. London\u2019s event starts at 11am, but marchers are being warned that police will restrict them to Westminster, so careful as you go. The action in Brussels will culminate outside EU headquarters, after starting at the city\u2019s North station. In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and \u201ccitizens meetings\u201d. The action group Lib\u00e9rons le Louvre (Liberate the Louvre) is planning an \u201caction\u201d at the museum in protest at its long-standing partnership with the petrol group Total. In Berlin, typically, the day will climax with a 3pm outbreak of techno at the Potsdamer Platz under the motto \u201cNo Future, No Dancefloor\u201d. Extinction Rebellion have announced plans to block traffic at strategic points \u201cwhere it will hurt drivers\u201d around the capital. New York City is anticipated to host the biggest climate strike the country has seen in decades. Thousands are expected at the strike, which is being co-hosted by more than two dozen local and national groups. Protestors plan to gather at a park outside New York\u2019s City Hall at 12pm and march a mile down to Battery Park, where Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak in the afternoon along with other performers and speakers.

Lucy Hughes, 23, a recent graduate in product design from the University of Sussex, sought to tackle the dual problems of environmentally harmful single-use plastics and inefficient waste streams by harnessing fish offcuts to create an eco-friendly plastic alternative. Her solution, a biodegradable and compostable material called MarinaTex, can break down in a soil environment in four to six weeks and be disposed of through home food waste collections. Hughes, from Twickenham, in south-west London, used red algae to bind proteins extracted from fish skins and scales, creating strong overlapping bonds in a translucent and flexible sheet material. Although it looks and feels like plastic, initial testing suggests it is stronger, safer and much more sustainable than its oil-based counterpart. It is estimated people in the UK use 5m tonnes of plastic every year, nearly half of which is packaging. Only 51% of local authorities in England have separate food waste collections and even where recycling schemes are in place, the majority of bio and compostable plastics are not generally suited to existing waste treatment infrastructures. An estimated 492,020 tonnes of fish waste are produced by the fish processing industry every year in the UK and it is considered a huge and inefficient waste stream with low commercial value. Unwanted offcuts include offal, blood, crustacean and shellfish exoskeletons and fish skin and scales, all of which ends up in landfill or incineration. Through research carried out on the Sussex coast, Hughes found fish skins and scales were the most promising sources for the plastic alternative, due to their flexibility and strength-enabling proteins. A single Atlantic cod could generate the organic waste needed for 1,400 bags of MarinaTex, she found. \u201cPlastic is an amazing material, and as a result we have become too reliant on it as designers and engineers,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt makes no sense to me that we\u2019re using plastic, an incredibly durable material, for products that have a life cycle of less than a day. For me, MarinaTex represents a commitment to material innovation and selection by incorporating sustainable, local and circular values into design. As creators, we should not limit ourselves to designing to just form and function, but rather form, function and footprint.\u201d As this year\u2019s winner of the UK category of the James Dyson award, Hughes won \u00a32,000 for her invention. It will now be entered in the international category for the final leg of the award in November, which will give the overall worldwide winner a further \u00a330,000 in prize money, plus \u00a35,000 for the winner\u2019s university department. The award operates in 27 countries, and is open to university students and recent graduates studying product design, industrial design and engineering. It recognises and rewards imaginative design solutions to global problems. This year\u2019s runners-up are an AI-enabled wearable device to help monitor asthmatic symptoms and predict triggers, designed by Anna Bernbaum, of the Dyson School of Engineering, in London, and solar panels which can be draped over backpacks or tents, invented by Bradley Brister, of Brunel University London.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "UN hosts drive to suck back carbon and reverse climate change", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/17/un-climate-change-carbon-geoengineering-capture-storage-restoration-forum", "date": "2019-09-17", "transcript": "A new effort to rally governments and corporations behind technologies that suck greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to help stave off disastrous global heating will be launched at the United Nations on Tuesday. The first annual Global Climate Restoration Forum, held in New York, aims to spur international support for emerging and sometimes controversial methods to claw back planet-warming gases after they have been emitted from power plants, cars, trucks and aircraft. The Foundation for Climate Restoration, the group behind the forum, has released a manifesto for its goal to \u201crestore\u201d the climate by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to those of a century ago. Atmospheric CO2 is rising sharply, peaking at 415 parts per million this year, far above the level during most of human history, around 300ppm. The foundation aims to restore this historical norm by 2050, saying success would be on a par with the moon landing or the eradication of smallpox. It warns that the current climate is leading us \u201cdown a path toward the probable extinction of our species and thousands of others\u201d. \u201cMother Earth will survive without us but we\u2019d like for humans to survive too,\u201d said Rick Parnell, chief executive of the foundation, which was created last year. \u201cThis is the beginning of a 10-year strategy to get governments and companies to understand the need to restore our climate now. Humanity got us into this situation, it can get us out of it.\u201d Global average temperatures have increased by around 1C in the past century due to the buildup of planet-warming gases from human activity. World leaders have agreed to limit this rise to 2C, and ideally 1.5C, although global greenhouse gases are not declining and major emitters such as the US and Brazil have shown signs of going backwards. Any realistic chance of avoiding highly dangerous levels of global heating will likely involve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, either through mass reforestation or nascent technology that either eliminates it from industrial processes or sucks it directly from the air. The Foundation for Climate Restoration\u2019s report outlines the most promising of these options, such as Climeworks, a Swiss company that uses giant machines to pull CO2 from the air and use it in greenhouses to boost plant growth. It has more than a dozen projects under way and has partnered with an Icelandic project that injects CO2 deep underground into basalt formations. Another avenue defined by the foundation as \u201cpermanent, scalable, and financeable\u201d is a company that turns CO2 into limestone that can be used in building. It recently supplied concrete for a new terminal at San Francisco\u2019s airport. The report also mentions the intentional placing of iron in parts of the ocean to boost its ability to absorb CO2, as well as efforts to seed reflective sand across the Arctic to reduce escalating melting. Some environmentalists have rejected such approaches as radical geoengineering that will have harmful unintended consequences. Others have criticized the development of CO2 removal technology as distracting from the need to reduce emissions. However, the UN-hosted forum highlights the narrowing window to confront the climate crisis before scientists\u2019 warnings of severe societal impacts become reality. \u201cMitigation and adaptation are absolutely critical in climate change, the piece missing is restoration,\u201d said Parnell. \u201cIt\u2019s not about leaving things as business as usual, younger generations won\u2019t allow that. But we need a breakthrough, we need to go further.\u201d David Keith, a Harvard academic who has led solar geoengineering work, said it was \u201cencouraging\u201d that the ideas were being discussed but said the ambition of the forum may be a little unrealistic. \u201cI think the timescales they propose for deployment of carbon removal make little sense and seem ungrounded in the real-world politics of cutting emissions which ought to be our first priority,\u201d he said. Klaus Lackner, director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University, said it would be difficult to restore the Arctic and that iron fertilization of the oceans \u201chas not been proven. In fact most data suggest that its contributions would be small, they also would have large ecological impacts.\u201d \u201cI think [the foundation] wants to do the right thing, but it is also important to do a careful analysis,\u201d Lackner said.

We will publish the best responses here. If you agree with Galileo and think the whole system is a nonsense, now is your time to vent. As food for thought, there are plenty of good candidates for Upside Legends in our weekly Upside offerings, in particular: 1. The people of St Ives, trying to turn their town into a paragon of mental health (three-minute read). 2. The psychiatrist rescuing mentally ill people from the streets of India (two-minute read). 3. The medics who have dramatically improved cancer survival rates in the developed world over the past 20 years (two-minute read). 4. The researchers trying to save the northern white rhino using IVF (18-month gestation period). 5. New tech to help disabled people (90-second read). Lucky numbers Beijing\u2019s air is getting better. Actually, the same is true in the UK: better, though perhaps not yet good enough. Also, somewhat randomly, in some eastern European countries, more than half of all scientists are women, according to the Economist. What we liked This piece from Positive News looks at the various groups standing up to online bullying, a pervasive problem that causes mental illness. We\u2019re also intrigued by this plan to give Americans $50 to donate to a news outlet of their choice \u2013 a measure to breathe new life and funding into a moribund sector. What we heard From Celine Pompeia in Brazil: There\u2019s a nice story in the Brazilian newspaper \u201cA Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo\u201d, Sept 9, page A3, about the benefits gained by prisoners given access to books. There does seem to be lots of evidence of the benefits of giving prisoners something to do and something to aim for. And Anthony wrote in by email: We need to establish ways to reward people that don\u2019t encourage a larger carbon footprint. Paying an income for people to live on is fine, but our culture is to incentivise and reward through further payment and that\u2019s problematic. When people acquire spare money most of the feel-good, status related ways to spend it are high-carbon, such as bigger cars or houses, or holiday flights. Everyone ends up aspiring to things with a bigger carbon footprint. There are lower-carbon rewards, such as esteem within the family, locality or wider, or individual services \u2013 if I became rich I\u2019d hire decorators. But for these and other examples, although they exist at a grand scale their more modest counterparts aren\u2019t readily identified, sourced or, crucially, aspired to widely or commonly used for reward. I\u2019d like to know what others make of this issue. Where was the Upside? In Denmark, where the government found $1.6m to buy the country\u2019s last four circus elephants to allow them to retire.

The study, published in the Lancet Oncology journal by the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, reviewed 3.9m cancer cases from Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Norway, Ireland, Canada and Denmark and compared the one-year and five-year survival rates for seven types of cancer: bowel, oesophageal, pancreatic, stomach, rectum, lung and ovarian. Australia had the highest five-year survival rate in all but lung and ovarian cancer. The five-year survival rate in Australia for oesophageal cancer was 23.5%, stomach cancer 32.8%, colon cancer 70.8%, rectal cancer 70.8% and pancreatic 14.6%. All countries showed an improvement in one- and five-year survival rates over the data period, which extended from 1995 to 2015. The UK had the lowest five-year survival rate of five of the seven cancers, the exceptions being oesophageal (lowest in Denmark) and ovarian (lowest in Ireland). The chief executive of Cancer Council Australia, Prof Sanchia Aranda, said the higher survival rates could be attributed to earlier detection, which she said was due to the management of referral and screening services in Australia. Australia had the densest per capita availability of imaging services for the seven cancers represented in the study, Aranda said. \u201cIn Australia our primary care practitioners can refer patients for a full range of investigation, whereas in places like the UK that\u2019s mediated through a secondary referral to a specialist,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cSo we can get it done much earlier, and either rule out cancer or make a directed referral.\u201d Australia\u2019s split public and private health system also allows a doctor to refer a public patient to a private diagnostic service, with part of the cost of that service covered by Medicare. Aranda said that model took the burden off the public system and \u201cevens out outcomes\u201d but there was still a sharp divide in survival rates between wealthy people and those from lower socioeconomic groups. \u201cPeople in the lowest socioeconomic group have a 37% higher mortality from cancer than people in the highest economic group,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we shouldn\u2019t be complacent about being number one. It should spur us on to make sure that those outcomes are equitable across their population.\u201d People from lower socioeconomic groups had a lower rate of participation in national screening programs for breast, bowel and cervical cancer, Aranda said. Poorer people are 40% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 2.5 times more likely to die from it. Among Indigenous communities, rates of mortality are 3.8 times higher. Only four in 10 eligible Australians (those aged 50 to 74) take part in the national bowel screening program. A 50% increase in participation would save an additional 84,000 lives through early diagnosis by 2040, Aranda said. The director of cancer medicine at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Prof Danny Rischin, said the study showed the Australian system was working relatively well to provide high quality care. But he urged caution in interpreting the data, because of classification differences between jurisdictions. \u201cI think the important trend is that overall, looking at the seven countries and across the different cancers, we\u2019re right up the top for all of them and if we\u2019re not first we\u2019re second,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think overall the results suggest that our system is working relatively well.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Mind over natter: the English town with a big mental health plan", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/calm-town-st-ives-mental-health", "date": "2019-09-11", "transcript": "\u201cA minister, a pub landlord and a mayor \u2026 it sounds like the start of a really bad joke, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d The Rev Matt Finch laughs as he recalls the origins of a novel attempt to create a paragon of mental health in the small Cambridgeshire parish of St Ives. The three men \u2013 who walked not into a bar but a coffee shop \u2013 are trying to bring a smile back to the face of a community that has suffered its share of recent blows. As a collective, they hope their string of initiatives to reach people in their darkest hour could establish St Ives as a model town for others to emulate, in an age of growing mental discomfort. An old market town around 12 miles north-west of Cambridge \u2013 population 16,384, according to the 2011 census \u2013 St Ives is venerable enough to feature in the Domesday Book. Back then it was known as Slepe. There have been some rude awakenings of late. In April last year 28-year-old Carl Malik, a popular regular at Floods, the pub at which Phil Pope worked his way up from teenage glass collector to proprietor, took his own life; a loss compounded by the suicide of his father Kevin seven years earlier. Last December, 26-year-old Adam Hyde, a keen cricketer for St Ives and Warboys cricket club, did the same. Tim Drye, who replaced Pope as mayor in May 2018 \u2013 and whose son was a friend of Carl\u2019s \u2013 decided it was time to act. \u201cIt resonated with me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d had mental health issues of my own at university. I said something in my speech about supporting a few existing charities and wanting to make St Ives a better place for mental health and to do something, not knowing what it would be. That phrase created a ripple that spread to others.\u201d Finch was one. A textbook trendy vicar, boyish, with tousled locks and a ready smile, Finch marked his 40th birthday by cycling from London to Paris for Calm, the Campaign against Living Miserably. Wearing Calm\u2019s T-shirt initiated conversations that brought home just how many people struggle with mental health. \u201cIn all, 84 men under 45 take their lives every week in the UK \u2013 and no one talks about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this was affecting the baby-boomer generation, or retired people, we\u2019d be all over it. \u201cSo, Tim and I said: \u2018Let\u2019s try to make St Ives a Calm Town.\u2019 Around 50 people \u2013 including Carl\u2019s mum \u2013 came to our first meeting, which drew out people\u2019s details, interests, gifts and talents. We planned another and invited people to be part of a guiding team.\u201d That sparked a network of spontaneous activity, as Amanda Mumford, a hydrologist with a cheery smile and winningly self-deprecating manner, explains. \u201cI\u2019d been reading one of those books you pick up in Waterstones, written by the CEO of the Danish Institute for Happiness \u2013 there was a chapter about getting to know your neighbours, and building communities,\u201d she says. \u201cNot long before there was a lady on our street whose husband had died. I wanted to knock on her door, but wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d know what to say, which seemed a real shame.\u201d Inspired by the meeting, Mumford decided to get everyone together. \u201cSo, last Christmas, we took a drinks invitation to every house on our street \u2013 46 in all \u2013 just to pop in, low-key, on a Saturday for a mince pie. We thought: \u2018What\u2019s the worst that can happen? No one will come and we\u2019ll have a load of mince pies.\u2019 But people showed up \u2013 including many who have lived on the street for years, decades, and hadn\u2019t met each other. I think there\u2019s a lot of loneliness out there \u2013 and it can be easier to open up to people you don\u2019t know well.\u201d On a sultry night in late summer, the Calm Town team gather at Floods to discuss their push for the autumn. Monday is market day in St Ives. Under the stern gaze of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s statue in the market square \u2013 the erstwhile lord protector once lived here \u2013 local people go about their business. Once cattle and grain were traded by those going to St Ives. Now, against a backdrop of high street staples such as Wetherspoons and Greggs, they rummage among anything from Turkish towels to \u201cGraveside vases - \u00a32\u201d and boxes of batteries, cooking foil, coin holders and assorted frippery. It\u2019s still early days for Calm Town \u2013 the group admit they are finding their feet \u2013 but they are clearly energised and exercised by giving structure to their simple initiatives: group walks, coffee mornings and signposts to help. The junior section at Warboys cricket club now sport caps with the Calm Town logo; there are school tie-ins where seven-year-olds are pen pals with 97-year-olds. Discussions are going on about establishing the group as a charitable trust. The committee natter about their Facebook page, whether a separate website is required, and where the \u201ccalm couch\u201d \u2013 a customised sofa taken to local events \u2013 is wanted next. It\u2019s all very English, very polite and, it has to be said, motivational. \u201cIf we can develop a culture in our town now that it\u2019s OK to talk \u2013 and my 12- and eight-year-old sons grow up realising that this is how you spot if your mate\u2019s struggling \u2013 that could be an amazing 10-year project,\u201d Finch enthuses. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a town that has a vocabulary around mental health when starting conversations is often the most difficult part. \u201cWhat we\u2019re about is a movement for change \u2013 and I think any town, any village can do what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s just saying: \u2018We care passionately about this.\u2019\u201d Pope\u2019s next wishlist item is mental health first-aid training courses for local businesses, having been on one himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t had one person say no,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might sit in a hairdresser\u2019s chair for up to an hour \u2013 they\u2019re the kind of people who really are going to be able to tell where you\u2019re at.\u201d When I suggest to Drye that it\u2019s reminiscent of the Games Makers, the volunteers who so enlivened the 2012 Olympics, he agrees wholeheartedly. \u201cAnd I was so cynical about that!\u201d he says. \u201cBut the wonderful thing is that it\u2019s triggered a lot of really creative people. I was back in my home town, Barnsley, the other day, thinking: \u2018How could you make that work here?\u2019 \u201cSt Ives is a very good place to live \u2013 a nice vibrant town with a good economy \u2013 you\u2019ve not got that there. Still, if it only encourages some people to give it a shot, and they make the place better than it was, that\u2019s a good enough place to be.\u201d Besides Mumford\u2019s \u201cmeet the street\u201d initiative \u2013 a forthcoming community barbecue has garnered several offers of help \u2013 there are calm walks, courtesy of yoga and pilates teacher Nicola Guitart, weekly 25-minute strolls from the top of the town with rallying points. Lisa Valla, head of Eastfield infant and nursery school, holds a monthly calm coffee morning for parents to come and chat. \u201cIf you just put \u2018free cake\u2019 and \u2018I promise we won\u2019t speak to you, you\u2019re just there to chat to each other\u2019, you get them in,\u201d she laughs. Designer and art gallery assistant Laura Bridgens feels planting the seed is as critical as the work itself, especially for a group who are, essentially, enthusiastic volunteers. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger of trying to do too much,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm cuppa, calm walk, meet the street, first-aiders \u2013 linking Calm Town to the school community, pointing people to links with teenage mental health \u2013 that\u2019s enough for now. If we clarify and crystallise the simple things we\u2019re trying to do and do them really well, then, hopefully, it should grow organically.\u201d Drye agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a group of people who\u2019ve grasped the nettle and run with it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in trying to see how a ground-up approach to mental health might complement a strategy developed by somebody in the NHS to try to impose on the location. \u201cWhat\u2019s surprised me is how many different things are already in place, like the NHS 111 option 2, where you can ring up and talk to somebody \u2013 I\u2019d never heard of that. If all we end up doing is raising awareness of some of these professional groups, then that would be really good.\u201d (Editorial note: NHS 111 option 2 is only available in some regions). Mumford adds: \u201cBecause we\u2019re still relatively new, very amateur, we\u2019re still trying to work out exactly what Calm Town is \u2013 and what it isn\u2019t. But it\u2019s brought together people interested in making a difference. There aren\u2019t many of us and it\u2019s quite challenging, but it\u2019s got legs. \u201cIf you just make a little effort to do something, you can make a big difference \u2013 and helping people makes you feel good. \u201cWe want to inspire people to develop their own initiatives and do them in their own way, whatever works for them, rather than dictating what people should do, or doing it for them.\u201d The steering group winds up \u2013 monthly responsibilities and checklists are doled out, farewells are said. On the River Great Ouse that has flowed past the Grade II-listed Floods beer garden for centuries, a gull alights on the surface, creating a ripple illuminated by the rays of a brightly fading sun.

And finally, another piece in praise of slow, serious journalism, as opposed to shrill, rapid digital hysteria \u2026 What we heard Karsten Hein writes from Berlin: We are a group of blind and sighted people centred around our photo studio for blind photographers in Berlin. We started our projects on blindness and visual art in 2012. At the beginning we learnt how to overcome a handicap, visual impairment, with the help of one of the eminent human abilities, cooperation. The blind photographers started soon to develop personal styles. Building on their growing visual imagination and the not-less-eminent human ability to turn a handicap into a benefit, they are now creating unique pictures. Next Friday they will receive the prize of the jury of Wiesbadener Fototage. Now we plan a new project. On the internet pictures are like black holes for blind people. Principally every picture on the internet should be described. Yes. Where to begin? We thought Wikipedia would be a good place and German Wikimedia agrees with that. So in 2020 we will start a joint project on picture descriptions for Wikipedia. The project will be to look for multipliers in the search for picture describers. Schools, universities etc that shall commit to have their students of art, art history, creative writing etc write a certain amount of picture descriptions per semester. And we received this, from Lindsay Viljoen I think human acts of kindness is important. What about covering articles like animal-rescue successes, ecology-rescue successes, festivals and events which make people feel good? They don\u2019t have to be articles in other publications, they can be from members of the public who write in. What about looking at people who volunteer and the reasons why they volunteer? I volunteer as a dog walker at our local Dogs Trust branch. Why do I do it? Because it makes me feel good. What about people who have paid train fares for people who haven\u2019t enough money to pay for a ticket, or bought food for someone, rescued a hedgehog? I think there is an overwhelming amount of good done in the world. Where was the Upside?

Requests sent to every FTSE 100 company show that they alone have trained more than 10,000 staffers, while mid-tier and even tiny businesses are appointing first responders who can be approached confidentially by those with depression, anxiety, stress and other conditions. A national training body, Mental Health First Aid England, said 140,000 people were trained in 2018-19 \u2013 the most ever in a single year, from local hairdressers to employees in global corporations. Almost half a million people in Britain have now been through an MHFA programme \u2013 about one in every 100 adults. \u201cWe have worked in more than 20,000 businesses and organisations,\u201d said its chief executive, Simon Blake. \u201cThe exciting thing for me is that training courses are as likely to have someone from a shop in Doncaster as from a City firm.\u201d In terms of numbers, big firms lead the way. More than half the FTSE 100 companies have mental health first aiders (some call them \u201cbuddies\u201d, \u201cchampions\u201d, \u201cadvocates\u201d or even \u201cbe well allies\u201d). Lloyds Banking Group has a programme to train 2,500 by next year, while National Grid and Severn Trent both have more than 1,000. The BBC, NHS and other firms including Goldman Sachs are in on the act. The construction and finance sectors seem particularly keen. Government departments have trained prodigious numbers: the Department for Work and Pensions alone has more than 1,000, according to Blake. But there is concern that mental health first aiders are being viewed as a panacea when actually their impact can be quite limited. In a report last year, the Health and Safety Executive concluded: \u201cThere is limited evidence that MHFA training leads to sustained improvement in the ability of those trained to help colleagues experiencing mental ill health.\u201d Academic research has found that training is good for raising awareness, but unproven as a strategy for improving mental health. Experts in workplace health warn that some recruits might not be the best people for what is a subtle role, and warn that first aiders need support and supervision themselves to ensure their own wellbeing. They add that a two-day training course does not produce instant experts. Alan Bradshaw, a business psychologist, said: \u201cMy main problem with it is that organisations see it as a tick in the box. It\u2019s essentially reactive, when what they really need to be doing is the preventive bit, the proactive management of stress risks at work.\u201d Dr Jo Billings, a consultant clinical psychologist at UCL, said: \u201cThere are pros and cons. Anything that raises people\u2019s understanding of mental health is a really good thing. But it\u2019s not sufficient to tackle mental illness in the workplace.\u201d While some companies may be keen to simply tick boxes, others say that their first aider programmes are part of a bigger strategy. Some offer free subscriptions to digital tools such as Headspace and Unmind. Others provide counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for staff. Many have confidential helplines, often known as employee assistance programmes. Mental health first aiders volunteer for the role and typically complete a two-day training session. They are not counsellors, psychologists or experts, but simply first responder \u201clisteners\u201d who can signpost services. Imogen Truphet, who works at the School of Life in London, says the intense two-day course gave her confidence to respond to distressed colleagues without saying the wrong thing. \u201cYou listen without judgment, you give them information and support but you don\u2019t give them advice,\u201d she says. \u201cYou encourage them to seek the appropriate professional help \u2013 mostly but not always about going to your GP \u2013 and encourage them to talk to family and friends.\u201d Natalie Rose, a wellbeing champion for HS2, says: \u201cThe first thing you have to do is listen. Show some understanding, compassion, have patience, point them in the right direction of where they can get some support.\u201d \u201cIf there was someone I was wildly concerned about I would let them know that I had a duty of care to speak to someone else about it. It\u2019s a fine line because we do not replace any trained medical specialists.\u201d Mental health first aid came to the UK from Australia in the 2000s, but took a long while to take off. Trainee numbers were low until the middle of this decade, when concerns over the sharp rise in the number of people presenting with mental distress prompted a response from business. Blake agrees that MHFAs alone will not transform the psychological wellbeing of a company or organisation, and emphasises that it has to be part of a bigger strategy that includes work-life balance and managing the sources of stress in the workplace. \u201cMental health first aid on its own is not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to ensure prevention, early intervention, job design and to ensure that people are not tied to phones and emails all the time. \u201cMental health first aid works best in an organisation that has started thinking of things like this.\u201d Case study Niki Garcha-Davies has worked for six years in Lloyds\u2019 risk division. Last year she did the two-day training course to become a mental health advocate, and quickly found herself applying her new-found skills. \u201cI take part in charity fundraisers and earlier this year I went on a walk with some colleagues. We went off in a big group and I started talking to one colleague about why I was doing the walk. It was easy to get to the conversation of mental health. My colleague started talking about their own situation. \u201cI just made sure they were aware of the resources available to us \u2013 the Headspace app is free, for example. I spoke about how I\u2019d used it and also about how the employee assistance programme is just a phone call away. They contacted me afterwards to say how much they had appreciated the chat, they had used the app and were planning to reach out to the assistance programme.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Can blind people make great architects?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/02/can-blind-people-make-great-architects", "date": "2019-09-02", "transcript": "Visualise yourself entering a new building.

As the first step in running a foundation course aimed at people who see things differently, the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL ran an architecture and design workshop for people with visual impairments this summer. \u201cGoing to start an architecture degree as a visually impaired person is so horrendously daunting, there\u2019s so much that\u2019s inaccessible,\u201d said one of the students on the five-day course, Poppy Levison, who is about to start studying at Central Saint Martins. \u201cI\u2019ve been brought up to analyse spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember my vision support worker when I was four asking: \u2018Is it better if the window\u2019s behind you in the classroom?\u2019 It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always been asked to think about.\u201d One key exercise in the workshop involves documenting how different spaces make you feel. Levison has particularly enjoyed sharing thoughts with her fellow students. \u201cI know my experience, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s always going to be best for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people really like daylight, and some people really don\u2019t. It\u2019s about finding ways in the future to balance those ideas within a building.\u201d The workshop is run by the DisOrdinary Architecture Project, which aims to change attitudes towards disability and accessibility. DisOrdinary promotes the social model of disability, which argues that people are only disabled when they are confronted with a barrier. If those barriers are removed, the disability ceases to exist. As such, the founders believe that integrating the perspectives of people with a range of disabilities into the architectural design process from the outset will build better spaces for everybody. \u201cIf people from a whole cross-section of society aren\u2019t involved in architecture, then the outcome at the end won\u2019t work,\u201d says Zoe Partington, an artist and one of the co-founders. \u201cIf you develop a building with incredible acoustics capabilities so sound doesn\u2019t reverberate around, it\u2019s not just about disabled people, it works for everybody,\u201d says Partington. \u201cIt can still be a beautiful environment, aesthetically amazing, but you can get the balance right.\u201d Visually impaired architects are also more attuned to the importance of wayfinding, which is especially valuable in public transit areas, as well as the need for space for guide dogs \u2013 which likewise benefits wheelchair users and people with children. Jos Boys, a co-founder of DisOrdinary and a lecturer at the Bartlett, thinks there is growing interest in inclusion and alternative perspectives. \u201cIt feels like a new generation\u2019s coming in,\u201d she says. \u201cMy experience with younger students is that they\u2019re much more interested in that stuff, they see it as a positive, it\u2019s something they really want to get engaged with.\u201d The Bartlett\u2019s work with DisOrdinary is led by its dean, Alan Penn. As well as wanting to increase diversity in a profession he describes as a \u201cmonoculture\u201d dominated by white architects from mostly affluent backgrounds, he is looking to foster new ways of thinking about architectural aesthetics. \u201cIt occurred to me you\u2019d get different ideas if you had some people involved where the visual sense wasn\u2019t their primary way of thinking about things,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to disrupt the architectural fixation with the visual. I don\u2019t want to patronise blind people or lead them up the garden path.\u201d He testifies to genuine interest from the profession in increasing representation from people with visual impairments and other disabilities. \u201cAs soon as I mention it to leading practices, Norman Foster and so on, they want to be involved. They have the same issues about diversity and new thinking.\u201d Although there are some visually impaired people working as architects (often without disclosing their disabilities for fear of stigma), Penn has identified just two practising blind architects in the world. One of these is Chris Downey, a San Francisco-based architect who teaches on the DisOrdinary course. He lost his sight 11 years ago, after 20 years in the profession. Downey is doubtful that, at present, architecture is a viable profession for someone who has been blind since birth. While there are workarounds to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to contribute \u2013 for instance through tactile drawings and 3D printing \u2013 licensing exams are a barrier. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you could go into a traditional practice,\u201d he says. Nevertheless, there is a spectrum of visual impairment, and Downey thinks that even for those who are completely blind, there is value in learning the principles of architectural design, not least because these can be applied to a range of creative careers. His experience of becoming blind later in life has fundamentally shaped his understanding of the purpose of architecture. \u201cIt\u2019s less about the sight I\u2019ve lost, but the realisation of how much of the environmental experience that I wasn\u2019t designing, that I was leaving to chance, leaving to possible failure because I wasn\u2019t designing for it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered more possibilities and a strategy toward a richer design than I was working with when I was sighted.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The village did not fancy the asylum seekers. The asylum seekers did not fancy the village. Residents of Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, on Ireland\u2019s west coast, rejected a government plan to settle asylum seekers there in a lopsided vote: 197 against, 15 in favour. Authorities ignored the vote and bussed in dozens of people from Africa, Asia, eastern Europe and the Middle East to a hastily converted hotel in April 2018. The newcomers feared hostility and isolation in a windswept village with few amenities and poor transport links. It was a forced union laden with irony: Lisdoonvarna was famous for a venerable matchmaking festival that draws tens of thousands of visitors each September. Now, 16 months later and with a new festival under way, it turns out that on one level the match has largely worked: villagers and asylum seekers have warmed to each other. \u201cThey are very active in the community and are very well-liked,\u201d said Elsha Daly, the daughter of Willie Daly, Lisdoonvarna\u2019s official matchmaker. \u201cPeople here have become very accepting of different cultures.\u201d Other residents \u2013 business owners, taxi drivers, older people \u2013 echoed the sentiment. The new arrivals said initial anxiety had turned to relief as they encountered friendliness and generosity. Emboldened, several plan to attend the matchmaking festival, which started on Saturday and continues until the end of September. \u201cPeople are good to me. They make me feel welcome,\u201d said Mputu Wabalekelayi, 30, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The single mother of two is open to romance. \u201cI want to see the music and dancing. Sharing is good. Maybe I\u2019ll meet somebody.\u201d Sayed Ali, 20, who arrived from Bahrain, said rudimentary English would not deter him from socialising. \u201cPeople say hello. I feel safe. It would be nice to meet girls.\u201d Ireland\u2019s policy of accommodating asylum seekers in rural hotels \u2013 a response to overcrowding at shelters in Dublin \u2013 has prompted protests from residents who cite cultural differences and strain on public services. Arsonists in Roosky, County Roscommon, twice attacked an empty hotel earmarked for asylum seekers. Authorities cancelled the move. Lisdoonvarna, in contrast, has channelled the spirit of its festival. Launched 160 years ago to find wives for farmers, it has broadened into a global, LGBTQ+ friendly event for singletons and music lovers. \u201cSome matches are made in heaven but the best ones are made in Lisdoonvarna,\u201d says the slogan. The 107 asylum seekers at the King Thomond, a three-star regency-style hotel just outside the village, have settled into the community without backlash. The children attend schools and many parents have found work. Volunteers from Lisdoonvarna and neighbouring villages visit the hotel to teach knitting, host coffee mornings and help with transport. \u201cThe people are good, decent,\u201d said Smoyo, 47, a Zimbabwean who declined to give her last name. With her meagre cleaner\u2019s wage she half-joked about storming the festival with a friend. \u201cWe are looking forward to getting some men.\u201d Several factors smoothed the integration. A spa town, Lisdoonvarna is accustomed to foreigners. Residents sympathetic to hosting people fleeing persecution appear to have been underrepresented in the vote. Increased school enrolment should help Lisdoonvarna avert the school closures that afflict other rural communities with dwindling populations. Hotels, B&amp;Bs and restaurants are grateful to have workers willing to scrub pots and toilets \u2013 jobs difficult to fill. Asylum centres can be grim, with bad food and surly staff, but the King Thomond is well-run, said Orla Ni Eili of the Clare Immigrant Support Centre. Asylum seekers there endorsed that. Willie Daly, a fourth-generation matchmaker credited with 3,000 marriages, relished the prospect of matching asylum seekers with some of the estimated 40,000 visitors expected to pack the village in coming weeks. He meets clients in the Matchmaker bar and notes their details in a leather-bound folder tied with shoelace known as \u201cthe lucky book\u201d. He advises clients to be relaxed \u2013 intensity, or worse, desperation, can repel suitors. And to be decisive. \u201cThe good-looking and the good dancers, they get spoiled with attention and sometimes can\u2019t choose.\u201d Despite the festival bunting and \u201clove is in the air\u201d slogans, Lisdoonvarna is hardly a fairytale ending for asylum seekers. Ireland\u2019s system of \u201cdirect provision\u201d satisfies material needs but traps asylum seekers in a bureaucratic limbo of dependence and uncertainty about their fate that can last years, causing anxiety, stress and depression, according to critics. Ending up in rural areas \u2013 a money-saving tactic for the state, which rents hotels on the verge of closure \u2013 can compound feelings of isolation and frustration. \u201cI\u2019m stuck, not happy,\u201d said a woman who fled violence in eastern Europe. She had no intention of joining the revels. \u201cThe festival means nothing to me.\u201d Another woman, aged 29, said she had fled an arranged marriage in the Middle East to a much older man. She was bemused at the prospect of being matched at a festival still associated with elderly bachelors. Vikisha Sesay, 25, in contrast, was intrigued. Having escaped homophobia in Sierra Leone, Sesay hoped to meet other members of the LGBTQ+ community and to see Irish craic in action. \u201cI want to experience it.

A few months after settling, Rahimi was invited to join a local bike club, and was given a second-hand bicycle by ReBicycle, a local charity. Within weeks, her depression had begun to ease as she cycled the steep green hills and harbour paths of Wellington, sometimes travelling 45km on a weekend. \u201cThat bike totally changed my life, it gave me hope,\u201d says Rahimi. \u201cI love that bike. I bike everywhere. I feel free now.\u201d New Zealand accepts 1,000 refugees a year under its quota system and many struggle to access affordable and reliable transport options. A driver\u2019s licence and a car can sometimes take years to acquire. Hilleke Townsend, co-founder of ReBicycle EkeRua, says many former refugees have never learned to ride a bike in their home country, and women are particularly disadvantaged because cycling can be frowned upon for cultural reasons. Long robes and loose-fit clothing can also be an obstacle. ReBicycle has donated more than 200 bikes to former refugees in Wellington, and is now expanding bike-riding lessons around the capital as demand soars. Another 500 donated bikes have gone to Kiwis who struggle to afford one. \u201cGiving people a bike means they can travel further afield but for almost no cost,\u201d says Townsend, who said some former refugees spend as much as three hours a day walking to and from English language lessons. \u201cIf we cut down on transport time it gives people more opportunity to socialise and have a normal life.\u201d ReBicycle\u2019s bike-riding lessons are such a hit it is urgently looking for more volunteers to work with former refugees. Learning to ride a bike is almost always more difficult as an adult, Townsend says, and can take days and weeks, rather than hours. For Rahimi, cycling has given her confidence. Rahimi has also learned to fix bikes and volunteers helping other refugees learn to ride. She also enjoys the competitiveness of the sport \u2013 with other riders challenging her to ride further at weekends and beat their record. \u201cI used to be so shy,\u201d says Rahimi. \u201cBut they don\u2019t care about who I am; they just care I am human.

But not everyone can travel on a zero-carbon yacht. In the global battle against carbon, aviation is one of the toughest challenges of all. Grids are getting ever greener thanks to renewables, cars are going electric, even construction is exploring new ways to become more sustainable. But air travel is popular, dirty and, most importantly of all, hard to power with anything other than hydrocarbons. That\u2019s where Megill comes in. The German-Canadian is seeking the holy grail of air travel \u2013 a manned aircraft powered by a liquid hydrogen fuel cell. The technology, engineered by the non-profit organisation AeroDelft which he co-founded in 2017, promises a sort of atmospheric alchemy: a power source whose principal emission is water vapour. It\u2019s 8am and Megill has an 18-hour day ahead of him, culminating in a nail-biting control and systems test flight at nearby Rozenburg, the Netherlands, and then back to the workshop until 2am to finalise the wing and tail mould designs, paint part of the internal fuselage and run some simulations. Making aviation history is hard graft, but if the team\u2019s latest endeavour, Project Phoenix, is successful, flying could become not just the safest form of long-distance transport, but eventually also the greenest. A shiny white, yellow and blue prototype for Project Pheonix\u2019s motor glider was unveiled in April to a ticketed audience, and boasts a range greater than 2,000km, at a cruising speed of 200km/h, on just one tank of liquid hydrogen. Inside Phoenix\u2019s simple, tented workshop within Delft\u2019s Tec Factory, the ambitious project, says Megill, is \u201cslowly becoming a reality\u201d, as daily deliveries \u2013 from 100 metre rolls of fibreglass to tiny electrical components \u2013 begin piling up. The full-scale, two-seater aircraft should be ready for testing by 2021, and Megill, a qualified flight instructor, may even pilot it himself. The design features a pioneering \u201cboundary layer suction\u201d: 14m tiny perforations on the wing to reduce drag. Safety features include sensors and vents, in case of a hydrogen leakage, and an electric battery should the fuel cell fail. Revisiting hydrogen since the Hindenburg (1937) and Challenger (1986) disasters can be a hard sell. \u201cIn the public\u2019s mind, they still have hydrogen as a very scary, difficult substance to use,\u201d acknowledges Megill. \u201c[But] it isn\u2019t all that much.\u201d Hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant element, produces three times more energy per kilo than kerosene, although in gas form (at 700 bar), is six times the volume and requires heavy compression tanks. Phoenix keeps the hydrogen in liquid form by storing it at -253C (-423F), halving the space needed. But hydrogen\u2019s trump card is that, when mixed with oxygen to create electricity, it emits nothing but water vapour, unlike conventional jet fuels, which are spewing out ever larger amounts of carbon dioxide every year. AeroDelft is investigating measures such as storage tanks to ensure that all water is released at low altitude or in dry air to prevent cloud creation which can have a greenhouse effect. Liquid hydrogen has been flight tested as far back as 1988, with the Soviet Union\u2019s Tu-155. But like Boeing\u2019s Phantom Eye 25 years later, it relied on a combustion engine, losing about 70% of the fuel in forces of friction and heat. Phoenix\u2019s liquid hydrogen fuel cell, explains Megill, will be twice as energy efficient as a fuel-burning system. Sceptics point out that most hydrogen is still produced using steam methane reforming (SMR), which even with carbon capture and storage, still creates as much as 150g of greenhouse gases per kWh. Creating hydrogen via electrolysis is more costly and the process (excluding manufacturing)is carbon neutral only if the electricity is generated with renewables. \u201cIf you produce hydrogen in a dirty way, it has no advantage over kerosene,\u201d says clean technology expert Bertrand Piccard, who, in 2016, completed a carbon-free flight around the globe in Solar Impulse, a plane whose electric batteries were 97% energy efficient and powered only by the sun. Piccard\u2019s achievement was widely heralded. But the solar option looks a long way from becoming a mass-market alternative. Scaling up the single-seat aircraft, whose solar-cell-covered wingspan was already as large as a jumbo jet, is still problematic. \u201cIt\u2019s not tomorrow that we fly fully solar aeroplanes with passengers \u2026 but it will come,\u201d says Piccard, who points to fuel-saving aircraft towing systems (ATS) and route-optimising software such as SkyBreathe as \u201can intermediate way\u201d to reduce the carbon cost of flying. The other technology under exploration is battery-powered aircraft. Norway announced last year that it wants all short-haul flights to be electric by 2040. But sceptics counter that battery cells will never be enough to power big aircraft and long-haul flights, and that hybrid solutions will have to come first. Though hydrogen production is increasingly efficient and projects such as Big Hit on the Orkney Islands and HyBalance in Denmark are good examples of hydrogen being produced efficiently, fully sustainable hydrogen-based aviation is still some way off. \u201cHydrogen would be facing a strong headwind if it wants to be the solution to sustainable aviation, especially in the timescale that we know we have to act,\u201d says Julian Beach of Green Fuels, the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of biodiesel equipment. Biofuels, for their part, have been extensively criticised for the huge amounts of land that would be required to produce sufficient quantities of fuel to make a difference. In 2017, 69 countries, including the Netherlands and the UK, voluntarily signed up to Corsia (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) targets, which include more than halving aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2050. For Megill, a carbon-free future for aviation requires time, courage and collaboration. \u201cOur goal is to show that it works and hopefully convince others to make the infrastructure to make green hydrogen,\u201d he says. He hopes that by 2030 the technology that the Phoenix has demonstrated could be used to create a commercial passenger aircraft, but a major investor would need to take over. A 1:3 scale model of Phoenix, with a wing span of 5.7 metres, will make its maiden flight next year, doubtless highlighting once again that carbon-neutral flying is technically possible, and that liquid hydrogen is a potentially sustainable fuel. Until investors see the value in that, flying less is probably still the best path of travel.

A muscular, tattooed man takes a deep breath before raising a hand to serve. His opponent purses his lips in concentration. The crowd is hushed. A ball is fired across the room, clips the edge of the table, and it\u2019s game over. The crowd erupts in cheers and burly men launch themselves on to the winner. Blokes playing ping pong might seem prosaic enough. Only on this occasion they are in jail. A prison guard watches over the hall, as the banter kicks in and other matches resume, older hands coaching newer members of the group. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s here now is not getting into any trouble, and that\u2019s because there\u2019s an incentive,\u201d says Axel James, 30, a prisoner at HMP High Down in Surrey for the past three years. \u201cYou get a good rapport with the officers. When they know that you are well behaved, you get more gym sessions and it can lead to other sports as well.\u201d He attends the table tennis sessions each week. To qualify for the weekly sessions, inmates must have a good record \u2013 no violence, drugs or abuse are tolerated. Traffic-light stamps that denote behaviour are meticulously recorded in a log book. Too many red entries and prisoners stay locked in their cells. The incentive appears to be working: violent behaviour has fallen by 83% among attendees \u2013 and demand is growing. So far 250 prisoners have passed through the programme since it started two years ago, with many on a waiting list eager to play. The initiative is also aimed at tackling one of Britain\u2019s most stubborn justice problems: the revolving door that puts offenders out on the streets and then sucks them back in again. According to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures, 29% of adults and 42% of young people reoffend within one year of release. But a select committee report this summer claimed recidivism can be dramatically reduced with sports-based programmes both in and after prison. James looks forward to the sessions all week because he believes the movement and concentration required by the game allow him to mentally break free from the tedium of prison life. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of eye contact, you have to remain focused because it\u2019s a quick game,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s an escape for prisoners.\u201d Coaches and volunteers from Brighton Table Tennis Club have been going to High Down every week to train the inmates as table tennis coaches. So far they have awarded 24 level 1 coaching qualifications. The group have got to know each other well, and have developed a genuine camaraderie as the prisoners and volunteers laugh and embrace one another in victory. \u201cI\u2019m really very fond of them,\u201d says Sandie Clark, 72, a volunteer who has travelled the hour to High Down every Tuesday for a year. \u201cThey get scarred by the prison, but when they\u2019re with us they remember who they are. There\u2019s a warmth and an intimacy there which is not allowed for the rest of the week. The fact that people are interested in them gives them a bit of confidence \u2013 many of them are unsure of themselves.\u201d She adds: \u201cThey\u2019re going to come out with more than just a qualification \u2013 it empowers them, they can see other ways of coping with things.\u201d Michael, 51, who used to be at HMP High Down and is now at an open prison, frequently returns on day release for the table tennis club. \u201cAt times, if they\u2019re short staffed and there\u2019s been incidents, people can be left in their cells for three or four days and only come out to get their food and go back to their wing,\u201d he says. Tensions reach boiling point, so physical activities like ping pong \u201crelease that tension\u201d, he believes. \u201cPing pong also brings people together across the prison buildings. You are one big community in prison even though you don\u2019t like half of the people. We all have to mix, we all have to get on, we\u2019re living under each other, like a powder keg situation.\u201d For Jack Finch, 34, the programme changed his life. He was introduced to table tennis in High Down during his two-year sentence. On release he went straight to Brighton Table Tennis Club and got a full-time coaching job in Moulsecoomb, on the outskirts of the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for these kids to do in Moulsecoomb, so when they see me, they\u2019re happy to get involved in something. I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s tough,\u201d he says. \u201cCrime is the last thing on my mind \u2013 I\u2019ve got so much going on,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I could\u2019ve easily been tempted to go back to it.\u201d Rosie Meek, a psychology professor at Royal Holloway, University of London and author of the MoJ\u2019s 2018 review of sport in prison, says that giving people a positive and alternative identity to that of an offender is a really powerful predictor to reduce reoffending. \u201cCoaching is a valuable and meaningful way to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can equip people with the skills once they come out of prison to become volunteers in their communities, to engage their kids, maybe, in table tennis, or even for some to work in this sector \u2026 that\u2019s really powerful.\u201d The programme has proven so successful that the MoJ says it is \u201cconsidering options for extending it further\u201d. So far, the nearby women\u2019s prison, HMP Downview, and Ford open prison in West Sussex have introduced similar schemes. The new justice secretary, Robert Buckland, welcomes the ping-pong scheme for \u201ctruly harnessing the power of sport to change lives and reduce reoffending\u201d. He adds: \u201cIt is vital that we set offenders up with worthwhile skills such as teamwork, leadership and discipline, so they have a better chance of securing employment on release and resettling back into the community.\u201d Back at High Down, James believes ping pong is his ticket to a life outside jail. \u201cI would definitely say having a sport like table tennis, having people come in, it opens doors for a lot of people.

Rebel soldiers drive past their roadside bread ovens daily. A spectre of violence remains. Regardless, Yvette Abaka and her female baking collective make dough and roll with it. In this impoverished, rebel-held corner of the Central African Republic (CAR), this group of mothers came together last year to better their lot. Since then, their loaves have become a hit in the wider community, promoting the women as their families\u2019 breadwinners and promising further, quietly profound, change. \u201cThis bakery makes us more powerful than before,\u201d says Abaka, the group\u2019s leader and a 50-year-old mother of two. \u201cMy husband respects my work. Now I am his equal.\u201d In this turbulent country, scarred by years of conflict, Abaka\u2019s bakers are not the only people hoping for something good to come out of the troubles. Following a major ceasefire brokered earlier this year between the government and 14 rebel militias, groups of women are coming together across the nation to reinforce the grand strategy for peace at a community level. They are rebuilding their country from the ground up, forging formidable sisterhoods in the ashes of a protracted conflict. High rates of sexual violence, maternal mortality and teenage births have made CAR one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. But now female activists, displaced mothers and survivors of rape have joined forces to heal deep wounds and restore trust between opposing ethnic factions as part of an ambitious attempt to mend a broken country in the heart of Africa. Besides Abaka\u2019s bakers, another group called Femme Debout (\u201cWoman Standing\u201d) is defying religious tensions by bringing together Christian and Muslim widows in Bangui, CAR\u2019s capital, teaching them commercial skills and helping traumatised individuals recover collectively. Elsewhere, in camps for displaced people, where people shelter from militants who use sexual violence as a weapon of war, survivors enrol with associations to fight the stigma of rape and to cultivate hope. \u201cSuch groups are vital forces for social change,\u201d says Viola Giuliano, a researcher in CAR for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an NGO focused on civilian protection. \u201cThey are uniquely placed to find and prioritise solutions and enable a sense of ownership of the peace process, which is key for sustainable, long-term reconciliation.\u201d In the northern village of Bamingui, lead baker Abaka is familiar with such horrors of war, having survived six years of it. In 2013, an alliance of mainly Muslim rebels assembled close to her village before running amok through the rest of the country, committing atrocities and seizing power in a bloody coup d\u2019etat. In response, \u201canti-balaka\u201d militias consisting of Christians and animists rose up and carried out revenge attacks against Muslim communities. Increasing waves of violence killed thousands, displaced more than a million people and prompted warnings from the United Nations of an impending genocide. The rebel coalition has since fragmented into numerous armed groups competing over territory and access to mineral reserves. Among the many fatalities was Abaka\u2019s son. Her brother, aunt and grandfather also perished in the bloodbath. Today, gunmen from the same rebel group that killed them frequently drive past her home and bakery. While the militants\u2019 presence has taken on a surreal air of normality, Abaka\u2019s war-weary community \u2013 like others nationwide \u2013 fear this uneasy truce could shatter at any time. \u201cAt first the kids were scared of all these weapons, but now they\u2019re used to it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do worry that the war will begin again. We\u2019ve already lost so much. We cannot afford for it to happen again.\u201d Despite these concerns she presses ahead, along with seven friends, with what they do best. They rise at dawn and congregate to scrub baking trays, gather large logs, chop up kindling and light fires in the kilns. Beneath a tin roof, they knead dough into hundreds of rolls. Small ones sell for the equivalent of 7p, a medium one for 14p, a loaf for 35p. Any profit is split between the women, allowing them to buy key household items and reinvest the remainder. Revenues are modest; the impact, big. With almost half the country affected by acute food shortages and several regions teetering on the brink of famine, food production for malnourished communities is crucial. The bakers sell to local Muslim families, bringing once-divided communities together to intermingle in the marketplace. And in a place where the international response to a humanitarian crisis has received less than 50% of the funding it needs, a little extra cash represents a lifeline for struggling families. \u201cThis bakery is the only opportunity we have to make any money by ourselves,\u201d says Estella Yarsara, Abaka\u2019s fellow baker and a 27-year-old mother of five. \u201cThis work means I have some extra food for my children too. I do this to help myself and to help my family. We all want to lift up our community.\u201d The job has upended a conservative hierarchy, helping Yarsara challenge her role in society: \u201cIf I have some money and my husband does not, I can intervene and support him. It is making our relationship more equal. I don\u2019t have to depend on him. I have more strength in the family.\u201d Their bakery opened last September, kickstarted by an EU-funded initiative. While this programme was focused primarily on wildlife conservation in the nearby Bamingui-Bangoran national park, officials were keen to reach out to the wider community. In addition to the bakery operation, other locals are taught how to farm guinea fowl, produce shea butter and air-dry beef in order to reduce an unsustainable dependence on bushmeat. Reverent Yakoudou, a park manager, knows the value of this investment: \u201cWomen are more reliable with money. They use all their profits to look after their family and reinvest in the business.\u201d Abaka\u2019s vision for the bakery\u2019s future confirms this. She hopes eventually to open up a permanent shop, selling their bread among many other products: \u201cThat way we can help our children and our community even more.\u201d Although separated by hundreds of miles of rebel-held roads, Abaka would find a sister in arms in Florence Atanguere, who runs the Femme Debout women\u2019s association for widows and orphans in Bangui. Many of its members have suffered displacement and witnessed extreme violence, yet despite the war\u2019s divisions along religious lines, Christians and Muslims are welcomed alike. Supported by UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, the group meets every week on the edge of the capital to discuss their difficulties and successes. From sewing to soap-making, they are taught new skills, helping them foster solidarity and a boisterous, entrepreneurial spirit. \u201cLittle by little women are getting together to fight back,\u201d says Atanguere, a mother of six who saw her brother stabbed to death when rebels stormed her neighbourhood in late 2013. She fled to a squalid camp for displaced people and eventually returned home three years later, founding the association with the women she met there. \u201cWe are sisters. We are all Central Africans. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re Muslim or Christian. Here, we are all equal.\u201d While the worst of Atanguere\u2019s ordeal is over, more than 600,000 people remain displaced within CAR, with a similar number uprooted as refugees outside the country. Many of the women have been raped by militants. Yet among these exiled communities, there is resilience and a restless desire to rise above such harrowing circumstances. One of them is 18-year-old C\u00e9leste, who was five months pregnant when rebels attacked her village in northern CAR late one night. Gunshots and the roar of motorbikes woke her. \u201cThey raped many girls and tortured many men,\u201d said Celeste, just 15 at the time of the attack. She wasn\u2019t spared either. Four soldiers entered her house, each taking turns to rape her: \u201cMy pregnancy was visible but they still did it anyway.\u201d Afterwards, she fled her village and hid in the bush for several days, surviving on whatever she could find to eat. Her distress was amplified by memories of what she had lost. Before the war, she had enjoyed helping her father farm cassava, okra and peanuts, participating at school as an enthusiastic dancer and eager pupil. Now, forced from home, her sense of helplessness grew when she learned a few days later that her fiance \u2013 the father of her unborn child \u2013 had been murdered in the course of a car-jacking. C\u00e9leste, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, eventually made it to a displacement camp on the outskirts of a rebel-held town called Kaga Bandoro. She moved into a cramped tent where she saw out the last few months of her pregnancy but could not shake off the psychological and physical pain of the attack. \u201cSleeping at night has been hard,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt is difficult to forget. I miss my fiance terribly.\u201d Yet even in this overcrowded and perilous camp, where armed groups freely operate, C\u00e9leste has started to overcome this nightmare. A friend introduced her to a women\u2019s association where fellow survivors of rape enter a shared process of mutual healing and, together, tackle the stigma of sexual violence. \u201cI now feel that I have the strength to deal with what has happened,\u201d said C\u00e9leste. \u201cThe pastor at church teaches us to forgive, let go and move on. During therapy sessions, we can express ourselves. We talk about what has happened and discuss any problems that we still face.\u201d C\u00e9leste and her fellow members are keen to return to school. Their dream: to take up midwifery and help pregnant mothers receive the care that war and poverty have denied them. In spite of the camp\u2019s dangers and dreadful conditions, her son is now two years old and in relatively good health. With her country edging towards greater stability, C\u00e9leste clings to the hope of a life beyond their tiny, dusty tent \u2013 for now, the only home her child has ever known. \u2022 Jack Losh is a journalist, photographer and filmmaker with a focus on conflict, conservation and humanitarian issues This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

But \u201cMa cit\u00e9 va briller\u201d (\u201cMy suburb is going to shine\u201d) has become just that: a viral initiative that spread throughout France, to Algeria and beyond in just a few days. Ayadi, founder of youth arts nonprofit Espoir et Cr\u00e9ation, lives in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, part of the northern suburbs of Paris and previously famous only for gang violence. But at the end of July, Ayadi and other members of Espoir et Cr\u00e9ation decided to work with local young people to raise awareness of environmental issues and the importance of protecting natural resources \u2013 as well as encouraging them to feel proud of their town. Hind managed to inspire around 40 residents between the ages of eight and 25 to volunteer to pick up litter and trash all over the city for almost a week. \u201cTeenagers don\u2019t always feel preoccupied by environmental issues but this time, they wanted to get involved,\u201d Hind explains. Impressed with how much of a difference they saw around them and keen to see it go further, the volunteers decided to use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to challenge the southern French city of Marseille to make a similar effort. Teamed with pictures of their work, the hashtags they used, #cleanchallenge and #marseille, immediately went viral. And to their amazement, Marseille accepted the challenge. \u201cWhen I found out about the challenge and our nomination, it was obvious that we had to take over,\u201d says Isma\u00ebl Cousin, president of Marseille education nonprofit, Action Bomaye. Cousin recruited a group of 20 local families who cleaned up the streets of Marseille \u2013 before challenging Montpellier. Since then, the word has just kept spreading. Residents throughout the country have been inspired to get cleaning \u2013 whether their city has been directly challenged or not. Nice, Poissy, Perpignan and Mantes-la-Jolie embraced the trend last week along with 25 other cities; while others including Argenteuil, Stains and Arras are poised to join the list. But while there is certainly less litter around, in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, crucially, not only did challenge participants make sure their city was clean, they also improved its image. Before the challenge, Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse had a bad reputation; local and national media coverage tended to be limited to reports of violence. In fact, on July 21, just a week before the cleanup, a 29-year-old man was severely wounded after being shot three times in the middle of the street. Known for its long-standing neighbourhood gang rivalries and violence, Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse is relishing its new role as the linchpin of a national initiative. \u201cConflicts are rife, the younger ones like to challenge one another on Facebook or Snapchat,\u201d Hind points out. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to encourage them to join a cause that would still imply the challenging part but with a positive impact on their neighbourhoods. It brought them all together, even those who were part of rival groups.\u201d The project has become symbolic for the residents, refocusing attention and casting a positive light on their city. Now, instead of shaking their heads at another report of bloodshed, people are congratulating and even emulating them. Thanks to the power of social media, cleanup challenges have become increasingly popular. The Instagram-friendly #trashtag movement is another online challenge that gained global prominence earlier this year, encouraging people to choose a spot to improve and to share striking before-and-after pictures of their handiwork. Similarly, Ma cit\u00e9 va briller is proving to have global appeal. Following its success in France, residents of A\u00efn Benian and Ghazaouet, both in Algeria, decided to roll up their sleeves last Friday \u2013 and have subsequently challenged cities in Morocco and Tunisia to do the same. Back in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, proud volunteer Adil Nazir, 16, marvels at the scale of the response: \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to see that we\u2019ve reached so many people,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, we\u2019re fully committed to keeping our city clean.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Optimism may hold secret to longer life, study suggests", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/optimism-may-hold-secret-to-longer-life-study-suggests", "date": "2019-08-26", "transcript": "Seeing the glass as half full may mean a longer life, according to research suggesting that optimists not only live longer in general, but have a better chance of reaching 85 or older. It is not the first time optimism has been linked to health benefits. People of an upbeat disposition have previously been found to have a lower risk of heart conditions and premature death. Researchers now say it could also play a role in living a long life. The team behind the study say their findings could also be cause for cheer. \u201cA lot of evidence suggests that exceptional longevity is usually accompanied by a longer span of good health and living without disability, so our findings raise an exciting possibility that we may be able to promote healthy and resilient ageing by cultivating psychosocial assets such as optimism,\u201d said Lewina Lee, the lead author of the study at Boston University School of Medicine. While such a possibility has yet to be tested, Lee noted that other studies have shown optimism levels can be raised. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Lee and colleagues report how they analysed data from two previous long-term research projects, one involving female nurses and the other focused on a cohort of men. The former were assessed for optimism in 2004, with participants having an average age of 70, and followed until 2014. For men, optimism was assessed in 1986, with participants having an average age of 62, and deaths tracked until 2016. The team split about 70,000 women into four equally sized groups, based on their scores for optimism. They then compared lifespan for the most optimistic with the least, taking into account factors including age, sex, race, education, depression and other health conditions present at the outset. The results show the most optimistic group of women had a lifespan almost 15% longer than the least. Similar results were seen in men, even though optimism was measured slightly differently. When the team compared the fifth of men boasting the highest optimism scores with the least optimistic, they found the most positive men had lifespans almost 11% longer. Research suggested people who are more optimistic might also lead a healthier lifestyle, thereforethe analysistook into account factors including exercise levels, diet, smoking and how much alcohol participants drank. The resulting effects were smaller \u2013 although still pronounced \u2013 with the most optimistic group of women having a 9% longer lifespan than the least optimistic. The most optimistic fifth of men had a 10% longer lifespan than the least. These figures remained almost unchanged for women when social life was considered, although for men a clear link to optimism was no longer present \u2013 possibly because of the smaller size of the male group. But being optimistic was not only linked to a longer lifespan. For men and women it was also linked more specifically to living to 85 or older \u2013 \u201cexceptional longevity\u201d when health behaviours were taken into account, with the most optimistic group of women having 20% better odds of reaching age 85 than the least. Most of the participants in the study were white, and few had low socioeconomic status \u2013 meaning more research is needed to see if the findings hold in other groups. Also, income was only considered among the men, and for men and women optimism was only considered at one point in time. Lee said it was not yet clear why optimism is linked to longevity. \u201cIn our study, healthier behaviours, fewer depressive symptoms, and more social ties only partially accounted for the association from optimism to exceptional longevity,\u201d she said, adding there are likely to be other mechanisms at play, such as optimistic people coping better with stress. Dr Catherine Hurt, an expert in health psychology at City, University of London, said the study highlighted the importance of psychological wellbeing alongside physical wellbeing for living a long and healthy life. \u201cThe results suggest that as well as educating and encouraging people to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly to maximise longevity we should also be promoting psychological wellbeing and the importance of optimism,\u201d she said. \u201cAn optimistic outlook appears to be a key part of a healthy lifestyle.\u201d Lisa Bortolotti, the professor of philosophy at University of Birmingham, added other forms of optimism could also bring benefits. \u201cWe can also have biased views of our abilities and our future: we may think that we are excellent drivers, or that we will never get a divorce, when evidence suggests otherwise. These biases can be good too. If we believe that we can attain our goals, we are more likely to persevere when difficulties arise.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The kindest thing I ever saw ...", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/upside-kindest-thing-i-ever-saw", "date": "2019-08-26", "transcript": "In the age of hysteria, polarisation and antagonism, it\u2019s a relief to know that simple acts of kindness are not a thing of the past. The Guardian\u2019s Upside series asked its readers to write in this summer with stories of the kindness of strangers. Here is the best from the mailbag. Thanks a lot I suspect most of us, distracted by whatever, have gone into a mall and paused in confusion upon leaving, trying in vain to remember where we parked in the relentless sea of cars the same colour as ours (in Arizona, white is popular for obvious reasons). That happened to my wife Mary yesterday. She is 83 and moves a little slowly. Part way down the first aisle, she realised that \u201clost car syndrome\u201d had struck her. It was 105 degrees out. A young woman in a huge SUV stopped, lowered her window, and asked if she was having trouble locating the car. When Mary nodded, the woman said: \u201cHappens to all of us. Get in. We\u2019ll find it.\u201d Mary has a handicapped tag, but doesn\u2019t always use it. She didn\u2019t think she had this time, but it turned out she was wrong. After a few circuits around the parking lot, she spotted it \u2014 in a handicapped space. The young lady let Mary out and with a wave and a smile, she drove off to her own parking challenge. Oh, how I would like to give that gracious young lady a warm hug. She made my day, and I wasn\u2019t even there! Al Bell, Peoria, Arizona You\u2019ll never guess who I had in the front of my taxi A few months ago, I travelled from London to Liverpool for an interview at National Museums Liverpool. After the interview I thought I would visit some of the museums. My train was just before 5pm. And I hadn\u2019t clocked quite how late I had cut it. Unfamiliar with the city, I thought getting a bus would take forever, so I jumped in a cab \u2013 with 12 minutes to spare before my very expensive ticketed train was leaving Liverpool Lime Street. Little did I know that some cabs in Liverpool don\u2019t take cards. I had no cash on me. When the taxi driver dropped me off, I told him to wait and I would get cash out to give to him. He knew I was running late for the train, and waived the fee. Instead he said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget me if and when you get that job in Liverpool. Us Liverpudlians aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d He was such a kind man. Four months later, I got the job and moved to Liverpool. And I have never forgotten that first taste of Liverpool and its people. I made my train. And got the job. And just wanted to thank the taxi driver. Sahar Beyad, Liverpool The gentle touch My daughter and I were visiting my elderly mother at her nursing home. We went into the lounge where the residents were sitting in a semicircle facing the tv which was on but which nobody was watching. As usual my mother beamed as she saw us draw up two chairs to sit in front of her. Conversation was difficult because my mother had no short-term memory but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. About half way through our visit, the frail looking lady sitting next to my mother began to weep silently. Tears poured down her face and I\u2019m ashamed to say I froze, not knowing what to say or do. My mother, who has dementia, knew exactly what to do. She took hold of her neighbour\u2019s hand and stroked it gently with her thumb all the time looking with great concern into her face until slowly the crying ended. I was deeply moved, upset and worried about the reasons for the distress and put to shame by my mother whose immediate reaction was deeply humane. No words were exchanged between them, there was no need. I left feeling I\u2019d been taught a valuable lesson. Jan Forster, Cardiff Birthday drinks On my 29th birthday (I was in medical school then) I went to a restaurant/bar with some friends for drinks. We had a bottle of wine and some other drinks and when we wanted to pay, the waiter said the wine had already been taken care of. The couple at the table next to ours had overheard us talking about our studies. They said they had once been students themselves without a lot of money and therefore wanted to do a nice thing for us. Oh and happy birthday. It completely made my night. Nina Loretz, Zurich Walk this way I\u2019d buggered my knee and was in a huge brace and on crutches, feeling wretched, miserable, afraid to go out in case I fell over and broke my arm, and in fairly constant pain. One day I was crossing the road at one of those big intersections that has a diagonal crossing. The countdown started and I could tell that I wasn\u2019t going to make it across before the lights changed. A guy crossing at the same time saw me shooting panicked looks at the flashing sign and slowed down to walk at the same speed as me so I wasn\u2019t alone in the middle of a busy intersection when the traffic resumed. Obviously the cars wouldn\u2019t have run me over but it still made me feel much safer to not be the only one in the oncoming traffic. Kate Alley, London Dental health When I was sixteen (in 1965) I ran away from home. I lived on the streets for months and got into a pretty dire state. A girl I knew looked at my decaying teeth and told me: \u201cYou must come to see my father.\u201d I was taken to a smart flat in Hampstead and was introduced to Dad, who was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis. Dr Frankel was a dentist with a private practice in Harley Street. He invited me to his surgery and, over several sessions, he gave me sixteen fillings \u2013 for free. Dear Dr Frankel, I still have all of my teeth (at seventy). John McAllister, Bristol Train champion Last year my daughter and I were on the train from Carlisle to Manchester. There was a stag party, loud and pretty annoying, and getting cross looks from some passengers. Then along comes an older lady, who couldn\u2019t find her case. She was going from compartment to compartment, desperately searching. One of the lads stands up, puts a hand on her shoulder and says: \u201cDon\u2019t worry love, I\u2019ll help you find it.\u201d The pair of them set about searching. Her station comes, and goes, and still the case isn\u2019t found. She starts to cry. He takes her in his arms, gives her a soft hug and tells her that he\u2019s not leaving her. He\u2019ll stay with her till the case is found and until she\u2019s gets to where she is going, even if it takes all day. She asks him about his plans and says that she can\u2019t ruin his day. He says that it doesn\u2019t matter. He won\u2019t leave her. He tells his mates that he\u2019ll see them tomorrow and then the pair of them go off to find the conductor. Over the next hour or so we watched as the case was found, and the two worked out a plan for how to get her back to her station. The lad had found a double seat in front of us and they spent the rest of their journey having the loveliest chat about her family, his family and the silly things they had both done in their lives. It was the sweetest thing I have ever experienced. And I wished it had been me who had jumped up to help. That lad sacrificed a stag night to help someone who could have been his Nan, and I think everyone in that compartment wished we were him, and we all had a smile on our face and a tear in our eye. Judith Raddatz Wedding belles My husband is English and I\u2019m Indian. In 2018, we decided to have a small register marriage ceremony in England to get a head start on the visa application process. As everything was done on a really short notice, none of my friends could make it to the wedding, so there I was at the hotel getting ready all by myself on the big day, wishing at least one friend was there with me to share my excitement, anticipation, happiness and everything associated with a wedding day. At this point I was interrupted by a knock on the door. I opened the door to a girl from the downstairs bar holding a small bottle of prosecco in one hand and a glass in other. She hugged me, handed me the prosecco and said she was sorry my friends couldn\u2019t make it, but no bride should be getting ready by herself without a little bridal party. I barely knew her, but she made me a little less homesick for my friends and I felt a little less alone. Her kindness and thoughtfulness is one of my fondest memories of my wedding day. Surya Vishnu, Winchester Checkout chum Today an unknown friend came to my rescue in the supermarket when I had put three items through the self-checkout and found I had left my debit card at home. Next in the queue, she stepped forward and put her card on the machine and paid my small bill, saying it was just her good deed for the day. I hope she has had the same warm glow that I have had for the rest of the day! Also that I see her again to repay her random act of kindness! Elise Forbes Dinner lady I had grabbed a coffee and was lingering outside Kings Cross station waiting for a train. Amidst the busy lunchtime throng I spotted a young lady walking towards the station\u2019s entrance with a takeaway bag of food. It was fairly large and I presumed she was doing the lunchtime run for her colleagues. But to my surprise she casually approached a nearby homeless man and gave the bag to him. She said a few words and quietly returned the way she came. A heartwarming moment. Tim Bechervaise, Wiltshire And then she said I\u2019ll give you shelter from the storm Today I was walking to the shops with my ten month old in a sling, when it started absolutely pouring down. I tried huddling under a tree with an umbrella and a waterproof coat around us both, but the rain was too heavy and we were both still getting wet. I looked up and there were people hurrying out of the park. A lady seemed to be headed towards us purposefully, but I didn\u2019t think much of it. As she approached she said \u201cI live just up here \u2013 would you like to come in and take shelter from the rain?\u201d She let us wait inside for the rain to pass before we set off again for the shops. This is just one of several random acts of kindness I have been the lucky recipient of since having a baby. It has really restored my faith in humanity in these testing political times. Lizzie Thomson, Sheffield Lost in Amsterdam In the days before we all had mobile phones, I\u2019d been invited to give an address at a conference held at a Dutch university. My contact person there seemed a classic absent-minded professor when it came to travel arrangements and was forgetful about answering emails requesting clarification. The result was that I got off the train from Amsterdam at the station he\u2019d instructed, but it was tiny, apparently out in the middle of nowhere and seemed all but deserted. As I looked around baffled, a Dutch man who\u2019d got off the same train asked if I needed help. I explained I was going to the university and was supposed to take a taxi from the station. He told me I was a long way from the university and there were no taxis, but he\u2019d be happy to drive me. It must have been a 20-minute drive and it was, I ascertained, out of his way. When he dropped me at the university reception, I thanked him profusely and asked if I could pay him, but he just waved me on with a smile. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without him! Anne Marie Karlson Night bus When I was in university in Dublin I was working late one night and ran to get the last bus home. I was the only person left on the bus when the driver shouted back to me asking me where I was going. I said I was going home and told him where I lived, the bus driver then changed his route and dropped me at my door! Miriam Phelan, London Room at the top At our academy, I gave up my office space for an additional student entrance and lobby space at school and was going to move my stuff into a new, unfurnished space over the summer holidays. When I came back after the first week of the holidays, our site manager had moved everything out of my office, hung all of my posters, pictures and display boards and set the new office up better than I ever could have, and even included a USA feature wall to remind me of home. After such a long school year and all the challenges of maintaining our site I was completely knocked out that he would think to do that, take the time and make such a kind effort.

Isabel Costa, formerly a high-flyer in Portugal\u2019s corporate retail sector, and her lawyer husband, Jo\u00e3o, are among a small but growing number of investors turning their eye to Portugal\u2019s rural interior. It is no easy task. Years of economic decline following the 2008 banking crisis, coupled with harsh government austerity measures, have hit the country\u2019s rural regions especially hard. Between 2014 and 2017, the population of Portugal\u2019s interior declined by 5.6% as birth rates stalled and young people left. Business activity (or lack of it) has followed suit. Although Portugal\u2019s economy is now finally getting back on its feet again (GDP grew by 2.8% in 2018), the vast bulk of this growth is concentrated in Lisbon and a handful of other (mostly coastal) cities. \u201cMore and more people are investing in the interior of Portugal \u2026 but they need to look at these projects almost as a kind of mission, not as a way of getting rich,\u201d advises Costa. This is true of her own venture, which, despite growing year-on-year, was never designed to be a major money-spinner. Indeed, its origins were more coincidental than commercial. Costa had placed an order with a local manufacturer for burel wool \u2013 a historical speciality of Portugal\u2019s mountainous Serra da Estrela region. She quickly discovered that the manufacturer was in a \u201cbad situation\u201d and agreed to buy its working looms and its back catalogue of patterns. She rented a disused factory space owned by the local council, re-hired 15 of the firm\u2019s employees, and restarted operations. With some luck (Microsoft hired her to refit its Lisbon headquarters) and plenty of hard work (she spends half the year travelling to trade shows), Costa\u2019s Burel Mountain Originals brand now employs more than 60 people and supplies two high-end stores in Lisbon and Porto. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just sit back and see this incredible heritage destroyed. I couldn\u2019t sleep knowing about this problem and doing nothing to retain the area\u2019s industrial history and to teach the next generation,\u201d says Costa, who also owns two boutique mountain hotels close to Manteigas. Catarina Vieira is of a similar mind. A former finance manager from the coastal city of Aveiro, she owns a modest six-chalet quinta, or estate, near the town of Seia and is a vocal proponent of Portugal\u2019s nascent eco-tourism market. Chao do Rio is the polar opposite of the vast, package-holiday complexes that now litter the Algarve. The food she serves is all locally sourced, the swimming pool is \u201cbiological\u201d (read: unchlorinated and teeming with frogs), and the only loud music you will hear is the sound of birdsong. \u201cThe whole idea behind projects like ours is that they are on a small scale and they show concern for the environment and social awareness,\u201d says Vieira. Her vision of a small-scale, culturally-sensitive mode of development is shared by many of those investing in Portugal\u2019s interior. Like Bruno Vargas. A 41-year-old former marketeer, he jacked in his city job five years ago to run a four-hectare farm in Rio Maior, a village located in the Centro region. His venture, Herbas Organic Herbs, specialises in hand-crafted aromatic tea infusions. Business is good. He exports to various European countries and employs seasonal labour from the local area. By his own admission, however, the venture grew out of the \u201cromantic idea\u201d of a more balanced lifestyle as much as turning a profit. \u201cI had the idea that it would be a different kind of life, with more time for my family and less pressures. That\u2019s not turned out to be true, of course. If you have a business, you have pressures, but at least my mind is clearer about why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d he says. Not all embrace this pared-down model of rural development. The Portuguese government provides warm words, for instance, but little in the shape of financial support. Such public investment as exists for rural enterprise development tends to come from the European Union. To get started, for example, Vargas received \u20ac40,000 (\u00a337,000) in seed-funding from ProDer \u2013 a nationally-managed fund for rural development primarily financed by the EU. Costa and Vieira also received help from the same fund. Even less sympathetic are large-scale investors, for whom big is \u2013 as ever \u2013 beautiful. Despite being located in an officially designated natural park, for instance, Manteigas is soon to have a huge, luxury hotel constructed in the wooded glacial valley overlooking the town. In a similar vein, international mining firms are now sniffing around. It transpires that Portugal\u2019s central belt is especially \u201cblessed\u201d with reserves of lithium, the alkali metal used in batteries for smartphones and electric cars. \u201cIf mega-mining comes to the centre of Portugal, it will spoil everything. We really need to cherish these small projects and put away these crazy dreams of Portugal as the future Arabia,\u201d says Vieira. The economists would disagree, arguing that mega-mining and commercial tourism promise far higher levels of capital investment and job creation. The central government, which campaigners fear is poised to greenlight a lithium mine on the edge of Serra da Estrela, appears to agree. From his holistic yoga retreat near T\u00e1bua, in the district of Coimbra, Tony Speirs is watching with anxiety. Originally from north Wales, he set up shop in central Portugal a decade ago. Over that time, he has seen large-scale commercial investment completely alter the once sleepy coastline of the Algarve. He hopes his neighbours will take note and opt for a different route. As he himself readily admits, micro-enterprises like his will not transform Portugal\u2019s rustic interior into dynamos of economic development. But they are helping spark into life pockets of entrepreneurial vitality. For Speirs, that\u2019s enough. His neighbours, he says, are of like mind: \u201cHere, people think once your business is working, why grow it?\u201d Why, indeed?

But this year, G7 leaders will be joined by more than 20 fashion retailers and brands, including the owner of Gucci, Kering, H&amp;M and Zara\u2019s parent company, Inditex, for a key fashion moment \u2013 a global pact to fight the climate crisis and protect biodiversity and the oceans. The deal to be concluded in Biarritz at the weekend comes as the global fashion industry faces an unprecedented backlash from young people concerned that it is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. Without action, the industry could account for a quarter of the world\u2019s carbon budget by 2050. The issue is soaring up the agenda, with models on the catwalk at London fashion week next month set on a collision course with campaigners from Extinction Rebellion who want the event scrapped in the face of the climate emergency. Growing numbers of young people are turning away from fast fashion towards reuse and resale sites such as Depop in the UK, Thredup and The RealReal in the US and YCloset in China. The secondhand market is expected to overtake fast fashion in the next few years and be 50% bigger than it by 2028, according to a report by market analysts GlobalData for Thredup. The surge in environmental concern is forcing brands to accelerate sustainability plans and club together to bring about change not only in stores but with the factories and suppliers they share around the world. Last month Inditex, the world\u2019s third-largest apparel company, announced that all of its collections would be made from 100% sustainable fabrics before 2025, the first international high street store to make such a commitment. It is switching to renewable energy and pledging to send zero waste to landfill by 2025. The UK parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee investigation into sustainable fashion has also prompted action, despite the government rejecting a recommendation of a 1p per garment tax to fund better textile recycling schemes. The committee\u2019s report published in February named and shamed brands such as Boohoo, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx, which had been slow to take action: failing to use sustainable cotton, collect used clothing or sign up to the government-backed sustainable clothing action plan (Scap). Scap, whose nine large retail signatories including Next, M&amp;S, Primark and Asos have committed to reducing their water use, carbon footprint and waste sent to landfill by 15% by 2020, said it had seen a notable increase in inquiries about joining up. With the spotlight shining on the fashion industry, Primark, one of the flag-bearers for the kind of one-use fast fashion so heavily criticised by environmental activists, is experimenting with clothing recycling bins at its new store in Birmingham and has pledged to introduce a full scheme this year. It has also launched sustainable cotton jeans and eco-friendly glitter. Giorgina Waltier, sustainability manager for H&amp;M in the UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThere has definitely been a significant change in people\u2019s attitudes towards sustainability and fashion in the last 12 to 18 months, with a real sense of urgency around these issues and a definite demand from consumers for more action and greater transparency from brands.\u201d H&amp;M, the Swedish group that also owns the Cos, &amp; Other Stories, Monki and Weekday brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, up from 57% now. It is also testing out a free mending service. Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering (whose boss Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, was asked by French president, Emmanuel Macron to help pull together the G7 fashion-industry deal) said the international fashion pact would enable global retailers to share best practice and ideas and combine their buying power to push for change right back to the agricultural practices involved in supplying raw materials. \u201cMany companies have taken the initiative but if they do things on their own it has less impact on the ground than if they work together,\u201d said Daveu. She said the group could combine efforts to find solutions to problems such as effective recycling of textiles and fibres for garments that can\u2019t be worn again. \u201cMore and more customers and clients, generation Z and millennials, are expecting brands to act,\u201d she said. \u201cListed companies also find more and more investors and financial analysts are taking factors like climate change into account on risk management. Chief executives and designers are also citizens of the world and very conscious that they have an important role to play in one of the most important issues of our century.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not an option, it\u2019s now a duty of running a global company.\u201d But there are fears that the G7 pact will only add complexity and confusion: there are already many groups involved in sustainability, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Global Fashion Agenda and Common Objective, a private enterprise that recently took over the former Ethical Fashion Forum, which was run as a charity. Several retail and sustainable fashion experts told the Guardian they were concerned that the array of standards and global groups which brands and their suppliers were now expected to sign up to could divert resources from actual action. \u201cIt\u2019s great what Macron is doing,\u201d said one big retailer who has held back from signing up to the G7 pact, referring to the fact that it was the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who asked Kering\u2019s boss, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, to help pull together the G7 fashion industry deal. \u201cBut our responsibility is not to just sign something and the job is done. It is fine to say stuff but actually doing stuff is what\u2019s important. Resources can be consumed by meetings. Let\u2019s keep the balance on delivering.\u201d David Moon, of Scap,said global initiatives served to get big company bosses focused on environmental issues but he said \u201cnational action like Scap can really drive change. We can [muster] capital investment and ensure people are measuring and managing change.\u201d The UK government has backed an extension to Scap when it winds up next year and the new deal is expected to involve more retailers and to take steps towards developing industry-wide systems to recycle and reuse textiles and fibres. Most big retailers now agree they have to adapt to survive. Waltier said: \u201cOur planet doesn\u2019t have the resources available to facilitate the linear production model that the vast majority of the fashion industry operates and therefore systemic change is the only option.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The Dutch city of Utrecht is unveiling an answer at its railway station on Monday morning: the world\u2019s largest multistorey parking area for bicycles. The concrete-and-glass structure holds three floors of gleaming double-decker racks with space for 12,500 bikes, from cargo bikes that hold a family to public transport bikes for rent. It is part of a strategy in which hundreds of millions of euros are being devoted to enhancing cycling infrastructure across the Netherlands, a nation so fervent about its two-wheelers that it is applying to add cycling to its inventory of intangible heritage. \u201cWe are striving to make it a cyclists\u2019 paradise and there\u2019s still much to be done,\u201d said Stientje van Veldhoven, a junior infrastructure minister. \u201cI\u2019d like us to make better use of what I call this secret weapon against congestion, poor air quality in cities and climate change that is also good for your health and your wallet.\u201d She added: \u201cIf you want to get people out of their cars and into public transport, you need to make sure using public transport is easy and comfortable. It needs to be very easy to park your bike as close to the train as possible \u2013 and you don\u2019t want to be looking for half an hour for a space.\u201d According to the Dutch Statistics Office, 60% of all trips to work in the Netherlands are made by car and just a quarter by cycling \u2013 although in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, (known as the Randstad region) cycling is more common. Demand for public transport is growing, the main four cities are predicted to expand, and the Netherlands has been struggling to meet its climate crisis commitments, so encouraging more bike use is a political priority. \u201cIn the next 10 years, 500,000 more people will come to urbanised areas, and if all of those people bring their car then we are going to have massive congestion,\u201d said Van Veldhoven. \u201cSo investment in public transport, cycling lanes and cycle parking facilities is crucial to keep this area that\u2019s essential for our national economy moving.\u201d The national railway service NS is investing tens of millions in bike parking, according to its spokesman, Geert Koolen. \u201cWe have over 1 million train passengers a day and in our bigger cities \u2013 like Utrecht \u2013 more than half arrive at the station by bike,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Dutch stations there are some 490,000 parking spaces for bikes and we expect 5 million bicycle rides on OV-fiets [shared public transport bikes] in 2020.\u201d Utrecht is promoting cycling as part of a \u201chealthy urban living\u201d policy. \u201cWe are counting on biking as a healthy and sustainable form of transport for a growing city,\u201d said the deputy mayor, Victor Everhardt. \u201cCycling is in the genes of people from Utrecht and in 1885 it built the Netherlands\u2019 first bike lane. Every day, 125,000 cyclists go through the city centre to work, school and the station, and the world\u2019s largest bike park sits perfectly in this global cycling city.\u201d The scale of Dutch investments shows cycling is about more than just the issue of transportation, according to BYCS, a social enterprise behind a network of international cycle mayors. \u201cThe bike park in Utrecht shows you need massive investments into cycling infrastructure parking, cycle lanes and great architecture, but we believe this is one of the most impactful things a city can do,\u201d said its strategy director, Adam Stones. \u201cIf you look at it as transformation \u2013 how it addresses mental and physical health, brings communities together and addresses resource use and the environment \u2013 you put more weight behind it.\u201d But some experts sound a note of caution. Although the Fietsersbond, a Dutch cycling organisation, warmly welcomes the investment, it warns that it is irritating and counterproductive when bike parks are combined with a no-tolerance policy to on-street parking \u2013 as in central Amsterdam, where \u201cwild\u201d parked bikes are confiscated. \u201cI am not a fan of this,\u201d said its director, Saskia Kluit. \u201cThere\u2019s a grey area growing where the government wants a clean appearance and wants to get rid of the bikes, but parked bikes give the street liveliness and movement, and if you want the benefit of the cyclist shopping, it\u2019s better they can stop everywhere they want.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "What do you do with a derelict Center Parcs?

A hand crank is turned on the side of the cube and the fork is being shredded, ready to be melted down into a filament that can be 3D-printed into a brand new product, in this case a ring with a heart. \u201cPlastic is a wonderful material,\u201d muses Casper van der Meer. \u201cOur message isn\u2019t that we\u2019re against plastics, we just have to use it better and to recycle it.\u201d Van der Meer is the co-founder of Better Future Factory, one of 30 businesses set up in a vast derelict swimming pool complex on the banks of the river Maas in Rotterdam. Besides designers and engineers, there are bio-scientists, growers, caterers, brewers, architects, carpenters, storytellers. Oh, and hundreds of worms. The idea is to create one ecosystem that shares resources and reuses waste in a trial \u201ccircular economy\u201d. They call it BlueCity. With environmental threats multiplying almost as fast as the waste in landfill, \u201ccircular economy\u201d has emerged as a buzzword \u2013 the promise of a system that circulates products for as long as possible and promotes a more sustainable use of raw materials. The world generates 2bn tonnes of solid waste annually \u2013 enough to fill 250m builder\u2019s skips. If these were placed end to end, they would go around the world more than 23 times. In the UK, 12m tonnes of municipal waste went to landfill in 2016, of which half was biodegradable. Globally, tens of millions of tonnes of plastic are discarded every year \u2013 but less than 10% is recycled. A 2050 circular strategy has been in place in the Netherlands since 2016, with a nationwide objective to halve primary raw material usage by 2030. Rotterdam is trying to position itself as a leader in the circular economy movement. As an emissions hotspot and a significant consumer of raw materials (because of the port of Rotterdam) it has an urgent need to deliver on the rhetoric. In March this year the municipality of Rotterdam announced a four-year pilot, pointing to innovations such as BlueCity as crucial to the programme. \u201cSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for a large proportion of the city\u2019s economy and employment,\u201d explains Marijke Visser from Rotterdam Circular, a government initiative. \u201cThis makes them important for changes in business behaviour and processes, but also for behavioural change.\u201d BlueCity is an impressive asset to point to, not just because of the startups but because of the building itself. Thirty years ago it was a Center Parcs resort, a giant glasshouse called Tropicana with flumes and jacuzzis, saunas and spas, shops and restaurants. By 2012 it had fallen into disuse \u2013 but to Siemen Cox, the hulking superstructure looked like a giant greenhouse. Cox was looking for a site for his innovative enterprise growing mushrooms from coffee grounds. A plan was hatched to house circular economy startups in the old spa changing rooms beneath the dome. Cox is a zealot and a charmer, meaning it didn\u2019t take long for him to sell the idea to three other sustainable entrepreneurs in architecture, consultancy and construction, and an investor who bought Tropicana in a public auction for \u20ac1.7m in October 2015. From that point on, BlueCity accelerated from a brainstorm hashed out on one of Tropicana\u2019s many windows to an ecosystem of circular entrepreneurs. Everyone was eager to begin. \u201cWe saw that the circular economy was an economy of consultancies writing reports and roadmaps. This is why we started doing,\u201d explains Sabine Biesheuvel, one of the original founders. \u201cIt\u2019s completely different to what we imagined we\u2019d be doing in the beginning.\u201d The renovation is Biesheuvel\u2019s sticking point. It\u2019s not finished. Tropicana\u2019s former nightclub and events centre have been converted into Rotterdam\u2019s first circular office wing, which opened two years ago with 100 workplaces, conference rooms for hire and a communal kitchen-bar fittingly shaped in a circle. But the water park under the dome, Tropicana\u2019s once noisy epicentre, stands quiet and vacant, its green flumes slowly flaking into gaping pools that have been dry for nearly a decade. There\u2019s more life stirring beneath the dome, however, on the lower level, which is partly finished. Worms compost all of BlueCity\u2019s organic waste here in the concrete bowels of the building, which is also where the production workshops and the BlueCity Lab are located. Down here mangoes are being mashed into leather, recycled plastic is 3D-printed into new products for market and regenerative bio-based concepts, such as mycelium furniture, are being grown and tested. There\u2019s also Vet &amp; Lazy craft brewers, who are developing a pioneering chemical-free rainwater purification system, and the circular caterer Arabella van Aartrijk, who bakes cookies from Vet &amp; Lazy\u2019s spent grain and rescues \u201cugly\u201d food. Superuse Studios, the sustainable architecture and solutions firm behind Tropicana\u2019s circular redevelopment into BlueCity, is down here too. The fact that all of this is going on in and around a derelict water park attracts curious visitors from around the world, who want to see the waste-as-a-resource theory in action. It gives it the edge over other similar circular innovation hubs in Europe, such as De Ceuvel in Amsterdam, CRCLR in Berlin, SPACE10 in Copenhagen or Sustainable Workspaces in London. It\u2019s the spectacle of BlueCity that helps it to grow and sustain itself as a private enterprise. (It has received less than 10% of its funding from the municipality and some indirect funds from the European commission for programming and projects only.) But the BlueCity spectacle also poses a dilemma for Biesheuvel, whose ultimate intention for the venture is to flip the narrative about waste in order to instigate system-wide change \u2013 not to become just another tourist attraction. \u201cWe are a raw experience. People come here because of the raw innovation, they want to be inspired and to think differently, but they don\u2019t really want to think differently,\u201d explains Biesheuvel. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell who is sincere about really changing and who is window dressing.\u201d Nevertheless, BlueCity is making measurable impact through its fast-track circular programmes that link budding entrepreneurs with corporate clients to solve real waste-stream solutions. And through its debate and events programme, the hub is arming the public and businesses with practical steps for change, or simply providing a more positive spin on waste. \u201cGiven the focus on the circular economy and the experimental labs they facilitate, BlueCity is very valuable in the Rotterdam innovation ecosystem,\u201d says Visser. \u201cBlueCity is increasingly becoming the hotspot where the circular economy is created. A place where the city is reinvented through experimentation, in a healthy and sustainable way.\u201d But is focusing on individual residuals and micro-innovations for waste making enough of an impact when waste is such a huge problem? And are entrepreneurs really the ones to deliver the system-wide revolution required for the world to go fully circular, or in other words eliminate waste for ever? \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of trying to replace everything we have with something new because that requires a huge amount of consumption and materials,\u201d says Rupert Wyllie, an industrial designer and circular economy advocate in London. \u201cTo expect small business to scale up or change the behaviour of others in industry isn\u2019t practical.\u201d You could argue that something so radical can only come from the top down, from government policy and from companies spearheading innovation and investment, which can be a lengthy process. It\u2019s taken the European commission more than three years to deliver the 54 actions stated in its circular economy package, and this is still only the stimulus for change, not change itself. But the BlueCity pioneers aren\u2019t waiting for change to trickle down in order to act. \u201cConsumers need positive alternatives,\u201d says Biesheuvel. \u201cI really believe everyone wants to do something, but it\u2019s really hard to know where to start because the problem is so big. But this is also an opportunity.\u201d \u2022 A chart first published with this article contained errors and has been removed This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The disused mine stack at Wheal Kitty overlooks a group of warehouses reinventing local industry: there is the HQ of the pioneering marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage, its big green eye logo staring at zero-waste shop Incredible Bulk. Next door to that is Canteen, a community-minded cafe uniting local people over \u00a35 meals and long trestle tables. Often they are ravenous from a surf or beach clean at Trevaunance Cove down the cliff, a hypersaturated blue on this scorcher of a summer\u2019s day. Then there are the offices and flagship store of Finisterre, an outdoor apparel company focused on sustainability and functionality. Tom Kay, who founded the business 15 years ago, meets me in the office breakout area. The place has the sweet, salty tang of surfboard wax, and Kay\u2019s dog, Otis, roams around under employees\u2019 desks. Finisterre\u2019s aim, says Kay, part hippy, part focused businessman, is to connect people with the sea. \u201cWe believe that they experience better wellbeing, better health, better spirituality, mental space,\u201d he says. Once a week at Finisterre, staff start an hour late so they can participate in Sea Tuesday \u2013 getting wet in whatever way floats their boat, board or body. \u201cHopefully, there comes with that a guardianship, realising the importance of looking after the sea.\u201d After all, what the sea gives us, we seldom give back. David Attenborough\u2019s Blue Planet II kickstarted a nationwide battle against the single-use plastics clogging the oceans. Surfers have an intimate relationship with the water, but the damage they do goes under-reported. Wetsuits are made of neoprene, a synthetic rubber originally invented to line landfill sites: good for staying warm while surfing in December, less so for the environment. Finisterre estimates 380 tonnes of wetsuit waste ends up dumped every year. Eighteen months ago, Kay decided to do something about it. Wetsuits from Wetsuits is Finisterre\u2019s mission to create the world\u2019s first fully recyclable wetsuit, and to pioneer the means of recycling any old suit. Finisterre already uses a biodegradable rubber in its suits. It makes clothes from Econyl, a recycled nylon made from discarded fishing nets and carpet tiles. Fully recyclable wetsuits are the next step. \u201cWe have an outlook to do something about these problems if we can,\u201d says Kay. \u201cWe\u2019re very much involved in solving these problems in innovation.\u201d Finisterre hired what Kay believes is the world\u2019s only full-time wetsuit recycler to help the company look for sustainability solutions. Jenny Banks is a graduate of the material futures MA at Central Saint Martins in London. Normally, at the start of such a project, she says, you would spend a year reviewing existing research. \u201cBut it\u2019s been so hard to find information,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one or two papers on testing wetsuit properties and construction, and a lot of those testing standards are military standards from the 50s when they started making diving suits.\u201d It is possible that the knowledge is \u201ckept within the walls\u201d of the main suppliers, she says. Or that there has not actually been much wetsuit innovation since the San Diego physicist Hugh Bradner invented them in 1952. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use the materials that we use in nonrecyclable wetsuits today,\u201d says Banks. \u201cThey are pretty brilliant.\u201d Conventional wetsuits can contain as many as 15 different materials that are nearly impossible to separate at the end of a suit\u2019s life. Finisterre\u2019s plan was to design a suit made of a limited number of materials to maximise the quality of rubber and other material that could be recovered in the recycling process. So Banks started chopping up standard suits and testing the constituent parts for stress and durability. \u201cFabrics are great for meaning the foam doesn\u2019t overstretch, but the fabrics make recycling really hard. That was the starting point of the redesign \u2013 asking: how do we still make the foam strong, but make it recyclable?\u201d One solution was using a \u201cskin finish\u201d \u2013 a texturised biodegradable rubber that prevents water from getting trapped in the fabric and chilling the wearer. But it is controversial, and not for its environmental impact. \u201cSkin finishes were used in the 70s and it\u2019s seen as a very retro thing,\u201d says Banks. \u201cThere are a few small brands that still use it as a style point \u2013 some people love it and some people hate it. You\u2019re balancing style and sustainability \u2026\u201d But the prototype that Kay shows me at Finisterre\u2019s office looks sharp: the skin finish appears technical in an on-trend way. It is a men\u2019s suit because women\u2019s are harder to cut. He has tested it out in the water and, even designed as a 3mm-thick summer suit, it is a bit warm, and not that easy to get on and off. He has me stick an arm down a sleeve, which is sticky \u2013 removing a wetsuit at the best of times can be a pretty undignified battle. Still: \u201cThis is the most recyclable suit out there in the world, pretty much,\u201d Kay says proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s got no laminate on it, you can take the stitching out and then the theory is that it can be totally recycled.\u201d There is still a lot more testing to go \u2013 next, Kay and other testers will wear the suit with temperature sensors for a more precise assessment of the heat situation. This is the \u201cupstream\u201d element of Wetsuits from Wetsuits: the creation of a product that can be recycled. \u201cDownstream is when the product has gone through the hands of the customer and is about to go to landfill,\u201d says Kay. Here is where another, chemical recycling process comes in. Kay discovered UK company ReNew ELP, whose hydrothermal test plant in Australia uses catalytic thermo-hydrolysis to break down any old wetsuits and marine waste from Sydney\u2019s beaches into a bio-crude. When Finisterre put out a call for old suits to send to Australia, it got 100 in two days. Banks admits that this discovery may make Finisterre\u2019s recyclable wetsuit seem redundant. But the more materials go into the bio-crude, the more that need distilling afterwards, which is expensive. \u201cBy simplifying the materials within our suit,\u201d she says, \u201cwe maximise the amount of good quality, pure material we can recover and reintroduce into our wetsuit manufacturing.\u201d Obviously, these processes also have an environmental impact. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a partner to do a life-cycle assessment to find out what the balance is between the environmental impact of the recycling and the environmental impact of making them from virgin,\u201d says Banks. By talking about this, Finisterre is giving away the company secrets. But that is the point. Other surf brands \u201cwon\u2019t do it because it\u2019s a nice thing to do, or the right thing to do,\u201d says Kay. \u201cBut they will do it when you can prove an economic case. The innovation around the future of business growth has to be waste as a resource. If you can prove that you can get the bio-crude out of the plant in Australia, and that\u2019s saving half of the raw material cost at the start, suddenly there\u2019s an economic argument for it. If we as a brand could prove that change is possible, that\u2019s something I\u2019m really excited about, and really gunning for.\u201d Wetsuits from Wetsuits was initially conceived and funded as a two-year programme, which would theoretically end in November, but Banks says it is realistically a five-year plan that needs support from the big guns. \u201cAt the end of these two years, it\u2019ll be about presenting the prototype, the information from our wetsuit testers and the lab, and saying, this is totally feasible, let\u2019s do this together. We\u2019re a tiny brand in the whole scheme of the wetsuit industry. The next phase would be about partnership and collaboration, and building up enough momentum from the wetsuit industry to put pressure on the supplier to make that change.\u201d Finisterre is not yet profiting from the programme, and once it hits the market it will have to persuade customers to spend more. Kay notes the growing awareness around the climate emergency, but says he does not think most people will splash out on sustainability. \u201cSo that\u2019s the challenge: getting proof of concept, testing this first recycled wetsuit out, and then starting to think about the economic viability.\u201d It has taken longer than Kay and Banks thought it would to get here, but both sound irrepressibly enthused about what is still to come. \u201cWe could have waited for one of the bigger wetsuit brands to figure this all out, but we didn\u2019t, which I think is testament to how dedicated we are to our ethos of looking after our environment and bringing about positive change,\u201d says Banks. At any rate: the joy of surfing lies in never tiring of the pursuit of perfection, so their temperaments are well suited to their mission.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The Upside series: 'Our reporting generates change for the better'", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2019/aug/03/upside-series-positive-news-change", "date": "2019-08-03", "transcript": "Journalists do what they do for lots of reasons. Some are natural storytellers, gossips even; others get a kick out of unsettling the mighty. Some simply want to find things out to satisfy their natural curiosity. Most want to think their work has real-world impact, though I must confess that an awful lot of things I have written over the years have passed through this world without touching the sides. Usually it is the investigative types, the diggers and undercover reporters whose revelations lead to the biggest change, a minister toppled, a policy reversed. But not always. One of the many joys of editing the Guardian\u2019s Upside series \u2013 optimistic journalism that focuses on solutions, initiatives, innovations, people making a difference \u2013 is that it often ripples back out into the world it reported on, inspiring readers to take action, generating change for the better. For me, this is urgently needed in a world where a surfeit of dismal news \u2013 a crisis crisis if you like \u2013 is demoralising audiences as never before. We surely won\u2019t fix the world if we keep on telling people that everything is rotten, hopeless, unfixable. While we have a duty to inform and educate society on where we are going wrong, we feel it is only proper we should point out where it is going right too. When we do, when we show what is possible, it can have a powerful virtuous effect on the lives of the people we write about. For example, earlier this year, we published the story of a pioneering group of Yazidi women who set up a female-only community in Syria as a safe space from the hideous violence and abuse they had faced at the hands of Isis. Within hours, emails were pouring in from readers asking how they could support the community. We gathered them together in a WhatsApp group and put them in touch with community leaders, so they could figure out how best to send money. One reader, Gill Whittaker, said the aim was \u201cto do something together \u2026 Thus a more certain \u2018upside\u2019 outcome may be achieved\u201d. Another example: last year we wrote about the Remakery, a cafe in Edinburgh that also fixes your broken appliances while you wait. Almost 100,000 people shared the article on social media. The piece became part of a virtuous circle, with people around the world getting in touch with the owner, Sophie Unwin, asking how they could set up a franchise in their city. \u201cAs a result of the piece I had more inquiries from across the UK (Nottingham, Brighton and elsewhere) and also internationally (one group in Montreal, others in the US) and I think a few others in Europe and New Zealand too,\u201d Unwin told us. \u201cSome people directly referenced the Guardian feature and said they found it inspiring. \u201cWe\u2019ve received other funding and are in conversation with other potential partners \u2013 there is a lot of interest. I would argue that the article also helped raise the wider agenda, as evidenced by news like Ikea\u2019s work on the circular economy. Repair culture is moving more into the mainstream, which has always been one of the aims of this work.\u201d When we wrote about an obscure cleric who drives around Iran\u2019s poorest province bringing books to children, enough people were touched to club together and buy him a new car for his rounds. \u201cThis was a particularly cheering and hopeful piece in a climate of nastiness and Brexit tedium,\u201d wrote Paul MacGowan. \u201cI wonder if you could let me know if it\u2019s possible for me to send donations to support his work?\u201d A piece about paint recycling prompted no end of tips (and jokes) from readers. An article about an African environmentalist generated offers of legal support and a UN promise to champion her case. A focus on tree-planting in Niger brought inquiries from farmers in southern Africa. Best practice doesn\u2019t always spread itself. The Upside has sought to deepen this connection between readers and subjects through a weekly newsletter, which attracts a prodigious digital mail bag each week. We continuously encourage our 30,000 subscribers to get in touch with alternatives, ideas and suggestions. When they do, others can be moved to get involved. \u201cOne of the pleasures was reading about the Green Ukhiya Star Team in The Upside,\u201d wrote Beverley Colgan recently, referring to a little known Bangladeshi group planting 1m trees in the country\u2019s south-east. \u201cI went to their Facebook page but it had no big, obvious \u2018contribute\u2019 button.\u201d We put Beverley in touch with the tree planters. Readers come up with great solutions, too. When we asked what people were doing to cut their carbon, we had hundreds of responses. The innovative things individuals are doing in a dozen countries around the world prompted more readers to write in and commit to flying less, cycling more or eating less meat. When we asked people for their favourite foreign word that is hard to render into English, it threw up many ideas, notions, tendencies and instincts that some cultures have that others could benefit from. (My own favourites: saudade, turangawaewae, philotimo). The media must recognise it shapes the world we live in, as well as reflecting it. Hyperbolic coverage of terrorists and school shooters and people who take their own lives will encourage copycats. Hysterical coverage of populism, recession and mental illness risk turning into self-fulfilling prophecy. But the same is true of optimism. Writing about inspiring characters \u2013 environmentalists, health workers, inventors and unsung heroes \u2013 will encourage more young people to follow in their footsteps. When we report progress, more progress ensues.

Jonas Thrys\u00f8e is not one of them. At least, not yet. The 36-year-old has agoraphobia, rarely leaves the house and can\u2019t think of anything worse than a group singalong. And yet by the second chorus he is putty in the choirmaster\u2019s hands. \u201cI swore I\u2019d just stand at the back and listen,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the mood was infectious.\u201d Out of work and in his second year of sick leave because of anxiety and panic attacks, Thrys\u00f8e had become isolated. \u201cI\u2019d avoid situations where I thought I\u2019d get anxious, until I ended up avoiding all situations. It was a vicious circle,\u201d he says. With a master\u2019s degree in European studies, Thrys\u00f8e had dreamed of a career in Brussels or the Danish government. \u201cBut things got so bad I couldn\u2019t even leave the house. It was \u2026 a kick in the groin,\u201d he says. Then the Kulturvitaminer (culture vitamins) programme came along, offering Thrys\u00f8e and other unemployed people in Aalborg with stress, anxiety or depression the chance to go on a crash culture course. Partly funded by the Danish health authority, and administered by the local jobcentre, the municipalities of Aalborg, Silkeborg, Nyborg and Vordingborg set up pilot schemes to encourage cultural participation for those unemployed or on state sick leave. Mikael Odder Nielsen, the Aalborg course leader, says: \u201cWe wanted to see if we could make people\u2019s mental health better, reduce social isolation and help them get back into the labour market via culture.\u201d Participants were invited to go on two or three cultural excursions a week for 10 weeks. This appealed to Thrys\u00f8e. \u201cIt was an activity that would get me out of the house, something that wasn\u2019t a medical appointment, where I was treated as \u2018normal\u2019. Because I am not my anxiety, I\u2019m me. And the course helped me feel like \u2018me\u2019 again,\u201d he says. Evy Mortenson, 49, was working in a kindergarten in 2013 when work-related stress resulted in unemployment, followed by periods of ill health and chronic insomnia for the next six years. \u201cBefore I went down with stress, I would often go to concerts and museums,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I stopped. Nothing made me happy or even made sense any more.\u201d After several temporary contracts but no improvement in her health, Mortenson\u2019s caseworker at the jobcentre enrolled her for Kulturvitaminer. \u201cAs soon as I walked into the welcome meeting, I felt a sense of relief. It was a shared experience and there were no expectations, we were just all there together in a judgment-free space,\u201d she says. This was key, because many participants have not taken part in cultural activities for years, if ever, says Nielsen. \u201cIf you are depressed, culture is often the first thing you don\u2019t bother with, you\u2019re too preoccupied with getting through the day. My role is to get them used to this world again, or even introduce it for the first time,\u201d he says. So far, 200 people, mostly women in their late 30s or 40s with family commitments, have taken part in the Aalborg programme. \u201cThey tell me, \u2018I used to do this sort of thing a lot before I had kids.\u2019 I tell them, \u2018This sounds depressingly familiar\u2019,\u201d Nielsen says. \u201cBut there are men too, because it\u2019s not a space where you have to talk all the time: you\u2019re there to do and experience things.\u201d There are eight strands to Aalborg\u2019s programme, including singing (which is proven to release dopamine and promote a sense of belonging when conducted among a group), visiting the city archive to learn about local history and genealogy, and music appreciation. \u201cWe use playlists developed by music therapists to give your brain a break, which in turn allows your body to take a break,\u201d says Nielsen, adding that the music is intended to \u201creduce arousal\u201d \u2013 it is \u201cmusic that\u2019s predictable, a bit boring, even\u201d. Such as? \u201cJack Johnson.\u201d There are also visits to the theatre to watch new productions, and coaching sessions in which actors teach participants about body language to help with confidence in job interviews. The programme has an agreement with the Aalborg Symphony Orchestra in which participants are taken to watch rehearsals and performances, something that often leads to tears, says Nielsen. Researchers have found that watching music performed live reduces stress. Participants also visit the local art museum and take part in creative workshops, an activity proven to develop resilience. Participants are also encouraged to snuggle up under blankets in a dimly lit room in an Aalborg library while a librarian reads to them for two hours. Most of the participants will not have had books read to them since childhood, so this can prove an emotional experience. Mortenson says: \u201cI spent so much of my life reading to others, but this time I needed help and I felt taken care of. It was very powerful.\u201d Brain scans show that when people are immersed in a book, they mentally rehearse the activities, sights and sounds of a story, stimulating neural pathways, increasing empathy and improving wellbeing. Participants are encouraged to talk about the books, \u201cbut not in a school-type way\u201d, says Thrys\u00f8e. Finally, there are guided nature walks, because numerous studies have shown that spending time in nature is good for mental health. Nielsen says: \u201cThese are also valuable in terms of seeing how slowly things grow, in contrast to our busy modern lives.\u201d Culture as a cure is not a new idea. In 2008, the then UK health secretary, Alan Johnson, called for the arts to be part of mainstream healthcare, and in 2009, the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommended participation in the arts and developing creativity for the protection of mental health. A decade on, evidence for the impact of the arts on wellbeing is growing. Research shows that \u201cart on prescription\u201d is valued by referrers and participants alike, and is also cost-effective, with a reduction in the number of visits to the doctor and participants gaining transferable skills. But provision in the UK remains patchy. In contrast, Australia has had a national arts and health framework to promote integration of the two since 2013, while Sweden leads the way in Scandinavia in terms of art on prescription. But Denmark is catching up, and the relationship between culture and health is increasingly being identified as an important factor in a sustainable Nordic welfare model. Anita Jensen, a postdoctoral researcher at Aalborg University, says: \u201cWe can see that it works for many people. It\u2019s relatively inexpensive, with no known negative side-effects.\u201d The 10-week course costs 12,000 Danish krone (\u00a31,440) per person, while a single session with a psychologist is about 1,000 krone and a week on sick leave costs about 4,000 krone, including benefits and cost to employers. \u201cBecause Denmark is a small country, we have a unique opportunity to make a difference by offering arts on prescription as a public health initiative,\u201d says Jensen. Nielsen agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re largely funded by the state, but the council can also decide that this is worthwhile and fund it independently from their own budgets when the pilot programme ends in November,\u201d he says. Mortenson says: \u201cI\u2019d like to see the whole world taking their culture vitamins. I\u2019m not the same person as I was when I started this process. I listen to classical music every day now, I meet my culture group for outings, even though our 10-week programme has finished, and I have a support network with new interests. I\u2019ve even applied for a job in an art museum.\u201d Thrys\u00f8e has also noticed a shift. He says: \u201cThe course altered my outlook \u2013 I\u2019ve redefined what success looks like. I went from being very isolated to being ready for the job market and happier, too. It changed my life.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Some from distant housing estates had travelled here as early as 4am to be sure of a place in line. \u201cThis doctor is really loved because he takes time to listen to you, he calms you down,\u201d said Yamina Derni, 63, who had been treated for benign tumours. \u201cYou don\u2019t even notice his age.\u201d Christian Chenay, who celebrated his 98th birthday last month, is France\u2019s oldest practising doctor. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly give up work,\u201d he said in his small consulting room in Chevilly-Larue after treating his final patients of the day, an unwell toddler and a woman suffering from high blood pressure. \u201cHow can I stop when there are only three doctors in this area for a population of 19,000?\u201d he added. \u201cI keep going for my patients, particularly for the older ones, who I like to encourage. I love medicine. But I also like to keep active. If you stop working, you go downhill. At my age, if you spend your time watching TV and snoozing, you won\u2019t survive long.\u201d Chenay\u2019s decision to keep working is partly due to France\u2019s shortage of local family doctors. Although the country has a reputation for one of the world\u2019s best healthcare systems, the lack of general practitioners has reached crisis point. The problem is acute in rural areas where millions struggle to access care, but also in some of the low-income Paris banlieues. Half of all general practitioners in France are now aged over 60, and some work beyond retirement in order to keep practices open. Chenay is not alone in continuing into his 90s. Four years ago a 93-year-old doctor, Fran\u00e7ois Le Men, finally retired from his practice in rural Brittany, apologising his heart problems. Chenay began work as a general practitioner in this area of the Val-de-Marne almost 70 years ago. He has outstayed his own son, who also worked as a doctor but who retired at 67. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change,\u201d Chenay said. \u201cThe internet means more people now come in saying \u2018I\u2019ve looked it up online, I\u2019ve got such and such illness and need such and such treatment.\u2019 In reality they have no such thing and don\u2019t need that treatment at all.\u201d He said he had been most struck by a rise in domestic violence. \u201cKnife crime against women by their partners seems to me to have got much more prevalent in the last couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cMen assume they can get away with it.\u201d Chenay, who says he wakes at 6.30am every day, sees patients on Mondays and Wednesdays and cares for members of a religious retirement home one afternoon a week. But he said the heavy administrative load of the French health system, as well as his continuing study of latest research, meant he worked around 60 hours a week. He\u2019s the only doctor in the area who accepts patients without appointments. A sheet of paper and a pencil are fixed to the wall in the waiting room where people write their name on a first-come-first-served basis. Chenay believes that a large part of general practice work is looking beyond initial ailments and helping patients with underlying mental health issues. He said the low-income Paris suburbs were a \u201cforgotten place\u201d where unemployment affected mental health and undocumented migrants often survived on little. Chenay was born in 1921 in the western town of Angers and worked part-time as a welder to get through medical school. He walks with a cane due to a leg injury sustained while jumping from a train to escape forced labour during the Nazi occupation of France in the second world war. \u201cThe leg only really bothered me when I reached 80,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t wear glasses and he said his sight was excellent after a cataract operation. \u201cMy hearing is also good, certainly better than the 18-year-olds who wear earphones with the volume up,\u201d he added. Sarah Lahrouchi, 31, who has been a patient of Chenay\u2019s since she was born, said: \u201cHe\u2019s got an amazing memory and he takes time to investigate the why and how of what\u2019s wrong.\u201d In recent years he had supported her when she lost her premature baby son following a car crash during pregnancy. She said he had treated four generations of her family: her late grandmother, her parents, her siblings, and now her own children aged between three months and six years. Another patient, Leonor, 61, said: \u201cHe helped me after I had two miscarriages at a time when there was not much support for that.\u201d Life at the surgery has not always been easy. Chenay\u2019s late wife, Marthe, was repeatedly stabbed in an attack outside his consulting room several years ago. She survived but later succumbed to Alzheimer\u2019s. He and his current wife, Suzanne, whom he married at 91, have installed security cameras. Chenay said he had been lucky enough to know six patients aged over 100. One woman who reached 106 had survived her family being deported during the Nazi occupation, and had lived alone for 25 years but kept \u201cin good spirits\u201d, still going out with a walking frame in her final years. Asked for advice on living to a healthy old age, Chenay said: \u201cI never smoked, drank or took drugs. So I\u2019d say avoid those three things. Never stop, keep active. The key is learning to deal with stress. You can\u2019t avoid stress \u2013 the organism needs it to develop defence mechanisms \u2013 but you can learn how to manage it. Make it a routine: whenever you have some down time, even five minutes, ensure you sit back for a moment and really relax.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t fear for his own health. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to stress at my age because I\u2019ve got a one in five chance of not waking up in the morning,\u201d he shrugged.

Nauris Puntulis a tenor who also had a successful pop career in his 20s, but is now the craggy, grey-haired minister-from-central-casting in the country\u2019s centre-right coalition government. Latvia is proud of its musical traditions. Like Finland on the other side of the Baltic Sea, it produces a remarkable number of leading conductors and classical musicians for so small a country. This summer it is launching an annual music festival at the capital\u2019s seaside resort, J\u016brmala, designed to be more than just a moment of high culture but something of a rallying point for a country with a delicate historical and geo-political backdrop. \u201cWhen we founded our state [after the first world war], culture was a central element,\u201d says Puntulis, \u201cmore important in a way than political structures. The only way for us to exist was to nurture our culture.\u201d Latvia and the other Baltic states had spent centuries as playthings of empires \u2013 Swedish, Polish, German and Russian. All it had to sustain itself was its language and a Lutheran choral tradition that remains vibrant and culminates every five years in a huge song and dance festival in Riga at which the combined choir numbered 17,000. The Latvian state lasted only 20 years before the country was occupied successively by the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union once again after the second world war. Latvia has only been independent again since 1991. \u201cIt was our folk art culture that kept us alive under the Soviet occupation,\u201d says Puntulis. There was, though, one beneficial byproduct of that almost 50-year Soviet occupation \u2013 the network of free music schools that have helped a country of just 2 million people to produce a battery of international classical music stars: conductors Mariss Jansons and Andris Nelsons; opera singers El\u012bna Garan\u010da and Kristine Opolais; violinists Gidon Kremer and Baiba Skride; and cellist Mischa Maisky. Grafting Soviet pedagogy on to Latvia\u2019s choral tradition has produced a potent musical mix. In the UK, music education now relies on parents stumping up for private lessons. But Latvia has a network of 120 music schools, not just in the cities but in the countryside too, and one in 12 children attend them, usually between 3pm and 6pm after their general schooling is over. \u201cThe accessibility of the music schools is the pride of our nation,\u201d says Puntulis. \u201cA third of the culture budget goes into education.\u201d Critics argue that it is too expensive and that the system should prioritise excellence over mass participation, but Puntulis is unconvinced. \u201cWe\u2019re educating listeners as well as performers.\u201d The new festival hopes to tap into that audience \u2013 in Latvia opera and classical concert prices tend to be lower than in the west and audiences younger \u2013 as well as attract music lovers from other countries. \u201cThe aim is to put Latvia on the map,\u201d says the festival\u2019s director Zane \u010culkst\u0113na, who also founded and still runs the contemporary art centre in Riga. \u201cWe want to get across the message that music has a special place here, and we are not from forests where we spend all our time picking mushrooms\u201d, although mushrooms are indeed a national obsession in heavily forested Latvia. The festival is largely privately funded by a group of business people based in Latvia or who are part of the large Latvian diaspora that resulted from the tragedies of the 20th century. The chairman of the trustees is Petr Aven, a Russian businessman whose father was half-Latvian. Aven is worth an estimated $5.2bn so he can afford the logistical and financial burden of bringing four internationally renowned symphony orchestras and an array of soloists to Riga and J\u016brmala on four weekends in July and August. But in future years, when the festival hopes to add extra weekends, he is looking for greater state support. \u201cWe are doing this for Latvia,\u201d he tells me during the interval of the second of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra\u2019s two concerts at Riga\u2019s opera house. \u201cLatvia is potentially a great country. It lost a lot of people during the second world war and in Soviet times, but it has a great environment and a great musical culture. We wanted to do something to distinguish Latvia from the rest of the world, but at some stage we hope the Latvian state will come in. If you want it to be sustainable, you need the state to participate.\u201d Aven, eager to get back to the second half of the concert, is coy when I ask him why music matters so much to Latvians. \u201cWhy do they play football in Brazil? Why in France are there so many painters?\u201d he says. But the new president, Egils Levits, a judge at the European Court of Justice, who attends the festival\u2019s gala opening, is happy to spell out its central role. Culture, he explains, was central to the survival of Latvian identity during the occupation and is just as important now in a digital age that threatens to atomise the population. \u201cThe choral movement has a big social role,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially in the countryside, with people coming together over a period of years to prepare for the song festival.\u201d The fact that the anti-Soviet movement of 1987-91 that led to the independence of Latvia and the other Baltic states was called the Singing Revolution underlines the social and political importance of the choir tradition. Like many politicians across Europe, Levits is worried about globalisation. He says the decline of solidarity and a shared identity \u2013 complicated in Latvia by the presence of both Latvian- and Russian-speaking populations \u2013 feeds alienation and social breakdown. Keeping musical and cultural traditions alive, making sure, as Puntulis says, that the concert hall is not entirely supplanted by the shopping mall, is accorded a significance unthinkable in the west. \u201cIn America, culture is something for the elite,\u201d says Levits. \u201cIn Latvia it\u2019s for everyone.\u201d He realises that an emphasis on protecting the nation\u2019s traditions can become nativist if taken too far, but says he is determined to guard against that. \u201cIt is possible to be introverted, to reflect about ourselves, but at the same time to be open to the world,\u201d he insists. The ambition is to strike a balance between modernity and tradition, cutting-edge digital technology and vast choirs in national costume, though the number of audience members using their state-of-the-art mobile phones during concerts at the festival\u2019s opening weekend suggests some misunderstand the nature of that balance. The determination to sustain the country\u2019s musical life is not, however, just about the search for social solidarity. Levits, who hopes that in future years the government will be able to forge a partnership with the festival\u2019s private backers, sees it as a statement of what the still young state of Latvia, a member of the EU since 2004 and now firmly western facing, can achieve. \u201cIn culture there are no [automatic] small countries and big countries,\u201d he says. \u201cIn music Latvia is a big country.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The EU said this week it had set out a new plan to protect and restore the world\u2019s forests, which involves working with governments to promote better use of land and resources, managing supply chains, and carrying out research. A possible new regulation to \u201cminimise the impact of EU consumption on deforestation and forest degradation\u201d will also be assessed under the plan. The EU accounts for as much as 36% of all global imports of crop and livestock products associated with deforestation, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature. However, it is actions rather than words that will determine how serious it is about tackling its impact on forests, said a spokeswoman for Fern, an organisation that works to protect forests and the people depending on them. \u201cWe desperately need new laws that require companies to demonstrate that goods they put on the EU market are not tainted with deforestation or human rights abuses,\u201d Hannah Mowat told Ursula von der Leyen, the new EU commission president. Frans Timmermans, her deputy, said: \u201cWe will not meet our climate targets without protecting the world\u2019s forests. The EU does not host the world\u2019s major primary forests on its territory, but our actions as individuals and our policy choices have a major impact.\u201d About 80% of forest loss worldwide happens because trees are cut down to make way for agriculture or pasture. Deforestation in Ghana increased by 60% last year, mostly driven by cocoa production. Europe is home to the world\u2019s biggest chocolate consumers, led by Britain, Switzerland and Germany, where people eat more than 8kg of chocolate a year on average. \u201cAddressing deforestation is not possible without addressing the EU\u2019s demand for the goods which drive it. But it also requires getting to the root cause of forest loss in forested countries,\u201d said Obed Owusu-Addai, a campaigner at EcoCare, a Ghanaian organisation working on community rights and forests. \u201cAs it did in fighting illegal timber, the EU must use its market leverage to start discussions in producer countries about forest governance and concession allocation.\u201d In 2017, a Guardian investigation showed that the chocolate industry was driving deforestation in Ivory Coast, with \u201cdirty\u201d beans from deforested national parks tainting big companies\u2019 supply chains. Later, the cocoa industry pledged to stop deforestation in west Africa and eliminate these dirty beans, but environmental campaigners have said they are failing to meet this promise, and are still responsible for the deforestation of tens of thousands of hectares of land in what used to be countries covered in rainforest.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Britain\u2019s first climate assembly agrees plan for council to tackle crisis", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/21/britains-first-climate-assembly-agrees-plan-for-council-to-tackle-crisis", "date": "2019-07-21", "transcript": "Britain\u2019s first climate assembly has agreed on 17 proposals for action to tackle the climate crisis, including installing solar panels on all available roofs and cutting fossil fuels out of local government developments. The assembly, convened by Camden council in north London, brought together more than 50 residents and a team of climate experts to develop proposals that could be taken up by the council to reduce carbon emissions and increase sustainability. The proposals focused on housing, transport and green space, and included a community energy scheme to remove fossil fuels from home heating, widespread cycle lanes and car-free zones, and programmes to ensure that all new homes in Camden are built carbon-neutral. The group also recommended that community input on the crisis become permanent, calling for a climate emergency group made up of experts and residents to be set up to oversee the shift to eco-friendly initiatives. Suggestions came from across the community, with local businesses and institutions such as the Roundhouse, British Museum and University College Hospital collaborating to address Camden\u2019s carbon footprint. Residents, workers and commuters contributed more than 600 ideas through an online platform. Tim Hughes, the director of Involve, a public participation charity that facilitated the event, said demand for citizens assemblies had surged in the past year. \u201cThey\u2019re really good processes for dealing with conflict and contested opinions on issues, and really help to bridge some of the divides we\u2019re seeing in democracy and politics at the moment,\u201d he said. Last month the House of Commons announced plans to hold its own climate assembly to inform government policymaking. A representative from the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, Chris Shaw, attended the Camden event to learn about the process and its potential for Westminster. Farhana Yamin, who as a board member of Greenpeace UK and a Camden resident was observing proceedings, said: \u201cMany of the problems that we\u2019ve had on the climate and issues such as Brexit are because decision-making has been too remote and citizens haven\u2019t had enough of a say. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the theme of Brexit was \u2018take back control\u2019 but actually this is what taking back control really looks like in practice \u2013 it\u2019s citizens being given the information and being asked to decide.\u201d Members of the assembly were broadly positive about the process. Anna Pick, 23, a researcher, said: \u201cThe process of engaging people with the council, making people feel that they\u2019re a bit more empowered at the community level, making people get together and talk to each other, I think those are all really powerful things.I feel much more optimistic about Camden council\u2019s power to do things and my ability to shape what they do.\u201d Climate Emergency Camden, a group of residents, called on the council to take meaningful action on the proposals, warning that some residents were cynical about the impact of the process. Their concern was echoed by many members of the assembly. \u201cThere will be a lot of very good ideas suggested by people, but the crucial thing is that these ideas will be acted upon rather than be forgotten. It\u2019s very important that they\u2019re followed up and put into practice,\u201d said Hamid Reza Aghaei, an Iranian refugee living in Camden. The council leader, Georgia Gould, emphasised her commitment to doing so. \u201cWe declared a climate emergency and that can\u2019t just be a statement or a piece of paper, it has to be real action,\u201d she said.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "First climate assembly in UK draws up wishlist for council action", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/uk-first-climate-assembly-camden-draws-up-wishlist-for-council-action", "date": "2019-07-20", "transcript": "Britain\u2019s first climate \u201ccitizens assembly\u201d opened its final session on Saturday morning at which more than 50 Londoners will decide on carbon-cutting measures they want their district to enact in order to confront climate change. Camden\u2019s Citizens Assembly, convened to interrogate what locals, neighbourhoods and the council can do for the environment, is deliberating action that would reduce fossil fuel usage in homes and public buildings and on roads. The wishlist will be considered by the council as it draws up an environment action plan for 2020. The outcome of the assembly will be closely watched by other councils planning to follow suit this year, and by Westminster which will hold its own national climate assembly in the autumn. Council officials say there is a clear intention to implement at least some of the recommendations. \u201cI hope there will be some concrete action that we can take forward as a council,\u201d said Georgia Gould, the council leader. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea of it being an open process \u2013 you are letting go of that control. Our climate is in a crisis and we need to act in radical new ways and this assembly is part of developing those new ideas.\u201d Ideas being considered include community energy projects such as solar panels on schools, GP surgeries and public buildings, a revolution in heating buildings that favours air source heat pumps over old-style gas boilers, better insulation and urban greening. Anti-car measures are also being considered, though motorists produce only 13% of emissions in the district, with the rest generated by energy use in buildings. \u201cI\u2019m keen that they should ban all cars. They should ban all gas boilers in newbuilds now. They should retrofit old buildings,\u201d said Rupert Cruise, one of the participants. But the assembly is diverse in age, ethnicity and outlook. Another juror, Neil Chappell, said: \u201cI\u2019m here to defend the motorist. Camden always hammers the motorist but only 10% of emissions is down to cars.\u201d By the end of Saturday\u2019s deliberations, participants will have spent 12 hours in three separate sessions listening to briefings, asking questions, debating with each other and coming up with solutions. They were recruited randomly via a street and door-knocking campaign. A shortlist was winnowed down to assure the final composition was demographically (but not necessarily politically) representative. The participants are being paid \u00a3150 in vouchers for their time. Some participants said that although they were keen to do something, they felt the real scope for action lay with the national government. After all, aircraft do not take off in Camden, there are no large power plants, and container ships do not pass through. \u201cMost people are informed and there is consensus, but people feel that individuals can\u2019t do much,\u201d said Khalil Miah. \u201cIt\u2019s up to national government to set the goalposts and the deadlines.\u201d Others said the process itself was a breath of fresh air, helping to address not just the crisis in the environment but the crisis in democracy too. \u201cIt is absolutely great,\u201d said Merve \u00d6ner, a student on the assembly. \u201cIt\u2019s a diverse community and it\u2019s delightful to involve them all. I think it should be implemented in lots of other countries.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Britain's first climate assembly: can it help fix democracy too?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/could-camdens-climate-assembly-help-fix-democracy-too", "date": "2019-07-19", "transcript": "In an airless library in north London, 56 people are trying to help fix not one global crisis but two. There are students and builders, a civil servant, an entrepreneur, a restaurateur, a support worker. There are immigrants and retirees and even a retired immigrant. This is Britain\u2019s first climate assembly, a randomly selected panel of local people convened by the London borough of Camden to consider what can be done to confront the climate emergency. The jurors have been assembled to listen to briefings, pose questions, assess facts, debate and discuss, and then ultimately recommend action to Camden council. The big question before them is what action the district can take to limit global heating and its impact. The hope is that the series of deliberations this summer will have a bearing not just on the climate crisis but on the crisis in democracy too. A national climate assembly is planned for Westminster this autumn and Camden is being closely watched for the dos and don\u2019ts of this relatively new form of public engagement. \u201cI am interested in the idea of citizens assemblies and not just for climate change,\u201d said the local MP Keir Starmer, a Labour frontbencher. \u201cI think they might turn out to be a way to have a different kind of political dialogue to avoid the shouty tribalism of the last few years.\u201d Things take a while to get going. The opening session, something of a factfinding exercise, is held on a muggy summer night in the semi-basement rotunda of Swiss Cottage public library. The room swelters, as if to make a point. A woman wafts a fan. Facilitators urge brevity, inquiry, civility. One helpful juror draws a smiley face on a paper cup to keep a restless child amused. Climate experts such as Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, set out the indisputable science of the climate emergency. Participants have yellow and red cards to slow him down or stop him if they get lost. (\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been red-carded during a presentation,\u201d he says later.) Not everyone finds it easy. One young woman is on the verge of walking out because progress is slow. For others it\u2019s all a bit fast. And one juror, Neil Chappell, who works in construction, wonders who chose the experts and how they chose the facts. \u201cThe people they had talking were good at getting their agenda over but didn\u2019t give us enough information to make informed decisions,\u201d he said. A gulf in knowledge between jurors is exposed when they are invited to pose questions. One wondered: \u201cHow many people in Camden die from air pollution each year?\u201d. Another asked: \u201cCan wind farms change the direction of the wind?\u201d But council officials are enthusiastic about the process and adamant they will act on its recommendations in a new environmental plan to be drawn up for 2020. Georgia Gould, the council leader, said she hoped the outcome would be \u201csome concrete action that we can take forward as a council. That\u2019s the idea of it being an open process \u2013 you are letting go of that control. There has been a complete breakdown in trust in our political system, we need to create new democratic mechanisms to break through that and this is it.\u201d What is to be done? After an initial fact-finding phase, the 56 panellists get into the nitty-gritty. What is to be done? What works? A pair of local trailblazers talk through their own personal carbon \u201chygiene\u201d measures: an electric car for their horticultural business; rail travel for holidays; meat as a treat, not a staple; double glazing, solar panels, and \u2013 perhaps less convincingly \u2013 \u201cwarm\u201d wallpaper. They even approach idling cars on the street and tell drivers to switch off their engines. \u201cMost people respond politely,\u201d Stephen Evans tells the audience. Campaigners and experts lay out the pros and cons of certain measures. Refitting all Camden\u2019s buildings with greener heating such as air source heat pumps and insulation would cost at least \u00a31.3bn. Is that a bargain or a burden? Who would pay? What about pedestrianising streets, a zero-emissions motoring zone, greening driveways, grasscrete \u2013 would that make enough of a difference? And is there any space to plant more trees? (Answer: not really.) \u201cI think it\u2019s very interesting but I\u2019ve been wondering quite a bit about where it\u2019s going to lead,\u201d said Chris Dunham, the director of Carbon Descent, an eco-consultancy, who spoke as an expert at the sessions. \u201cMy concerns are that in the age of austerity it\u2019s a real challenge for councils which don\u2019t have the money or power to do the things that are needed to complete the piece.\u201d Panel action Citizens\u2019 assemblies have been rising to prominence since an Irish experiment in 2016 to convene randomly selected laypeople to thrash out the abortion issue broke the deadlock and paved the way for a national referendum in 2018. Camden has debated social care and its 2025 borough plan. Its climate assembly will be followed by similar exercises in Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Lambeth, Devon and Hertfordshire this autumn, and a national climate assembly is also scheduled to take place. Scotland will debate its future in a citizens assembly. \u201cIn the last six months the interest in the idea has risen exponentially,\u201d said Tim Hughes, who helped to facilitate the Camden exercise. As the director of Involve, a public participation charity, Hughes has worked on a range of assemblies. What makes them work well? \u201cYou want a good range of expertise, time and space for assembly members to reflect and reach recommendations,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not looking for complete consensus because that could be false consensus. You also want a good sense of where people disagree.\u201d Debate at the six tables in the library rotunda produces plenty of disagreement but participants say it is good-natured. Rupert Cruise, who is originally from Johannesburg and has lived in Camden since 2001, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic. The only surprise we\u2019ve had is that there are no climate change deniers. There are differing views on where we should focus but it\u2019s done in a respectful tone.\u201d Some have suggested participation in such assemblies could be made mandatory in the same way that jury service is. Simon Burall, an expert in public participation who also helped to facilitate the Camden assembly, said that may be some way off. \u201cThere is significant distrust in government already, and if you force people to be here and don\u2019t listen to them you will alienate them even further,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you tell them they have to come to learn how to be better citizens, they\u2019ll feel patronised.\u201d Still, the scope for more citizens assemblies on divisive issues seems broad enough. Indeed, a rigorously instituted panel to discuss the pros and cons of leaving the EU might have been useful in the run-up to the 2016 referendum. Perhaps it might still be useful as a tool to elevate debate, restore the primacy of indisputable fact and return civility and respect to political dialogue. \u201cFor the past few years we have had two or more groups of people talking past each other, whether on Brexit or climate change,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cI\u2019m supportive of the idea.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

As they enter the crowded carriage, they are met not with a musty mix of human odours, but with the subtle aroma of citrus fruit. A select few trains on Vienna\u2019s U-bahn are trialling perfumed carriages following complaints that the city\u2019s subway system was unpleasant during the summer, despite widespread air conditioning. According to Wiener Linien (Vienna Lines), the city\u2019s public transport operator, feedback has been \u201cmixed\u201d. But the fact that Vienna\u2019s biggest public transport debate this summer is over perfumed carriages is evidence of a broader success story. A dense constellation of trams, buses, trains and subway cars, Vienna\u2019s system is widely regarded as one of the best in the world. And it is remarkably cheap for residents: just a euro a day for those who buy the \u20ac365 (\u00a3328) annual pass. For comparison, a similar pass is \u20ac761 in Berlin, or \u00a32,020 for London zones 1-4. Berlin is one of a number of German cities looking at copying Vienna\u2019s pricing policy, as municipalities across Europe look for innovative policies that will lower emissions and get more people on to public transport. The euro-a-day ticket was the brainchild of the former Green deputy mayor of Vienna, Maria Vassilakou, who ran for office in 2010 promising \u20ac100 season tickets. Most other politicians thought this was crazy, pointing out that the existing \u20ac449 ticket was already cheap by European standards. After a long negotiation, a compromise price of \u20ac365 was agreed and launched in 2013. The effects have been considerable. \u201cFor people with modest incomes the saving really made a difference, and for well-off people it became something you buy it to have it just in case,\u201d said Vassilakou. Sales of annual tickets are up from 321,000 in 2011 to 822,000 this year. When children and students, eligible for cheaper passes, are added to the total, around 1.1 million of Vienna\u2019s 1.9 million population has a long-term pass. The extra ticket sales meant that the already generous city funding for transport infrastructure did not have to be increased too much to meet the shortfall. Wiener Linien receives around \u20ac700m a year in subsidies. There are no plans to raise the annual ticket price, which has remained static since 2013, even as short-term ticket prices creep up \u2013 a daily pass now costs \u20ac8. Using Vienna\u2019s transport system is easy, with short interchanges, minimal distances between stations, and trains or buses that arrive at regular intervals. \u201cTime as we experience it is not about minutes, it\u2019s about our feelings. People say in Vienna it\u2019s quick. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s just clever,\u201d said Hermann Knoflacher, a professor and urban planning expert who has worked on the city\u2019s transport infrastructure since 1963. The network is a mix of old and new, and ancient infrastructure forms part of a very modern system. The city\u2019s U-bahn system only began operating in the late 1970s, but still uses the ornate Jugendstil entrance pavilions and sleek platforms \u2013 designed by the architect Otto Wagner \u2013 that were part of an overground railway network constructed in the late 19th century. The 71 tram that rolls along the famous Ringstrasse before a half-hour ride out to Vienna\u2019s vast main cemetery has been operational since it was horse-drawnand coffins were pulled along the tracks at night. \u201cHe\u2019s taken the 71\u201d is still a slang term akin to \u201ckick the bucket\u201d. Now, it carries commuters from the suburbs and shuttles groups of tourists between the multiple historical landmarks on the Ring. But much of the infrastructure is more recent and new stations and routes are still being added. All the U-bahn stations and most of the buses and trams have disabled access. Knoflacher, who has taught a generation of urban planners, said that for years he has made his students spend a day getting around Vienna in a wheelchair. \u201cThey never forget that,\u201d he said. Almost everyone in Vienna lives within a five-minute walk of a public transport stop or station, and a bus or train will be along within three to five minutes, meaning door to ride almost never takes more than 10 minutes, and usually much less. David Lansky, who works at EY, formerly Ernst &amp; Young, has one of the longest commutes in Vienna, requiring a bus and two U-bahn trains, but he enjoys the 45-minute journey twice a day. \u201cI like to read, or listen to podcasts; it\u2019s me time,\u201d he said. In two years of regular commuting, he did not recall a delay of more than a couple of minutes. The love of the Viennese for their public transport system is so great that branded merchandise made by the operator has become the latest fashion trend in the city. \u201cI see a lot of Wiener Linien apparel around the university and at parties. Somehow they\u2019ve managed to hype their brand name and make it part of the youth culture here,\u201d said Sophie Spiegelberger, a 20-year-old politics and maths student at the University of Vienna. The key to the success, said Knoflacher, lies not only in the impressive public transport infrastructure, but in making life more difficult for drivers as well, something Vienna has done gradually over recent decades. \u201cCars are like water, they fill any space you give them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that the Germans want to introduce the cheap subway fares, but it\u2019s only part of the solution. If you don\u2019t really go after the cars, it will never work.\u201d Additional reporting by Adam Urosevic", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The best things in life are free \u2026 but where are they?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/the-best-things-in-life-are-free-but-where-are-they", "date": "2019-07-17", "transcript": "Mushrooms in Russia In Russia, mushroom picking is called the \u201cquiet hunt\u201d and it has a ritual all its own. From late spring through to autumn, the high season for mycophiles, Russians fan out into the forests in search of fresh air, solitude and fungi to fill their wicker baskets. Should you see Ladas and Range Rovers abandoned roadside after a downpour, do not be alarmed: it is just mushroom season, not the zombie apocalypse. The prey depends on the season: morels in spring, then pine boletes, broad milkcaps, orange chanterelles and the prized boroviki, the porcinis or penny buns that crown the season before the first snowfalls. Yes, Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy wrote about mushroom hunts. But for a more hallucinogenic offering, turn to the Bolshevik functionary Alexander Tolstoy, who wrote a fairytale about talking mushrooms complaining how painful it is to be eaten, trampling a poisonous mukhomor and then shoving their way into the mouths of two children with the cry \u201cAll right, kids, open up!\u201d Soviet labour unions sometimes rented out buses to send factory workers off for a day of mushroom picking as a kind of teambuilding exercise. But the quiet hunt is really about leaving everything behind \u2013 our troubles, our devices, and often our loved ones \u2013 and communing with forests of birch and pine until we emerge again, our burden a little lighter. Well, most of us emerge. Each year, dozens of Russians go missing and only stumble out weeks later in a kind of trance state. Others become so hopelessly lost that they are never found at all. \u2022 Andrew Roth in Moscow The langar in India Indians are born negotiators, and everything in Delhi has a price. But twice a day, tens of thousands of people file into the city\u2019s largest Sikh temple, take their place on their floor and eat a simple meal of vegetables, daal and roti \u2013 without paying anything. The langar, or communal kitchen, is a pillar of the Sikh religion. At the Bangla Sahib gurudwara in Delhi, an estimated 35,000 people are fed each day in a ritual symbolising the faith\u2019s commitment to equality and eradicating hunger. \u201cFor everyone who comes it is free of cost,\u201d says Harbhej Singh, who runs the langar. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t divide anyone by caste, creed or culture. It\u2019s for everyone.\u201d In a culture that has traditionally been riven by the caste system, an intricate south Asian social hierarchy whose rules include who can and cannot prepare food or eat together, the 500-year-old langar tradition is still a radical statement. \u201cThe main motive is to remove these class differences,\u201d Singh says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a foreigner, a minister, or anyone, they all sit together. A beggar might be sitting next to you, but you both eat.\u201d Preparing the meal involves thousands of volunteers as well as staggering quantities of food. On an average day, the kitchens prepare 450kg of lentils, 1,800kg of flour, 300kg or rice and 900kg of vegetables, most of it garnered through donations. And will the temple ever start charging? Singh is emphatic. \u201cIt will never happen.\u201d \u2022 Michael Safi in Delhi Public transport in Estonia When the initiative to make public transport free for residents in Estonia\u2019s capital Tallinn was introduced six years ago, it was seen as something of a throwback to the communist era. No matter. It\u2019s predictably popular. Across ages, genders, mother tongues and ideologies, free public transport has become something that residents expect and value. The scheme has encouraged people to sign on as residents of Tallinn with the city\u2019s population registry. This has increased the tax base and improved revenues. Proponents of free public transportation in Tallinn have pointed to gains in the city\u2019s income that far outweigh the loss of fares. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do without it,\u201d says Mari-Liis Kade, 20, a barista at the coffee chain Reval Caf\u00e9 in Tallinn\u2019s old town who commutes in from a suburb 10km away. \u201cYoung people generally don\u2019t earn much in Estonia by EU standards,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf you take home \u20ac300-\u20ac400 a month, which is common in the service industry, you can see why a free mode of transport is a great benefit.\u201d A ride on the bus or tram in Tallinn is \u20ac2 for non-residents. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just the money,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s as much about convenience. It\u2019s great to just jump on the 1A bus, ping my (Tallinn Transport) card and not have to worry about the fare. I definitely use the bus more because it is convenient in my community but also for getting to other places. Tourists think of Tallinn as just the Old Town and centre but it\u2019s actually quite a spread-out city.\u201d And is free public transport alleviating traffic snarls? \u201cWell, the people of Tallinn are addicted to driving. I don\u2019t know how much it has helped with that. But for those of us without cars, free public transportation is a godsend. It definitely encourages my friends and I to go into the city more often.\u201d \u2022 Michael Amundsen in Tallinn Open-air workouts in Senegal A hazy dusk descends on Dakar\u2019s coastal strip as hundreds of men and women work out, undeterred by the heady blend of harmattan dust and diesel fumes. Recently, China gave Senegal an improbable number of outdoor fitness machines \u2013 a vast row of glinting seafront metal. Surely there are not enough fitness freaks to necessitate even a quarter of the pull-up bars, pec decks and leg-swinging contraptions that interrupt the view? But by evening, they are full. Dakarois take fitness seriously. Packs of men jog up and down the city\u2019s chinks of beach, turning shoal-like every 50 metres to cover the same ground hundreds of times. Other groups do aerobics, play football or wrestle as the traffic splutters past. The most creativity is brought to bear on elaborate synchronised press-up routines: with legs crossed one way then the other, elbows in then splayed out, then holding each other\u2019s legs aloft. On a recent weekday evening on Yoff beach, a group did frog jumps en masse, first forwards, then back. Wrestling is equally popular, and you will often find a ring of spectators egging on two skimpily-dressed but deadly serious men circling each other before launching themselves at each other\u2019s waists. At Dakar\u2019s biggest and most prestigious gym, the Olympique Club, staff confide that some of the country\u2019s most famous wrestlers often come to work out \u2013 but add that they preen a little more than they train. Senegalese boys are as likely to tell you that they want to be wrestlers as footballers, which goes some way to explain the citywide pursuit of \u201cmusculation\u201d. Often sensible of gifts that are likely to be popular, China has cottoned onto that too \u2013 their donation of a large wrestling arena was inaugurated in Dakar last summer. \u2022 Ruth Maclean in Dakar Amber fishing in Germany Amber fishing is a popular pastime for visitors to the Baltic Sea coast. I\u2019ve been doing it in the islands off northern Germany with my children ever since they were babies. Requirements are: the immediate aftermath of good storm, coupled with an onshore wind, after which you should make your way to the beach in the early morning to beat the other \u201cBernstein Fischer\u201d (amber anglers). Take a scoop net \u2013 known as a kescher \u2013 to drag over the sea bed, and if you\u2019re really serious, a pair of waders, or waterproofs that reach as far as your oxters and enable you to walk through the breakers, and possibly even a rope fastened to the shore to stop you being swept out to sea. Still keen? The idea is that a storm loosens the amber nuggets \u2013 believed to be around 44m years old \u2013 from the sea bed, and once it\u2019s relatively calm again, the \u201cgolden tears of the Baltic\u201d, as they are typically referred to, are either to be found floating among the concentration of disturbed shells, seaweed and driftwood or, if you\u2019re lucky, washed up on the beach. The most likely time of the year is between November and March, when storms are most common. The sea must be cold. Patience and luck is required to find the best gems, and the most magical finds include pieces with insects encased in them, or the rarer green moss amber, and sometimes even blue chunks. But we have always been thrilled by the tiniest find \u2013 some little bigger than a pinhead. Other orangey-coloured stones on the beach can easily be mistaken for amber. But its lightness, hollowness and softness (tapping them against your teeth and biting into them helps to identify the real stuff) helps distinguish them from stones and pebbles. Polished them up is as easy as using a duster dipped in dry washing powder, and rubbing it over the nugget. Make a hole in it (local amber shops are usually happy to do this for a small fee), insert a thread, and you have the perfect unique holiday souvenir. \u2022 Kate Connolly in Berlin Visual treats in Tokyo Now that the dawn tuna auctions at Tsukiji fish market have moved to more clinical surroundings, arguably the best possible early start to a day in Tokyo is a visit to a sumo stable. Several heya allow visitors to sit in on training sessions, although reservations are recommended to guarantee getting close enough to take in the slapping of sweaty flesh and the sweet scent of the wrestlers\u2019 bintsuke hair oil. The Arashio stable has an English-language page on its website, but restricts visitors to watching the action through a window. Keirin is the best cycling sport you\u2019ve probably never heard of. The world\u2019s first keirin races were held in the southern Japanese city of Kokura (now Kitakyushu) more than seven decades ago, with betting receipts used to fund the country\u2019s postwar reconstruction. Its popularity among older men who enjoy a punt has saddled it with an image problem, but make no mistake, this is track cycling at its most brutal, with huge sums in prize money at stake for the best riders. Keirin tracks dot the suburbs of major cities, and admission is often free. Even when it isn\u2019t, it never costs more than 100 yen [74p] to pass through the turnstiles. And if the keirin gods are smiling, there is even the prospect of leaving the velodrome with a profit. Visitors arriving in Japan in the next few weeks will have to be incredibly unlucky not to catch a glimpse of the springtime sakura \u2013 or cherry blossoms \u2013 whose pale pink petals appear at different intervals the length of the archipelago. The blossoms\u2019 ubiquity means you are never far from a park or riverbank to indulge in a spot of hanami flower viewing and ponder the ephemeral nature of life as the petals float to the ground, not to be seen for another year. A Japanese picnic and a plentiful supply of beer and sake are optional, but recommended. \u2022 Justin McCurry in Tokyo Generous grannies in Spain They move with a stealth and speed that belies their years, materialising suddenly at pedestrian crossings, on cafe terraces and in tube carriages. They carry sweets, gooey compliments and, above all, centuries of accumulated wisdom and opinion. They are the grandmothers of Spain, and they are not shy. Undoubtedly the most assiduous worshippers of children in a country where kids possess semi-divine status no matter how infernal their true natures, the abuelas are always keen to talk, ruffle hair and magic up tissues for snotty young noses. Their chief function, however, is the imparting of parenting advice \u2013 whether solicited or not. God help the mother or father who dares to venture out without wrapping their offspring in at least two more layers than is strictly necessary. Being a guiri (foreigner) will not serve as mitigation. There is something wonderful about these daily displays of affection and about the way old and young communicate in Spain. To be a child here is to be seen, to be heard and to be engaged with. And, obviously, to be fussed over relentlessly. I sometimes wonder whether the children and the grannies don\u2019t share some secret signal long lost to the eyes and ears of the generation that sits between them. Perhaps it is something learned, forgotten and then rediscovered over the course of a life. Perhaps it\u2019s just the smell of sweets. \u2022 Sam Jones in Madrid The phallic shrine in Bangkok Shrines are scattered across Bangkok, dedicated to deities, gods, ghosts and spirits. In a city where the luxury mall is king, they serve as a spiritual counterbalance to the ever growing number of Louis Vuitton boutiques and on days when Bangkok feels overwhelmingly urban, I go and seek out some of the weirder and more wonderful ones. And the Chao Mae Tubtim shrine is certainly weird, and certainly wonderful. The modest shrine, tucked away in a park in the hectic centre of Bangkok, is dedicated to the Chinese fertility goddess Tubtim, and since 1920 has been where women hoping to conceive have come with a phallic offering \u2013 mostly in the form of a penis sculpture. It is a shrine dedicated to the power of the female and there is something both so endearing and so defiant about seeing the image of a goddess with hundreds of penises \u2013 big and small; hot pink, red, black, brown and ornately decorated; some piled up on a gold platter, laid out before her like a phallic congregation standing to attention. Another favourite is the shrine dedicated to Mae Nak, one of Thailand\u2019s most famous ghosts. As the myth goes, she was so in love with her husband that when she died in childbirth she returned to the world and pretended to him she was still alive \u2013 until unfortunately he noticed she could walk through solid objects. Then there is Trimurti shrine, known as the lovers\u2019 shrine and always strewn with red roses: a joy to encounter in the midst of a crowded, polluted Bangkok junction. In a city of chaos, the shrines offer a moment of stillness. And whether I\u2019m sitting in the company of a lovesick ghost or in a sea of phalluses, they offer a window into the spiritual side of Thai society that can otherwise be easy to miss. \u2022 Hannah Ellis-Petersen in Bangkok Festivals in France From summer outdoor cinema in deckchairs in northern Paris to December\u2019s monumental, nocturnal light creations in central Lyon, France has a vast array of free festivals all year long. The Atlantide international book festival held in the western city of Nantes in early spring each year \u2013 and currently run by the acclaimed Congolese novelist Alain Mabanckou \u2013 is among the best literary festivals in Europe, attracting top writers. And it doesn\u2019t cost a cent to attend. Local festivals such as the F\u00eates d\u2019Arvor in Vannes, southern Brittany, are about celebrating regional traditions and culture. Others such as the Techno Parade in Paris each September are more about hundreds of thousands of fans taking over the city centre in a giant, free street party. The Parc de la Villette in northern Paris stages a summer free open-air cinema where people can bring their own picnics and watch films from Yellow Submarine to La La Land. In October, Paris also stages its Nuit Blanche nocturnal art trail, where people roam the city into the early hours looking at art installations in buildings and courtyards that they might not otherwise have access to. Even France\u2019s more than 16,000 public libraries \u2013 over four times the number of libraries in the UK \u2013 regularly stage their own free events, such as the Paris libraries which decamp to parks on certain days in summer. Many of the most popular festivals are in smaller locations, like Saint-Louis on the Swiss border, well known for its free summer open-air music festival, Con\u00e7-Air. Lyon\u2019s December Festival of Lights \u2013 one of the region\u2019s key tourism events \u2013 sees top artists create giant, cutting-edge light projections and installations in the city centre. It is completely free. \u2022 Angelique Chrisafis in Paris What is your favourite freebie?

The positive trend has been identified in the latest assessment of world poverty collected by the UN Development Programme, which quantifies relative impoverishment across the globe by multiple factors. \u201cWe looked at data for a group of 10 middle- and low-income countries and we found encouraging news that the bottom 40% were moving faster than the rest,\u201d said Sabina Alkire, director at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, which drew up the report with UNDP. \u201cWithin these 10 countries, data show that 270 million people moved out of multidimensional poverty from one survey to the next.\u201d According to the report, the progress was largely driven by south Asia. In India there were 271 million fewer people in poverty in 2016 than in 2006, while in Bangladesh the number dropped by 19 million between 2004 and 2014. Figures for those living in the most extreme poverty, however, tend to be complex, representing a group who move in and out of the most deprived conditions. The new snapshot of global poverty identified 1.3 billion people across the globe that it categorised as \u201cmultidimensionally poor\u201d, with more than two-thirds of them \u2013 886 million \u2013 living in middle-income countries. revealing vast inequalities among countries and among the poor themselves. \u201cTo fight poverty, one needs to know where poor people live. They are not evenly spread across a country, not even within a household,\u201d said UNDP administrator Achim Steiner. The aim of the multidimensional poverty index, published by UNDP on Thursday, is to go beyond using income as the sole indicator for poverty by highlighting other ways in which people experience deprivation. Health, education and standard of living were among the areas investigated with the aim of identifying wide disparities in poverty, even within single households. In south Asia, said the report, almost a quarter of under-fives live in households where at least one child is malnourished and at least one child is not. \u201cWe need \u2013 even among those living in poverty \u2013 to understand people\u2019s different experiences of deprivation. Are they malnourished? Can they go to school? Only then will poverty reduction policies be both efficient and effective,\u201d said Pedro Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, director of the UNDP\u2019s human development report office. Results also showed that children suffer poverty more intensely than adults and are more likely to be deprived in all 10 of the study\u2019s indicators, lacking essentials such as clean water, sanitation, adequate nutrition or primary education. Even more staggeringly, one in three children worldwide was found to be multidimensionally poor, compared with one in six adults. That means that nearly half of the people living in multidimensional poverty \u2013 663 million \u2013 are children, with the youngest children bearing the greatest burden.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'You remember other ways to have fun': the loyalty card with free Nando's for recovering addicts", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/12/loyalty-card-nandos-recovering-addicts-capital-card", "date": "2019-07-12", "transcript": "Three years ago, Arjun Patel (not his real name) found it almost impossible to leave his room. Patel, in his 30s, was using drugs including sedatives and spice to help cope with severe mental health problems, and spent most of his days in a comatose state. \u201cPart of me was like, \u2018I\u2019m developing a serious addiction,\u2019 but the drug told me: \u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it,\u2019\u201d he remembers. When his mum caught him buying cannabis and realised he had a problem, she took him to the local drug and alcohol service in his area of London. Patel says: \u201cI was glad, because it meant I could finally deal with this.\u201d With a lot of help and determination, Patel stopped taking drugs, but would only leave the house to go to the service. He found himself very isolated. \u201cYou tend to see that in a lot of people, because many of their friends are using drugs and they have to cut them off,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce you get into that world, you think you might as well keep using.\u201d He wasn\u2019t working and didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so opportunities were limited. His situation dramatically changed when he was offered the chance to be part of a new loyalty scheme that rewarded him for attending recovery services. Patel was given a Capital card, which would allow him to accrue points for every session he attended. Once he had saved enough points, he could spend them at pop-up shops selling toiletries and clothes, the cinema, restaurants and more. Although he was sceptical at first, he now believes the card can change lives. He says: \u201cThese things allow you to have a bit of fun. It sparks something in your brain and you remember there are other ways to have fun. You start to develop an identity of being round people and that\u2019s a massive step.\u201d The Capital card was launched by the charity WDP in April 2017. It is now used in nine London boroughs and in Cheshire West and Chester. Since its launch, 5,400 service users have benefitted from the scheme. The charity has built relationships with 35 different organisations including Nando\u2019s, City Lit, MOD Pizza, Middlesex cricket club, local gyms and others, offering more than 50 different activities, services and products. More than 990,000 points have been earned \u2013 for every intervention you gain 10 points \u2013 and more than 155,000 points have been spent. Analysis carried out by London South Bank University has shown that the Capital card was associated with a 50% increased likelihood of service users successfully completing treatment. There is also a free Capital card app. According to Manish Nanda, joint chief executive officer at WDP, the card allows service users to enjoy things they may not have been able to previously and get out and about. He says: \u201cThat\u2019s the crux of the Capital card\u2013 to give people an opportunity to experience things we take for granted or they may have lost a connection with.\u201d Nanda came up with the idea nine years ago, when he was working at the WDP service in Hackney. Prisoners released from Pentonville used to come into the service on Friday when they were released. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the riskiest points in someone\u2019s treatment journey,\u201d says Nanda. \u201cIf, on the day of release, they\u2019re on an opiate prescription and they don\u2019t come into the service, there\u2019s a huge risk of potential overdose and death.\u201d It was a chance conversation with the local barber that sparked the idea of incentivising people to attend the service. While Nanda was talking about the challenges of his work, the barber asked if he could help. Nanda took up his offer and started telling prisoners due for release that if they came to the service on the day of release, they would get their repeat prescription, advice and support, as well as a free haircut. \u201cWe started getting more and more people coming in. That was the genesis of the card.\u201d Since then, the scheme has taken on a life of its own, although not without challenges along the way. Stigma still plays a huge part in getting partners on board. Holly Price, Capital card manager, says: \u201cAs soon as you mention it\u2019s for people with drugs and alcohol issues, people don\u2019t want to open their business up, though I do feel that\u2019s changing.\u201d It\u2019s also hard to get enough activities, services and products to meet every service user\u2019s needs, which is why there is now a dedicated member of staff approaching potential partners. The team, which now comprises four full-time staff as well as volunteers, are still developing the Capital card, and consult service users regularly to get feedback and suggestions. The team noticed that some people wouldn\u2019t spend their points, instead amassing as many as possible to show family and peers how well they were doing. The next update on the app will show how many points have been earned overall, as well your current balance and how many you\u2019ve spent. For people who don\u2019t feel ready to use their points to attend places like the gym or the cinema on their own, the charity now runs group outings. The aim is to support people using the five ways to wellbeing to meet all their needs and encourage them back into society, while the plan in the future is to provide employment opportunities. The card comes at a time when treatment budgets are being cut. Nanda says: \u201cThere\u2019s less resource to deliver these services. It\u2019s really troubling. In respect to austerity biting, the generosity [from people and businesses] is enabling us to think as creatively as we\u2019re able to and harness what\u2019s really good in a community.\u201d There are many who have benefitted. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve managed to get to a good point in the last year, it\u2019s still taken a long time to get my anxiety levels back to the point where I can do things like go on the train,\u201d says Patel. \u201cGoing to meals [at Nando\u2019s] was the first time I had been able to go out for a meal in public in a long time. It\u2019s been amazing in helping me personally.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt gives people hope. That\u2019s a big part of it.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The Syrian refugees changing the UK's food scene", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/12/the-syrian-refugees-changing-the-uks-food-scene", "date": "2019-07-12", "transcript": "When Mohamad Rahimeh arrived in the Calais refugee camp that was nicknamed \u201cthe Jungle\u201d, cooking was the last thing on his mind. He was a political scientist from Syria with a journey from hell behind him. Food was just a means to an end. But when a close friend fell sick, he rustled up a meal of eggs. A hidden talent was uncovered. \u201cHe loved my food and after he got better I made everyone a big feast from one pan, and everyone had my \u2018Jungle eggs\u2019 \u2013 people loved it,\u201d Rahimeh says. Rahimeh is one of almost 14,000 Syrian refugees who have arrived in the UK since 2015, and a growing number of chefs bringing Syrian cuisine to the country\u2019s food scene. His recipe, using simple ingredients such as tinned tomatoes that were donated to the camp by charities, is still a big hit three years later, served to customers at his popup Syrian brunch in Archway, north London. With the help of some Syrian friends and British volunteers that Rahimeh met in the now-cleared camp, he turned his culinary talents into a viable business by setting up Mo\u2019s Eggs. Customers sit at communal tables, taking it in turns to dip in to the colourful selection of homemade hummus dishes, while he wanders through the restaurant chatting about his recipes and his home country. \u201cThat\u2019s where the idea of Mo\u2019s Eggs came from \u2013 sharing food from one pan and giving people the love we had in \u2018the Jungle\u2019,\u201d Rahimeh says. Asylum Eggs have also been added to the menu since then \u2013 a new recipe that came to him during his stay in a detention centre while seeking asylum in the UK. \u201cWhenever I make something new I always try to have a story behind it.\u201d Rahimeh buys most of his ingredients from the market, having grown up in the mountain town of Ain al-Fijah surrounded by fresh fruit and vegetables. Research has shown that the majority of Syrian refugees in the UK are now in work or study, but unemployment rates remain high. A report from the University of Glasgow found that for 18- to 32-year-old Syrian refugees, 35% are studying and just over a quarter are in paid work. However, 19% are looking for work, almost five times the national unemployment rate of 3.9%. The report also found that many of the young Syrian refugees settled in the UK are highly qualified \u2013 a quarter have a university degree. But many are working in jobs they are overqualified for, and only 57% of those in professional or highly technical roles in their home country have found similar work in the UK. As more arrive, the popularity of Syrian food is on the rise, not only in London but in other areas that have large concentrations of immigrants and refugees. A number of restaurants and bakeries have popped up in Scotland, for instance, where nearly a fifth of Syrian refugees have settled since coming to the UK. Juliette Lyons, who met Rahimeh in the Calais refugee camp while working for an NGO and now helps run Mo\u2019s Eggs, said: \u201cFor a lot of customers who come, it\u2019s their first interaction with Syrian culture and it\u2019s opening people\u2019s eyes to a little part of Syria here that they hadn\u2019t ever been exposed to before. It\u2019s highlighting Syria in a completely positive light, rather than just in the context of war.\u201d While his popup continues, he hopes to set up shop permanently with a street food stall and add his specially made Syrian ice-cream to the menu. But not only has Rahimeh brought his Syrian cuisine to the UK, he\u2019s also been introduced to classic British food dishes too. \u201cThe first English dish I tried was roast potatoes, and I love them. It was Christmas time [when I first arrived in the UK] and everyone was making roast potatoes and roast chicken. It\u2019s my favourite.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

And what about diseases?\u201d It\u2019s nearly noon in Windhoek, Namibia\u2019s capital, and the market is preparing grilled meat \u2013 known locally as kapana \u2013 for the lunchtime rush. Everyone comes here, from construction workers to members of parliament. Namibians love to eat meat, and he is no exception: his tribe, the Herero, traditionally eat nothing else. But regulation is patchy and the meat being sold at this market could contain anything from antibiotics to parasites, Haakuria says. Diseases that pass from livestock to humans are rife in the country\u2019s rural north. Animals that die from unknown causes are eaten, no questions asked. Last year more than 50 people were hospitalised in north-western Namibia after contracting anthrax, a deadly disease that had probably entered a goat flock from infected wildlife. In those areas, people live cheek by jowl with their livestock, Haakuria says. \u201cYou go straight from the cattle kraal into the house, where babies crawl around on the floor.\u201d While most small-scale farmers are able to access basic veterinary drugs such as antibiotics and dewormers over the counter at agri-stores or human pharmacies, few are told how to administer them safely. That is why Haakuria has brought his second-year pharmacy students from the University of Namibia to this market: to teach them about the interface between human and animal health. He is the country\u2019s only specialist veterinary pharmacist. But not for long \u2013 or so he hopes. The University of Namibia teaches all its pharmacy students a bit of veterinary pharmacy. But starting next year, it will offer a postgraduate specialist course on the subject. It is only the second such course in the world. The first opened its doors at the UK\u2019s Harper Adams University a decade ago. \u201cPart of the training will be around animal health and husbandry,\u201d says Alison Pyatt, who runs Harper Adams\u2019s postgraduate course, and who is helping to set up its Namibian counterpart. Graduates from these courses do not replace vets, she explains. But they are able to go out into farming communities and advise people on how to keep their animals, and themselves, healthy. In Namibia, that means teaching people about naturally occurring diseases such as brucellosis, a bacterial infection passed from animals through milk, meat or even close contact, which can cause miscarriages in humans. Haakuria and Pyatt both believe pharmacists are ideally placed to supplement veterinary health services in rural areas. The medicines used to treat humans and animals are often the same, he says, and pharmacists are experts on how to give drugs safely and effectively. This is something vets don\u2019t always know how to do. And anyway, in northern Namibia vets are in short supply. But most towns have a pharmacist. Veterinary pharmacists would provide drugs, advice and information to rural communities, Haakuria explains. But they could also help curb drug resistance. Overuse of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics in agriculture is one of the main culprits driving the development of superbugs around the world. So if stores that dispense them in rural parts of the country are required to have specially trained staff, that would be a big step forward, he says. It doesn\u2019t have to stop with Namibia, he adds. \u201cIf it works here it needs only a little bit of tweaking to work in, say, Botswana.\u201d Speaking to the students, it seems at least some of them are keen to follow in Haakuria\u2019s footsteps. Nearly all of them grew up around animals and have seen the issues Haakuria describes with their own eyes. One of them, Venomuinjo Kasaona from Opuwo, a town near the border with Angola, remembers eating meat as a child from an animal that he realises now had probably died of foot and mouth disease. \u201cI realise I can help people back home,\u201d he says.

The researchers say the device is not only a source of green energy but also offers an alternative to current technologies for purifying water. These, they add, often consume large amounts of electricity and require infrastructure beyond the reach of many communities that lack basic access to safe drinking water \u2013 a situation thought to affect more than 780 million people worldwide. \u201cThese people spend a collective 200m hours a day fetching water from distant sources,\u201d said Prof Peng Wang, a co-author of the research from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. With solar farms often located in arid regions, the device could provide clean water where it is needed most. What is more, the team say it could be used in a backyard or on an industrial scale. \u201cHaving a significant amount of freshwater produced continuously on a daily basis [means] many challenging tasks can then be easily achievable,\u201d said Wang. \u201cThe generated clean water can be used [for] cleaning solar panels to remove dust particles; it can be use to irrigate plants and crops, making desert agriculture possible.\u201d Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Wang and colleagues reveal how they constructed the device. On the top is a horizontal commercial silicon solar cell and beneath this are several tiers through which saline, brackish or contaminated surface water is run. Waste heat from the solar cell warms the saline water passing immediately beneath it \u2013 the water evaporates, passes through a membrane and condenses to yield clean water, releasing heat in the process that warms the saline water in the tier below that \u2013 the process is then repeated for the next tier. The purified water flows out of the device and is collected. The team found the device can be used to purify saltwater as well as seawater contaminated with heavy metals, with the water collected containing levels of lead, copper, sodium, calcium and magnesium all below the levels deemed safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization. While the team outline various versions of the device, they reveal that under conditions on a par with a bright, cloudless day the energy efficiency of the solar cell was about 11% \u2013 a figure they say is on a par with what would be expected without the distillation section attached, and higher than previously reported by others working on such devices. The device was also able to produce clean water from seawater at a rate they say is higher than conventional solar stills. The device, while not the first to make use of solar distillation, has a particular advantage: by combining two types of device that typically each require a large land area, and mounting systems, the approach is relatively compact. Wang said the device turned the traditional link between water and electricity on its head: conventionally, electricity is produced by heating water to produce steam that is then used to turn turbines. While he said the team was still working on scaling up the device and reducing costs, they are optimistic. \u201cIt is our hope that we move quickly to push this technology towards its large-scale adoption,\u201d he said.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Real sole: recycling project providing shoes for India's children", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/05/real-sole-recycling-project-providing-shoes-for-indias-children", "date": "2019-07-05", "transcript": "In the vast Indian interior, it is not unusual to see shoeless infants \u2013 whether walking barefoot to school or hopping around on makeshift sports pitches. Injuries are common and lead to infections such as hookworm and elephantiasis. More than 250 million Indians live below the poverty line and footwear is usually a luxury. Tens of millions of children have no shoes. (By contrast, roughly 300m pairs of shoes are discarded in the US every year). Now, two young athletes in Mumbai have come together to convert old shoes into new footwear for unshod schoolchildren in small villages. Green Sole has teamed up with schools and colleges to distribute remade footwear across states such as Odisha, Assam, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. So far they have provided more than 150,000 pairs of flip-flops and slippers. \u201cWe have also started retailing our recycled footwear through stores and online portals,\u201d said one of the founders, Shriyans Bhandari. \u201cBesides making footwear and distributing it, we are very proud of having set up a skill centre in Jharkhand, to train tribal women in recycling footwear.\u201d The duo is working with large companies such as Adidas, Sketchers and H&amp;M to collect old shoes, and absorb the cost of converting them into new slippers for children. A donation of 200 rupees (\u00a32.30) is enough to recycle one shoe. Shriyans says that his \u201cambitious mission is now to make sure that every person in the country has a pair of shoes by 2023.\u201d The hope is that footwear will encourage school attendance. Some children initially did not wear the flip-flops, storing them safely in a cupboard because they were precious. But more typical is the story of one 14-year-old girl called Radha. Her daily walk to school was a 4km round trip. In the summer heat, it was sometimes impossible to walk barefoot and her schooling suffered. Her new shoes have improved her attendance. A proliferation of companies and social enterprises in India are working to repurpose and recycle old materials into new products and items of clothing, from Goonj, which revives garments and distributes to the needy, to HelpUsGreen which converts old flowers from temples and mosques into incense sticks, organic fertilisers and insulation. Code, started in 2016 by friends Vishal Kanet and Naman Gupta, is India\u2019s first cigarette waste management company, turning butts into manure, and stuffing for cushions and toys. Pune based Aarohana Ecosocial started by Nandan Bhat and Amita Deshpande, in 2015, is converting plastic waste into fabric and then making handbags, accessories and home d\u00e9cor from it, employing local tribal people. \u201cFor Indians recycling and upcycling are not new concepts,\u201d says Shriyans. \u201cGenerations of Indians have converted old saris and bed sheets into quilts and dresses, repaired old radios and transistors and reused oil cans as planters. But then consumerism took over and the old tenets were forgotten.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Natasha van Zyl, the Melbourne-based surgeon who leads a research programme that has given some people their lives back, said the patients were able to use their hands and extend their arms from the elbow. \u201cExtending your elbow allows you to push a wheelchair better, helps you to transfer in and out of a car, reach out and do something in space in front of you, shake someone\u2019s hand. \u201cIt allows you to reach above your head, which you need to be able to do because the world is designed for standing-up people. So you can switch a light off, you can get something off a shelf. Hand function is everything you use your hand for. You would just need to tape your hands up for five minutes to experience how frustrating life would be without your hands, without your fingers.\u201d The team at Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia, have been using combinations of tendon transfers, which result in greater strength for the muscle, and nerve transfers, which improve dexterity. Their findings from their work on 13 patients are reported reported in the Lancet medical journal. Van Zyl says she hopes they will encourage the thousands of people who become tetraplegic (also known as quadriplegic) by losing the function of all four limbs to seek surgery which could help them live more normal lives. Nerve transfers are not new, she says, but had not been successful in spinal cord injuries. Van Zyl had been using nerve transplants in brachial plexus injuries, where neck and shoulder nerves have been pulled out of the spinal cord, and wondered why they did not try them to restore function in patients who had been paralysed. In 2014, she and her team designed a triple nerve transplant. The first patient had \u201creally fabulous results from the surgery\u201d, she said. \u201cWord got out and we were fairly inundated with people wanting nerve transfers.\u201d They set up a structured project to track everything they did and all the outcomes, which has resulted in the Lancet paper. They recruited 16 young adult patients who had become tetraplegic after motor accidents, falls, sports or diving. Two of them did not continue with the programme and one died, unconnected to the surgery. Nerves were taken from shoulders and transplanted into paralysed muscles in the arm so that they bypassed the injury and connected back up to the spinal cord. Ten of the patients had nerve transfers to one arm and tendon transplants in the other. Four nerve transplants in three patients failed, but the team say tendon transplant is then available as a backup. Two years on from surgery, the patients have significant improvements in their hand function, particularly enough pinch and grasp strength to carry out most tasks of daily living. Van Zyl says she gets strength and inspiration from her patients. She tells of one who had been \u201ca very high-functioning individual. He was in a boating accident \u2013 he was thrown out of a boat. He was the CEO of three different companies he\u2019d set up and he was working seven days a week and he went from that to a head on a stick, as he described himself. \u201cHe told me, after he\u2019d had his surgery and had enough of a result from it, that he had decided that he would try this surgery but if it didn\u2019t work he was going to exit. He didn\u2019t want to live any more. His was a very high level of injury but he got enough out of what we did for him, which was a combination of tendon and nerve transfers, for him to start to work again at home, to be able to take a young family member out to the movies independently and handle the money, get the tickets, get the popcorn.\u201d One time Van Zyl video-called him and saw people milling about in the room. She asked if his carer could do something for her. \u201cHe said: \u2018That\u2019s not my carer \u2013 that\u2019s my assistant. I\u2019m working. These are people working for me.\u2019 \u201cIn his case it was life-saving, not just life-changing.\u201d She and her team have now done about 160 nerve transfers. Between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year have a spinal injury, more than half of whom become tetraplegic. There are surgeons who could help at least some of them, says Van Zyl. \u201cWe are all dedicated to this cause and absolutely love this work. All around the world there are surgeons \u2013 we all know each other \u2013 some of them waiting for patients, frustrated that they don\u2019t get enough.\u201d They cannot do anything for someone as badly paralysed as Christopher Reeve was, but they can help the most common spinal injuries that cause tetraplegia, called C5 and C6 \u2013 damage to the fifth and sixth cervical (neck) vertebrae. She hopes the published paper will encourage rehabilitation teams to suggest surgery and patients to seek it out. In a commentary published with the paper, Dr Ida Fox from Washington University in the USA writes: \u201cStem cells and neuroprostheses could change the landscape of regenerative medicine in the future. For now, nerve transfers are a cost-effective way to harness the body\u2019s innate capability to restore movement in a paralysed limb.\u201d Case study: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do it again\u2019 Paul Robinson, 34, from Australia\u2019s Gold Coast, said the surgery had been \u201clife-changing\u201d. Robinson fractured his C6 vertebra in a dirt bike accident in early 2015, a month before his 30th birthday. It left him a tetraplegic. He lost function in his hands, and was only able to manage a slight grip. Picking up objects like a cup to drink required squeezing two hands together. \u201cEven something light like an empty can would really be a struggle for me to grab with one hand because all I had was slight tenodesis grip, which is when you pull your wrist back and your fingers automatically close,\u201d Robinson said. After a few months in the spinal unit at Brisbane\u2019s Princess Alexandra hospital, one of his health workers mentioned the research being done by Dr Van Zyl into tendon and nerve transfers. In December 2015, he received a nerve and tendon transfer on his right side and nerve transfer on his left side. Recovering from the surgery was difficult, both physically and emotionally, because it erased progress he had made toward rehabilitation. But once he started rehab again, he forgot about the setback. \u201cYou spend so much time in rehab learning to do things with what you have got \u2026 and then all of a sudden you go almost back to the start,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I was four weeks [post surgery], not being able to move my arms, so it was back to \u2018Can someone give me a drink of water, can someone change the channel?\u2019 I was more or less bedridden for a while. \u201cIt was probably about six months and I started really noticing the results, and then after about eight months it was like: \u2018Oh wow, I didn\u2019t even notice I was doing that.\u2019 \u201cI was picking stuff up and I couldn\u2019t have done that previously. It is a slow healing process but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do it again if I was in the same position. The amount of difference it\u2019s made to my daily life makes that recovery beyond comparison.\u201d Robinson can now lift up to 9kg with his right hand and 4kg with his left. The restored grip function means he is able to live independently and has recently moved out of his parents\u2019 home. \u201cIt means I am able to pull apart and put my wheelchair in and out of the car, pick things up off the ground, hold a drink with one hand,\u201d he said. Using his wheelchair is also easier now he can rely on his increased strength to manoeuvre on uneven ground. He travels to Brisbane several times a week to play wheelchair rugby and regularly meets other people who have received similar injuries who might benefit from the same surgery. \u201cThere might be someone else out there who doesn\u2019t see that this is an option,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made such a big change to my life; hopefully it can help someone else too. It\u2019s really a life-changing thing.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The penny drops: at last a female urinal for the festival crowd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/the-penny-drops-at-last-a-female-urinal-for-the-festival-crowd", "date": "2019-07-04", "transcript": "It\u2019s the great injustice of festival life. While men don\u2019t have to think twice about it, for women the question of when and where to pee is always there. Do you brave a long queue and risk losing your friends, or are you drunk enough to relieve yourself in a more informal setting? Gina P\u00e9rier, a French architect living in Copenhagen, thinks she has the answer. In a boost for \u201cpee-quality\u201d, her company is rolling out Lapee, which she claims is the world\u2019s first industrially-produced female urinal, at this week\u2019s Roskilde festival in Denmark. \u201cWhen we were here on Saturday and Sunday, it was only used by girls and they were so happy,\u201d she said, as she inspected her 48 pink plastic spiral designs. \u201cWe were spammed by Instagram messages. They were all saying \u2018finally, something for us\u2019, because it\u2019s so degrading for women, the situation of urination.\u201d The concept is fairly simple. The Lapee takes the idea of a single moulded urinal unit with built-in storage tank and adapts it for women by extending the divider to screen the user off, lifting it up and raising the hole into which you pee to make it easy to hit. A spiral design assures privacy. P\u00e9rier, 25, founded the company last year with her Danish friend Alexander Egebjerg after both had worked for the festival as student architect volunteers. \u201cWe wanted to create the female version of a product which exists all over the world,\u201d she explained. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that complicated to make a urinal for women. I just think it was something which was designed by men and they only thought about themselves.\u201d With three women able to visit at a time and no door, they claim it takes just 30 seconds to spend a penny, compared to three minutes for a standard cabin toilet, making it six times more efficient. The platform where women stand or crouch is raised so that passers-by can\u2019t peer in and the user can look around. \u201cActually, it\u2019s not safer to have a door, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d P\u00e9rier said. \u201cWith Lapee, you are in a way better position to defend yourself than if you are locked in a cabin with someone.\u201d There was a mixed reaction from festival-goers, with some units overflowing and doubts over the lack of a door. \u201cYou need to be a little bit drunk to do it if you ask me,\u201d said Ida Blomberg, 18. But her friend Sol Grum, 19, approved. \u201cYou know, when you\u2019re drinking you have to pee all the time, and last year all the girls had to pee in front of everyone or wait for half an hour, so it\u2019s very nice,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso they are pink, so that\u2019s also a little bit cool.\u201d Lapee is not the first innovation in female urination. Travel devices include the Shewee, which has been around for two decades. P\u00e9rier believes Lapee has already reduced the noxious smells for which Roskilde is notorious. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a girl and you go to toilets at festivals they are usually covered in shit, so to have a place where you know it\u2019s only going to be pee sounds like the most luxurious thing in the world.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to problems.

Heads nod amid whoops of approval and excitement at what this talent could bring to England\u2019s cricket team. Not the bunch currently scrapping in the World Cup, or the team that will face Australia later this summer, but the gaggle of richly talented amateurs united by two powerful things they have in common: sport and disability. \u201cOur most improved player over the last couple of years,\u201d says Liam Thomas, the vice-captain of England\u2019s physical disability side, of the ball hitter, Matt Askin. Ditching his prosthetic arm has liberated Askin. He now flourishes his bat like a cheerleader\u2019s baton, larruping the ball further and faster than ever. \u201cHitting sixes with one hand, eh?\u201d adds Thomas. \u201cAmazing.\u201d Teachers, tilers, students, water workers and biscuit exporters by day, the men gathered here for a weekend training session are the elite among 60,000 people with disabilities playing cricket at one level or another. There is a burgeoning range of sports for people with disabilities: the Paralympics is just the tip of the iceberg. From football \u2013 there are varieties for both frames and powerchairs \u2013 to wheelchair rugby, or blind and visually impaired tennis, disability sport is enjoying something of a boom. There is even table cricket: a specially adapted version of the game requiring no little skill, the national title of which was contested by more than 300 schools. Roughly one in five people in the UK report a disability and, according to a Sport England study in 2015-16, those who do are more than twice as likely to be physically inactive. \u201cA 26-year-old lad got in touch,\u201d said Neil Bradshaw, the operations manager for England disability cricket. \u201cHe was injured in service, is registered disabled and used to play for the army cricket team. He\u2019s not been confident enough to reach out previously. He\u2019s coming for a trial in August.\u201d At the training session at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, everyone has a backstory \u2013 teenage bone cancer, amputation, club feet, missing limbs \u2013 but sympathy is neither sought nor required. Respect and a stage to perform on: that\u2019ll do. That\u2019s why they\u2019re here. That and the chance to inspire the next generation to get involved. Joining the physically disabled elite at the weekend training camp are their counterparts from England\u2019s deaf squad. This innovative joint residential jaunt has been designed to bring together four sides \u2013 those with physical disability (PD), deafness, learning disability and visual impairment \u2013 under the overall disability umbrella. Sizing each other up in open-net sessions lends proceedings a keen edge on the cusp of a pivotal season, for the PD group in particular. Later this summer, England stages the first physical disability world cricket series, duking it out with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe across nine days of T20 action in the West Midlands. The hope is that exposure, and the seeing-is-believing nature of disability cricket, will help achieve what the likes of Anya Shrubsole and Steph Houghton have done for women\u2019s sport. There are, as yet unconfirmed, plans to stream the games live. Millions would watch on the subcontinent. India\u2019s involvement, backed by the all-powerful cricket authorities there, could be a gamechanger. \u201cThe number of blind cricketers alone in India would drown the number of visually impaired athletes in Paralympic programmes across the world,\u201d says Ian Martin, the head of disability cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board. \u201cAnd I think people often miss cricket\u2019s appeal to people with all disabilities \u2013 we aim to include, not exclude. At grassroots level, we can be proud to say we welcome anyone.\u201d Martin appreciates the game\u2019s potential reach so keenly because the story is also autobiographical. A lifelong and passionate club cricketer diagnosed with the muscle- and nerve-wasting condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, he has singlemindedly pushed the disabled game forward over the past decade. \u201cWhen I pull on my suit and look at the three lions on it, I\u2019m able to think back to the dreams that I had as a kid about representing England at cricket and realise that I\u2019ve achieved the dream and then some, just not in the way that I planned.\u201d This summer is a watershed for Martin and Bradshaw, both backroom veterans. Martin brokered the first PD international, between England and Pakistan in 2012. Bradshaw, who knits logistics together across the board, finally gave up his Matalan warehouse shift manager\u2019s gig to go full-time last year. His initial involvement, a decade back in Cheshire, was done as a favour. \u201cI got into it simply because I fancied a pint at a cricket club,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI saw 10-12 disabled kids running their own warm-up, so just started helping out.\u201d Martin and Bradshaw are a tight partnership despite a bitter footballing rivalry (one is Everton, the other Liverpool). They have hundreds of shared miles under their belts building patiently for this moment. As Bradshaw sees it, fate just dealt these cricketers a different path: his remit is to push the envelope in search of validity. \u201cThat\u2019s where our frustration lies,\u201d he says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sympathy setup because these lads can\u2019t get access to their cricket anywhere else. The standard\u2019s really high. \u201cIt\u2019s educating people \u2013 getting away from the \u2018oh, bless them, isn\u2019t that nice?\u2019 attitude. People don\u2019t understand the game until they\u2019ve seen the game.\u201d Watching the training underscores his point: there is serious ability here, as evidenced when left-hander Thomas nails a succession of sweet shots against a bowling machine, deploying immaculate footwork. (His right leg ends just below the knee.) The coaching staff comprises ex-England Test cricketers Ian Salisbury and James Kirtley. The performance analyst, Chris Highton, is on hand to crunch the numbers and go through footage. Muscles and tweaks are tended by Scott Gormley and Richard Olejar, the latter physio a quietly spoken Slovakian taekwondo international known as \u201cthe assassin\u201d for reasons that later become clear. After a couple of hours power-hitting in front of the bowling machines, there is a performance analysis seminar with Highton, who urges the players to embrace the data and make it work for them. \u201cIt\u2019s about making strengths super-strengths and weaknesses strengths,\u201d he says. Then it\u2019s down to the nitty gritty: batters v bowlers in a series of T20 scenarios. Fielding and catching drills complete the afternoon\u2019s work.\u201d The competitive instinct kicks in when the different teams come together to test out their skills. There is an eye-catching exchange when deaf fast bowler George Greenway, capable of whistling it down at almost 80mph, takes on Liam O\u2019Brien, who is not given to taking backward steps. \u201cMake sure you say he didn\u2019t get me out,\u201d he says of the tussle. He\u2019s only half joking. Honesty, friendship and integrity, winning on and off the pitch: these are constantly recurring themes across the weekend. Saturday evening is spent at the campus bar enjoying a couple of well-earned drinks, during which the squads start to mingle. Salisbury doesn\u2019t bang the drum about curfews. He doesn\u2019t have to: several of the players retreat to their digs before last orders. Sunday morning brings the opportunity to discover first-hand why Olejar has his nickname. Breakfast is at 7.45am. At 9am sharp, both squads \u2013 and, at Salisbury\u2019s insistence, your 50-year-old correspondent \u2013 warm up with Olejar. For 45 minutes, we are put through a series of hops and/or leaps up one, two, and then three steps. The theme to Rocky blares out as we pound the concrete. Then it\u2019s rigorous stretching inside before getting down to work again. By about 4pm we are done. Everyone goes their separate ways, back to the day jobs. There is a wistful, end-of-school-term air as the players drift off. Liam O\u2019Brien and spinner Fred Bridges plot their podcast listening on the journey back to Sussex. Dan Hamm, joker in the pack, alights upon Askin\u2019s discarded prosthesis. \u201cLook!\u201d he says, waving it like a triumphant detective cracking a case, \u201cwe\u2019ve found this \u2013 which must mean\u2026 there\u2019s a body somewhere!\u201d Askin, clearly familiar with this sketch, smiles and shrugs his shoulders. I mention that time has raced by: 48 hours gone in five minutes. \u201cYeah,\u201d Askin concurs, smiling broadly. \u201cI never want to go home.\u201d \u2022 A version of this article appeared in Wisden cricket monthly", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Your 50-year news report: humanity is actually in good shape", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/28/your-50-year-news-report-humanity-is-actually-in-good-shape", "date": "2019-06-28", "transcript": "If we only produced a newspaper every 50 years what would we put in it? Well, despite today\u2019s mood of crisis, pessimism, alarm and antagonism, the semicentennial 2019 edition would probably be pretty upbeat. In the 50 years since we landed on the moon (and since I was born) progress down here on Earth has been stellar. We\u2019ve made remarkable advances in tackling poverty and child mortality, as the world\u2019s economy has grown more than thirtyfold since the giant leap for mankind. When it comes to public health, we\u2019ve either eradicated (smallpox) or driven back (guinea worm, polio, malaria, sleeping sickness) a whole textbook of diseases, and fought back strongly against some of the most deadliest of all, including HIV and cancer. (This week, Sarah Boseley discovered great hope for the battle against cervical cancer). We have more people in work than ever \u2013 and despite current pangs, democracy is still winning as a numbers game, with more people voting in elections in 2019 than at any point in history. And while we\u2019re comparing 2019 with 1969, the festival scene has come a long way since Woodstock, and is now probably greener than ever. Of course there are challenges. There always have been. Humanity has doubled in number since 1969 (when I was born there were 3.528 billion people alive \u2013 check your number here.) We are overusing resources, leading to big environmental and biodiversity crises. Yet since 1969 we have learned to harness energy from sun, moon and wind. (This week, Oliver Milman reported that the US generated more electricity from renewables than from coal for the first time). We are an ageing species \u2013 more than 1 billion of us are over 60. But we are ingenious too, for ever thinking up new ways to face down this challenge. Of course, there\u2019s still Trump, Brexit, Iran, Johnson, Hong Kong, Putin, austerity. But will we still be writing about them in 50 years\u2019 time? Lucky numbers Still playing with the rather arbitrary 50-year theme, air pollution may be a serious health hazard in parts of the world today, but in many places it\u2019s actually better than it was. In the UK, you\u2019re far less likely to die because of nasty stuff in the air than you were in 1970. What we liked The family spending a year volunteering in Europe, as reported by our friends at Positive News. Also this piece examining how the green new deal might change the US\u2019s built space. What we heard Mary Bomford wrote to us on the theme of waste and recycling: Lots of bad news about how recycling goes nowhere. Check out how it is done in Canada in the province of British Columbia. Alan Robertshaw, meanwhile, sees potential for an ancient technology to make a big comeback: I would like to suggest a subject ie the reintroduction of sail into commercial shipping. The latter is currently a large contributor to the climate emergency as well as being a serious polluter of the oceans, issues which need to be addressed. Whilst initially a return to sail may seem retrograde and old school, this is not actually the case. We\u2019ve had a go at this subject before, but perhaps it is worth a second look. Future sailors indeed. Where was the Upside? In Catania, where Lorenzo Tondo showed us that refugees are far more than just uprooted unfortunates. Did you get to the bottom? Well done!

Duvi Leineberg, a remote care nurse, is doing the lunch rounds. But instead of jumping in a car and visiting each person one by one, she is sitting in an office looking at a large computer screen where she can see into seven people\u2019s homes. Most are sitting at a table preparing to tuck into some food. This is a virtual lunch group, set up to make sure older people receiving home care services in the city eat regularly and at the right time. Leineberg runs the session. She starts by checking everyone has their food and that it is warmed up. Some have soup, others have pre-prepared meals that have been delivered by home care services. People also sip coffee. One screen shows an empty backdrop and she calls the home to check her client is all right. He walks past the screen but says he isn\u2019t hungry and doesn\u2019t want to eat right now. Leineberg then asks everyone if they have any plans for the afternoon. A few reply that they will go out for a walk. A former hospital nurse, Leineberg sees the value of such groups. \u201cFirstly, the client feels like they are a part of a bigger thing. It\u2019s also guaranteed that they eat properly. If I spot anything that seems out of the ordinary, I can call the home care nurses who will pay them a visit if necessary.\u201d Her clients are also fans of the lunch group. Riitta Koskinen, 80, says through a translator: \u201cI\u2019m old and living alone and it\u2019s nice to have the company. We eat at the same time \u2013 food tastes better when you\u2019re with others \u2013 and I\u2019ve really enjoyed it. It makes me eat and it\u2019s good to see other people.\u201d Finland has a rapidly ageing population and recruitment problems in health and care. By 2070, one in three Finns is expected to be over 65. At the same time there has been a huge decline in the birth rate and the number of Finns of working age is expected to fall by around 200,000 by 2050. As a result, the demand for and cost of care services are growing while tax revenues are decreasing, leading politicians to warn that the Nordic model of highly state-funded cradle-to-grave social care will no longer be affordable. Taina Mantyranta, a medical counsellor at the Finnish ministry of social affairs and health, admits: \u201cFinland is facing economic constraints. We have been trying to reform our social and healthcare system for several decades. The need to develop more integrated social and health services has been clearly recognised also from a cost containment perspective. ICT and digitalisation are integral parts of the reform.\u201d The virtual lunch group is one aspect of Helsinki\u2019s remote care \u2013 where clients have a tablet that links up with remote care nurses in a service centre. Remote care appointments are set up to check on clients throughout the day and to make sure they take the relevant medication. There are 800 home care clients, and nurses carry out 24,000 remote care visits a month. By the end of 2019, the service hopes to cater for 1,100 clients. The potential savings are eye-watering. Whereas a physical home visit costs the equivalent of around \u00a340, a remote care visit is just \u00a34.50. Over the course of one shift, a remote care nurse can carry out over 50 visits \u2013 which works out almost 90% cheaper than if they had knocked on each of their client\u2019s doors. Little wonder that the city\u2019s service centre is hoping to start a remote dinner group soon as well as other sessions. They already take clients virtually to concerts and shows. Hanna H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, who works as a planner at the service, remembers when she took 64 clients virtually to a carol concert. A screen was placed on the front row and the priest greeted them while they watched at home on their tablets. She remembers: \u201cThe funny thing is that even if some had memory problems, they knew all the lyrics. That is the power of music and made me see that if there\u2019s a concert, we should be there.\u201d Neighbouring city Espoo is also exploring remote care. By 2027, 8% of its population will be over 75. Roope Lepp\u00e4nen, medical director of Espoo hospital, admits that there aren\u2019t the resources to deal with the increase. \u201cWe see remote care as a possibility. We are only starting but will expand these services quite rapidly in the coming years,\u201d he says. However, he maintains that remote care will never fully replace physical care but that, with advancing technology and future generations that are used to digital life, it will become more and more important. But he doesn\u2019t expect it to totally replace physical care services. \u201cPeople will need physical visits as well. It\u2019s my belief that [remote care] can\u2019t completely replace that, but tech will make [things] even easier in 10 years time.\u201d Both the staff and patients I meet seem to like it. Tiina Kosonen, a remote care nurse, says she is able to build close relationships with her clients. \u201cI like it and the patients get a lot from it. It\u2019s really intensive this contact. We look into each other\u2019s eyes and talk together face to face.\u201d One of her clients, 86-year-old Raimo Uimonen, who has epilepsy and lives alone says: \u201cI get a feeling of security from this service. I also like to talk. This video contact is really important as I get this face-to-face contact and the opportunity to discuss things.\u201d Lepp\u00e4nen adds: \u201cI\u2019ve been on home care visits. You come into a person\u2019s house, take your coat off and sort of intrude. Of course there are some instances where you need to be there, but if we can increase contact with the patient [surely that\u2019s a good thing]?\u201d So could this type of service take off in the UK, where the number of people aged 65 and over is set to increase by more than 40% over the next 20 years? Claire Turner, director of evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better, believes so. \u201cIf you can remotely check in on somebody, see how they are, remind them of medication, that feels like a good and practical solution [as it] enables more time for home visits for people who need physical support,\u201d she says. She adds: \u201cSocial contact is the stuff of life. That\u2019s what is important to us as human beings and it doesn\u2019t change as we get older. If part of the goal of this is to encourage people to have more contact with others who share interests or values, than that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Sarah Johnson\u2019s visit to Helsinki was supported by Business Finland", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Refugees Got Talent: UN-backed show aims to change perceptions", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/refugees-got-talent-un-backed-event-challenges-perceptions", "date": "2019-06-23", "transcript": "A teenage poet from Nigeria, a reggae singer from Sierra Leona and a Colombian dancer were among those competing in Sicily this weekend in a UN-backed talent show aimed at reshaping the narrative around migrants. Refugees Got Talent, the first event of its kind to be held on an international level, featured dozens of people seeking shelter from war-torn countries, as well as victims of human trafficking. This weekend, 13 finalists showed off their skills in Catania, performing songs, music, art and theatre in front of a judging panel that included the British actor Douglas Booth. \u201cThis is more than just a talent show,\u201d said Marco Rotunno, a press officer in Sicily for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), which supported the event alongside 20 other aid groups. \u201cThe things we need to thrive in life \u2013 confidence, pride, friends, community and hope \u2013 are all experienced by the contestants and all those involved.\u201d The winner was an 18-year-old Nigerian poet, Hannah Imordi, who read a work titled The Journey, dedicated to those who doubt refugees have justified reasons for leaving their home countries. \u201cI am so happy\u201d, she said. \u201cMaking it to the finals was not as important to me as having the opportunity to state in poetry that millions of people are forced to leave their countries because of war, poverty or religion. We need to help these people attain their dreams or simply reach a happy ending in their lives. We need to embrace them, not cast them away. Before we change the world, we should begin to change ourselves.\u201d Her poem included the lines: \u201cIn this different city, I look for protection. In this different world, I look for acceptance. In this different culture, am trying to adapt to, I seek help. What does tomorrow holds for me?\u201d Among the finalists were a 23-year-old reggae singer from Sierra Leone, whose stage name is Mr 705 and who arrived in Sicily from Libya, and a 37-year-old professional dancer from Colombia, Darwin Medrano, who is one of Colombia\u2019s 8 million displaced people. \u201cSeeing the talent here is a powerful reminder that refugees are people like all others \u2013 unique and talented with a lot to offer the world,\u201d Rotunno said. All of the performing artists have lived through traumatic experiences. Many of them arrived in Italy as minors via Libya, where they suffered torture, abuse and violence. Others are victims of human trafficking, lured into leaving their homes with the promise of dignified work and then forced into prostitution or slavery. \u201cAll of them have experienced terrible trauma,\u201d said Rotunno. \u201cBut we wanted to avoid dwelling on that for this event. This is precisely the point of this contest: to show that refugees, despite their dramatic stories, are men and women like the rest of us, each one with a talent that can enrich our world. \u201cArt and music helps all humans express themselves all over the world. For refugees \u2013 who have lost so much \u2013 it\u2019s no different. The opportunity to sing, dance and perform can be a welcome escape from reality and help confront difficult emotions.\u201d Francesco Patan\u00e8, the event\u2019s artistic director, said: \u201cWe wanted to show that migrants and refugees are skilled and talented people who are contributing to make our countries a better place as much as the Italians did or still do when they moved to other countries.\u201d From dance parties to food festivals and urban hikes, millions of people around the world have taken part in events over the weekend to celebrate Thursday\u2019s World Refugee Day, at a time when record numbers of children, women and men have been uprooted by war and persecution. This week, the UNHCR published its annual global trends report, which showed the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide had risen to more than 70 million by the end of 2018, the highest in the organisation\u2019s history. In a video address, the UN refugee chief, Filippo Grandi, said restrictions introduced by some countries had limited access to asylum and hindered efforts to rescue drowning refugees. The Italian and Maltese governments have closed seaports to NGO rescue vessels. According to data from the UN and the International Organization for Migration, about 3,200 people have reached Italy and Malta from north Africa since the beginning of 2019, and almost 350 have died en route.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Why not scrap GDP and replace it with trees?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/why-not-scrap-gdp-replace-with-trees-upside-weekly", "date": "2019-06-21", "transcript": "In May we asked you: what are the alternatives to endless economic growth? Dozens of you got in touch with tips and suggestions. And so we persuaded the Guardian economics correspondent Richard Partington to try to make sense of it all by taking a good hard look at GDP and the alternatives. His conclusion: GDP is an anachronism, but it\u2019ll take a major systemic upheaval to shift over to a more nuanced measure of progress. Coincidentally, the alternatives to GDP were also the subject of the latest Reasons to be Cheerful podcast by Ed Miliband and Geoff Lloyd. Perhaps a better metric would be the number of trees planted annually. It\u2019s a figure in the billions, as Patrick Barkham discovered, and a number that is also growing strongly. Will it be enough? After all, trees are not just good for the environment, they are good for mental health too, as Harriet Sherwood learned. Lucky numbers Alcohol sales in Scotland have fallen to their lowest level in 25 years. Alcohol-free beers are among the fastest-growing beverages in Germany. Among the world\u2019s poorest communities, more than 2 billion people gained access to a decent toilet in the first two decades of this century. And among the richest, Americans gave almost half a trillion dollars to charity in 2018.

We also loved this Atlantic article on how to deal with life after you\u2019ve peaked professionally, particularly because it includes the great quote: \u201cUnhappy is he who depends on success to be happy.\u201d What we heard Kostas Karoubas emailed in from Greece to share his experience with reforesting in arid terrains. Reforestation in tropical climates is \u201ceasy\u201d (relatively)! Planting and rehabilitating arid zones becomes more difficult. Here is my experience over the last 16 years, and I hope it will be helpful. Aminul Hoque Chowdhury got in touch from Bangladesh. We are the Green Ukhiya Star Team, a team of volunteers gathered as part of relief operations during the Rohingya influx in Cox\u2019s Bazar. To compensate the great disaster and protect the environment we are planting 1 million trees.

It was, she says, a sign. Humanity is nearing a precipice. Trees can stop us going over the edge. This calling was so strong that Dubois, a business life coach, founded TreeSisters with a friend, Bernadette Ryder, to take on a daunting mission: to reforest the tropics within a decade. In 2014, their new charity funded its first 12,000 trees by encouraging western women to make small monthly donations to reforestation projects in the tropics. Today TreeSisters is planting 2.2m trees (average cost: 33p a tree) each year across Madagascar, India, Kenya, Nepal, Brazil and Cameroon. \u201cWe have to make it as natural to give back to nature as it is to take nature for granted,\u201d Dubois says, musing on the need to \u201cshift from a consumer species to a restorer species\u201d. She is not alone. The global elite is embracing tree-hugging rhetoric. It is as if the world has suddenly woken up to the restorative powers of plants. Forests can stop runaway global heating, encourage rainfall, guarantee clean water, reduce air pollution, and provide livelihoods for local people and reserves for rare wildlife. Politicians are waking up to the potential of \u201cnatural climate solutions\u201d \u2013 reforestation and other ecological restoration \u2013 to capture carbon and tackle the climate crisis. Such solutions could provide 37% of the greenhouse gas mitigation required to provide a good chance of stabilising global heating below the critical 2C threshold. In March the United Nations announced a Decade of Ecosystem Restoration and has set a target to restore 350m hectares \u2013 an area bigger than India \u2013 by 2030. India itself has pledged to plant 13m hectares of forest by 2020, Latin America is aiming at 20m hectares and African countries 100m hectares by 2030. China\u2019s aspiration is to plant an area of forest as large as Ireland every year. Trees are increasingly hailed as a solution for climate-stressed cities too, preventing overheating and reducing air pollution. In England, more than 130,000 trees are to be planted in towns and cities over the next two years. But it isn\u2019t as simple as just grabbing seeds and saplings and sticking them in the ground. Non-native plantations can cause problems for biodiversity, local livelihoods \u2013 or both. Grand pledges aren\u2019t always met. Dubois is only \u201cvaguely heartened\u201d by the new mood. She points out that a 2014 UN declaration pledged to halve deforestation by 2020. Instead, record deforestation ensued and in 2018 an area of primary forest the size of Belgium was lost, the third-highest annual depletion since records began in 2001. Technology \u2013 such as tree-planting by drone \u2013 is often hailed as a game changer, but it can be hit-and-miss. \u201cEverybody thinks that smarter technology is going to save us,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cA significant amount of the materials required to be mined for that smarter technology are under the last remaining old-growth forests.\u201d TreeSisters refuses to use drones, \u201cbecause we\u2019re all about the relationship between people and trees\u201d, says Dubois. \u201cIt\u2019s the disconnect between people and trees that drives deforestation. We need people connected with forests.\u201d TreeSisters\u2019 philosophy is different: local, community-based reforestation with native trees in the tropics. \u201cThe tropical forest belt provides cooling and rainfall,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the delivery system for a habitable climate for all of us.\u201d In Madagascar, the charity is helping Eden Reforestation Projects replant lost mangrove and dry deciduous forests on the north-west coast. Mangroves are a wonder-tree for local and global ecosystem services; they protect human communities from coastal floods but also filterriver flows out to sea and prevent soil washing into the ocean and destroying coral reefs. They are also crucial nurseries for juvenile fish. Most importantly, perhaps, studies suggest they can sequester four times more carbon than rainforest. Between 2000 and 2015, the equivalent of Brazil\u2019s annual carbon emissions was released by the destruction of mangrove forests. Eden employs local people to gather and plant mature propagules from mangroves. These seedlings usually fall from the tree and stick straight in the mud or float away until they reach another shore and grow. The mangrove-planters also clear debris from the forest because logs and debris shifted by the currents can destroy seedlings. (The debris is piled in particular spots so it creates wildlife habitat.) At most planting sites, the two-week tide cycle contains a six-day window when planters can canoe into the mangroves, plant propagules and catch the outgoing tide before they get stranded on the mudflats at low tide. \u201cOur goal is twofold: reforestation and poverty alleviation,\u201d says Jamie Shattenberg, international director of Eden Reforestation Projects, Madagascar. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do reforestation and you ignore the human issue \u2013 poverty \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to find success, because the forest is what people turn to last if they have no other sustainable livelihood.\u201d In the project\u2019s first year, eight people planted 100,000 mangroves. Now Eden employs more than 1,000 people to plant trees, with 225m new mangrove trees planted since 2006. Some Malagasy planters were enslaved to local fish barons because they owed money for using their fishing equipment; tree-planting income has enabled them to repay their debts and escape this bondage. Restoring coastal mangroves is not simple. Eden plants mainly on government and community land along the coast, with the support of local villages. Most mangrove is no-man\u2019s land but people still claim rights to establish shrimp farms or raid forests for timber for building and charcoal. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s really now destroying them is charcoal,\u201d says Shattenberg. \u201cOnce a mangrove forest is cut down it takes generations to refill, the mud starts eroding and kills the reef and a negative cycle starts. We\u2019ve had areas tree-poached, and we\u2019ve put guards in. Charcoal is a constant problem, and you can\u2019t change it overnight because so much of Madagascar relies on charcoal for their cooking. It\u2019s like telling England and France \u2018no more gas\u2019. You have to find a different source of fuel and make it affordable.\u201d Then there is a \u201ccharcoal mafia\u201d: \u201cYou get in the way of charcoal directly and you\u2019re in the way of people\u2019s money and people don\u2019t like that.\u201d Shattenberg is optimistic, however, about visible changes to the environment \u2013 and consciousness. \u201cMassive areas are starting to come back and the Malagasy are seeing changes in the fish, crab and wildlife populations. We\u2019re seeing a change in how people feel about the forest. They recognise they can protect it. It\u2019s for Madagascar, for the Malagasy people and it\u2019s for the future of our world.\u201d A similar emphasis on reforestation for local people is driving the restoration of deforested Mount Kenya. TreeSisters is working with the International Tree Foundation (ITF), a charity founded in 1924 by a visionary forester in colonial Kenya called Richard St Barbe Baker. The charity was originally called Men of the Trees. Now it is supporting reforestation led by local women. \u201cOne of the very clear learnings we\u2019ve had is that the more you can work with local organisations that are women-led or driven by women, the better your results,\u201d says Paul Laird, programmes manager at the ITF. \u201cIt is the women\u2019s groups that really drive and motivate, and men are often pleased to have women running it.\u201d Kenya is water-stressed, and dependent on seasonal rains for its water supply. Forest cover can influence rainfall and local humidity and temperature, as well as filter water. The country\u2019s current forest cover is a meagre 7% at best; Kenya\u2019s constitution commits to increasing it to 10%. Kenya has also signed the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) commitment to restore 5.1m hectares of degraded land in Kenya. But such targets are not yet creating much traction on the ground, according to Laird. Below Mount Kenya is a circle of humid montane forest. Google Earth reveals it is decidedly patchy. \u201cWhat happened to the forest? The 20th century happened to the forest,\u201d says Laird. The colonial regime harvested native forest and replaced it with eucalyptus and pine plantations \u2013 non-native monocultures that are \u201ca killer in terms of biodiversity\u201d, according to Laird. After independence, commercial gangs took timber and both rich and poor turned forest into farmland. The ITF is supporting local charities such as Mount Kenya Environmental Conservation to work with local women to establish small nurseries of native trees at the forest fringe. The sales of these tree seedlings provide the groups with an income, which is then distributed as loans to help women\u2019s farms and businesses. Native trees are planted directly into deforested areas, while a new scheme enables local people to temporarily grow potatoes in reforested areas, the cultivation helping native trees grow free of weeds for their first few years. The women also grow high-value grafted trees such as avocado and macadamia nut on their own burgeoning agro-forestry farms. \u201cWomen are the primary caretakers of the household and know their reliance on a healthy forest,\u201d says the Nairobi-based Teresa Gitonga of the ITF. \u201cThey are the people who look for firewood, they are the people who cook so they also look for water. Women are change agents. The only thing they need is to unlock their potential and know that planting trees will make their lives better.\u201d According to Anastacia Njoki, a member of a tree-planting group close to Mount Kenya, she and her fellow agro-foresters share experiences, as well as sing together. \u201cWe are doing it because we are the ones who have to collect the firewood. Instead of cutting a large tree, we are collecting dead wood,\u201d she says. But she recognises the wider benefits of trees to the region and Kenya itself. \u201cThe trees that we are planting are indigenous and we as a community are benefiting in one way or another to conserve our ecosystem and maintain the areas where our water is coming from,\u201d she says. Mount Kenya\u2019s forests, she says, make it their \u201cwater tower\u201d. In western countries, TreeSisters continues to raise awareness of a feminine way of responding to ecological crises and climate change, and the need to balance consumption with restoration. Dubois wants to embed restoration into every financial transaction: in other words, everything we buy must also include \u201ca kickback to nature\u201d. \u201cExtinction Rebellion has blasted through collective denial and there\u2019s suddenly a longing for solutions,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cWe\u2019re saying: \u2018Let\u2019s not wait for the government, we the people are the solution and can drive massive change.\u2019 We\u2019re talking about how we can move from rebellion to restoration.\u201d It may be difficult to measure how awareness is raised, but perhaps it can be guided by the straightforward measurement that is planting trees. As Dubois puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s tangible, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s life-giving.\u201d \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

A bottle shortage swept the country due to the rate at which beer was being consumed to quench the overheated nation\u2019s thirst. But it wasn\u2019t the demand for their classic range of beers that surprised the brewery bosses most, rather the rate at which its alcohol-free varieties were being drunk. \u201cSales were 40% up on the previous year,\u201d says Elisa Raus of St\u00f6rtebeker. \u201cWe literally could not produce it as fast as it was being drunk.\u201d Founded in 1827, St\u00f6rtebeker, which is in the northern port city of Stralsund on Germany\u2019s Baltic coast and built its reputation as a purveyor to holidaying royals, boasts no fewer than three non-alcoholic varieties among its considerable range of beers. Bernstein, a wheat beer, came out in 2007, then followed Frei, an isotonic pils, and the most recent, Atlantic Ale, last August. Its brewers are working on a fourth in their subterranean testing lab, but the details of that are secret. According to the German Association of Brewers (DBB), now as many as one in 15 beers of the estimated annual 6.2 million hectolitres consumed in Germany contains no alcohol. This is being put down to an increase in health awareness as well as an improvement in the quality of a beverage with a reputation for being flat and tasteless, typically drunk only out of necessity. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer considered shameful to ask for an alcohol-free beer,\u201d says Marc Oliver Huhnholz of the DBB. \u201cOn the contrary, it seems it\u2019s even becoming something of an accepted lifestyle drink and the stigma is more or less gone.\u201d Germany\u2019s 1,500 breweries, he says, now produce between 400 to 500 alcohol-free varieties of beer, with new ones emerging all the time as the brands compete to improve taste, head and consistency. The growth in their popularity has even gone some way to stem a year-on-year fall in standard beer sales. Improvements in both taste and variety and the fact that most bars in Germany will stock at least one type, says Huhnholz, \u201cmeans that people are increasing enjoying alcohol-free beers out of choice\u201d. Alcohol-free types contain, like conventional beer, water, malt, hops and yeast and are brewed according to Germany\u2019s 16th century purity law. The two most widely recognised brewing methods are an arrested or limited fermentation process and vacuum distillation. In the first, the fermentation process is stopped with a cold shock before the alcohol content is able to rise above 0.5%. This is how St\u00f6rtebeker\u2019s Bernstein is produced. In the second, which applies to the Frei and Atlantic, after the completed fermentation process, the beer flows through a closed system and evaporates, with vacuum enabling the ethanol to boil off at a lower temperature. The flavour from the alcohol vapour is added back into the beer to retain its hoppy flavour. Christopher Puttnies, chief brewer at St\u00f6rtebeker, proudly shows off his gleaming Entalkoholisierungsanlage or de-alcoholisation facility, a 500-metre sea of twisting stainless steel pipes. It\u2019s part of the brewery\u2019s recent multimillion-euro investment programme and, says Puttnies, a reflection of its long-term commitment to alcohol-free varieties, which now make up one in 10 of the brewery\u2019s sales. \u201cWe evaporate it as slowly as possible so as to retain the taste as best we can \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of technical fine-tuning involved,\u201d he says. This way just 10 hectolitres of beer can be produced an hour, compared to 100 hectolitres for conventional beer. The factory turns out 50,000 half litre bottles of alcohol-free beer a day in addition to 450,000 bottles of its other beers. Factory workers are allowed to drink the non-alcoholic beers as a refreshment during working hours. Increasingly, says Puttnies, the younger ones in particular even drink it off-duty at home. \u201cIt\u2019s a far cry from the days when you wouldn\u2019t be seen dead drinking a non-alcoholic beer,\u201d he adds, recalling the first of its kind which was invented in communist East Germany in the early 1970s by a Berlin brewer. It was called AuBi (Auto Bier). \u201cIt was like dish water,\u201d Puttnies says. The number of German bars that are increasingly stocking one or more types of alcohol-free beer is on the rise. Only in Spain is the interest in it as high as in Germany. Though not everyone is convinced. On Stralsund\u2019s market square, where children seek relief from the mid-afternoon heat in a fountain, Peter R\u00f6scher sips a 5% ABV Weizen or wheat beer. The pensioner admits he has never been interested in trying new types of alcohol-free beer, having only ever drunk it \u201cnow and then\u201d over the past two decades, \u201cout of necessity, when I had to drive somewhere or had to get up early for work. I\u2019ve always found it pretty thin and tasteless\u201d. His wife, Ellen, wonders what the point is. \u201cYou might as well drink water if you\u2019re not going to drink the real thing,\u201d she says. But Rachel Hundt, sitting outside Cafe am Markt drawing on a non-alcoholic pils from a Bavarian brewery, says: \u201cIt\u2019s just what I want in this heat. I like the slightly bitter taste and it might be psychological, but I get a buzz. I suppose it\u2019s from the hops.\u201d Bianca Kison, a waiter, says: \u201cI\u2019d estimate that every fourth beer I sell these days is non-alcoholic. That\u2019s a big change even from two, three years ago. Men, women, young, old, even kids like to sip it.

There are, of course, dozens of countries where these civilised rules do not apply, so it was heartening to note a small flurry of cases this week in which individual freedom defeated social oppression. First, Russia, a country where it is easy to find justice spiralling away from you if you fall foul of the wrong people. The journalist Ivan Golunov looked like becoming the latest victim \u2013 until a rare national outpouring of solidarity reminded the authorities that injustice can be dangerous for those who mete it out too. Botswana has little in common with Russia, apart from a lot of diamonds and a lingering prejudice against homosexuality. But this week, as Jason Burke reported, judges ruled that laws criminalising same-sex relations should be struck down. And while we are talking about LGBT rights, Ecuador legalised same-sex marriage, and Amrit Dhillon caught up with the inspiring Indian Olympian blazing a trail for homosexuality in a conservative country. It is not all plain sailing, however, as the situations in Hong Kong, Hungary, Sudan and Ethiopia demonstrated this week \u2026 Lucky numbers There were more encouraging environment statistics showing the UK used less fossil fuel than ever to power its energy grid this winter. And a big Thomson Reuters report found growing numbers of people are moving to trustworthy news brands because of concerns about information bandits, charlatans and fakers. What we liked The marathon runner saved by strangers on the finishing line. And also on the subject of rescuing people, the simple school multiple choice questionnaire that saved vulnerable children. What we heard There was a flurry of responses to Stephen Burgen\u2019s article about the Spanish restaurant served exclusively by people with disabilities. Leslie Yerington pointed out the work of the Lucy Foundation, a social enterprise \u2013 named after a false leg - that tries to empower and include people with all kinds of disabilities. Georgie Cottini wrote about the work of Beresford Street Kitchen in Jersey, which provides training and employment for people with learning disabilities and autism. We have a cafe, print shop and catering outlet in Jersey Channel Islands doing exactly the same thing! In your article you mentioned other places in Europe doing similar things so it would be great to mention one in this country! Paul De Maeyer wrote from Rome to point out a chocolate shop in Campania, Italy, that employs people with Down\u2019s syndrome (this article is in Italian).

Transport for London, Greater Anglia and the Go Ahead Group are also all taking part, with posters at three London tube stations encouraging people to talk to staff. Counsellors trained by the charity Relate will ply London buses as part of an initiative with Greener Journeys, encouraging passengers to open up. National Express said it would invite people to take part in \u201csome stimulating activities\u201d on Birmingham\u2019s number 11 route, the longest urban bus route in Europe. The series of initiatives, orchestrated by a BBC team focused on solutions journalism, is designed to combat two of the most toxic issues of the age: polarisation and isolation. Emily Kasriel, a BBC editor behind the project, said the aim was \u201cto encourage people who are up for it to get out of their comfort zone and emerge from their screens to interact with the adult sitting next to them\u201d. \u201cMany people are reluctant to talk to strangers, but perhaps someone is battling loneliness and an exchange could provide a meaningful moment that changes their day,\u201d said Kasriel, the head of the BBC\u2019s Crossing Divides season, which seeks to combat antagonism through conversation. \u201cEveryone has an interesting story to tell. These chance encounters can provoke a new way of looking at the world, and an opportunity to understand someone else\u2019s story.\u201d Though typical commuter behaviour these days might involve inserting earbuds and avoiding all and any interaction with fellow travellers, research indicates that those who do open up to strangers tend to feel happier as a result. In a 2014 study led by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago, the authors wrote: \u201cConnecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other.\u201d In a blogpost for the BBC, Epley wrote that one reason why a sudden conversation might improve a day is that \u201cthe experience of talking with others and hearing a stranger\u2019s voice makes us realise they have a rich inner life of thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences, just like us\u201d. He added: \u201cThese brief connections with strangers are not likely to turn a life of misery into one of bliss. However, they can change unpleasant moments \u2013 like the grind of a daily commute \u2013 into something more pleasant.\u201d Not everyone agrees.

Huge demand for seaweed, hauled up in slimy green bunches from the Pacific Ocean, has kickstarted an industry that existed as a mere fantasy only five years ago. \u201cThere\u2019s lot of interest in sustainability,\u201d says Beau Perry, head of Blue Evolution, a California-based company at the centre of Alaska\u2019s nascent seaweed boom. \u201cAs we deal with climate change and the movement towards plant-based diets, all of those trends play towards seaweed being a new sort of star ingredient.\u201d In recent years, farmers in Alaska have begun growing sugar kelp and ribbon kelp \u2013 two species that occur naturally in the ecosystem of remote communities like Kodiak and Ketchikan. With a $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) global market for seaweed, residents are hopeful that kelp farming is a sustainable way to cultivate \u2013 and harvest \u2013 the coveted aquatic plant. \u201cThere\u2019s huge potential in Alaska. There\u2019s so much space and it really fills an interesting niche,\u201d says Alf Pryor, co-owner of Kodiak Kelp Company. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for tons of different kinds of products \u2026 [I] see it taking off pretty quickly.\u201d A career salmon fisherman, Pryor along with his wife, Lexa Meyer, were drawn into the kelp business recently as a way to supplement their income. But interest in kelp farming is now so intense that Pryor believes a new farmer might have to wait up to three years for the necessary permits. Unlike in other parts of the world, where wild kelp is harvested by ships, Alaska\u2019s aquatic plants are grown by farmers in a months-long process, which begins in the dead of winter. After Pryor and Meyer find roughly 50 plants they consider ideal for breeding, the wild kelp samples are sent to a facility run by Blue Evolution. The company extracts spores from the kelp and grows seedlings on pieces of string known as \u201cseed pipes\u201d. These pipes are given to farmers, who then wind the string along long ropes, which dangle from a free-floating frame in the ocean. Over a six-month period, the spores mature before they are harvested in late spring. Pryor\u2019s experience as a gill-net fisherman helped him to switch to mariculture, including redesigning a 25ft skiff to harvest kelp more efficiently. Even with his technical knowledge, he\u2019s found that farming requires constant vigilance, including a sharp eye for drifting rafts of bull kelp, rogue groupings of wild seaweed that can crash into the ropes of young kelp and tangle into the plants. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a constant battle, trying to keep stuff out of the farm,\u201d says Pryor, who monitors the young plants once a week over the winter with his team. In early May, the couple harvested nearly 200,000 pounds of kelp from their operation, which spans 18 acres and uses nearly 50,000 feet of rope \u2013 one of the largest hauls of kelp in the history of Alaska. Blue Evolution hopes to buy \u201cat least 50 tonnes\u201d of seaweed from farmers like Pryor and Meyer, says Perry \u2013 a five-fold increase on the company\u2019s purchase last year, and a figure he hopes to double next year. The plant is of particular interest as studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of seaweed in animal feed as a way of reducing methane emissions. It is also being tested for properties that can mimic fossil fuels or plastics. In coastal towns like Kodiak, where the fishing industry is the main employer and incomes are seasonal, the burgeoning kelp farming industry is seen as a way for families to find work during slow periods. \u201cFor small coastal communities, [seaweed farming] could be a big deal,\u201d says Pryor. \u201cJust from the farm that we did this year, we put between 30 and 40 people to work.\u201d Alaska\u2019s experiment with kelp is nothing new: each year, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of seaweed are harvested around the world, with China and Japan leading global exports. But in recent months, the harvesting of wild plants has been dogged by controversy. In summer 2018, the proposed wide-scale harvest of wild kelp led to a fierce row in Scotland, where environmental groups say the dredging of kelp forests could cause irreparable harm to marine life off the coastline because the plants play such a crucial role in preserving a healthy ecosystem. In Alaska, companies are required to follow strict government rules on cultivation: strains of seaweed crops, taken from wild plants, must be grown within 50km of the source plant. This ensures genetic strength and diversity are maintained, says Perry, with salmon hatcheries in the state following similarly strict guidelines. On the whole, any environmental damage from the cultivation of farmed seaweed \u2013 which requires wild plants be picked for spore extraction \u2013 appears to be \u201cminimal\u201d, says Matthew Bracken, an associate professor of biology at the University of California Irvine. \u201cKelp have major benefits for the environment both naturally growing and growing in these cultures,\u201d says Bracken. \u201cWhen the sun is shining, [kelp plants] are going to absorb carbon dioxide from the water \u2026 And given increases in [carbon dioxide] concentrations in the ocean generally, this is a good thing.\u201d Because seaweed is seen as a tool for mitigating the damaging impacts of ocean acidification, Perry believes the product is good for the environment \u2013 and for business. But for Bracken, the surge in cultivation also highlights major advances in understanding the life cycle of a kelp, which has long mystified researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like plants where you just put seeds in the ground. They have a complex life. You have to really understand that well and be able to then magnify it,\u201d says Bracken. \u201cIt can teach us a lot about how life works.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'It has transformed my life': the restaurant where all staff have a disability", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/universo-santi-spanish-restaurant-disabilities-jerez", "date": "2019-06-10", "transcript": "The first thing that strikes you is the calm, the light, the modern art on the walls \u2013 and then of course the food. It\u2019s only later that you realise there is something different, and a little special, about Universo Santi, a restaurant in the southern Spanish city of Jerez. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come here because the staff are disabled but because it\u2019s the best restaurant in the area. Whatever reason they came for, the talking is about the food,\u201d says Antonio Vila. Vila is the president of the Fundaci\u00f3n Universo Accesible, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to helping people with disabilities join the mainstream workforce. He has also been the driving force behind Universo Santi, the haute cuisine restaurant whose 20 employees all have some form of disability. \u201cI always wanted to show what people with disabilities, given the right training, were capable of,\u201d says Vila, who is a senior manager at DKV insurance. \u201cThey were not represented in the world of haute cuisine. Universo Santi has broken through that barrier.\u201d The 20 staff, whose ages range from 22 to 62, were recruited from an original list of 1,500. To qualify, applicants had to be unemployed and have more than 35% disability. \u201cI feel really lucky to be part of this,\u201d says Gloria Baz\u00e1n, head of human resources, who has cerebral palsy. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to work when society just sees you as someone with a handicap. This has given me the opportunity to be independent and to participate like any other human being.\u201d Alejandro Gim\u00e9nez, 23, has Down\u2019s syndrome and is a commis chef. \u201cIt\u2019s given me the chance to become independent doing something I\u2019ve loved since I was a kid,\u201d says Gim\u00e9nez, who lived with his mother until he was recruited. \u201cWorking here has transformed my life. So many things I used to ask my mother to do, I do myself. I didn\u2019t even know how to take a train by myself because I\u2019d just miss my stop.\u201d A recent guest chef was Joan Roca of El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world. Gim\u00e9nez said he was not daunted at coming under Roca\u2019s orders. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything. The only thing I\u2019m afraid of is not knowing something. I always want to learn and here I\u2019m learning from the very best.\u201d Universo Santi may soon have a star in the Michelin firmament as the Michelin Guide people have already sampled the menu which, at \u20ac60 (\u00a353), is less than half the price of a typical men\u00fa de degustaci\u00f3n. \u201cOf course they didn\u2019t introduce themselves but we knew who they were,\u201d says Almudena Merlo, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019. While few are as gastronomically ambitious as Universo Santi, there are several other projects across Europe where catering is giving disabled people a new lease of life. One is La Fourchette de Collserola in Barcelona, which is staffed by 20 people with a range of physical and mental disabilities. The cuisine is Mediterranean, with vegan and kosher options. In 2010 Brownies&amp;downieS launched in the Dutch town of Veghel as a caf\u00e9 run by people with Down\u2019s syndrome and other disabilities. It was so successful that the venture became a franchise, with 53 branches in the Netherlands, Belgium and South Africa. Another similar project is the One Eighty Restaurant in Portadown, Northern Ireland, which was established in 2011 and trains 16- to 22-year-olds with learning difficulties to work in the hospitality business. The Jerez restaurant takes its name from Santi Santamaria, chef at the Michelin three-star Can Fabes in Catalonia until his sudden death in 2011. Can Fabes closed shortly afterwards but his family wanted to carry on his name and culinary tradition and were keen to support the Jerez project. The family\u2019s enthusiasm attracted the attention of Spain\u2019s top chefs, among them Mart\u00edn Berasategui, Roca and \u00c1ngel Le\u00f3n, all of whom have contributed recipes and their time as guest chefs at the restaurant. Disciples of Santamaria helped establish the kitchen, whose equipment was transferred in its entirely from Can Fabes, and several of the dishes on the menu de degustaci\u00f3n are Santamaria originals. Since it opened in October 2017, Universo Santi continues to win plaudits for its cuisine. Speaking at the restaurant, Roca said cooking was about humanity and was a way of integrating people. \u201cIt gives me great satisfaction to see it realised in a project such as this,\u201d he said.

Crossing the river on a tree-lined and lawned bridge, the roar of traffic has been replaced by the sound of water from fountains. Such is the vision for the Eiffel Tower, which is at the centre of a major makeover project to transform one of Paris\u2019s most visited districts. At the heart of the revamp is a pedestrian-friendly plan to create the city\u2019s largest garden. The landscape design, drawn up by a London-based company, will also turn a nearby bridge, the Pont d\u2019I\u00e9na, into a grassy, tree-lined walkway linking riverside gardens either side of the Seine with pools, fountains and mini-parks. The first stage of the project, financed by the company that operates the Eiffel Tower, should be completed by 2024 in time for the Olympics. It is the latest element in a concerted campaign led by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to reduce the number of vehicles in the French capital. Hidalgo, who faces re-election in 2020, has already closed long stretches of both riverside highways to vehicles. She has also revamped seven of the city\u2019s major squares, restricting roads and giving more space to pedestrians, cyclists and scooters. She says she wants Paris to become a city \u201cwhere you can let go of your child\u2019s hand\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re really aiming for a high pedestrian target. We\u2019re going to have a splendid garden where we can hear the birds sing,\u201d she said when she announced the Eiffel Tower project last month. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that will become a space for walking, strolling and breathing \u2026 Nature will take its place once more alongside this exceptional heritage.\u201d Mary Bowman, of Gustafson Porter + Bowman, which won a competition to redesign the area around the Eiffel Tower, said the aim was to unify the site from the Trocad\u00e9ro to the \u00c9cole Militaire via the Palais de Chaillot, the Pont d\u2019I\u00e9na and the Champ de Mars to create a \u201cbiodiverse corridor\u201d. \u201cThis is a fantastic project to be working on as a landscape architect. The iconic nature of the site make it a once-in-a-lifetime chance for us, and an honour and privilege,\u201d Bowman told the Guardian. The Eiffel Tower has about 7 million visitors a year, though many millions more go to stand and look at the Dame de Fer, one of the most recognisable symbols in the world and an object of engineering beauty. The area around it, however, is less inspiring, comprising busy highways and the neat but soulless Champ de Mars, which has never quite shaken off its former use as a military parade ground. The project plans to surround the tower with a mix of picturesque gardens and what the designers call \u201chard plazas\u201d that could be used for a variety of public events throughout the year. \u201cParis is the name of the climate agreement and to have a 54-hectare site in the middle of it that can show how one can begin to create a more green space in the heart of a major city and have it available and accessible to everyone, not just millions of tourists, is fantastic,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cOne of the things Anne Hidalgo mentioned about four of the shortlisted schemes was that they reinforced the idea of creating a pedestrian site so you could have this connection between the right and left banks. There is a phased approach. Creating pedestrian areas was a very strong part of our project. \u201cWe would like to restrict private cars and turn it back to nature, but we are just beginning to enter into a period of discussions with the city and the traffic people about how that can be done.\u201d The Pont d\u2019I\u00e9na would be covered with lawns and the pavements either side would be turned into passages for public transport and emergency vehicles. The project includes the creation of facilities for tourists to drop off luggage in front of the Eiffel Tower. The second stage, which will begin after the 2024 Olympics, is expected to be completed by 2030. A public consultation has opened into the \u20ac72m (\u00a364m) project and work is due to start at the end of next year or the beginning of 2021. The lobby group 40 Million Motorists, however, has accused Hidalgo of wanting to turn Paris into a \u201cmuseum city\u201d after she announced plans to turn the four central arrondissements into a \u201crestricted zone\u201d for cars. \u201cParis is not a museum. It is an economic heartland, where millions of people come, sometimes from far away, to work every day and need to do so easily \u2026 where will the mayor\u2019s obsession with eradicating cars end?\u201d it said in a statement. It said the pedestrianisation of swathes of the city did not improve air quality but pushed pollution elsewhere. \u201cAll of this is just ideology,\u201d it added. Jean-Louis Missika, a Paris deputy mayor, said that city hall was determined to press ahead with schemes to reduce road traffic. He said cars took up half the public space, but only 13% of journeys were made in them and most spent 95% of their time in garages or parking spaces. \u201cAll we\u2019re doing is rebalancing the public space given to cars,\u201d he said. Missika said the city was working on introducing a car-sharing scheme following on from its pioneering bike rental scheme, V\u00e9lib\u2019, and more recently, electric scooters. \u201cWe have a lack of green spaces in Paris, which is a very dense city,\u201d he said, adding that city hall aimed to create more public spaces from tens of thousands of square metres currently used for parking. He said initial public reactions to the Eiffel Tower project were encouraging. \u201cPeople seem to like it. A lot.\u201d Bowman added: \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic project also for raising the profile of landscape architects who should be leading the climate debate.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Fight the fakes: how to beat the $200bn medicine counterfeiters | Helen Lock", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/05/fake-medicine-makers-blockchain-artificial-intelligence", "date": "2019-06-05", "transcript": "By the time the teenage boy was standing in front of Bernice Bornmai, feverish and delirious, it was already too late. It wasn\u2019t just the malaria that was killing the 17-year-old, it was the time he\u2019d wasted taking fake medicine. The antimalarials did nothing to stop the disease marching through the young Ghanaian\u2019s body: his organs were already shutting down. \u201cHe died waiting to be taken to a larger teaching hospital for dialysis,\u201d Dr Bornmai told the Guardian, from the small hospital in Accra where she works as a senior medical officer. \u201cIt was one of my saddest cases, but I have lost other patients who would have survived because of fake medicines too.\u201d It\u2019s not just ineffective malaria medication that can prove fatal. Bornmai\u2019s patients have sometimes taken counterfeit antibiotics that not only don\u2019t fight the illness but also increase bacterial resistance to effective medicines. \u201cSometimes I just throw up my hands when I see the results showing which antibiotics have a chance of working \u2013 often they will be not readily available or too expensive,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cIt makes my work frustrating, and it means patients have to stay here longer while I investigate.\u201d When it comes to trying to stop fake medicines getting into the hands of sick patients, experts describe a difficult task where they are constantly trying to stay one step ahead of counterfeiters. Law enforcement and legislation is needed, strong pharmaceutical regulation has to be in place and well-trained healthcare professionals are essential, explains Cynthia Genolet, an Africa policy expert at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. \u201cYou can\u2019t focus on one specific dimension to be successful in this fight \u2013 it has to be a holistic effort,\u201d she says. Genolet is a member of Fight the Fakes, a campaign group launched in 2010 to raise awareness of the problem among pharmacists and industry. One tool campaigners hope will have an impact is the harnessing of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, which have the potential to help in dealing with the complexity of the task at hand. A handful of new startups are focusing on tracing medications on blockchain-type technologies, as well as arming consumers with instant information about what they\u2019ve bought. The Nigerian start-up RxAll, for instance, has created a handheld scanner that can assess the compound of a drug in real time. The device connects to a cloud-based database of information of what the drugs should contain, which then feeds back that information. \u201cThe information collected is a spectral signature of the drug, and once checked, the database sends back information to an app on your phone,\u201d explains Adebayo Alonge, one of the co-founders. The vast information database is updated using an artificial intelligence algorithm. \u201cThe app also shows you the other parts of your city that the drug has been tested in, meaning you can see where bad patches and bad suppliers are,\u201d says Alonge. Alonge and his colleagues launched Rxall last October and have been rolling it out in countries including Ghana, Cambodia and Kenya. It has been in use commercially in Myanmar and has been sold to a large Nigerian teaching hospital and to Nigeria\u2019s National Agency for Food &amp; Drug Administration and Control, whose officials have started training to use it. It\u2019s a personal cause for Alonge, who nearly died at the age of 15 after taking what turned out to be fake Ventolin for his asthma. The toxic tablets put him in a coma for 21 days, and it took six months for him to completely recover. That experience motivated him to train as a pharmacist himself before starting RxAll. Similarly, Raja Sharif, the chief executive of the UK-based data company FarmaTrust was also motivated by personal experience. He began researching the problem after he found out a relative had taken fake medicines. FarmaTrust offers a way to trace data about medicine moving through the supply chain on blockchain, a technology originally created for the purpose of buying and selling bitcoin without going through a server belonging to a bank or government that could be hacked. Sharif explains: \u201cThe issue with fake medicines is that they usually enter the middle of the supply chain, not at the top at the point of manufacturing, and the useful thing about blockchain is that it creates an incorruptible record; once you\u2019ve made a record, you can\u2019t make it again or alter it.\u201d Another benefit of this technology, he says, is that information can be shared between pharmaceutical companies about what is going on in their supply chains on a need to know basis. As they are siloed and competing with each other, vital information that could root out fakes might not be shared. Oksana Pyzik, a senior lecturer at UCL\u2019s school of pharmacy and Fight the Fakes campaigner, says blockchain looks as though it can become an effective tool. \u201cI think based on the fact the FDA is already piloting blockchain in the pharma supply chain in the US suggests it\u2019s a way forward to get the highest quality track and trace, and the cost is not as prohibitive as it was once,\u201d says Pyzik, who organised a panel on the topic of technology and fake medicines at the WHO\u2019s most recent annual health assembly in May. \u201cTechnology alone is not enough, however, it\u2019s a very effective tool. But we also still need to talk about human behaviour and corruption,\u201d Pyzik adds. A much simpler tech solution pioneered by Ghanaian company mPedigree offers a different approach. The company founders began by placing serial numbers under scratchcard surfaces on medicine bottles at the point of manufacture, and consumers can then check the text to see if it matches their database before taking it. \u201cThe company has grown because the counterfeiters grew,\u201d says Selorm Branttie, who co-founded the company with social entrepreneur Bright Simmons. \u201cWe\u2019ve studied where breaches in the supply chain happen, and we counteract it.\u201d The company now has offices in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and India, and has branched out into tackling counterfeiting in the food supply chain too. \u201cHappily, from when we began to now, the prevalence of counterfeiting has dropped from the estimated 30% of the Nigerian pharmaceutical sector to less than 10% today,\u201d Branttie says. \u201cWe are now looking into ways we can use blockchain too \u2013 blockchain helps to demonstrate that we are ourselves trustworthy because its a permanent public ledger and therefore can show the data we have collected,\u201d says Branttie. The need for any solution being developed to have a global reach is clear. In 2011, Interpol seized 2.4m fake and illicit pills, and that number jumped to 20.7m seized in 2015. A large quantity is produced in China, but India, Pakistan, Paraguay and the UK are also among the top sources for fakes. An estimated 116,000 people die from malaria from ineffective anti-malarial drugs in subSaharan Africa, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The WHO estimates that between 72,000 and 169,000 children may be dying each year from pneumonia due to \u201csubstandard and falsified antibiotics\u201d. Counterfeited medicine, thought to be the most lucrative of illegally copied goods trades, ends up all over the world. But developing countries, where spending on medicine means being out of pocket for the majority of people, are the most vulnerable to conterfeits. Most of the cases (42%) reported by the WHO between 2013 and 2017 were found in subSaharan Africa. In 2018 the EU rolled out its track and trace directive to combat falsified medicines in Europe. The same year, the African Union voted unanimously for the adoption of an African medicines agency, something that has been welcomed as a move that would help strengthen regulation across the continent. Meanwhile, organisations such as the Safe Medicines Foundation in Nigeria, which launched earlier this year, have sprung up. The foundation hopes its medical professionals can help pharmacists recognise the signs of fake logos and store medicines correctly. Slowly, the fightback is taking shape, but it is still a mammoth task. Dr Bornmai says that she has noticed her patients have asked her more questions about fake medicines recently. \u201cPeople are getting to know about fake medicines; they ask me if I\u2019ve heard of a certain drug, or whether its safe to take,\u201d she says. She says that technology can help speed up the process of checking something \u2013 saving days or weeks that could be lost to laboratory testing. But consumers ultimately still need quality medicine to reach their local markets. \u201cAn individual could scan a medicine and find that it is fake, then go to the next shop, scan again, and find it\u2019s fake again,\u201d she says. But most importantly, it\u2019s informing and educating the public that can save lives, she says. \u201cGiving individuals more power, through education and the right information to choose the medication that isn\u2019t harmful, is the most important thing that I want to see. It is a universal right to choose medicine that won\u2019t harm you.\u201d \u2022 Helen Lock is a freelance journalist", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Big Issue founder launches magazine to tackle illiteracy", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/big-issue-founder-john-bird-launches-magazine-to-tackle-illiteracy", "date": "2019-06-04", "transcript": "Almost 30 years after founding the Big Issue, John Bird is launching a new magazine that aims to do for illiteracy what his first publication did for homelessness. The peer, who only learned to read while in prison as a teenager, says Britain needs to become a \u201ccognitive democracy\u201d, and that a \u201crevolution in reading\u201d is the best way to bring this about. Chapter Catcher comprises \u201cdozens and dozens of chapters\u201d of a wide range of works of fiction and non-fiction, Bird explains: \u201cYou decide which to read. Think of it as road testing your reading. The idea is that you broaden out what you read.\u201d The first issue puts that conceit firmly to the test. Excerpts lurch from Franz Kafka and Oscar Wilde to Max Porter and Stephen Fry. There\u2019s even a short essay about jail life by an inmate who Bird met on a recent prison visit (\u201cJail either drives you mad or it drives you patient.\u201d) Editorially, the contents page looks as if it were compiled by an arbitrary drunk let loose in a municipal library. But such apparent randomness, Bird insists, is the whole point. We neither learn by reading what we already know, nor do we grow by reading what makes us comfortable. If we are to solve the big issues of today \u2013 climate change, immigration, poverty, social inequality, his list goes on \u2013 then we need to start thinking differently. And thinking differently, Bird argues, starts with reading differently. \u201cThe world is becoming really, really difficult. We\u2019re all going to have to be experts in ways that we never expected. Our children, in particular, will have deeper knowledge, and that requires a revolution in reading,\u201d he says. Baron Bird of Notting Hill credits Brexit with bringing him to this realisation. Perplexed as to whether to vote leave or remain (he lumped for remain in the end), the 2016 referendum persuaded him of his failure to \u201cever read deep\u201d. \u201cAfter the vote I thought: \u2018Why didn\u2019t I take this more seriously by reading deep so I could go and argue with people to stay or to leave?\u2019 I just felt that I needed to develop a mechanism where people can learn in their own way to broaden and deepen their reading.\u201d Enter the idea for Chapter Catcher. The index is not quite as randomly assembled as might initially appear. The chapters are loosely broken into five sections: contemporary, rediscovered, classics, non-fiction and \u2018in process\u2019. The last section is one of those that Bird is particularly excited about. He hopes that published and unpublished writers will be inspired to submit unfinished work for consideration. \u201cI want to encourage the growth of writing and break down the world of publishing and magazines. It\u2019s the beginning, in my opinion, of a new way of encountering writing and a new way of encountering reading,\u201d he said. At the heart of the venture is a desire to connect readers and writers more directly. Just as the Protestant reformers of the 16th century sought to open a direct channel to God by bypassing priests, he says, he wants to \u201ctake out the middleman\u201d in publishing. As with the Big Issue, which is sold by and for the homeless, Chapter Catcher is set up as a social enterprise. Copies of the magazine, which retails at \u00a34.99, will be sent free to every prison in the country. Charities that stock the magazine also get a 50/50 split on all sales. Bird hopes that it will be sold \u201calmost as a community bag\u201d, with non-profit vendors including their own leaflets and materials in the envelope in which the magazine is marketed. Another lesson that Bird has taken from the Big Issue is to play down the seriousness of his intent. So expect plenty of artwork, white space and, as the blurb on the cover states, \u201cno wise advice, no clever analysis, no acute insights\u201d. It is necessary to \u201csugar the pill\u201d, Bird explains. \u201cThe worst thing on earth is to be an enthusiast. If you are really, really enthusiastic about climate change, then you are probably incredibly boring.\u201d Bird is nothing if not enthused about his new publishing venture \u2013 his first since launching the Big Issue back in 1991. He has plans for a junior version, a bimonthly edition (it is launching as a quarterly), email lists with one-off stories, an interactive reader-friendly website, a national network of reading groups, and much else besides. Before all that, however, he needs to wean us off our screens and get our noses into stories and essays that we are not necessarily predisposed to read. And that is no easy task \u2013 especially with government cuts to public libraries, these great gateways to \u201cthe unknown unknown\u201d, as the author and etymologist Mark Forsyth puts it. As Bird reflects: \u201cIf you really want to screw up the world, then you close your libraries tomorrow. You close the future. You say: \u2018Bollocks to knowledge.\u2019\u201d Chapter Catcher isn\u2019t about to replace libraries, but, in a small way, it does capture what libraries (and bookshops) do best: presenting us with thought-provoking literature that we would not otherwise come across. Whether the readers share his excitement is uncertain, but this one-time butcher\u2019s boy isn\u2019t about to say \u201cBollocks to knowledge.\u201d Learning to read, he says, \u201cmade me into the posh geezer I am now\u201d.

But the really remarkable thing about Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Quisocala is that he is still a child himself. When many of his peers dreamed of becoming professional footballers, firefighters or cumb\u00eda music stars, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo had his sights set on the world of finance from an early age. By the age of seven, attending a state school in the Peruvian city of Arequipa, he decided he wanted to create a bank for children. He was motivated by seeing his peers skipping lunch because they had spent the little money they had on sweets or football cards. What drove him even more was the poverty he saw among children who were not attending his primary school. \u201cSeeing children living in poverty, seeing many children working in the streets, at the traffic lights selling sweets, begging \u2026 made me think, why can\u2019t these children go to a normal school,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOne of the reasons why those kids were working was because there was no money at home. Why can\u2019t I teach them to save?\u201d The Bartselana student bank he founded then now has more than 2,000 clients between the ages of 10 and 18 and offers loans, microinsurance and other financial services. The children can withdraw money from the cashpoints of several banks and building societies using personal bank cards, which no one else can use, and monitor their balances online. He also set savings goals his clients had to reach in order to withdraw money. Seven years ago, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo managed to convince a handful of teachers and pupils that his idea could work. Then a student prize from his local town hall helped him get the support of a local cooperative to formally register his bank. Since then he has won awards nationally, then internationally and he has not looked back. From winning Unicef\u2019s Child and Youth Finance International Award in 2014 to the Children\u2019s Climate Prize in 2018 and more recent accolades, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo has combined financial and environmental services. The student bank really took off when he came up with an innovative way for the children to earn money by collecting recyclable plastic or paper waste. \u201cThe children would sometimes bring savings of a few cents and I had promised that they could buy a bicycle, a computer or a laptop but with that amount of money it would take a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought there must be a way they can earn money and I thought about rubbish; we all generate rubbish and I decided that was the solution.\u201d The children bring plastic bottles, used school exercise books and old newspapers to a kiosk at their school where it is weighed and their bank accounts are credited with the corresponding amount of money. Jos\u00e9 Adolfo struck deals with local recycling companies to pay his bank\u2019s clients a slightly higher price than normal; for example 0.80 Peruvian Soles (0.19 GBP) a kilogram of plastic or white paper. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be in the street collecting rubbish but at home stopping the rubbish from reaching the street. So in their homes, they put out boxes for cardboard, paper, bottles \u2013 they start collecting and it becomes valuable,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Adolfo explains. His efforts have not gone unnoticed by Peru\u2019s environment ministry, which has made home recycling one of its principal campaigns. The country has introduced a law to tackle its estimated 18,000 tonnes of solid waste a day, half of which is not disposed of in landfills and ends up on streets, beaches and in rivers. \u201cHe\u2019s making an incredible change in financial structuring and financial education that perhaps many adults could not have come up with,\u201d said Peru\u2019s environment minister, Luc\u00eda Ruiz, as she joined Jos\u00e9 Adolfo at a recent event in Arequipa. \u201cBy joining that with recycling and the handling of waste, a serious problem in our country, he\u2019s scoring a double goal because he\u2019s not just designing a financial opportunity for children and teenagers but also helping to reduce the amount of waste in the country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very hectic life for a 14-year-old,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Adolfo says. \u201cEven so, I\u2019m passionate about what I do and I always tell people they should do what they like rather than what others believe they should do.\u201d The bank recycles about four tonnes of material a month and has kiosks in seven schools in Arequipa; more are on a waiting list. Increasingly the model is in demand in the rest of Peru and abroad. Meanwhile, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo is studying online as he no longer has time to attend school. \u201cHe\u2019s given up many childhood things \u2013 games, activities, what normal children do \u2013 but he too is a normal child, he just sees things differently and thinks in another way,\u201d says his father, Herbert Quisocala, who left his job a year ago to help his son. \u201cIf he wants to cry, I\u2019m here to help him understand that life is like that and you have to learn to accept the good with the bad.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The teenager had just started a degree in chemical engineering in Mexico City. So he dedicated his studies to a side project: creating an acceptable alternative to help his father and millions of Mexicans like him avoid sugar. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you know someone with this sickness that you realise how common it is and how sugar intake plays a huge role,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad tried to use stevia and sucralose, just hated the taste, and kept cheating on his diet.\u201d The young chemist started dabbling with xylitol, a sweet-tasting alcohol commonly extracted from birch wood and used in products such as chewing gum. \u201cIt has so many good properties for human health, and the same flavour as sugar, but the problem was that producing it was so expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I decided to start working on a cheaper process to make it accessible to everyone.\u201d Ten years later, Larragoiti has patented a fermentation-based process to turn wasted corn cobs from Mexico\u2019s 27.5m-tonne annual crop into xylitol. It is thereby solving a second problem: what to do with all that agricultural waste that otherwise might be burned, adding greenhouse gases to the overladen atmosphere. His business, Xilinat (pronounced Hill-Ee-Natt), buys waste from 13 local farmers, producing 1 tonne of the product a year. This month his invention was awarded a prestigious $310,000 Chivas Venture prize award, which will enable him to industrialise production and scale up production tenfold. Obesity is one of the fastest-growing global health problems. One in seven people are obese and about 10% have type 2 diabetes. Since 1980 the rate of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries. Larragoiti says that sugary diets are a real problem in Coca-Cola-loving Mexico, which has the world\u2019s second-highest rate of obesity and has successfully taxed sugary drinks to try to combat a main source of the issue. Paradoxically, another corn byproduct \u2013 fructose \u2013 is part of the problem, used to make corn syrup that has been linked to increasing obesity in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic,\u201d Larragoiti says. \u201cHigh fructose corn syrup is just a bomb of carbs and concentrated sugar that makes a high peak of insulin. It\u2019s many times sweeter than regular glucose. Companies use and pay less and that\u2019s the issue.\u201d Reusing agricultural waste is rapidly emerging as a promising sector for social entrepreneurs keen to tackle global heating and make useful things at the same time. \u201cOne corn stalk has 70% to 80% waste by weight when you get down to it,\u201d says Stefan M\u00fchlbauer, of Cormo USA Inc. His company has a pilot plant in Alsace, France, and is building another in Indiana, US, to turn corn waste into a peat moss substitute and a super-absorbent foam for filters or soil. \u201cFarmers are excited as it gives them something that extends their harvest season and they see another source of revenue,\u201d he adds. In Mexico, agricultural waste is often burned, releasing greenhouse gases and creating one of the country\u2019s highest sources of dioxin emissions. \u201cBurning the residue is cheap and quick and may suppress pests and diseases,\u201d says Dr Wolter Elbersen, a crop production expert at Wageningen University &amp; Research. \u201cThe disadvantages such as air pollution, loss of organic matter and nutrients are less appreciated apparently. Removing the material for feed or compost, or added value products such as paper pulp or fuels is often not cost-effective, or no labour is available to do all the work in a short window of time.\u201d But thinking in a different way about \u201cwaste products\u201d is essential if we are going to conserve scarce resources and feed a growing population, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. \u201cWe need to think about the principles in the past, where we had to do much with little, and at the same time apply the technology we have at hand nowadays to succeed in the challenge of feeding the world,\u201d says Clementine Schouteden, who leads the global initiative on the circular economy for food at the campaigning organisation. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sense of urgency in making sure that we farm in a way that is regenerative, preventing waste but also [creating value from] the waste that is currently not edible, with a food industry making the right options for consumers and for the planet.\u201d Xilinat\u2019s idea has huge potential, according to Sonal Shah, the founding executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, and a Chivas Venture judge. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that he\u2019s building a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar but that it\u2019s going to become scalable so every company that uses sugar in its food has the opportunity to rethink what kind of substitute they use,\u201d she said. Ebersen added, though, that \u201cyou do, however, need a solution for using the leftovers after the xylose has been extracted and the demand for xylitol is small [currently] compared with the amount of residue\u201d. Meanwhile, what about Javier\u2019s father? \u201cMy dad is super-happy,\u201d Larragoiti says. \u201cHe uses my product every day and he\u2019s willing not to cheat on his diet any more!\u201d \u2022 Readers have pointed out that xylitol is highly toxic for dogs and even small amounts can be fatal.

Solution Lucky numbers Off at a tangent we go, to inspect a list of the best countries in the world for attracting and retaining top talent. In a world of steadily mounting protectionist barriers and domestic chauvinism, this list tells a story. Also, the number of deaths from strokes have halved in the UK over the past 10 years. That silver lining does however come with a cloud attached: more people are surviving and enduring severe disability as a result. What we liked The Covering Climate Now project, led by the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation, which aims to galvanise media coverage of \u201cthe most urgent story of our time\u201d.

Nicholas Falk, via email Re (GDP alternatives) I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of the Social Progress Index, that looks for more telling metrics about wellbeing. Lee Mannion, via email In NZ we have had a number of schools adopt a mentoring programme, where senior students volunteer and are trained to mentor younger students. It\u2019s proven particularly effective for potentially vulnerable students who might be from single parent/financially stressed/marginalised/migrant ... families and where [there] is a real need for role modelling, having a confident and an \u2018older sister\u2019 or \u2018older brother\u2019 in the school / community environment. One programme was instigated in Nelson, started at Nelson college by groundbreaking social worker the late Celia Lashlie. I have seen first-hand how these mentoring programmes really do assist both younger and older student and work to break down age and social silo barriers and prejudices. Now, our small rural Golden Bay high school, where there are numerous rural community related stresses for students, is implementing a programme in peer support.

John Langared, a 30-year-old programmer, is hurrying to pick up his daughter from school. He has her at home every other week, so tends to alternate short hours one week with long hours the next. Sai Kumar, originally from India, is leaving to pick up his daughter because his wife has a Swedish class. Ylva (who doesn\u2019t want to give her surname) is \u201coff to the gym to stay sane\u201d, as is Sumeia Assenai, 30, who came in at 7am, so is allowed to leave early under her company\u2019s \u201cflex bank\u201d system. Minutes after 4pm, the trickle turns into a stream of people tramping through the tunnel under the E4 motorway out of Stockholm\u2019s tech district. The local traffic authorities mark the start of the city\u2019s rush hour at 3pm, the time the first parents begin to leave work to pick up their children from school and kindergarten, and mark its end at past 6pm. Sweden\u2019s flexible approach to working hours is one reason it was ranked best in the world for work-life balance in a recent HSBC survey. Only about 1.1% of the nation\u2019s employees work very long hours, according to the OECD\u2019s How\u2019s Life survey, the second lowest share among the organisation\u2019s 38 countries. Above all, it seems to have found an answer to a question that has vexed parents across the world for years: what do you do if school finishes at 3pm and work at 5pm? Langared says his colleagues and managers never make any comments on the days he leaves his desk shortly after 3pm: \u201cThey\u2019re totally OK with it. Basically, I handle my time any way I want. They just rely on me to do the work, but which hours I do it in, it\u2019s up to me.\u201d If his daughter is ill, he sends an email in the morning saying he needs to vab, the Swedish term for taking a day off to look after a sick child, although now she is a bit older he often works from home. According to Fredrik Lindst\u00e5l, the city\u2019s vice mayor for labour, the flexibility that Stockholm\u2019s employers offer helps the city attract the highly educated workers its tech industries need. \u201cThe city is actively marketing Stockholm as a destination for starting a family while maintaining a high-level career,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been really good at promoting this as a go-to factor.\u201d Robin Bagger-Sj\u00f6b\u00e4ck, who works at Carnegie, Sweden\u2019s leading investment bank, is one of those who\u2019ve been attracted, or at least attracted back. He returned to Stockholm in 2014 after three years working 12- to 14-hour days at the French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in London. Such moves are common among Scandinavian investment bankers, he says. \u201cA lot of Nordic people start leaving London when they reach 30 and it comes to marriage and, sooner or later, kids,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people I knew have left London and now have families, either here in Stockholm, or in Copenhagen or Oslo.\u201d He now drops off his son most days (often, he says, while simultaneously taking part in a conference call). And although he still occasionally puts in extremely long hours when completing transactions, he is sceptical of the hours that are common in London or New York. \u201cI think that if you work those 18-hour days and 80- or 90-hour weeks, in the long run you\u2019re not getting that much more out of it,\u201d he says. \u201cThose last five or six hours a day, I think they\u2019re just marginal. I don\u2019t think the brain works that well if you do that for a longer period of time.\u201d Johanna Lundin, chief executive of Equalate, which advises companies on promoting gender equality, says Stockholm\u2019s work-life balance is rooted in Sweden\u2019s 50-year push for equal treatment of men and women. \u201cCreating a social norm where both men and women take an equal role in childcare is a very important element,\u201d she says. \u201cThis enables women to make and have a career, and it allows men to take part in their children\u2019s lives.\u201d Most companies in Stockholm allow workers to do flexible hours, only requiring them to be in the office between 9am and 4pm, or sometimes 10am and 3pm. Under Swedish law, employees have the right to take the day off to look after a sick child, with the state reimbursing them for 80% of any salary lost. But perhaps the most important element is the system of parental leave, with a generous 480 days of paid leave granted for each child \u2013 almost two years of working days in total \u2013 which can be shared as the parents wish. To encourage men to take more leave, there are three so-called daddy months, which can only be used by one partner and are lost if not taken. Bagger-Sj\u00f6b\u00e4ck spent two months at home looking after his daughter, and says other male bankers at Carnegie have taken five to six months without doing any damage to their careers. \u201cI have a colleague who was away for the whole fall, I guess five months,\u201d he says. \u201cHe is well respected at the firm, both before and after, and as far as I know no one has mentioned anything.\u201d About 100 of the 300 staff at the bank\u2019s Stockholm office have taken some parental leave over the last three years, 60 of whom were men. This is not to say, however, that combining a challenging career with small children is easy, even in Stockholm. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you have one child in school and the other in daycare,\u201d admits Martin Vogel, stage manager at Stockholm\u2019s Royal Dramatic Theatre, as he walks with his two children past a school in the fashionable district of S\u00f6dermalm at 7.45am. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle, it\u2019s a constant battle,\u201d groans Jakob Lagander, COO of the Nordic IT company Pedab, as he rushes from the school to the nearest underground station. Lagander\u2019s wife is a banker, and he says it is not really socially acceptable in Stockholm to employ a nanny, as a similarly high-earning couple would in London. But he says employers in Sweden are also much more understanding of the challenges of being a parent than they are in Dublin, where he spent three years working for the US IT company IBM. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that parents could leave before 4pm in Dublin,\u201d he says. \u201cI get the feeling that it\u2019s much more relaxed here.\u201d But, he adds, Swedish executives do somehow manage to get at least the same amount of work done, with much less time spent chatting or messing around with colleagues. Indeed, one of the main complaints of British people working in Sweden is the lack of office banter and the rarity of after-work socialising. \u201cI think we are much more efficient during the day,\u201d Lagander says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more lazing around, especially in the United States.

When Liebold opened Tilvist in Mulhouse three years ago, in a space that had been vacant for years, friends tried to persuade her against it. \u201cThey said: \u2018Not Mulhouse, look elsewhere,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut I stuck with my instinct, and I was right.\u201d Just over a decade ago, Mulhouse, a town of 110,000 people near the German and Swiss borders, was a symbol of the death of the European high street. One of the poorest towns of its size in France, this former hub of the textile industry had long ago been clobbered by factory closures and industrial decline. It had high rates of poverty and youth unemployment, a shrinking population, and more than 100 shops empty or boarded up. The centre had become associated with gangs. \u201cWe had every possible cliche thrown at us: grey, grim, austere and unsafe,\u201d one local official says. Today, Mulhouse is known for the staggering transformation of its thriving centre, bucking the national trend for high street closures. In the past eight years, more than 470 shops and businesses have opened here. Mulhouse is unique in that 75% of new openings are independents, from comic book stores to microbreweries and organic grocers. It is one of the only places in France with as many independents as franchises. And it is one of very few places in France where more shops are opening than closing. The town\u2019s blue-collar history, its old factory buildings, the 136 nationalities living here and its very young population are now seen as desirable. Once overshadowed by its more famous Alsace neighbours, the city of Strasbourg or chocolate-box pretty Colmar, Mulhouse is now sought after by brands seeking retail premises. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Wow, this place has changed,\u2019\u201d says Sabine Muck, a high school teacher. \u201cThe independents make the place a joy, culture is booming.\u201d French political powers woke up late to the problem of dying town centres. Outside the Paris region, an average of 11% of high street premises lie empty, similar to the UK. But France, which has a powerful hypermarket industry and lobby, has for decades hastened town centre decline by allowing out-of-town superstores to mushroom over kilometres of dull grey hangars on the outskirts of towns. Leaders only recently turned to the issue, fearing boarded up shopfronts and vanishing services could help usher in Donald Trump-style populists. Polls showed that in small French towns, the fewer the services on offer \u2013 notably post offices \u2013 the higher the vote for the far right. Mulhouse has shown it takes at least a decade to turn things around. The town, under its former rightwing mayor Jean Rottner, decided boarded up shops were just the most visible symptom of deeper rooted problems. The city\u2019s \u20ac36m (\u00a331.5m) investment plan over six years tackled several issues at once, including housing. Town centre residents were among the poorest as higher earners moved to houses on the outskirts, leaving properties vacant and run down. Mulhouse set out to rebalance the housing mix. Generous subsidies for the renovation of building fronts expedited a facelift of more than 170 buildings. Security and community policing were stepped up. Transport was key \u2013 with a new tram system, bike schemes, shuttle buses and cheap parking. But making the town\u2019s public spaces attractive was just as important, with wider pavements, dozens of benches, and what officials deemed a \u201ccolossal budget\u201d for tree planting and maintenance, gardening and green space. Local associations, community groups and residents\u2019 committees were crucial to the efforts. A town centre manager was appointed to support independents and high-street franchises setting up. Geography played a key role. While the town itself was poor, the surrounding area, close to Switzerland and Germany, had cross-border workers on an income far higher than the French average. Offering original shops that didn\u2019t exist elsewhere was seen as a way of drawing them in. This was when local independents such as Liebold and her tea shop came along. Having worked in the supermarket business, Liebold understood people wanted a smaller scale experience rather than \u201cwalking for kilometres with a trolley in a hangar where you didn\u2019t see a single leaf on a tree\u201d. She says: \u201cThe idea was to create somewhere where people feel good, to re-appropriate our town centre as a kind of agora, the place where everyone can meet.\u201d Marie Zeugmann, a former teacher, opened her independent clothes shop, Confidence(s), in Mulhouse last month, stocking designers prominent on Instagram and not normally found outside Paris or the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. Like all Mulhouse independents, her shop is as much about providing a social space as it is about retail. Zeugmann is renovating the second floor into a champagne bar for independent producers. \u201cIt\u2019s about offering something different that you can\u2019t find anywhere else,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a few years, Mulhouse became really attractive with an array of little shops. People are very proud \u2013 we\u2019ve made a huge effort to change the town\u2019s image.\u201d Last month, Charlotte Nass and Sophie Erhart opened Le Nid, an urban cafe with a village feel on a cobbled street. They met at school in Mulhouse and had already opened a fashion franchise. \u201cIn Mulhouse, everyone just rolls up their sleeves to work for it, we\u2019ve got no complexes,\u201d Nass says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very young town. That\u2019s good for dynamism and for the new arts scene.\u201d In her town hall office, the mayor, Mich\u00e8le Lutz, who once ran a hair salon in Mulhouse, says the town must now move into a second phase where the vibrancy of the centre extends to the surrounding neighbourhoods. \u201cThe town centre is buzzing now, but we can\u2019t just concentrate on the small central perimeter, nor simply on shops \u2013 there has to be a vision of the town as a whole,\u201d she says. She feels greenery and nature are key \u201cto making people feel good and at ease in the town\u201d. Mulhouse was once known as a \u201clittle Manchester\u201d for its canals used by the textile industry, but many were later concreted over. Lutz is leading a drive to renovate neglected canalsides that run through various neighbourhoods. The focus is on the fine detail, including improved lighting \u2013 important in a town where winter nights come early. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Marquet, the town centre manager, is examining his database of empty premises to match them to new businesses. \u201cMulhouse currently has two shop openings for every closure,\u201d he says. \u201cNo other town in France can say all these brands have opened premises in the last five years.\u201d Olivier Razemon, the author of a recent study called How France Killed Its Towns, says town centres should be seen as a theatrical backdrop to life\u2019s encounters, with the understanding that: \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to the town centre just for shops, but because it\u2019s pleasant, because they want to meet up.\u201d Genevi\u00e8ve Pilnard, an 89-year-old widow, takes a taxi every Friday from her village outside Mulhouse into the town centre, where she goes to the hairdresser, the market, the cheesemonger and the independent bookshop. \u201cI like to keep the habit of coming in, because I don\u2019t want to live like a recluse,\u201d Pilnard says. \u201cAfter all, a bustling town centre represents life.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Van halo: the truck shop in New Zealand that drives off profiteers", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/20/salvation-army-good-shop-aims-to-beat-bad-guys-at-own-game-new-zealand-south-auckland", "date": "2019-05-20", "transcript": "Painted bright purple and crammed full of everyday essentials, the Salvation Army\u2019s Good Shop is hard to miss as it cruises the back streets of south Auckland. Frequenting deprived suburbs that are targeted by predatory lenders, the Good Shop aims to beat the bad guys at their own game. Jodi Hoare is the Good Shop project coordinator for the Salvation Army and first remembers seeing truck shops driving around her south Auckland suburb 30 years ago. Loaded with electronics, linen, food and entertainment items, truck shops ply the poorest areas, selling goods at vastly inflated prices to people who can ill-afford them, and charging interest of up to 800% on loans. People with disabilities or a lack of transport are commonly targeted, Hoare says, as are those with poor financial literacy, or for whom buying on credit is an attractive \u2013 or the only \u2013 option. Prices on truck shops include a three-pack of tuna for NZ$30 (\u00a315) and $59 for a 3kg bag of chicken drumsticks. The Good Shop aims to deliver the same doorstep service but without the high interest and exploitative practices. It sells its wares at similar prices to traditional shops, and requires its customers to undergo a financial background check and interview with a social worker before it will sell to them. Despite the comparative rigmarole, the Good Shop is proving a hit in south Auckland, with the Salvation Army receiving requests from other parts of the country to expand. \u201cFor some people, shopping from a truck is their expected norm. It might be what they have been doing for years and what they\u2019ve seen the neighbourhood doing, or their parents,\u201d says Hoare. Although online shopping is the norm in many western societies, Hoare says about a third of houses in some parts of south Auckland don\u2019t have the internet \u201cso running an online service wouldn\u2019t fully meet their needs\u201d. Larayne, a single mother from south Auckland, first heard about the Good Shop via a community Facebook page, and describes the service as \u201cawesome\u201d. She bought a mobile phone to help her stay in touch with family. \u201cI think it was a lot easier for me to be in my home and have them come to me. Not a lot of people have cars or transport round here. A single mum with kids that doesn\u2019t have transport will find it difficult to get to a shop, so it\u2019s so much easier,\u201d Larayne says. \u201cMy credit isn\u2019t the flashest. I have been turned away from a lot of places \u2026 if the Salvation Army wouldn\u2019t take me, no one else would.\u201d Most of the usual truck shop goods are available on the Good Shop, but some items, such as video games, are not. A social worker and a credit loan approver work together, helping customers choose items they need and be able to afford. \u201cWe have taken that array of stuff we know is offered on trucks and refined it in terms of what we think is ethical to be providing credit for,\u201d Hoare says. \u201cRather than getting into debt for a Playstation, we think you should come up with a savings plan and buy it once you have the cash.\u201d Last year, the Labour coalition government led by Jacinda Ardern announced a crackdown on loan sharks and money lenders, in what the Salvation Army hopes will be an ongoing tightening of the industry. The government now requires all mobile traders to pass the \u201cfit and proper person\u201d test before they are able to sell goods on credit, and it increased fines for sellers who break the law \u2013 they can now pay up to NZ$600,000. Hoare and her team are in the process of evaluating the Good Shop\u2019s success but have plans to expand to other cities later this year.

He was invited to play in Sana\u2019a, where he performed enchanting and technically brilliant music for an hour. But when he stopped, the audience waited for the musician to start talking. Without any poetry, they thought, the entertainment could not possibly be over yet. Sung and recited poetry is loved all over the Arab world, but especially so in Yemen. It is important for special occasions such as weddings and historical events, but also has a function in everyday life as part of dispute mediations between tribes and as a form of political and social commentary. The millennia-old tradition is still thriving. In the 2011 Arab spring protests, ancient and new compositions were chanted in the streets of Sana\u2019a. Even now, four years into Yemen\u2019s civil war, established poets and emerging young writers are exploring how the art form can unite people on different sides of the war\u2019s many fault lines. \u201cWe have to say what we feel and what life is like in war, and what life was like before it. That\u2019s what poetry is for,\u201d said 20-year-old Aisha al-Jaedy, a student from Hadramaut who writes on the themes of women and peace. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to give this message to the world.\u201d Jaedy volunteered for a recent project called In the Land of Shattered Windows, which involved nine young poets from different parts of Yemen writing in the tradition of balah, long poems composed and performed competitively or as part of a dialogue. None of the participants had met, but they were connected in pairs in order to communicate what life was like for people on opposite sides of the conflict, exchanging audio recordings of original poems via WhatsApp. The result was deeply moving portraits of young Yemenis\u2019 lives. I have always told you: You must be brave to say you are scared, And scared enough to look brave. From \u2018Over a Bridge of Fears\u2019 by Aisha al-Jaedy, translated by Hamdan Dammaj Seven of the nine participants were able to travel to Sana\u2019a to meet in person and perform together in February this year. \u201cWe wanted to update the poetic tradition, make it younger and cooler,\u201d said organiser Ibi Ibrahim, the founder of the Romooz Foundation, a new independent non-profit based in Sana\u2019a dedicated to promoting and developing Yemeni art and culture. \u201cWhen I moved back to Yemen last year, it was astonishing for me to really see and internalise how life goes on despite the war. Outsiders think of Yemen as death and war and conflict. That is absolutely true. But what we are aiming to do is create another narrative that shows our humanity and resilience.\u201d Creating art in times of war is not without its obstacles. In Yemen, the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the Saudi-backed coalition have both imprisoned and tortured activists, journalists and intellectuals. Many people are afraid to express themselves truthfully - and political poetry, by its very nature, can inflame existing tensions. \u201cPoetry is given a lot more value and honour in Yemen [than in the west],\u201d said 27-year-old British-Yemeni poet Sana Uqba and author of War &amp; Love. \u201cSo when writing my book, I knew it had to serve a purpose \u2013 a peacemaker but also an unconventional newspaper to inform readers of what is happening in Yemen in a more artistic and creative way. I\u2019m a firm believer in art being a form of resistance.\u201d Poetry, for Uqba, is also a way of processing collective trauma. One of her performance poems, What do you know about Yemen?, was shared thousands of times on social media by Yemenis and the diaspora community keen to draw attention to their country\u2019s rich history and cultural contributions to the world. \u201c[The collection is] designed to humanise what has quite obviously become a dehumanised war,\u201d she said. \u201cBeyond the headlines and death tolls, humans have bore the brunt of this unnecessary and devastating war.\u201d The sun rose and pushed them one by one Onto the ageing bus Fresh bread, a little butter And some cheese That\u2019s all it took - Oh and some tea A whole lot of singing And laughter; that\u2019s a perfect day At the beach Untitled poem from \u2018War &amp; Love\u2019 by Sana Uqba Ibrahim\u2019s team at the Ramooz Foundation is planning to nurture new literary talent in Sana\u2019a with a new project called Kitabat, hosting a creative writing workshop in Sana\u2019a in the summer and crowdsourcing funds for a writer in residence programme in the city. \u201cI feel lucky to witness the artistic energy in Yemen at the moment,\u201d Ibrahim said. \u201cIt\u2019s such an active scene in literature, visual arts, filmmaking. It deserves support. \u201cThere\u2019s a social responsibility to avoid the destruction of our culture and heritage and seeing how these young artists grow more confident in their talents when they get to share their work is amazing.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

It lost its raison d\u2019\u00eatre with the end of wars between nation states on a global scale. Alternative systems emerge already. New Zealand\u2019s \u201cwell-being budget\u201d is an attempt to add another dimension. Janina Priebe, from Ume\u00e5, Sweden, via email Infinite growth on a finite planet is a liberal economist fantasy around which we have erroneously based the core assumptions which guide our teaching of economics. Policymakers, analysts, consultants and financial actors all go through this same quasi-religious indoctrination in their introductory economics courses which treat a narrow view of economics as gospel, and is rightfully being challenged by groups like Rethinking Economics and Exploring Economics. Until a pluralistic approach to economics is the norm, it should come as no surprise that our economies are steering us down the path to extinction. Hamish Forbes (@HsimahForbes) via email I believe we are not going to sort of the problems of the world until we change our economic system to one called a Resource Based Economy (RBE). Phil Smart, via email We seem to think as long as we reach enough economic growth that would automatically solve all our problems like unemployment and poverty. De-growth is the flipside of this thinking; since our environmental problems are caused by economic growth, de-growth will automatically solve them. Instead we should start from thinking what we want to achieve. Personally, I would suggest happiness and a good life for all, including both present and future generation. Whether the path towards this goal would result to growth or de-growth is not essential. Jan Kunnas, from Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland, via email Thanks for picking up this topic.

The 44-year-old is a former engineer and has a mild form of muscular dystrophy. But for the last eight years, he and his wife Denise, 60, have provided a loving home for children who need it in Burnley. It wasn\u2019t an easy start. When Powton first looked into fostering in 2011, his local authority and an agency rebuffed him. \u201cThey thought I was too disabled and my wife was too old,\u201d he explains. But after approaching the National Fostering Agency, he was encouraged to apply. Four days after he was approved as a foster carer, he was assigned his first placement \u2013 a teenager \u2013 to care for. Soon afterwards, Powton and his wife started fostering other children. He says he\u2019s never looked back . Powton beams: \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing that I\u2019ve done with my life.\u201d His own positive experience has led him to question why there aren\u2019t more disabled foster carers like him. \u201cI watched an ad campaign about a general shortage of foster carers a few years ago,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt said \u2018you can do it if you\u2019re LGBT or black and minority ethnic. The only one that wasn\u2019t mentioned was disability.\u201d Concerned, Powton began to investigate whether anywhere in the country was actively aiming to recruit disabled people into fostering \u2013 and nowhere was. \u201cI mean, literally nowhere,\u201d he says. The University of Worcester has launched groundbreaking research into the nationwide shortfall of disabled foster carers. It aims to discover what barriers stop disabled people from applying to become foster carers, and how these can be overcome. Initial findings from the research, which is funded by the Drill programme (Disability Research on Independent Living and Learning) and the National Lottery, have identified attitudes, fear of benefit loss, wording used by foster agencies, and lack of role models as barriers to disabled people fostering. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma attached to disability that determines how agencies view disabled people who might apply to be foster carers,\u201d says Peter Unwin, principal lecturer in social work at the University of Worcester and the project\u2019s lead researcher. \u201cThey tend to see only the disability and what you can\u2019t do. It\u2019s a very negative mindset that is robbing children of a caring environment and a potential new home.\u201d Overcoming these barriers is all the more pressing in light of the current shortfall in foster carers. Latest figures from the Fostering Network show that 8,500 more foster carers are needed across the UK. Yet when the University of Worcester surveyed almost 500 foster agencies to ask if they had any disabled foster carers on their books, only six responded, of whom only a couple had limited experience of working with disabled people. The deficit in disabled foster carers reflects the wider exclusion of disabled people from society, not least from employment. Just under half of disabled people aged 16 to 64 are in work, compared with more than 80% of non-disabled people. This gets even worse for some disabilities: just 16% of people with autism are in full-time paid work, while less than 6% of learning-disabled people are in full-time employment. A recent ComRes survey found one in four UK employers are less likely to hire someone with a disability. Powton knows this all too well. After being made redundant, he was repeatedly rejected for jobs, despite being a qualified engineer. \u201cAs soon as the word disability is mentioned, you can hear doors closing,\u201d he says. Fostering was his way into gaining employment but it evolved into something more. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just a job,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vocation.\u201d Jennifer Luton, from Shropshire, who has been a foster carer for almost 20 years, feels the same: \u201cThey end up as part of the family. Some call us \u2018mum and dad.\u2019\u201d Luton (who uses a pseudonym to protect her foster children) has a rare form of arthritis, which means she uses a crutch to walk, but it was a damaged spine following a car crash in 2000 that meant she needed to leave her physically demanding job as a social worker. One young boy she was helping at the time inspired what she did next: she retrained as a foster carer to look after him. He\u2019s now 32 and Luton is still in contact with him. Luton now works full time as a lecturer and is looking after a 14-year-old, as well as an 18-year-old (she doesn\u2019t receive funding for him but keeps a room for him). \u201cHe can come home whenever he wants,\u201d she says. Far from inhibiting her role as a foster carer, she believes her arthritis helps \u2013 from teaching children the ups and downs of life (\u201cRegardless of who you are, we all have bad days,\u201d she says) to empathy for other people. Sometimes the children will do extra chores for her during a flare-up of her arthritis. \u201cAnd it bonds us as a family,\u201d she explains. This empathy works both ways: disabled people often know what it is to struggle and are well placed to understand children who are going through their own difficulties, adds Luton. She remembers a 15-year-old boy with learning disabilities who she fostered who was upset he couldn\u2019t be an astronaut when he grew up. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m going to be a ballerina!\u2019 I said to him. He thought this was hilarious with my crutch. It helped me talk about that fact that, we can\u2019t all do everything, but to ask, what can we do?\u2019\u201d Her experience neatly demonstrates that having more disabled people fostering can be a win-win situation, from finding an as yet untapped pool of foster carers to helping challenge perceptions of disability and creating positive role models for fostered children. As Luton puts it: \u201cThere are lots of young people who desperately need care. And there are lots of disabled people who have a lot to offer.\u201d Back in Burnley, Powton is hopeful some progress is being made. His agency has moved the training venue for his area to a more local and accessible venue for him (foster carers are required to have continual training), and he knows of 15 other disabled people in the group. Responding to the new figures on the shortfall in foster families, Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, says: \u201cWe encourage everyone who\u2019d like to find out more [about fostering] to get in touch with their local council\u201d. Powton stresses the maths: there are more than 13 million disabled people in the UK, meaning that \u201crecruiting 0.01% of us\u201d could more than solve the problem of the national shortfall in foster carers. First, he says, we are all going to have to start talking openly about disability \u2013 whether that\u2019s in foster caring or any other walk of life. \u201cThe only way this is ever going to change is a frank conversation about how society treats disabled people and what disabled people can do to change things.\u201d \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

By the time it is complete in 2028, it is due to be home to 20,000 people, plus another 20,000 workplaces, and with an explicitly family-oriented design. Centred on an artificial lake and with half of the entire area devoted to public space, it is billed as \u201cVienna\u2019s Urban Lakeside\u201d: a model city-within-a-city, in a place that already has the one of the highest qualities of life of any city in the world. When Christina Atta moved to Aspern four years ago, she was one of its rare single women. \u201cI was alone with my cats, and everybody had children,\u201d she says. Now she is pregnant with her second child, however, Atta, 35, can better appreciate its design. Her only complaint is that the bus to the city can\u2019t accommodate all the young children. But Aspern isn\u2019t just about families. It was deliberately planned with a brand identity, one that might elsewhere be considered political: all the streets and public spaces are named for women. There are Hannah Arendt Platz, Janis Joplin Promenade, Ada Lovelace Strasse, Madame d\u2019Ora Park and more, chosen by 30 experts. As an official brochure setting out these women\u2019s achievements puts it, \u201cAspern has a female face\u201d \u2013 a small counter to traditional Vienna, where 3,750 streets are named after men. It is symbolic, yes, but makes a clear statement: Aspern specifically takes in to account women and their needs. In this way it embodies a unique approach to urban planning that began shaping Vienna 30 years ago. \u201cGender mainstreaming\u201d is the practice of ensuring women and men are accounted for equally in policy, legislation and resource allocation. Proposed in 1985, it was enshrined as the UN\u2019s global strategy for gender equality in 1995, but Vienna had adopted it years earlier. The city has since conducted about 60 gender-sensitive pilot projects and assessed another 1,000. As the city\u2019s deputy mayor, Maria Vassilakou, wrote in 2013, gender mainstreaming ensures \u201cfair shares in the city\u201d for all by forcing planning to be approached from different perspectives. But how do pavement widths and bench design relate to gender? And if mainstreaming aims to promote equality, does Vienna\u2019s example prove that it works? \u201cThe argument is, you get a fairer society,\u201d says Eva Kail of the city\u2019s strategic planning unit. \u201cAs a public administration, to offer good service for the people \u2013 to have better quality of life \u2013 you have to take care of gender equality.\u201d Kail, one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent experts in gender mainstreaming, was previously the head of Vienna\u2019s first women\u2019s office. Initially called the Frauenburo, the department was established after Kail, then a junior district planner, co-organised a photography exhibition in September 1991 that documented a day in the lives of eight different women and girls \u2013 from a young child, to a wheelchair user, to an active retiree. It was a simple concept that showed a side to the city that was rarely considered. Like most European cities then and now, Vienna was being designed by male planners for men like them: going between home and work, by car or public transport, at mostly set times. There was no accounting for unpaid labour such as childcare or shopping, carried out mostly by women, in many short journeys on foot during the day. Sabina Riss, an architect and lecturer at Vienna University of Technology\u2019s Department of Housing, says this male-dominated thinking was evident in most large European cities after the second world war: \u201cThey designed cities like there would be no other people than men going to work in the morning and coming back in the evening \u2013 everything else in between, they kind of had no idea. And because they are the people who design cities, they are in charge.\u201d With no accounting for their movements, women were being left out of the city. Kail\u2019s exhibition was a surprise hit, drawing 4,000 visitors and sparking public discussion of areas where women felt unsafe, how they got around, and \u2013 more broadly \u2013 who the city was for. Later, a follow-up postal survey by the women\u2019s organisation of the governing Social Democratic party led to a breakthrough revelation: roughly two-thirds of car journeys were made by men, while two-thirds of those on foot were by women. \u201cThat was really an \u2018a-ha\u2019 moment,\u201d says Kail. For the first time, she was able to prove that men and women\u2019s experiences of city living were different \u2013 and women\u2019s were being overlooked entirely. In April 1992, she was tasked with turning the momentum into concrete change as head of the Frauenburo, which Kail has called \u201ca little bit of a feminist utopia\u201d. At that time Vienna was in a period of rapid expansion. The Iron Curtain had been swept aside, and the government had set a target of building 10,000 new apartments each year. Architecture firms were awarded contracts \u2013 but in 30-odd rounds, no women had even been invited to pitch. \u201cOnly men were defining the new structure of the city,\u201d says Kail. Her response was to invite only women architects \u2013 then just 6% of the profession \u2013 to submit proposals for a social housing project north of the city, with women\u2019s everyday life an essential criterion of the design. It was clear that Vienna\u2019s future was in high-density housing; Kail saw this inaugural pilot as an opportunity to prove that taking gender into account resulted in better outcomes for everyone. \u201cI always said we can\u2019t have special conditions, it can\u2019t be more expensive \u2013 we have to prove in the mainstream that we produce higher quality,\u201d she says. The result was Frauen-Werk-Stadt (Women-Work-City), a 357-unit complex made by women and completed in 1997. It was characterised by a woman\u2019s perspective at every level: from pram storage on every floor and wide stairwells to encourage neighbourly interactions; to flexible flat layouts and high-quality secondary rooms; to the height of the building, low enough to ensure \u201ceyes upon the street\u201d. \u201cThey tried to think it all through, from how you get off the bus to get into your flat,\u201d says Riss. The project was not without challenges. Some of the women brought on to the project were inexperienced, or did not hold feminist views: it was by no means only men who objected to gender mainstreaming in those early years. There was also resistance within the public service. Though the project had the backing of those at the top of the administration, at lower levels there was sometimes openly sexist objection. There were many cases where department heads who had not been against gender mainstreaming in principle revealed themselves to be less amenable to having to apply it themselves. Kail recalls being asked to moderate a cross-disciplinary working group for the traffic plan. \u201cThe first session was really horrible \u2026 [the men] didn\u2019t accept me as leader of the game,\u201d she says. Over the decades, she developed an arsenal of approaches. Some colleagues were won over by the promise of media attention or internal recognition for their pioneering work in gender mainstreaming; others could be engaged intellectually by the opportunities to learn from this cutting-edge discipline. Kail got very good, she says, at buttonholing influential people during the coffee breaks of meetings. Having shown it could be done with Frauen-Werk-Stadt, the next step was to gender-mainstream the city. Mariahilf, a densely populated central neighbourhood with about 28,000 residents, was designated as a pilot district. During 2002 to 2006, street lighting was improved in 26 areas identified in surveys as inducing anxiety; traffic lights were altered to prioritise pedestrians; and seating was installed in nine new locations. More than a kilometre of pavement was widened, and five areas were made entirely barrier-free, so as to better accommodate prams, wheelchair users and elderly people. The link between wider pavements, benches and gender might be obscure, but Kail says it is a question of ensuring equality of opportunity and access. For example, for an elderly person, a well-placed bench might make the difference between participating in the city and remaining at home. A neat example is the redesign of two parks in the Margareten district in July 1999 to encourage their use by girls, whose number was dropping off from the age of nine. The addition of volleyball and badminton facilities countered boys\u2019 dominance over the caged basketball courts; those courts, meanwhile, were fitted with areas for groups of girls to sit, observe and chat. Improving lighting and footpaths added to their sense of security, encouraging them to linger. Four more parks were devised as pilot projects from 2000 and informed the gender-sensitivity guidelines applied to parks citywide since 2005. That process \u2013 of turning gender experts\u2019 local knowledge into general guidelines for the whole municipality \u2013 has been described as ideal in terms of implementation of gender mainstreaming. In the absence of measures to ensure different users\u2019 needs are taken into account, only those of the dominant group are served. Kail notes that transport planners had thought to devise standards for car parks, but not ramps for bikes or prams, \u201cbecause they thought it didn\u2019t matter\u201d. When the women\u2019s office opened nearly 30 years ago, transport planners were exclusively \u201cwhite, middle-class men,\u201d she says \u2013 \u201cand car drivers in the city looked like them\u201d. When the city is viewed only as though through a windscreen, women feel the absence of measures to benefit pedestrians in a way that men typically do not. As Kail has put it: \u201cif you want to do something for women, do something for pedestrians\u201d. \u201cIt is very political, what is regulated and what is neglected,\u201d she says. Gender mainstreaming has been criticised as cementing traditional gender roles \u2013 for example, by equating childcare with women\u2019s work \u2013 but she takes a pragmatic view. \u201cYou can\u2019t influence the share of unpaid work by architecture, but you can support it. We would hope it would support 50% of men as well \u2013 but statistics show it is still more women doing that work.\u201d Similarly, she betrays an uncharacteristic trace of frustration at the suggestion that attempting to make women more safe by installing lighting absolves would-be attackers of responsibility. Lighting may not prevent sexual assault, she says, but it can alleviate women\u2019s feelings of anxiety, improving their access to the city \u2013 and when they are faced with a potential threat, lighting improves their ability to assess the situation. The line between feminist ideals of equality and practical steps to benefit the majority of women is one that gender mainstreaming sometimes straddles uneasily. Ursula Bauer, one of Kail\u2019s first appointments, now heads the city\u2019s cross-sectional gender mainstreaming department. \u201cOur aim is to make sure that all the infrastructure and services of the city can be equally used by women and men \u2026 and contribute towards a more gender equal society.\u201d Within the administration, it serves an intermediary role. \u201cWe try to translate feminist or gender equality to the departments who deal with the population,\u201d says Bauer \u2013 but only, she and Kail agree, insofar as it is necessary to achieve their goal. In the early years, Bauer and Kail agree that they leaned too much on feminist ideals to make the case for gender-sensitive planning. Eventually, they realised it was counterproductive to their primary goal: not to wave the flag for feminism, but to make women\u2019s lives in Vienna easier and more equal. Wolfgang Gerlich of the PlanSinn consultancy, which advised on the Aspern project, is sometimes called on to advocate for gender mainstreaming when a man\u2019s voice is seen as more authoritative. He remembers hosting a workshop in the early 2000s that was attended by a German feminist planning expert and men from the city\u2019s construction department. \u201cIt was a glorious, very valuable failure,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no effect except irritation. Then we completely changed the strategy.\u201d One of the techniques in this new inclusive approach was to ask sceptics to think of what they\u2019d wish for their daughter or niece, says Gerlich, \u201cas a means of creating empathy and making it personal\u201d. Another tool is \u201cthe four-R method\u201d, asking \u201cWho gets what and why, or why not?\u201d to raise awareness of representation, resources, reality and rights. Gerlich says there is a segment of the Viennese population \u2013 mostly men who drive cars \u2013 who resent gender mainstreaming because they are fearful of loss: of quality of life in the city, but also of power. \u201cOf course they are not happy,\u201d he says. But any rumble of backlash against gender mainstreaming has struggled to gain traction when the message from the city\u2019s highest offices has been one of unwavering support. Statements and symbols have helped to make that clear, such as the introduction of gender-sensitive language and titles to its corporate branding and, on the underground train network, posters to raise awareness of vulnerable passengers that represent men and women equally. Today gender mainstreaming principles are enshrined in policy, with sanctions for those who do not comply. \u201cGender budgeting\u201d, for example, introduced in 2005, requires each department to report twice a year on how their expenditure has benefited men and women equally. New housing projects must meet gender sensitivity criteria to be subsidised \u2013 a sort of checklist to ensure that mainstreaming is not dependent on individual interest. This, Kail has written, is a greater achievement than she could ever have imagined back in 1991. After 26 years, it is now fairly common practice in Vienna to approach city living through a gender lens \u2013 and in 2008, the UN Human Settlements programme recognised Vienna\u2019s urban planning strategy as best practice. It is striking that other cities are only lately looking to follow in its example, with Berlin, Barcelona and Copenhagen all beginning to incorporate gender mainstreaming into their urban design. In 2013 Stockholm began implementing gender-sensitive snow clearing, where the routes most used by women \u2013 such as footpaths around daycare centres \u2013 were cleared earlier in the day. But the fact that the policy was subsequently blamed for long delays (apparently without grounds) shows just how much scepticism there is about strategies to achieve gender equality \u2013 or even the need for them at all. But the more imminent threat to the city\u2019s housing standards is growth. Vienna needs 130,000 new residential units by 2025, and stretched public resources could force compromises in quality, gender sensitivity among them. \u201cI think it\u2019s already in process,\u201d says Riss. New private developments far short of the high standard set for social housing, she says. \u201cThey sell flats with really bad floor plans, they don\u2019t care about stairwells that have daylight or communication between neighbours. All of these achievements that have been implemented \u2013 they don\u2019t apply any more.\u201d Gender must also now compete with other, sometimes conflicting, concerns \u2013 climate resilience, migration, the better-access lobby \u2013 for resources and attention. But after nearly 30 years, gender mainstreaming is nearly procedural, almost embedded in the municipality mentality. Aspern doesn\u2019t feel like a \u201cfeminist utopia\u201d, as Kail once described the women\u2019s office. Rather, it comes across \u2013 in its cohesion, sense of established community and lively public spaces \u2013 as simply a very well-designed neighbourhood. Therein lies the importance of gender mainstreaming, says Kail, as well as the difficulty in arguing its case: \u201cIf it didn\u2019t happen, we would feel it. But as long as it happens, we don\u2019t see it. \u201cIf they\u2019ve really accepted it, it becomes invisible.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Why the EU is witnessing the birth of real European politics", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/14/why-the-eu-is-witnessing-the-birth-of-real-european-politics", "date": "2019-05-14", "transcript": "There is a problem with European elections: they are not very European. When EU citizens go to the polls this month, they will vote under national electoral laws, for candidates representing national parties, campaigning on domestic issues. The \u201cEuroparties\u201d the newly elected MEPs will join are not parties at all but loose, often fractious coalitions, so a vote for Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party also amounts to a vote for the far-right populists of Fidesz \u2013 unless the Hungarian nationalist party is finally expelled from the European centre-right group, EPP, to which both belong. More than 60 years of European union have, in short, signally failed to create anything that might reasonably be called a European political space. \u201cEuropean democracy is still, basically, the sum of the EU\u2019s national democracies,\u201d said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at the HEC business school in Paris who has been studying and advocating for truly transnational parties for more than two decades. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have a European politics \u2013 there\u2019s no real pan-European public opinion, no transnational political debate or dialogue on the issues that affect our common interests as Europeans \u2013 unemployment, the environment, migration, data protection. But as the need increases, it\u2019s starting to come.\u201d Previous attempts at a cross-border European politics have made little progress. In the early 2000s, the Greens began working towards a pan-European network, fielding candidates outside their home countries. In 2009 the Newropeans, a short-lived mini-party, won a grand total of 36,871 votes in the Netherlands, Germany and France. The most recent transnational stirrings have come, paradoxically, from the far-right fringe: by building a common discourse, focusing on just one or two hot-button Europe-wide issues such as immigration, and consistently attacking the EU, rightwingers have \u201cactually Europeanised Europe\u2019s politics in a way no moderate national party has even attempted\u201d, Alemanno said. But progressives are now trying too. Imagined the day after the Brexit referendum by Colombe Cahen-Salvador, now 25, a French human rights lawyer, her partner, Andrea Venzon, 27, an Italian consultant, and a German friend, Damian Boeselager, 30, a pro-European group called Volt hopes to become the first true pan-EU party to win seats in the parliament. National parties \u201ccompletely fail\u201d on the European level, said Venzon. \u201cAt any EU election meeting in any member state, the discussion will be 90% national issues and 10% how the EU must change to better serve national interests. National interests always come first, even in pro-European parties.\u201d Entirely crowd-funded, Volt claims 25,000 members, aged from 14 to 92, in 32 countries. It is registered as a political party in 12 and will field candidates in eight, said Cahen-Salvador. Supporters spent 18 months debating its policies bottom-up, online and in meetups before agreeing a platform in Amsterdam late last year. Nothing if not ambitious, its goals include \u201cfixing the EU\u201d by allowing MEPs to propose laws and member states to decide by majority rather than unanimous vote, and ensuring the bloc\u2019s funds are invested to make a palpable difference to ordinary Europeans\u2019 lives \u2013 in education and infrastructure, to create jobs. Other groups are attempting similar exercises. The left-leaning European Spring, headed by Greece\u2019s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, its lead candidate in Berlin, is a coalition of small, radical national parties rather than a single pan-European party but will nonetheless present a single reformist programme \u2013 a \u201cNew Deal for Europe\u201d \u2013 to the EU electorate. Also standing on a common platform in more than one EU country is a rather different kind of group: G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire, which bills itself as \u201ca political movement for young people from all across Europe \u2026 fighting mass immigration and the Islamisation of Europe\u201d and has made headlines staging anti-immigration stunts in the southern Alps and the Mediterranean. No matter how they fare, however, the energetic young activists behind Volt \u2013 who will do well to win more than a couple of seats \u2013 will have performed miracles by getting even as far as they have, because single pan-European parties are made all but impossible by the tangled web of differing national electoral law across the EU. In Italy, 150,000 signatures, including at least 3,000 in each region, are required to run in European elections, all authenticated on the spot by a notary. In France, a party must pass a 5% threshold to win seats \u2013 but even more dauntingly, it must pay the cost of printing its ballot papers: \u20ac800,000-\u20ac1m. In Denmark, 70,000-odd signatures must be collected no later than eight weeks before the election \u2013 but EU nationals can only register to vote 12 weeks before the date. Portugal may demand just 7,500 signatures, but all \u2013 along with the new party\u2019s statutes and mission statement \u2013 must be approved by the constitutional court. And in Britain, where Volt managed a respectable 4.2% in Manchester local elections this month, Venzon is having to stand as an independent in London because, 10 weeks after filing its application, the movement still has not been formally recognised as a political party by the Electoral Commission. Despite determined attempts in more than a dozen countries, Volt is fielding candidates only in Sweden, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Flemish-speaking Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Bulgaria. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Cahen-Salvador. \u201cThese laws are massive obstacles to a European democracy. They need to be harmonised.\u201d The party is, however, likely to benefit from a civic society that is slowly but surely becoming more Europeanised. Springing up often over the past two or three years in the wake of Brexit and strong performances by far-right parties in elections in the Netherlands and France, initiatives such as Stand up for Europe and Pulse of Europe have mobilised large numbers in defence of the European project. \u201cI\u2019ve campaigned in 15 or 16 European countries and there\u2019s no doubt people feel the cross-border fears, hopes and challenges are the same all over,\u201d said Volt\u2019s Venzon. \u201cJobs, the environment \u2026 the basis is so clearly there for a real, functioning European democracy \u2013 but the structure just isn\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d For Alemanno, we are \u201cfinally in at the birth of a European political space. It\u2019s slow, it\u2019s hesitant, it\u2019s painful, it\u2019s repeatedly being knocked back by national politics, nobody knows what form it will eventually take \u2026 And it will include anti-Europeans, for sure. But it is clearly developing.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

And, when he speaks, he doesn\u2019t sound much like one either. The founder of US outdoor apparel brand Patagonia believes stock market valuations are \u201cabsurd\u201d, investing in shares is \u201cbuying blue sky\u201d \u2013 and modern-day capitalism is destroying the planet. \u201cI\u2019d like to see an end to public corporations because we\u2019re not going to revolutionise them, we\u2019re not going to change them,\u201d the self-confessed reluctant businessman told the Guardian. It is easy to dismiss such comments as sour grapes or market envy. As a private company (Chouinard remains sole owner), Patagonia lacks the investment clout of Nike or The North Face. Not that that has necessarily restricted the plucky Californian brand, which posted sales revenues of more than $1bn last year. A soft-spoken former climber hailed by some as the Steve Jobs of eco-conscious commerce, Chouinard is not your usual businessman. Based in the small Californian town of Ventura, he eschews publicity and prefers gardening to board meetings. He set up his first company \u2013 a small climbing equipment firm \u2013 more than 50 years ago only because no one was selling the kind of pitons he wanted. In 1973, he established Patagonia to help finance the low-margin equipment firm. Despite Patagonia\u2019s exponential growth, Chouinard insists his company has sought to remain true to its eco-conscious origins. He cites the brand\u2019s decision to use 100% organic cotton in its garments and to donate 10% of its profits (or 1% of sales \u2013 whichever is greater) to environmental charities by way of example. Patagonia is far from perfect, however. By his own admission, the idea of a fully sustainable business or product is impossible: \u201cThere is no such thing as sustainability. The best we can do is cause the least amount of harm.\u201d Instead of \u201csustainable\u201d, he prefers the term \u201cresponsible\u201d, which, he argues, starts with companies treating nature not as a resource to be exploited but as a unique, life-giving entity on which we all \u2013 not least business \u2013 depend. Chouinard may have his acolytes among eco-conscious consumers, but he doubts mainstream companies are listening to his reforming message. \u201cI used to think that if we could show that being a responsible business is good business, then others would follow. And some do, but they\u2019re tiny little companies. But the public companies, they\u2019re all green-washing. I have no hope that they\u2019re going to change.\u201d Nor does he hold out much hope for government to force big business to act more responsibly. Politicians are \u201cpawns of corporations\u201d says the man who, together with a coalition of indigenous North American tribes and grassroots groups, is currently suing the Trump administration for attempts to reduce the size of ancestral lands in Utah. Our best hope for change lies with consumers, Chouinard maintains: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to change the consumers first and then the corporations will follow and then government will follow the corporations. They [governments] are last in line.\u201d Hence, his recent appearance in New York, where Patagonia was premiering a new documentary at the Tribeca film festival about the dangers to wild salmon of fish hatcheries and open-net fish farms. The film, entitled Artifishal, is intentionally provocative, Chouinard admits. \u201cPeople don\u2019t read any more and they make decisions based on emotions, so I think film is the best way to elicit people\u2019s emotions.\u201d Eliciting consumers\u2019 emotions is not without its risks, of course. One of the chief beneficiaries of salmon hatcheries are recreational anglers, a key consumer group for Patagonia. Chouinard says he couldn\u2019t care less: if he loses business, so be it. \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t believe in doing \u2026 focus groups and all that shit. Proctor and Gamble-style, no risk. Just do it,\u201d he says. The same thinking lay behind his decision in 2011 to run an ad campaign on Black Friday, the busiest day in the US retail calendar, with the tagline: \u2018Don\u2019t Buy This Jacket\u2019. But 50 years of activism has seen Chouinard lose as many battles as he has won; high-profile campaigns against ocean pollution and genetically modified food are two notable cases in point. Failure, fortunately, doesn\u2019t seem to dishearten him. \u201cIf you expect victories, then you\u2019re in the wrong business. Evil never stops. And it\u2019s just a matter of endless fighting \u2026 the fight is the important thing.\u201d For all his talk of evil, it would be tempting to think Chouinard was religious. He is not. The money that is being spent on going to Mars \u201cto see if God is up there\u201d, he jokes, would be better spent on \u201cdoing some actual good\u201d. As he enters his ninth decade, the appetite of this business pioneer to disrupt the status quo appears to be growing, not shrinking. Sparking his radicalism is the election of populist leaders, such as the US\u2019s Donald Trump and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro, whom he accuses of riding roughshod over nature. More important still is the looming threat of climate change and massive species loss. As he told the audience at Tribeca: \u201cThe polar bear is toast.\u201d It\u2019s time for brands to become more vocally political, he argues. Consumers, especially among the young, increasingly expect their favourite brands to speak out, he says. Chouinard, for one, leaves little doubt where his politics lie. When President Trump announced his decision to slash corporate taxes, for example, Patagonia announced it would give away the money saved. That added another $10m to its charitable outgoings, bringing to $105m (\u00a380m) the total lifetime amount donated to environmental causes. Chouinard sees it as an act of \u201ckarma\u201d: \u201cAfter all, we don\u2019t need it, we\u2019re debt-free.\u201d Similarly, plans are afoot to jazz up Patagonia\u2019s political advertising. Rather than just call on the US public to vote for the environment, it now intends to specifically endorse pro-conservation candidates, says Chouinard. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t pussyfoot around anymore. We have to just say, you know, this administration is evil and anybody who is denying climate change is evil.\u201d Such moves will provoke controversy without doubt. Not that Chouinard cares. As he likes to advise graduating students, life is easier if you break the rules rather than conform to them. \u201cInvent your own game and that way you can always be a winner.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on May 20 to remove an earlier inaccuracy which stated that Patagonia gained 600,000 new customers and year-on-year sales quadrupled as a result of its 2011 campaign Don\u2019t Buy This Jacket.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How the 'Las Vegas of Italy' is kicking its slot machine addiction", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/08/how-the-las-vegas-of-italy-is-kicking-its-gambling-addiction-pavia", "date": "2019-05-08", "transcript": "At the start of this year, Massimo was standing on a bridge \u201cdetermined to jump off\u201d. The 45-year-old had been struggling with gambling addiction since 2001. \u201cI started to play slot machines and video poker after the death of my father and ended up spending \u20ac5,000 a day,\u201d says the artisan fence-maker, from the city of Pavia in northern Italy. He was soon in debt to loan sharks and ended up stealing to fund his habit, including from his own mother, before considering suicide. Now Massimo (not his real name) lives in La Casa del Giovane, a unit that houses 100 patients suffering from addictions. Around half of the cases involve gambling \u2013 a symptom of an epidemic that has gripped Pavia for more than a decade. For centuries the city was best known as \u201cOxford on Ticino\u201d: it hosts one of the country\u2019s most prestigious universities, founded in 1361, and a beautiful medieval castle. Built about 25 miles south of Milan on the ancient Via Francigena pilgrim route running from France to Rome, its historic centre is currently a candidate to become a Unesco world heritage site. That reputation changed in 2013 when the city was identified as Italy\u2019s \u201ccapital of gambling\u201d, with a video or slot gambling machine for every 104 inhabitants. Although Italians never flocked there to gamble \u2013 Pavia is no Vegas or Atlantic City \u2013 local media nicknamed it \u201cthe Italian Las Vegas\u201d. \u201cWe had realised something new was going on in 2004, when a 14-year-old boy brought in his father, who was showing clear signs of gambling addiction,\u201d recalls Simone Feder, a psychologist heading the facility\u2019s addiction programme. \u201cSoon after, a very bourgeois-looking elderly couple asked for our help: the husband had gambled away all their money.\u201d Since then Feder says he has treated patients of all ages and walks of life. Pavia was shocked to hit the headlines this way, but not everybody simply accepted the news: a small group of residents self-organised into a grassroots movement called SenzaSlot (\u201cwithout slot machines\u201d) to fight the addiction. Their efforts are finally bearing fruit. \u201cOne day I went into a bar and I could not hear the noise of the spoon with which I was mixing sugar in my coffee because of the noise of coins being inserted into slot machines,\u201d says the group\u2019s Pietro Pace, a computer scientist. \u201cInside there were people who were burning their entire salary.\u201d Many residents blame the city\u2019s problems on the shift it has experienced since the 1970s, when its mechanical goods industry hit troubled times and its population fell from a high of around 87,000 (it is currently 72,000). Now the main sources of employment are the hospital and the university, and Pavia has become a dormitory city for Milan, the industrial powerhouse to its north. \u201cOn a cultural level, there\u2019s not much to do,\u201d says Giulia Cavaliere, an editor and writer who has lived in Pavia all her life. \u201cIt\u2019s a wealthy city but the mentality here is rather closed. There\u2019s just one movie theatre. The university is the only thing that is keeping the city alive, ensuring a constant flow of young people.\u201d SenzaSlot says these factors all came together to make Pavia particularly susceptible to gambling addiction. In the mid-2000s, after the national government removed restrictions, gaming machines began to spread through the city\u2019s bars and cafes. Suddenly residents would stumble upon a gambling opportunity every time they bought a cappuccino. \u201cThe city filled with slots and video poker machines,\u201d recalls Ludovica Cassetta, another SenzaSlot activist. \u201cIt took a few years, but it was a constant process. We reached the point where bars looked like they were all about gambling, as if regular costumers didn\u2019t matter any more.\u201d By 2013 Pavia had 647 slot machines and the highest per capita spending on gambling in Italy: \u20ac1,600 a year. SenzaSlot\u2019s first project was a website to map the few bars and cafes in the city that did not have slot machines. It now also provides gambling-free bars with a window sticker to highlight their lack of machines and runs events to inform residents, especially schoolchildren, about the dangers of gambling. The group offers legal support to cafe owners who want to remove slot machines from their premises \u2013 which is not as straightforward as it might sound. Pubs and cafes don\u2019t directly operate the machines, which are owned and managed by separate companies that give bar owners a share of revenues. Installing a new slot machine is easy, but removing one can be hard: there is the loss of income (around \u20ac500 to \u20ac750 a month per machine) and the likelihood that the bar will have to pay a penalty (typically around \u20ac8,000 per machine) for breaking a contract. \u201cIf you hold a pair of slot machines in your bar, they bring you \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac1,500 each month, which allows many to pay the rent,\u201d says Riccardo Bernasconi, owner of Sottovento, a slot-free snack bar. He says many bar owners agree to host the machines because the companies that operate them throw in credit card payment systems free of charge. Bernasconi has vowed never to host gaming machines, because most of his customers are students who he feels are too young to understand the dangers. By contrast, Matteo Tacchinardi, owner of the century-old Bar Italia, has hosted gaming machines for more than a decade. He considered getting rid of them but says he could not afford the penalty. \u201cI would have to pay \u20ac8,000 for every machine, and it\u2019s too much for me,\u201d he says. Nevertheless, upset at the sight of his customers \u201cthrowing away their money\u201d, he refuses to change bills into coins if he knows they will be used in the machines. But the SenzaSlot movement has made inroads, and now has the local authorities on its side. The former mayor of Pavia, Massimo Depaoli, introduced restrictions limiting when the machines can operate to eight hours a day \u2013 from 10am to 1pm and 6pm to 11pm \u2013 in an effort to reduce use by vulnerable groups such as children and older people. The city council has also introduced a rule forbidding the opening of any new slot machines within 500 metres of a school, church or retirement community. \u201cUnfortunately, we couldn\u2019t touch the existing slot machines because we have to wait until the end of the contract,\u201d says Depaoli, who stepped down last month. \u201cBut Pavia is not a very large city, so it is hard to find places that don\u2019t fall in the restricted areas.\u201d The municipality has barred slot machines from premises it owns, and offered slot-free bars and cafes longer opening hours on public holidays as an incentive to make the shift. The policies appear to be having an effect. By the end of last year, the number of gambling machines in Pavia had fallen from 642 to 547, with the per capita spend down 25% to \u20ac1,200. The SenzaSlot activists, meanwhile, welcome the latest moves but say the wider fight is not yet won. \u201cTrue, our city is trying to limit slots,\u201d says Cassetta, \u201cbut the fact is there are plenty of towns nearby that don\u2019t have any anti-slot regulations. People can just go there to gamble.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "A cold-water cure?

An oak, Quercus robur. It\u2019s yelling at us, \u2018Helloooo!\u2019\u201d says Wim Hof, the doyen of cold endurance stunts, as we head across Hampstead Heath, north London, for a swim in one of the ponds. Soon he\u2019s catapulting himself into a gaping hole in its trunk, peeping out excitedly like a child. \u201cHere I am, talking to the tree,\u201d he beams. \u201cI see the tree has personality. I go in. We are one. It\u2019s alive. We are alive. Is that crazy? Bloody crazy! Yes I am.\u201d Best known for trying to scale Mount Everest in only a pair of shorts and hiking boots, Hof has broken more world records than even he can count. His feats include a near-fatal 57-metre swim under ice during which he went temporarily blind, and a barefoot half-marathon in the Arctic. He\u2019s also immersed himself in a tub of ice for almost two hours, warmed only by the power of his mind and self-styled breathing techniques. Scientists have begun studying his methods to evaluate if they can offer universal benefits to people. \u201cLive your body, stimulate your body,\u201d he implores. \u201cArthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, psoriasis, depression \u2013 all of those diseases are a result of our neglected biochemistry. We need to be stimulated to help fight disease. Cold is a great stimulator.\u201d Hof and I have come to the pond for what feels like a sort of graduation. A day earlier, I attended a \u201cWim Hof Method\u201d workshop at London\u2019s Roundhouse to learn about his breathing techniques and how regular cold immersion could boost my immune system and reduce chronic inflammation within my body. Today I\u2019m testing my tolerance to nature\u2019s elements. I\u2019m not the only one. Cold-water swimming has enjoyed a huge surge in popularity in recent years, with the Outdoor Swimming Society growing from 300 followers in 2006 to 40,000 members this year. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tribe,\u201d says the society\u2019s founder, Kate Rew. \u201cIt used to be an eccentric thing, people doing it once or twice as a dare, but now it has an entire identity. It gives you such a feeling of mental calmness and physical robustness that it turns people into missionaries. Everyone who tries it tells their friends and they bring another five people.\u201d As I stand on the jetty looking out across the pond \u2013 the bright spring sunshine flaring off the water\u2019s surface \u2013 I\u2019m concerned about the water temperature. I was told by one enthusiast that between 0 and 5C is considered cold, \u201cbut if it gets up to six you\u2019re not ice swimming\u201d. I sheepishly turn towards the lifeguard\u2019s hut to see today\u2019s temperature scrawled on the chalkboard: \u201c7C,\u201d it says. \u201cIs this cheating?\u201d I ask Hof, who is already topless. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s still cold,\u201d he assures me. Superhero ___________________________ It\u2019s 24 hours earlier, and I am lying on a yoga mat at the nearby Roundhouse under a haze of purple lights, breathing intently. \u201cFully in, fully out. Fully in, fully out,\u201d cries Hof from the stage, as more than 700 people hyperventilate in unison. Among them are yoga teachers, life coaches, cold-water swimmers, medical professionals and those, such as Tomasz Radecki from Poland, who have simply been inspired by Hof\u2019s message of hope. \u201cI first saw Wim on YouTube and he said, \u2018anything inside us is within our reach\u2019 and \u2018whatever limitations we set ourselves, it\u2019s all bullshit\u2019,\u201d Radecki recalls. \u201cTo me it was like being an ordinary person and suddenly realising that I can be a superhero, too.\u201d Breathing is one of the three main pillars of the Wim Hof Method, alongside cold exposure and commitment. Over a period of 30 minutes, Hof instructs us to fill our lungs rapidly before emptying them passively, in a fashion developed from an ancient Tibetan technique, Tummo. Every so often we hold our breath for as long as we can. The idea is to mimic the natural gasping reflex we experience when we enter cold environments, thereby decreasing the amount of CO2 in our bodies. Nick (above) reacts during the breathing exercise at the Wim Hof Method event. Photographs by Jonny Weeks Soon the effect is so intoxicating that the muscles in my forearms contract, my arms raise involuntarily from my chest and my fingers curl into claws. Around me, people are writhing on their mats, some weeping or howling like wolves. \u201cRelease all trauma. Liberate. Your future. Your mind. Your soul. Who are you? What are you?\u201d urges Hof, before stepping off-stage to attend to Wayne Sequoia, whose limbs are jerking so violently it rouses me from my stupor. \u201cI left my body,\u201d Sequoia tells me afterwards, his speech slow and slurred. \u201cI had this intense feeling; I did a somersault over or through myself. It was a complete loss of control, death, I don\u2019t know. It felt like a huge healing.\u201d Another participant, Nick, is similarly delirious. \u201cMy wife gave birth to two children not long ago and I can really say I felt the birthing process in my gut,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a physician and if somebody told me this would happen today I would think they\u2019re crazy. It was completely amazing.\u201d But not everyone is euphoric. \u201cI just wanted to cry, to sob, but I couldn\u2019t let it out,\u201d says Karren Probyn. \u201cIt seemed like there was no end.\u201d Fight or flight ___________________________ True to Hof\u2019s eccentric character, the 60-year-old\u2019s first experience of cold water was spontaneous. Aged 17 and wandering alongside a frozen canal in Amsterdam, he felt a sudden urge to jump in. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t know why but you feel attracted to do something,\u201d he explains. For many years thereafter, Hof was a local oddity known as the \u201cIce Man\u201d, a guy who would walk his children to school barefoot and do handstands and splits in the snow while the other parents looked at him perplexed. \u201cThey stood there smoking, saying, \u2018Look at him, he\u2019s crazy\u2019,\u201d he says. Over time, opinion slowly changed. Wim Hof at Hampstead Heath men\u2019s pond. Photograph by Jonny Weeks The tragedy of his first wife\u2019s suicide in 1995, as a consequence of her schizophrenia, fomented his belief that cold-water swimming \u2013 and his breathing techniques \u2013 are a panacea for inflammatory diseases. \u201cWe are estranged from our own deeper physiology because we are no longer in contact with nature,\u201d he explains. \u201cInstead, we are controlling nature with air pollution, heating, technology. But you have to know you have a depth within yourself which needs to be stimulated. If it doesn\u2019t get stimulated it becomes weaker, like a muscle that\u2019s not being used any more.\u201d Hof claims his method activates the body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d adrenal response, which in turn reduces chronic inflammation. What\u2019s more, he claims he can regulate his immune response to stress \u2013 a feat previously considered impossible because the immune system is autonomic. Scientists have begun to pore over his theories. In one logic-defying experiment, he was able to maintain his core body temperature while encased in ice. In another he was injected with an E coli endotoxin that would ordinarily induce sickness, yet he showed no major symptoms. Accusations that he is simply a freak of nature were quashed when he taught a group of volunteers his methods and they, too, showed the same remarkable results. Professor Peter Pickkers, of Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, who conducted the E coli tests, told me: \u201cWe found that [his method] results in major changes in oxygen and CO2 levels and an increase in adrenaline to really high levels \u2013 higher than observed in people who bungee-jump for the first time. \u201cHigher adrenaline results in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and this inhibits the inflammatory response. We were really surprised that we found these results. The fact that you can influence your immune response willingly with these techniques is of interest, especially for patients with autoimmune diseases.\u201d However, he cautions: \u201cWe are very reluctant to say it may cure diseases because we have so little data. Assuming there is a beneficial effect, my guess would be that the effects can only be there as long as you practise the techniques \u2013 likely not longer than a day.\u201d Watching Hof on stage, it\u2019s clear that his desire to help others is genuine, even if his evangelical tone and occasional hyperbole could stoke a cultish faith among those seeking \u201cwellness\u201d. \u201cAnybody is able to doubt me,\u201d Hof says. \u201cI say, \u2018Come with your criticism to polish the diamond of the truth.\u2019 People need to wake up to their own power. Everybody has this nature.\u201d Feel-good factor ___________________________ Participants take an ice bath at the Wim Hof Method event. Photographs by Jonny Weeks Back at the Roundhouse, a line of half-naked people is snaking out into the car park for the day\u2019s big challenge. Everyone is waiting to enter the four inflatable paddling pools, which are being filled with ice. The first participants gingerly lower themselves in, motivated by a combination of peer pressure and willpower. Two minutes \u2013 that\u2019s their target. For some the experience is visibly excruciating; for others it\u2019s a thrilling sensation. One woman buries her head face-down in the ice and emerges 10 seconds later with a broad smile. The man next to her seems put off by such showboating and quits after a minute. Catherine Girvan climbs out and begins performing the \u201chorse stance\u201d to warm up. \u201cI was swimming in the pond at Hampstead Heath up until November last year when my husband passed away,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThis is my first time [practising cold immersion] since then, and I got a bit of a shock, but I really enjoyed it. It\u2019s all about the endorphins, the serotonin, the feel-good factor. I\u2019m 73 and I\u2019m not on a pill so something\u2019s working.\u201d Catherine Girvan (above) doing the \u2018horse stance\u2019 after her ice bath Exactly what is \u201cworking\u201d remains a mystery, however. A 2017 review of past scientific studies, titled \u201cCold water immersion: kill or cure\u201d, found a bounty of evidence dating back to the 16th century regarding the potential health implications of cold-water immersion. Its co-author, Michael Tipton, professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth, says: \u201cI believe that cold-water immersion works for a lot of people but we can\u2019t say precisely why. \u201cThere\u2019s an absolute raft of anecdotal evidence but what it can\u2019t tell you is whether the benefits are derived from going into the open air, being with friends, exercising, or being in the cold. There\u2019s not yet been a study that has isolated the cold factor. \u201cThe closest we\u2019ve come was a study of upper respiratory tract infections, where we found that people who go cold- and open-water swimming have fewer infections than their partners who are exposed to the same pathogens. However we also found that they don\u2019t have fewer infections than people who go indoor swimming [in heated water]. So the jury is still out.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt may be that cold-water swimming works for people because of a placebo effect. But so what? If it works for them and if it\u2019s not harmful, and if it\u2019s removing their dependency on drugs, then great.\u201d After my turn in the ice bath, my body feels unexpectedly warm, so much so I don\u2019t even rush to dry off or get dressed; I\u2019m supercharged with adrenaline for at least an hour. Birthright ___________________________ On the jetty at Hampstead ponds the following morning, Hof is getting changed when Dermot Sullivan, a regular cold-water swimmer, requests a picture. \u201cDo you know about the new documentary, The Ponds?\u201d he asks. \u201cSome of their stories really shook me up. People have had depression, cancer, they\u2019re going through bereavement, and they come here. One woman said, \u2018If you can cope with two-degree water, you can cope with anything.\u2019\u201d On a personal note, he adds: \u201cFor me it doesn\u2019t resolve life\u2019s problems, but it\u2019s like momentum.\u201d Jonny Weeks (above) after swimming at the men\u2019s pond Hof offers encouragement before racing down the ladder into the water. As I hesitate, I\u2019m reminded of his earlier words at the oak tree: \u201cMy mission is to bring happiness, strength and health to all. It\u2019s a birthright,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you want to become strong, happy and healthy, you\u2019d better do this shit.\u201d \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The proposals are part of a growing debate on how to radically change humanity\u2019s relationship with nature in the wake of a new UN mega-report that showed an alarming decline in the Earth\u2019s life-support systems. They were presented by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) at the meeting this weekend in Metz, France, of environment ministers from the G7 nations \u2013 the US, Germany, Japan, the UK, Canada, France and Italy \u2013 along with observers including India, Indonesia, Mexico and Egypt. The head of the OECD, Angel Gurr\u00eda, told the gathering the world was heading for catastrophe as a result of the degradation of nature and needed a new culture that \u201crespects nature and life\u201d. He pointed out that environment-related taxes currently accounted for only 1.6% of global economic output. And only a hundredth of that fraction generated revenue for biodiversity. \u201cIt\u2019s microscopic,\u201d said Gurr\u00eda. \u201cSo what our tax policies essentially tell us is that we do not care about biodiversity. There is potential to scale these up, while also protecting the poorest and most vulnerable from their effects.\u201d The balance of incentives also needs to shift, according to the OECD report he unveiled, which found that finance flows for biodiversity may be as little as $50bn (\u00a338bn) a year, which is just a tenth of the subsidies paid to fossil fuel companies and agribusiness, the main drivers for the climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse. A switch of priorities could redirect economic systems towards natural growth rather than material extraction, but it will be politically difficult. Many legislators rely on financial backing from energy companies and farm lobbies to win elections. The main stock indexes in London, New York and Tokyo are heavily dependent on mining and petroleum companies. Millions of jobs are at stake. But the potential economic benefits are far greater, according to both the OECD and the UN, especially when compared with the trillions of dollars that are already being lost each year as a result of climate instability, soil erosion, pollinator loss and water pollution. The primary lever for change is financial incentives and capacity building, according to the global assessment report that was launched on Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Ipbes). The authors said they had considered a variety of scenarios but the only one that was likely to have an effect was \u201ctransformative change\u201d, which required new economic models, less reliance on GDP, a cross-governmental focus on the environment, and a review of values so that concepts of happiness were no longer associated so closely with material consumption. Unusually for UN reports \u2013 which depend on consensus \u2013 the study predicted a confrontation over remedial policies. \u201cBy its very nature, transformative change can expect opposition from those with interests vested in the status quo, but such opposition can be overcome for the broader public good,\u201d it said. The recommended measures are by definition world-changing. They also include more ecological education and greater recognition of the rights of indigenous communities and other forest dwellers, who have proved the most effective defenders of nature. Public opinion has become more receptive of change in many countries. School strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests have raised the profile of the multiple environmental crises the world faces. Politicians in the US and Europe are pushing for green new deals that would create more jobs in renewables and nature restoration. Scientists are increasingly speaking out about the alarming trends. \u201cPlace the Ipbes report next to the IPCC 1.5C report and you have a full picture of a planetary emergency. Science cannot be more clear. The world needs to transform. Now,\u201d tweeted the climate scientist Johan Rockstr\u00f6m. Such messages are increasingly finding an audience among economists, financiers and bankers as the costs of inaction become clearer. The head of the UN\u2019s biodiversity organisation, Cristiana Pa\u015fca Palmer, said she was encouraged by the growing debate, which comes ahead of a series of global meetings between now and a pivotal conference in Kunming, China, in 2020 that aims to reset international strategies for dealing with the climate and nature crises. \u201cLoss of nature is fundamentally an economic problem,\u201d said the former biologist. \u201cSolutions and tools are available to avert the crisis but it requires scaled-up investment flows for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, as well as incentives to change the way we consume, produce and dispose of material goods. Above all, it requires a profound change in the fundamentals of growth models and development paradigms to recognise the value of natural capital.\u201d But there is also a strong and growing argument that the concept of capital itself is at the root of the planet\u2019s current problems because current economic models are predicated on endless growth, extraction and consumption \u2013 which are impossible on a finite planet. Instead of tallying the value of nature in dollars, which could simply lead to further commodification, many people believe nature should be recognised for its essential, incalculable role as the foundation of life. This flips the debate: instead of justifying nature in economic terms, it should be up to businesses to justify their activities in environmental terms. This is not yet on the table of most global conferences. But for the first time in many years, there is a high-level debate about the destructive nature of the current economic model. The next step, says scientists, is for the issue to be taken up by heads of state at this summer\u2019s G7 summit in France and for people on the streets to continue pushing for a decisive move away from business as usual.

Nearby is the Dzhumaya mosque with its mix of Byzantine and Old Bulgarian architectural styles. The unhurried atmosphere is typical of the laidback character of Plovdiv, one of Europe\u2019s oldest continuously inhabited cities. It is this relaxed pace of life, combined with affordable living expenses and the city\u2019s expanding IT sector, that is attracting a new type of citizen to the city: young Bulgarian returnees disillusioned with life abroad. Maria Stancheva, 25, moved with her mother to the UK in search of a better life. Ten years ago, Bulgarians abroad could support their families with one salary. Now, with political upheavals such as Brexit and changing financial markets, foreign capitals are no longer so attractive. This is certainly true for Stancheva, who studied international relations and human resources in Cardiff for four years. On graduation she found it impossible to get a job in her field. After visiting a career fair aimed at Bulgarians in the UK she realised her skills were needed \u2013 in Bulgaria. Now a recruitment specialist at the Plovdiv-based outsourcing company 60k, Stancheva says: \u201cMy salary is low, but my living standards here are better.\u201d Reflecting on her decision to return, Stancheva points out that for Bulgarians, the grass is not always greener in another country. \u201cWe face challenges and uncertainty. With a potential Brexit it can get worse for Bulgarians in the UK.\u201d Bulgaria has experienced a huge dip in its population over the past 20 years, falling from nearly 9 million to just over 7 million at the end of 2017, according to the National Statistical Institute (NSI). Current forecasts predict that by 2050 the population will have shrunk by another quarter. Emigration explains two-thirds of this loss (the remaining third is due to declining birth rates). In 2017, 31,586 Bulgarians changed their current address to one abroad. \u201cWe have an entire Bulgarian capital living abroad,\u201d says Stancheva. It is not simply that huge numbers of Bulgarians are leaving: also, every second emigrant is young, in the 20-39 age bracket, according to the NSI. The most popular destinations for Bulgarians heading abroad are Germany (22%), the UK (16.3%) and Spain (12.2%). But in Plovdiv, Bulgaria\u2019s second-largest city, newcomers outnumbered leavers in 2017, defying the national trend. Statistics from the office of the mayor, Ivan Totev, show a 7% increase in 20- to 29-year-olds in the city. \u201cWe are already reversing the brain drain, by offering young Bulgarians a lifestyle they could not afford abroad,\u201d said Svetoslav Braykov, 60k\u2019s regional manager, speaking from the company\u2019s offices in a tall corporate building squeezed between old Soviet apartment blocks on the outskirts of town. \u201cPeople are still leaving Bulgaria, but before they did not return.\u201d The company employs 1,550 people in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital, and Plovdiv and offers work to students and graduates in the early stages of their careers. It appears to target its recruitment strategy at those whose experience abroad did not live up to their expectations. Traditionally, Plovdiv\u2019s largest employer has been the manufacturing sector, but since the city began to reinvent itself as a European hub for urban development in 2014, the IT sector and its higher-than-average wages has been at the forefront of the city\u2019s image. Outsourcing companies are also keen to copy cities such as Tallinn in Estonia and add \u201cdigital nomad\u201d to Plovdiv\u2019s employment options. It is not just Brexit that has made returning home seem attractive. \u201cWe\u2019ve benefited from the instability in Europe, and the economic crisis in other EU countries, such as Spain and Greece,\u201d says Totev, the mayor. The city is small, with a current population of 345,000, which may work in its favour. Local business investors describe Sofia as overcrowded, with unwelcome competition from other companies. Indeed, in 2017 the labour market in Plovdiv and surrounding commuter towns increased by 38,000 people, more than any other region in the country, according to data provided by the mayor\u2019s office. But not everyone is convinced the city is experiencing a renaissance. Critics claim the mayor\u2019s office might have altered the statistics to present a more flattering picture. \u201cThe mayor built a hotel with our tax money,\u201d said a 29-year-old business owner who wanted to remain anonymous. Such accusations are common, with many denouncing Totev as an oligarch and pointing to allegations and investigations into his financial dealings by various Bulgarian news outlets. Some are also disappointed with projects affiliated with the city\u2019s trendy creative district, Kapana. Locals complain that instead of investing in the artists who made the district popular in the first place, authorities have instead supported commercial shops and bars to attract tourists, killing off the atmosphere and turning the district into a dead end. Meanwhile, life in the city goes on at the same calm pace. Drinking local wine in a downtown bar, 30-year-old Ivan Dzheferov, a community manager from the startup hub Trakia Tech, is joking about Plovdiv\u2019s guiding philosophy, aylyak. In Turkish, the word means \u201cidle\u201d; for Bulgarians it means not to hurry pointlessly \u2013 if there is a job that needs to be done, it can be postponed. The city\u2019s population might be increasing, but there is little sign the pace of life will change.

They are many and compelling: vaccine-doubters, conspiracy theorists, arch-pessimists and even people who approve of Theresa May. The danger however is that these newspoints can give us a certain impression about the world: that outliers are the norm, that eccentrics are far more prevalent than they actually are. But the YouGov-Cambridge Globalism survey of more than 25,000 people in 23 countries, which the Guardian unveiled this week, is actually remarkable for the unremarkable things it points out. In this age of extremes and opposites, most people are pretty normal. They tend to like Italian food, watch American telly, travel a little abroad. If there is one word that captures (most people\u2019s) politics, it is probably \u201cmoderate\u201d. They tend to trust local media and television news but \u2013 not without justification \u2013 distrust social media and government officials. Most people think it\u2019s bad for immigrants to come specifically to claim benefits in a new country. But most think it\u2019s OK for them to come to flee war. Yes, many people \u2013 particularly in the developed world \u2013 are gloomy about future prospects for their own country and for the world itself. But when asked about their own prospects, there are more optimists than pessimists. Deep down people have not given up hope. Most people think the UN is OK; most are suspicious of banks and pharmaceutical companies. Conspiracy theories may be popular among populists, but overall relatively few people believe hoaxes about 9/11, aliens, the Holocaust or Aids. Most think that most jobs are equally suited to both genders. Most acknowledge that minorities and gay and transgender people still face discrimination. Most support abortion and gay sex. Whatever else this era is, it is not a throwback to the 1950s. Most feel a keen sense of belonging, both to their local community and their country \u2013 very high numbers are at least a little patriotic and say that buying local produce is important. Most are worried about climate change, and the direction of travel for both health and education. The vast majority do not see themselves as part of an elite, and believe it would be very hard to become so. Catholic countries are pretty positive towards Christianity. Muslim-majority countries tend to have a favourable impression of Islam. Each are rather uncomfortable with the other\u2019s religion. A lot of the questions give people a sliding scale to record their answers, from one extreme (agree very strongly) to the other (disagree strongly). On a great many issues \u2013 from globalisation to ethical shopping, and from fashion to small business regulation \u2013 the majority cluster towards the centre ground in a classic bell curve. This is true even in places where we may have expected to find a yawning chasm \u2013 such as between Britain\u2019s leavers and remainers, who have a surprising amount in common. The conclusion is that we are more similar than we think. It is only when forced into binary-choice boxes that it looks like we are all extremists, ranged against each other. Last year, the German newspaper Die Zeit ran a little experiment. The paper posted a rather simplistic questionnaire on its website, asking readers yes/no questions: should German borders be freely opened? Should cars be banned from cities? Is Trump bad for America? When thousands had answered, they then paired up hundreds of people who had answered yes to all the questions with people who had answered no. They challenged the pairings to find things they had in common. The upshot was remarkable. \u201cYou would expect a lot of clashes in their debates but when I heard from them, it really gave me goosebumps because it was the polar opposite,\u201d said Bastian Berbner, a reporter on the project. \u201cThey all said after a couple of minutes that we realised we are not that far apart. \u201cWhen you go into nuance and talk about what we really mean we found that we are not that far apart at all,\u201d added Berbner, who is now writing a book called 180 Degrees: Stories Against Hate. \u201cPeople have their stereotypes and as soon as they meet they fall apart and get replaced by the things we have in common.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Why cities could hold the key to many of the world's problems", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/03/upside-weekly-report-cities-world-problems-change", "date": "2019-05-03", "transcript": "Who has the answers?

There is another subset of power, agency, ideas and progress that often gets overlooked in the search for solutions to the world\u2019s problems. There are estimated to be upwards of 4,000 cities around the world with more than 100,000 inhabitants. They are a burgeoning political, economic and social force, often able to implement change more deftly and decisively than national governments. Witness congestion charges, bike sharing, digital hubs, green energy solutions, even immigration protection.

Watch this space for more great examples of urban renewal. Data A slew of opinion poll data published exclusively by the Guardian this week is worth reflecting on. It asked 25,000 people worldwide for views on globalisation, populism, immigration and nationhood. The results told us what we know deep down but often forget in the daily hurly-burly: most people are pretty moderate, sensible and conciliatory. (A lot are pessimistic though \u2013 and clearly need to sign up to the Upside.) They are also generally a bit less hostile to immigration than previously thought. What we liked This University of Washington article on what triggers compulsive smartphone use, and what we might do to keep our phone habits in check. Also this Huff Post piece about a teacher encouraging her pupils to be open about their mental health, with a \u201cwall of feelings\u201d. What we heard Poor health and social isolation is often due to GPs, the NHS (and the medical model) not opening up to community groups. The solution is for them to do so.

He was 14. Neo-Nazis were gaining a foothold in Kung\u00e4lv, an industrial borough of 20,000 people on the west coast, for the first time since the second world war. Sweden\u2019s economy had stuttered in the early 1990s after a financial crisis and its politics were in flux. Twenty-four years later, Sweden\u2019s neo-Nazis are again targeting Muslims and Jews, buoyed by anti-immigrant sentiment in the country that has seen the radical nationalist Sweden Democrats make electoral gains. After terrorists attacked two mosques in New Zealand in March, killing 50, the massacre was hailed by members of the so-called Nordic Resistance Movement, an openly Nazi group. And today, 1 May, the group is marching in uniforms through Kung\u00e4lv city, which it is targeting because of its historical links to Sweden\u2019s war-time Nazis. But Kung\u00e4lv has changed over the past two decades. Galvanised by Hron\u2019s murder, the municipality has developed a quietly successful initiative to prevent recruitment of young people by racists. After the tragedy, Kung\u00e4lv hired Christer Mattsson, a local teacher and researcher, to plan its response. He says the problem was not Kung\u00e4lv as a whole, but small parts of it: \u201cHate is always local.\u201d So he and his co-researchers created the Tolerance Project, starting with Ytterby, a large school where the neo-Nazis were very active. \u201cBack then we had a big problem at the school, a lot of trouble with neo-Nazis in the neighbourhood,\u201d says Ther\u00e9se Kraffke, the school\u2019s headteacher. In 2001, Kraffke, Mattsson and other teachers started to hold workshops with a mixed group of girls aged 14 to 16, including those who hung out with the skinheads. \u201cThe skinhead core was mainly boys,\u201d Kraffke says. \u201cWe reasoned that if the girls stopped supporting them, they wouldn\u2019t have people around them.\u201d The culmination of the project was a week-long trip to significant Holocaust sites in Poland for which students had to hand over their phones, ensuring their attention was concentrated on their experience and the group around them. The visit encouraged each student to think about who they were, what shaped their attitudes, and how to deal with emotions such as anger. Madeleine, who asked that her surname not be used, was one of the first girls to participate. Aged 14, Madeleine had started to shave her head and wear boots and a bomber jacket just like the neo-Nazis. She scrawled SS symbols around Kung\u00e4lv and hung out with white supremacists, drinking and smoking. \u201cIt was just a cool thing, but it was starting to mean something,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI started yelling at people with dark skin, being really aggressive. \u201cIn my group, to be angry and hateful was seen as good thing \u2013 my identity was the hard girl who is angry all the time. The climate was so bad at the school against black people, Muslims and Jews. The white people were the \u2018right\u2019 people.\u201d As part of the Tolerance Project, Madeleine started to mix with girls from other backgrounds. They talked about why people hate each other and learned about the Holocaust. During her six months on the project, she found herself for the first time among people who listened to her and respected her. \u201cI think about what would have happened to me without that experience. I would probably be a Nazi\u2019s girlfriend today,\u201d says Madeleine, now 31 and a teaching assistant. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the network around me to get out of it.\u201d The approach has become known as the \u201cKung\u00e4lv model\u201d for tackling racism among teenagers, and its techniques are practised in more than 60 schools in Sweden. In Kung\u00e4lv itself, the programme has inoculated a generation of young people against right-wing extremism. Loa Ek took part in the Tolerance Project in 2012. She was 14 and by her own admission a difficult child who was skipping classes and failing exams. \u201cIt was hard for me to keep my mouth shut at first but I calmed down \u2013 nobody judged me,\u201d says Ek, 21. \u201cIt was a safe space \u2013 it helped me to understand and control myself. We learned how easy it is to manipulate people through racism.\u201d Ek\u2019s outspoken nature now has other targets. \u201cIt irritates me so much when people don\u2019t like immigrants,\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them to go read some books.\u201d Breaking down the barriers between groups of school students is key to success, according to Maarten van Zalk, professor of developmental psychology at the University of Osnabr\u00fcck in Germany, whose research has measured the impact of the Kung\u00e4lv model on pupils\u2019 outlook and opinions. \u201cWhen you are part of a racist subculture, it is unlikely you will interact with immigrant students,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the Tolerance Project they are strongly encouraged to engage, and with the engagement they break the circle. The more they break that circle, the higher the level of tolerance.\u201d A 2013 study backed by diversity and anti-racism organisations estimated that the economic benefits of the project, measured in terms of preventing damage to society caused by neo-Nazi gangs, outweighed the investment required by a factor of 20. A 2018 study by a researcher at Birmingham University concluded that the project had led to \u201can increased sense of security, less vulnerability, and most important of all, less hatred\u201d. Cristine Lysell, who is currently in charge of upper secondary school education for Kung\u00e4lv council, saw for herself the changes at Ytterby school, where she was a teacher when the neo-Nazis were at their height. \u201cThe racism started to disappear \u2013 it became more calm and students started to react when they heard people express racist views,\u201d Lysell says. \u201cEveryone in the school was standing up for integration. Then we began to realise the hard work was paying off.\u201d Today the neo-Nazis do not recruit from Ytterby school, Kraffke says. \u201cThey are strong here, their leader lives nearby. But they don\u2019t target the school, they have nothing to get from us.\u201d A student from a neighbouring school was so moved by her experience of the Tolerance Project that she and some friends organised a memorial concert for John Hron, 20 years after his death. Some 5,000 people took part. \u201cWe called it Together for Kung\u00e4lv \u2013 instead of saying we hate the racists, we wanted a message that was positive and inclusive,\u201d says Louise Eklund, now 21. \u201cWe wanted to show a society where everyone can feel safe and happy and live their lives, where we can understand that people are different.\u201d In 2015 the project\u2019s success led to the establishment of the Segerstedt Institute at Gothenburg University, with the aim of developing and spreading the Kung\u00e4lv model. The institute trains teachers and social workers to apply the methodology in their own environments, tailoring it to the specifics of youth culture and style. \u201cDoing so requires a highly complex, situated knowledge, the understanding of the local context \u2013 you have to be part of the fabric,\u201d says Mattsson, who now runs the institute. Each year, more than 800 Swedish school students go through the Kung\u00e4lv model. But nobody should be tempted to think the work has been done and the problem is retreating, Mattsson says. \u201cIf we stop doing this job, the racism will resurface in a different form in a year, five or 10 years, we don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cRacism is not something you can get rid of \u2013 it is an ongoing battle.\u201d For Madeleine, neo-Nazi marches such as today\u2019s are not the only reason the Kung\u00e4lv model remains so necessary. \u201cWhen Notre Dame cathedral was burning, on Facebook [people] started blaming Muslims straight away,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryday racism is growing in the whole of Sweden.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Leeds becomes first UK city to lower its childhood obesity rate", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/01/leeds-becomes-first-uk-city-to-lower-its-childhood-obesity-rate", "date": "2019-05-01", "transcript": "Leeds has become the first city in the UK to report a drop in childhood obesity after introducing a programme to help parents set boundaries for their children and say no to sweets and junk food. Only a few cities in the world, notably Amsterdam, have managed to cut child obesity. Like Amsterdam, the decline in Leeds is most marked among families living in the most deprived areas, where the problem is worst and hardest to tackle. \u201cThe improvement in the most deprived children in Leeds is startling,\u201d said Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at Oxford University, whose team has analysed the city\u2019s data. Over four years, obesity has dropped from 11.5% to 10.5% and the trajectory is steadily downwards. Among the more affluent families, there was also a decline from 6.8% to 6%. Overall the drop was from 9.4% to 8.8%. The data comes from the national child measurement programme (NCMP), which requires all children to be weighed at the start and end of primary school. The biggest decline in obesity in Leeds is 6.4% in the reception class, at about the age of four. From 2016 to 2017, 625 fewer reception class children were obese. No such data has been reported elsewhere in the UK, where childhood obesity is a major concern. Almost a third (28%) of all children aged two to 15 in England are overweight or obese. The measurement programme shares the progress made in each city with those considered comparable. For Leeds, the 15 closest \u201cneighbours\u201d at the start of the study period in 2009 were Sheffield, Kirklees, Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne, Coventry, Bolton, Wakefield, Derby, Bradford, Dudley, Medway, Liverpool, Swindon, County Durham and Warrington. The obesity rates there and across the country have not shifted. \u201cFor England it\u2019s absolutely flat,\u201d said Jebb, who added that the dropping rate in Leeds appeared to be a trend. \u201cThis is four years, not one rogue data point,\u201d she said at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow where she presented the research, also published in the journal Paediatric Obesity. \u201cEverybody is going around saying Amsterdam is doing something amazing. Well, actually, Leeds is too.\u201d Jebb, a former government adviser, says they cannot be sure what has turned the tide in Leeds \u2013 but it could involve a programme called Henry that the city introduced as the core of its obesity strategy in 2009, focusing particularly on the youngest children and poorest families. Henry (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young) supports parents in setting boundaries for their children and taking a firm stance on issues from healthy eating to bedtimes. Henry\u2019s chief executive, Kim Roberts, said the drop in obesity in Leeds was \u201cunprecedented \u2026 The indicators are that this isn\u2019t happening in other cities.\u201d The programme encourages authoritative rather than authoritarian parenting, she said. \u201cAuthoritarian parenting is when children are told what to eat and what to do, such as being banned from leaving the table until they have eaten their sprouts,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cPermissive parenting is asking children what they want to do. \u201cBut Henry encourages a third approach known as authoritative parenting, where parents make it clear they are in charge, but also respond to their children.\u201d Instead of being asked what vegetable they want with dinner, children might be asked whether they would like carrots or broccoli. Instead of being told to go to bed, they are asked where they want to read their bedtime story. Instead of telling a child to stop watching television, a parent could ask whether they would like to turn the television off or whether the parent should do it. Lisa, who joined a Henry parenting course when her oldest daughter was two, is enthusiastic about her family\u2019s experience of the programme. Her children now eat sweet potato and beetroot. She learned a lot about healthy eating, saved money by planning meals and lost two stone herself. \u201cI think it made me a better parent because of all the parenting skills stuff. I was able to share some of the ideas with my partner and as a result the kids became calmer and happier, which helped us feel less stressed too,\u201d she said. Kayleigh constantly argued with her daughter, who had just started school and was overweight. \u201cLexi had a very limited diet and whenever I tried to get her to try anything new she would reject it, so I stuck to what I knew she would eat,\u201d she said. The programme inspired her to take Lexi to the park to chase the dog. She turned the television off at mealtimes and introduced healthy food choices. \u201cMy confidence as a parent was increasing as the weeks went by. I became more conscious about responding to Lexi\u2019s needs while still remaining in charge, like understanding that she would act up sometimes because she needed some attention and balancing that with what I needed to do,\u201d she said. Janice Burberry, the head of public health at Leeds city council, said the early years were a good time to intervene to support families. \u201cParents want to do the best for their children. During pregnancy they are more receptive to change, they want to give their children the best start,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to focus on prevention because it\u2019s very, very difficult when obesity has taken hold to tackle it. \u201cWe understand that there is no magic bullet here. Parents are experts in their own lives and they know what they can and can\u2019t achieve. The strategy of Henry is about sitting alongside parents and thinking through what\u2019s right for them.\u201d The public health minister, Seema Kennedy, was enthusiastic. \u201cThere are some fantastic pockets of work happening in early years already, and while still in the early phases, it is encouraging to see what can be achieved locally through interventions like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how hard it can be for busy parents to make healthy choices for their families, so anything that can make it easier is a real lifeline.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 May 2019 to use a different chart type in order to add clarity to the presentation of data.

Young Venetians had skipped school to join the global youth climate strike, holding placards with statements such as \u201cIf climate was a bank, you\u2019d save it.\u201d The movement is especially relevant in Venice, since a 50cm rise in sea levels could see the city vanish beneath the waves. Critical as the climate crisis is, the city faces a more immediate risk: the rising tide of tourists, presently estimated at 25 million a year and projected to reach 38 million by 2025. Europe, already the world\u2019s largest tourism market, received 713 million international visitors in 2018, an 8% increase on the previous year, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. But, in European cities, the increase is far greater: since 2008, overnight stays have jumped 57%. While tourism provides significant economic benefit \u2013 contributing \u20ac2bn annually in gross revenue to Venice alone \u2013 overtourism is causing cities like Barcelona, Amsterdam, Dubrovnik and others to make international headlines on issues ranging from housing affordability, environmental degradation and the destruction of local life. In 2016 in Dubrovnik, residents were outraged when the mayor asked them to stay home to avoid the dangerous levels of crowds disembarking from multiple cruise ships. The new mayor, Mato Frankovic, has since capped the number of cruise ships that can dock in the city at two per day, cut souvenir stalls by 80% and cut restaurant seating in public spaces by 30%. But similar issues of overcrowding in Palma de Mallorca, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Prague and Salzburg have brought locals out into the streets in increasingly impassioned protests. One of the most dramatic was Venice\u2019s 2016 No Grandi Navi (\u201cNo Big Ships\u201d) protest, when locals took to the Giudecca Canal in small fishing boats to block the passage of six colossal cruise ships. And, although plans have been announced this year to reroute the largest ships to a new dock in Marghera (still to be built), campaigners still argue for a dock outside the lagoon at the Lido, where heavy cargo ships historically unloaded. This is just one of the ways the Venetian Republic safeguarded the equilibrium of the lagoon and the complex system of commerce around it. In fact, the act of sustaining the lagoon for over a millennium is a singular human achievement, because a lagoon by definition is a temporary natural phenomenon. Venice\u2019s lagoon would have silted in 500 years ago if it hadn\u2019t been for careful environmental protection, sensitive technical intervention and strict commercial regulation \u2013 a historic blueprint that provides useful lessons for tourism. A new generation of concerned citizens and entrepreneurs is taking up that challenge, combining grassroots activism with socially sensitive, sustainable initiatives to save their island home. Consider waste. What comes into Venice must be removed again via a complex collection and recycling system. Every day an army of sanitation workers knocks on every door in the city, collecting waste to be ferried away on barges. The same rules and fines, however, do not apply to tourists \u2013 despite the fact that during high season the bins around Piazza San Marco have to be emptied every half an hour. Troubled by the plastic waste generated by their two boutique hotels \u2013 the Novecento and Hotel Flora \u2013 the Romanelli family have taken action, eliminating plastic bottles from their properties, and encouraging guests to use steel flasks at Venice\u2019s historic water fountains, for which they supply a map. \u201cWe don\u2019t pretend to be [Leonardo] DiCaprio, but through these small actions we hope to do something positive,\u201d says the owner, Gioele Romanelli. With just 50 rooms and 40 members of staff, they calculate they save 36,000 plastic bottles a year. Multiply that by the estimated 40,000 guest beds in Venice \u2013 to say nothing of restaurants or the waste unloaded from cruise ships \u2013 and you could save hundreds of millions of plastic bottles a year. \u201cOur children learn about these issues at school and all of them carry their own water flasks, so why not us?\u201d concludes Romanelli\u2019s wife, Heiby. Addressing the issue of waste is only the most tangible effort to create a more sustainable tourism in Venice.This June will see the launch of Fairbnb, a not-for-profit home-sharing site that only permits resident hosts; mandates one home per host; and contributes half of the 15% booking fee to social projects. Their launch is timely. Since 2015, Airbnb tourist rentals in Venice have tripled from 2,441 to 8,320, according to Airdna. Of those, 80% are entire home rentals, many are owned by agencies or foreign investors and a 2018 report by Centro Studi di Federalberghi Nazionale found the most prolific host in the city had 135 listings. Other European cities are responding to similar problems. Barcelona is prosecuting unlicensed apartments and has secured access to Airbnb\u2019s host data in order to pursue offenders. In Madrid, home sharing is now only permitted in houses with their own entrances. Palma, meanwhile, has banned short-term tourist rentals completely in flats that are part of multi-family residential housing, although it is still possible to rent detached homes and villas, provided they are not in a protected area. \u201cWithout significant regulation of the rental market [in Italy], we saw the only way to change things was to provide a market alternative,\u201d says Emanuele dal Carlo, a Venetian who is one of five co-founders of Fairbnb, which crowdfunded for its startup cash. \u201cWe\u2019re not anti-Airbnb \u2013 we just want to show that it\u2019s possible to create a tourism model that works for local communities as well as travellers.\u201d On booking, Fairbnb renters decide which project to support and are invited to visit or participate: in Venice this could mean joining volunteers cleaning graffiti or helping turn a centuries-old squero (boat yard) into an educational centre. \u201cWe want to bring back the connection between tourists and locals that has been lost,\u201d dal Carlo says. \u201cNowadays you can go to a place and virtually never meet a local. But this way you can join them in their real pursuits or even just share a drink together.\u201d This loss of connection between locals and tourists is something that Valeria Duflot and Sebastian Fagarazzi are also concerned with. Their website Venezia Autentica directs tourists to Venice businesses that support a sustainable local economy \u2013 everything from printmakers to photographers, mosaicists to rowers. This is because too few of the city\u2019s 25 million tourists frequent shops and restaurants owned by Venetians, they say. \u201cQuality local businesses definitely need more customers, visitors included,\u201d Duflot says. Across Europe, other grassroots groups are also fighting to preserve local cultures. In 2017, the social movement Morar em Lisboa, in conjunction with 30 local associations, wrote an open letter denouncing Lisbon\u2019s excessive dependency on tourism and real estate speculation. And last May, 14 cities and islands \u2013 10 of them Spanish, alongside Venice, Lisbon and Malta \u2013 joined forces to form the Network of Southern European Cities against Touristification, arguing that mass tourism causes high rents, pollution, the loss of local shops and the proliferation of low-wage jobs. This is what the European Parliament was referring to when, in 2015, it declared that \u201cEuropean tourism must make a transition from a model of quantitative growth to a qualitative model leading to steady and sustainable development.\u201d To kick-start new thinking on the matter, they awarded the inaugural 2019 European Capital of Smart Tourism to Helsinki for the city\u2019s locally-oriented tourism strategy, which is based on sustainability and the assumption that what makes a city attractive to residents will appeal to travellers, too. It is this focus on the liveability of a city that Venetian data scientist Fabio Carrera believes is the key to Venice\u2019s future. Because if a city cannot retain its own populace, no amount of tourist tax will be able to avert its inevitable decline and death. As such, Carrera has dedicated 30 years of his academic life working on the Venice Project Centre, dividing his time between Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the prestigious Santa Fe Institute and Venice. During that time, he has supervised over 250 projects examining the city\u2019s challenges: mapping every bridge, bell tower, well and water bus. The centre also tracks tourism flows, and has concluded that Venice\u2019s maximum carrying capacity is 55,000 tourists per day, or 20 million per year if European safety standards are to be maintained. It\u2019s not far from the current number of 25 million, he points out \u2013 it just needs to be managed better. A new wave of digital tools could offer some solutions. At the centre\u2019s startup incubator SerenDPT, students are working on projects including smart transport apps, hybrid mortgage schemes that use tourism income to assist with repayments, and a Smart Control Room for the city council that they hope they can export to other cities. He believes these new business ideas, among others, would create the kind of high quality jobs that could refloat the local economy. No other city faces a bigger tourism challenge, says Carrera \u2013 but given Venice\u2019s uniquely contained and complex character, nowhere is better equipped to meet the challenge of sustainable tourism. \u201cYounger generations have been out in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThey see other possibilities and want to bring that back to Venice.\u201d This article was edited on 1 May 2019 to clarify that Palma has not completely banned short term tourist rentals, just those in apartments in multi-family residential housing Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Are the hyper-specialist shops of Berlin the future of retail?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/apr/29/are-the-hyper-specialist-shops-of-berlin-the-future-of-retail", "date": "2019-04-29", "transcript": "On the first floor of a nondescript 1,000 sq metre industrial unit in Berlin\u2019s Steglitz district, four workers are cautiously placing pregnant queen ants into test tubes in order to dispatch them across Europe. This is Antstore, the world\u2019s first specialist ant shop, a business with around two dozen employees, a glass-cutting workshop, plastic and plaster modelling studios and a full-time social media manager. It is just one of the surprisingly large number of shops in Berlin that sell only one thing, be it crawly insects, salty sweets, sticky tape or miniature string instruments. With online retail sales changing the face of high streets in cities around the world, many wonder if this hyper-specialisation could be more than an accidental side effect of the German capital\u2019s tumultuous history, and also a blueprint for the high street of the future. Martin Sebesta started Antstore in 2003, frustrated that his city\u2019s pet shops lacked either the expertise or enthusiasm to tell him how to build his own ant farm. Having survived cancer in his 20s, he chucked in a promising career at Siemens and rented a small shop from which he worked part-time to build and sell his own ant terrariums, which he calls \u201cformicariums\u201d, from the insect\u2019s Latin name. \u2018With ants I can see how they start small and build something big\u2019 \u2026 Martin Sebesta of Antstore The majority of Antstore\u2019s sales take place via the company\u2019s website, but Sebesta reckons the shop itself is still key to its success. First-time customers can choose between anything from a \u20ac50 (\u00a343) starter set containing the robust Lasius niger, or common garden ant, to a tripartite formicarium with the South American Atta cephalotes, a species of leafcutter ant, for a starting price of around \u20ac500. \u201cOf course, you could get a goldfish and watch it swim from left to right all day,\u201d says Sebesta as a trail of leafcutter workers diligently carries the remains of a wilted orchid through a glass skywalk over his head. \u201cBut with ants I can see how they start small and build something big.\u201d He considered branching out into stick insects and terrariums for lizards, but soon realised teaching his staff the required expertise would stretch the company\u2019s capacities. \u201cThese days, if you want to keep your head above the water as a medium-sized business, you can\u2019t afford not to specialise.\u201d Paul Knopf and his buttons at his shop in Kreuzberg \u2018I have more buttons than I can sell before I die\u2019 According to Nils Busch-Petersen, CEO of the Berlin-Brandenburg trade association, the high number of hyper-specialists is the result of historical chance. \u201cOur city is home to these special kinds of shops not because of the senate\u2019s efforts, but in spite of them,\u201d he argues. Germany\u2019s Mittelstand, roughly defined as businesses with between 50 and 500 employees, may be commonly hailed as the \u201chidden champions\u201d of nation\u2019s economic success, but in Berlin retail, medium-sized businesses have traditionally been less hidden than absent. Two-thirds of the city\u2019s 9,000 Jewish-owned Mittelstand retail companies were lost in the wake of the Reichskristallnacht pogroms in 1938. In 1972, during the Cold War, East Germany nationalised even small businesses with more than 10 employees. In such a skewed retail landscape, many small shops found they could compete by specialising in goods neglected by generalist department stores, especially since retail space was cheap and in plentiful supply behind the Iron Curtain. \u2018It\u2019s one thing to take a typewriter apart\u2019 \u2026 Bernd Moser in his typewriter store in Kreuzberg Bernd Moser\u2019s shop on Kreuzberg\u2019s Gneisenaustrasse 91 illustrates this tradition: aged 76, Moser, who proudly sports a white walrus moustache, has for over a quarter of a century only sold and repaired typewriters. Although already deep into retirement, Moser unlocks the glass door to his sparse premises from 11am until 4pm during the working week \u2013 mainly because demand remains high. After a 60-year career as an office machine mechanic, Moser owns boxes full of spare parts by long-bankrupt manufacturers and still has reams of instruction manuals stored away in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to take a typewriter apart,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I also know how to put them back together again.\u201d \u2018They don\u2019t call the violin a cello for kids, do they?\u2019 \u2026 Harald Truetsch in his ukulele shop A hundred metres around the corner, lies Paul Knopf, a shopping emporium spanning two shop fronts and several storage units. It is named after its owner, who is himself named after the only product he has sold over its counter for 32 years: buttons, millions of them, intricately filed by material, size and colour in drawers reaching up to the stuccoed ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how many buttons there are in this building in total,\u201d says Knopf, \u201cbut I know there are more than I can sell before I die.\u201d A short walk east, at Gneisenaustrasse 52, Harald Truetsch has for almost 10 years sold only miniature string instruments: ukuleles made of wood or metal, \u201cbanjoleles\u201d with plastic membranes, mandolins, South American cavaquinhos and tiny bass guitars. \u201cBig music shops often treat the ukulele as a second-rate instrument, as if it were just a guitar for children,\u201d says Truetsch, his long white hair flowing as he picks up his own uke from behind the counter. \u201cThey don\u2019t call the violin a cello for kids, do they?\u201d Knopf, Moser and Truetsch have all survived the ongoing gentrification of their neighbourhoods in part because of lenient landlords. But they also run lean operations with low expenses \u2013 Knopf has three employees to help tackle his intricate filing system, while the other two are one-man shows. Germany\u2019s strict laws around shop opening hours have allowed them to work solo without risking burnout: many hyper-specialists remain closed not just on Sundays but Mondays too. \u2018One sausage gave birth to another\u2019 \u2026 Silvia Wald in Aufschnitt Berlin, her textile meat shop in Friedrichshain And the threat online retailers pose to their business model is limited: Truetsch\u2019s shop may be called Leleland.eu, but typing the url into a browser draws a blank page. When he tried selling his wares via an online shop he found the postal work overwhelming (\u201cWith instruments, people want to try before they buy\u201d). Over the holidays, leleland.eu fills up with customers who have travelled from as far away as Argentina or Israel, and unlike with an adult-sized guitar, they know they will be able to take their purchases back on the plane. With the old guard of Berlin\u2019s hyper-specialists proving surprisingly resilient, younger shop owners are taking a leaf out of their books. On Boxhagener Strasse in bustling Friedrichshain, the 38-year-old garment engineer Silvia Wald has set up shop in an old butcher\u2019s store to sell the kind of wares older customers used to see behind the counter: legs of pork, chains of sausages, mortadella ham, bacon rashers \u2013 but all made of fabric, to be used as decorative cushions. The shop was borne out of a marketing gag for her textile company, Aufschnitt (\u201ccold cuts\u201d). \u201cOne sausage gave birth to another,\u201d says Wald, who ironically has been a vegetarian since her teens. She soon realised the shopfront was an excellent showroom to advertise the made-to-commission work taking place in the studio part of her 70 sq metre unit. In the year of her business\u2019s 10th anniversary, she is also realising that specialists can sometimes specialise too much. Recently, Wald was commissioned to make a giant cushion in the shape of a currywurst, Berlin\u2019s famed street food snack. Her client, the German capital\u2019s branch of Madame Tussauds, asked her if she knew a tailor who could make some fries to add as a side. \u201cOf course I can make some fries, I told them. They literally thought I could only make cushions that look like meat.\u201d \u2018I have sticky tapes mere mortals would never dare to dream of\u2019 Hyper-specialists usually make for popular neighbours because they add character to an area. Since Ilse B\u00f6ge opened Kad\u00f3, Germany\u2019s first specialist liquorice store, on Kreuzberg\u2019s Gr\u00e4festrasse 20 years ago, she has seen the entire area blossom. Known as the Gr\u00e4fekiez, the network of tree-lined cobbled streets has also attracted property investors from around the world, and some of the shop\u2019s neighbours closed down when their landlord suddenly doubled the rent. \u201cWe made this area attractive, now we could be punished for it,\u201d worries B\u00f6ge. Katrin Lompscher, Berlin\u2019s Die Linke (The Left) party senator for housing, has proposed extending the \u201cmilieu protection\u201d measures, which currently protect low-income residents in select parts of the city from being pushed out by aggressive rent increases, to also apply to local shops. But B\u00f6ge, who first started importing salty Dutch sweets for her personal cravings while studying economics, is in two minds. \u2018What does the state know about how retail will develop in the next 10 years?\u2019 \u2026 Ilse B\u00f6ge in her liquorice store On the one hand, she says, milieu protection for shops would give small-business owners stability to plan their future. But the economist in her remains sceptical: \u201cWhat does the state know about how retail will develop in the next 10 years? You would end up creating a parallel business system.\u201d Instead, B\u00f6ge and her husband, Frank, are putting in place measures for a post-shopfront future. Kad\u00f3 looks old-fashioned: the 500-plus varieties of liquorice are stored in glass jars, arranged from sweet English allsorts via salty Finnish salmiakki to bitter Italian pure liquirizia sticks, and cash-only payments go through a vintage till. But the old-school look betrays a more modern business model. As much as 35% of the shop\u2019s sales now take place online, and Kad\u00f3\u2019s sticky confectionery is for sale in most of Berlin\u2019s independent cinemas and even, wrapped in a designer box, in the luxury KaDeWe department store. \u2018Specialists like us are the future\u2019 \u2026 Tape art on the facade of Klebeland\u2019s new building It is not unimaginable that Berlin\u2019s first liquorice specialist could take the same route as Mohamad Ghouneim\u2019s Klebeland. Ghouneim, a 40-year-old Palestinian German who has called Berlin his home since he was two, ran the city\u2019s leading sticky-tape specialist from a store on Kreuzberg\u2019s Ritterstrasse until rent increases forced him out of the premises. Instead of shutting up shop, Ghouneim relocated to humdrum Wittenau, a suburb of Berlin, and got some tape artists to decorate the facade of the new building.

This is the boundary between Hell\u2019s Gate national park and the geothermal plants that are increasingly powering one of east Africa\u2019s fastest-growing economies. Giraffes wander close to the giant pipes that snake across the landscape, a reminder this is also a border between an old model of development reliant on foreign safaris and a new drive to leapfrog the fossil-fuel phase of growth. In recent years, Kenya has been a frontrunner in expanding access to electricity. Since 2010, the proportion of the 44 million population with power has reportedly surged from one in five to three in five. This is largely thanks largely to steam from the subterranean depths. Hell\u2019s Gate is named after the sulphurous hot springs that bubble up in this part of the Rift Valley, a 3,500-mile fault line that is slowly pulling the African continent apart and bringing underground heat closer to the surface. Engineers tap the energy by drilling up to 5,000 metres into the earth, then injecting water that returns to the surface as steam to drive turbines. As long as the water is carefully recycled, the energy is virtually renewable. Emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases are released in the process, but the impact on the climate per kilowatt hour is between a fifth and a ninth that of burning fossil fuels. After a slow start, Kenya has embraced this technology with gusto. Engineers boast that the recently expanded Olkaria IV plant, on the edge of the national park, is now the biggest single-site geothermal facility in the world, with a capacity of 280 megawatts. Kenya is already the ninth biggest geothermal-producing nation in the world and will rise further when the new 165 MW Olkaria V facility opens in July. \u201cBy the end of next year, we will be one of the biggest geothermal producers in the world,\u201d predicted Cyrus Karingithi, assistant manager at the Kenya Electricity Generating Company, KenGen. \u201cWe are transforming people\u2019s lives like larvae into butterflies.\u201d Geothermal generating capacity has grown 117% since 1999 thanks to investment of $1bn from the Kenyan government, with support from international financing bodies such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The country\u2019s 302 geothermal wells now provide 400 megawatts of power, enough to power two cities the size of Nairobi, according to the company. Until now, hydropower has been the leading source of electricity production, but this is set to change. Over the next five years, the government plans to more than double capacity, mostly by opening enough geothermal wells to provide 49% of the power on the grid. This is considered a cheaper and more stable supply than dams, which are badly affected by drought. \u201cKenya is reducing its reliance on hydropower due to climate change. Currently when the dams are dry, they have to fill the energy supply gap with emergency imports of diesel fuel. That\u2019s expensive. That\u2019s why they want to have more geothermal,\u201d said Geordie Colville, UN Environment climate change mitigation expert. Other African nations are set to follow. Last year, Ethiopia contracted an Icelandic firm to survey possible sites in its stretch of the Rift Valley. Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda are also reportedly exploring similar developments. But geothermal comes with a heavy cost to the local ecosystem. Environmentalists say the Olkaria complex has intruded on almost half of the Hell\u2019s Gate national park, an important refuge for zebra, giraffes and eland. KenGen says this is an exaggeration and insists it has tried to minimise the impact, for example, by raising pipes on to stilts so animals can pass underneath. Even so, birds have died in collisions with power lines or been pushed from breeding sites. The future could be dirtier still. The company plans to bring steel and iron mills to the region, which would create a heavily polluting giant industrial complex on the edge of a protected area, with all that entails in terms of traffic, population and degradation of air and water quality. Overall, however, supporters argue geothermal is the lesser of evils. Over the next five years, coal and gas generation will also increase at a rapid rate as the government tries to supply a population that is expected to almost double by 2050. Some of the first investments in geothermal in Africa were approved by Inger Andersen, the incoming head of UN Environment, during her time at the World Bank. She recalls taking groups to Iceland 20 years ago so they could learn from the pioneering geothermal plants there. These days the visitors come to Kenya, which is set to overtake Iceland this year in generating capacity. The goal now, she says, is for regional economies to skip the dirty phase of fossil fuel-powered development and go straight to clean growth. \u201cI totally believe in leapfrogging when I see the renewable resources that are available in Africa,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cKenya is sitting on huge geothermal resources and is blessed with incredible sunshine.\u201d There is progress too in solar and wind power. According to the UN, 10% of 600 million people who live off-grid in Africa are already accessing renewable energy. Last September, Kenya opened sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest windfarm: a 310-megawatt plant near the shores of Lake Turkana. Officials say the government has ordered the installation of 50MW of solar by 2024. But geothermal is leading the charge. After 31 years in the business, Karingithi says the investment conditions are finally ideal for the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to secure financing now because international investors are more interested in renewable energy and the government is promoting this sector,\u201d said Karingithi, who insists the target of providing half the nation\u2019s energy from geothermal is achievable. \u201cAs long as you set a goal, the universe will conspire for you.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Up to 600 drone flights will be made each day, delivering vaccines, blood supplies and life-saving medicines to 2,000 health centres in remote areas around the country. The service will operate out of four hubs, each hosting 30 drones, designed by Zipline, a California-based robotics company. Ghana\u2019s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, who officially inaugurated the new drone network at a ceremony in Omenako, said the service \u201crepresents a major step towards giving everyone in this country universal access to life-saving medicine\u201d. \u201cNo one in Ghana should die because they can\u2019t access the medicine they need in an emergency,\u201d said Akufo-Addo. The new drone service was initially met with concern. Critics argued that in a country where, according to the BBC, 55 ambulances serve a population of 29 million people, money should instead be spent on improving current health facilities, including clinics and ambulances. The Ghana Medical Association called for the drone project to be suspended and tested on a trial basis first, claiming it would not help to tackle health service problems. But Ghana\u2019s government granted Zipline $12m (\u00a39.5 million) to run the project for four years after the initiative was approved in parliament by 102 votes to 58. Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, which is supporting Zipline\u2019s work, said: \u201cThe ability of the government to supplement routine immunisation on demand will allow us to make sure that there will always be enough life-saving vaccines for every child in Ghana.\u201d Zipline first introduced their drones in Rwanda in 2016, where they have since made 13,000 deliveries. One-third of these were to patients in a critical condition, when urgent access to supplies was a matter of life and death. A health centre can request supplies via text message, with packaging and delivery taking an average of 30 minutes, according to Zipline. Each drone can carry a load of 1.8kg, which it releases with a parachute once it descends to a safe height. The company\u2019s engineers include aerospace veterans from SpaceX and Nasa. Following the opening of a second Rwanda distribution centre in 2018 and expansion into Ghana, the drone technology now serves 22 million people across the two countries.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'Bee saviour' sugar cards could save starving insects", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/24/bee-saviour-sugar-cards-could-help-starving-bees", "date": "2019-04-24", "transcript": "If you\u2019ve ever felt a pang of pity for a starving bee struggling on the pavement in front of you, then help may soon be at hand. Or more precisely, in your wallet. A community development worker has invented a credit card-style reviver for bees containing three sachets of sugar solution, which can be placed beside the insect to feed it. Dan Harris, 40, is now crowdfunding to produce the \u201cBee Saviour\u201d cards after the success of his prototype, with community groups and businesses in his local city of Norwich, including the Book Hive bookshop and a local pub, pledging to stock the \u00a34 bee revivers. Each card contains three indentations containing a beekeepers\u2019 formula, secured by foil-backed stickers which can be peeled off. \u201cThe first time you peel back the sticker and put the card down next to the bee, you think, what\u2019s going to happen? When I first tested it, the bee walked calmly onto the card and started feeding,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt struck me that everyone who walks around a city will have walked past an exhausted bee. That means you\u2019ve also walked past an opportunity to connect with nature.\u201d Harris came up with the idea after learning about bees\u2019 fast metabolism and how quickly they can run out of energy. He also wondered how people living in cities could engage with nature more frequently. \u201cI was living in a flat without a garden and the most likely place I would come across a bee was walking around the city and I didn\u2019t have a teaspoon of sugar solution to hand,\u201d he said. Over four years, he has laboriously tested handmade prototypes, with advice about bees from his scientist father and beekeeper uncle. Now he has set up Bee Saviour Behaviour, a not-for-profit co-operative, to make the revivers, which he hopes to source from recycled plastic cards. If he hits his \u00a38,000 crowdfunding target, he can commission a company to make the indentations, which he hand-fills with a sugar solution recommended by beekeepers. If he raises more funds, his co-op can mass \u2013 produce them. Richard Horne, a designer and illustrator, designed the cards free of charge after seeing his children use the prototype to save a bee. \u201cI\u2019ve tried reviving bees using sugar and water on a spoon and it\u2019s never worked,\u201d said Horne. \u201cAfter we got the prototype, me and the kids found a bee that was struggling and they said, \u2018Dad! Get the card!\u2019 I fetched my wallet and the card worked a treat.

It is a good smell.\u201d Cherry is one of a growing army of UK farmers who are turning their back on the plough \u2013 and centuries of farming tradition \u2013 in an effort to tackle a little-noticed but potentially devastating environmental crisis: the degradation of the Earth\u2019s soil. The UN has warned that soils around the world are heading for exhaustion and depletion, with an estimated 60 harvests left before they are too barren to feed the planet. That message was backed up in the UK by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, who warned that the country is 30 to 40 years away from \u201cthe fundamental eradication of soil fertility\u201d. He added: \u201cCountries can withstand coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, wars and conflict, even leaving the EU, but no country can withstand the loss of its soil and fertility.\u201d The apocalyptic nature of the threat was underlined last month by a report that revealed that excessive use of pesticides had depleted the Earth\u2019s soil and contributed to a drastic decline in insect numbers that threatened a \u201ccatastrophic collapse of nature\u2019s ecosystems\u201d. But on his 800-hectare (2,000-acre) farm outside Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Cherry says that he and farmers like him around the world are fighting back. The conservation agriculture movement he advocates means no ploughing or turning the soil, instead keeping the ground covered with crops all year round and growing a wide variety of plants. The method involves more planning, but the benefits its advocates claim are remarkable \u2013 from plummeting costs on machinery and labour to a drastic reduction in fertiliser and chemicals. This in turn leads to a huge increase in insects, birds and wildlife, as well as fewer floods and more resilient crops during droughts. Healthy soil can also absorb massive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 playing a key role in the drive to tackle climate breakdown and the biodiversity crisis. As kites and skylarks fly above his fields, Cherry says he first became interested in conservation agriculture \u2013 or no-till farming \u2013 after speaking to others who were trying it. \u201cI have always been interested in soil, which in the end is the most important thing about farming,\u201d he says. \u201cI went to see a farm where it was being done and when you see someone who is farming without moving the soil it is mind-blowing.\u201d The movement, which began in the US, is now taking off around the world. Conservation agriculture (CA) is widespread in the Americas because of its water-retention properties in drought-prone and hot areas \u2013 healthier soil can hold and retain much more water. Some experts have sounded a note of caution, though. The Soil Association, which promotes organic farming, says it backs conservation but warns that it should not be seen as a silver bullet. A report written by Peter Melchett for the organisation , published in December shortly after his death, said that while CA minimised soil disturbance, reduced erosion and increased organic matter, by itself it was not guaranteed to increase biodiversity or the amount of atmospheric carbon that farmland can absorb and hold. It said farmers should also consider planting trees (agroforestry), introducing livestock on to arable farms, and having more diverse crop rotations bringing grassland into arable systems. Nonetheless, the movement is taking off in the UK. Three years ago, Cherry organised the Groundswell festival on his land to spread the word about the environmental and economic benefits of looking after the soil. He was amazed when 700 people turned up. Last year that number had jumped to 1,250, and this year, as word spreads to farms across the UK and Europe, he is worried the farm won\u2019t be big enough to cope. \u201cThis whole thing is farmer-led,\u201d says Cherry. \u201cIt is coming up from below, with farmers talking to each other and seeing the benefits, then adapting that to work on their own farms. It is a groundswell of farmers doing it \u2013 that is where we got the name.\u201d Not ploughing avoids disrupting micro-organisms, including the fungal threads that drive the biological life of the soil. A mix of crops on the land increases the diversity and health of the bacteria in the soil, which in turn supports a wide variety of insects. Cherry says that one of the many benefits is that he no longer needs slug pellets, as the soil supports a lot of slugs\u2019 natural predators. However, he does still use some sprays to clear the winter crops. Cherry says: \u201cWe are using fewer chemicals and less fertiliser year on year as the soil recovers. Our aim is to get to using no fertiliser or sprays at all. \u201cThere are guys in the US who have been doing this for 30 years and their soil is so fertile, they have got so much going on in the ground, that you do not need to apply anything.\u201d Cherry, who works the farm with his brother Paul, turned to conservation agriculture eight years ago. The first few years they had their best ever returns as costs declined in terms of machinery, labour and pesticides but yields remained high. Cherry says there were \u201ca few disappointing years as the soil adjusted, but our costs kept going down\u201d. He adds: \u201cAfter 15 years or so, what most people find is that your costs are right, right down and your yields are better then they were at the beginning. On top of that, you have a genuinely sustainable future ahead.\u201d The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) produced a report last year backing conservation agriculture as one method of replenishing degraded soils. It warned that a combination of industrial farming practices and poor land management have resulted in dangerous levels of soil erosion, compaction and declining fertility, which costs around \u00a31.2bn a year in England and Wales. Graeme Willis, the senior rural policy campaigner at the CPRE, says: \u201cSoil is fundamental to delivering productive farming, a healthy countryside, and can play a key role in tackling climate change. But decades of neglect have degraded our soils to a point where much of this life-giving asset, which underpins the health of all living things, is no longer able to function as it should. \u201cThrough conservation agriculture, farmers can reduce costs, use fewer chemicals and rebuild biological life in the soil, making it healthier, more resilient to extreme weather and able to support more wildlife. It\u2019s win-win for farmers, the people they feed and the environment.\u201d Willis says there was a stark similarity between the human gut and soil in terms of planetary and human health. \u201cLooking after the soil is much like looking after a healthy gut biome where variety is key: eat lots of different foods, especially plants, not too much wheat and cut back on the chemicals \u2013 for farming, pesticides and synthetic fertilisers, and for the gut, antibiotics and ultra-processed foods.\u201d Back on his farm Cherry is examining the soil and the tangle of winter crops that cover his field. \u201cThe insects are the bottom of the food chain and there are so many things that eat them,\u201d he says. \u201cSince they have come back we have seen a huge increase in birds: skylarks, flocks of yellowhammers, kites, buzzards, and we are not doing anything special to attract them \u2013 they just love the fields, the system we have here.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Growing resistance to the construction of wind turbines or fields of solar panels on land has led the renewable energy industry to look for alternative options. Large islands of solar panels are under construction or already in place in reservoirs and lakes across the Netherlands, China, the UK and Japan. In a development that is to become the largest of its type in the world, construction will begin this year on 15 solar islands on the Andijk reservoir in north Holland. The islands, containing 73,500 panels, will have the sunflower-like ability to move to face the light. The first phase of the project, involving three islands, each of which will be 140 metres in diameter, is due to be finished by November, once the migratory season for birds has come to an end. Arnoud van Druten, the managing director of Floating Solar, a solar panel supplier, said: \u201cWe would like to have started earlier but because of the environmental issues regarding bird seasons, there is only a limited period in the year, these three months, that we can put anything in the water.\u201d Along with a second project at Hoofddorp, near Amsterdam, which will involve static solar panels, the water company PWN, which owns the land on which the farms will be located, is expected to create enough energy to power 10,000 households. Van Druten said: \u201cThe sun-tracking system involves three buoys for anchoring with cable around it, which turns the island and at the same time keeps the island together. It ensures the island is turned towards the sun. \u201cYou can have two options: one is tracking automatically to the light. But because the position of the sun is not expected to change too much in the coming years, an algorithm can be easily programmed.\u201d Another feature of the islands is that they can reposition themselves in extreme weather to minimise damage. \u201cAndijk is a very severe environment,\u201d Van Druten said. \u201cSo we have optimal solar tracking, which is generating extra energy, and weather risk management [WRM], which is a technology that makes sure that if an island is under severe pressure due to wind or storms, it moves itself automatically in a position so the wind and waves travel easily through the island. \u201cWe have already tested that the system can sustain, without WRM, wind speeds of around 60mph.\u201d To avoid damaging the reservoir\u2019s ecosystems, half its surface area will be covered by the islands. The added benefit of floating solar panels is that the water cools the electrical wiring. \u201cThere is a lot of pressure from pressure environmental groups about wind turbines, so the alternative to land is water. But what does it do to the water quality?\u201d Van Druten said. \u201cOur design has the least impact on the ecosystem as possible so the water quality remains almost the same. \u201cAt the same time, because the island is moving, we don\u2019t have a fixed shadow shape.\u201d Critics of floating solar farms say they are ugly and reflect the light, disturbing nearby communities. But Van Druten said the fusion of light on the water created a blurring effect that made the panels disappear from afar.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "We are not yet doomed: the carbon cutters determined to save the world", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/18/we-are-not-doomed-cutting-carbon", "date": "2019-04-18", "transcript": "We are all doomed, it is said.

Participants will be invited to suggest pieces or even whole programmes for the season, which will start in September 2020. \u00d6sterling said that the idea for a no-flight season had come to him when the Swedish cellist Jakob Koranyi, who had travelled down from Stockholm by the night train, asked him what he was doing to compensate for the flights taken by other players. \u201cAmong the new generation of musicians, you often find this, that they choose to become vegans or vegetarians, and that they think about the CO2 footprint they have,\u201d \u00d6sterling said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m convinced that we will find many others willing to support us.\u201d On the day he announced the idea, he said he was contacted by an Armenian pianist living in Vienna who had offered to take the train up to Sweden to play.

The timeline is so short now, that we all have to contribute.\u201d Richard Orange in Malmo The country Costa Rica has long been ahead of the crowd. Blessed with abundant hydropower, its emissions peaked in 1999 and in 2017 its power system ran for a record 300 days on clean sources. Now its president has vowed to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions totally by 2050, meaning it would produce no more emissions than it can offset through activities such as expanding forests. The country\u2019s electricity, 98% of which is already derived from renewable sources, would be entirely clean by this point, while transport, which accounts for 40% of current emissions, would be transformed by requiring sales of new cars and trucks to be zero-emission only. The plan also targets the elimination of emissions from buildings, industry and waste disposal. Carlos Alvarado, the president of Costa Rica, said that the plan should be used as a blueprint for other governments to help meet the increasingly urgent task of cutting emissions to avoid disastrous climate change. \u201cWe have committed ourselves to be an international laboratory for decarbonisation and we are standing true to that commitment,\u201d Alvarado told the Guardian. \u201cWe want to lead by example. Our strongest contribution is to demonstrate the possibilities. It\u2019s not only possible but it\u2019s necessary.\u201d Alvarado, a 39-year-old who was elected in April 2018, said countries need not be deterred by US inaction on climate change. \u201cImagine humanity is in the middle of an electric car race to survive and let\u2019s say one of the big vehicles instead of moving forward just parked in the road,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cThe rest of us could stop and stare or we can continue our journey. We will need everybody but we also need to keep moving forward because time is part of this equation. \u201cIn 2050, my son will be 37 and he will ask if I did enough for the planet and humanity to continue its existence. I better have a good answer. We need to do this because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Oliver Milman in New York The brewer AB InBev brews a lot of beer \u2013 about 3,000 pints a second. If that sounds like one gigantic hangover, consider this: to do that it requires about 6.6 terawatt hours of electricity each year \u2013 about the same as Latvia. Now it says it aims to generate that power solely through renewable means by 2025. For the most part, it will do so through so-called power purchasing arrangements \u2013 direct contracts with renewable suppliers. But it also plans to install its own solar and other generators on its sites. Already, it says, about half its power in the US comes from renewables \u2013 enough to brew about 10bn pints. \u201cWe believe climate change is real,\u201d says Tony Milikin, the company\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe want other companies to jump on the flywheel that we\u2019re on.\u201d Mark Rice-Oxley The capital Wellington is getting greener. Literally. It\u2019s been planting a tree every five minutes, on average, for the past 15 years \u2013 more than 1.5m in total. Native species such as Rata, Kowhai and Kanuka are being prioritised, with the aim of creating a \u2018green corridor\u2019 for native bird species that have already begun to spillover into locals gardens from their protected habitat at the Zelandia eco-sanctuary. Wellington mayor Justin Lester says the capital is New Zealand\u2019s greenest city, and one of the few cities in the world where bio-diversity is increasing. Last month, it was named as the world\u2019s least polluted capital, though that is also down to prevailing winds. \u201cWellingtonians are proud of this transformation and are acting on it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe most common conservation activity is tree planting - about 40% of Wellington residents have planted a native tree at home.\u201d The upshot is that although the city still has a battle on its hands to reduce emissions from traffic, the impact of all those leaves is starting to be felt. Trees act as a natural sink for carbon and about 40 percent of the city\u2019s emissions are now mitigated by so-called land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities. According to the council almost half of the city\u2019s urban area is now forested. By comparison\u2019s 39% of Auckland is forested and 22% of Christchurch. The Wellington tree planting project will contribute to a central government plan to plant one billion trees by 2028, which forms part of New Zealand\u2019s ambition to be carbon zero by 2050. Eleanor Ainge Roy in Auckland The flightless Aviation accounts for just over 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it is one of the fastest growing areas. Its real effect on warming is several times greater because the emissions have more impact at altitude. Growth is fuelled by globalisation and the rise of ultra-cheap flights. The airline industry has made gestures towards sustainability, but with little impact, and governments have shown great reluctance to rein in an industry seen as popular and strategic. Into this vacuum, individuals have started to bring their own actions. \u201cWe are in a climate emergency and need to radically reduce our emissions to avert climate breakdown,\u201d says Anna Hughes, of the UK\u2019s FlightFree campaign. \u201cAviation is the biggest contributor to an individual\u2019s carbon footprint [if they fly], and people are often unwilling to change the way they live because individual action doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference. But they are more likely to act if they can see others are acting too.\u201d Inspired by a similar campaign in Sweden, FlightFree invites people to pledge not to take any flights in 2020, if enough other people are willing to do the same. Should 100,000 people sign up, the pledges will be triggered, giving an incentive to early adopters to encourage as many others to take part as they can, and potentially saving more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020. More than the carbon savings \u2013 which are hard to estimate in advance because some of the signatories may be frequent flyers while others may fly rarely \u2013 is the sense of moral action, that individuals can spur change even in huge and politically protected industries. An increasing number of short-haul flights are taken by better-off people in better-off countries taking advantage of cheap flights and low property prices to buy holiday homes in areas that not long ago would have been practically and economically inaccessible, according to research from the New Economics Foundation. That is unsustainable. But there are alternatives, from taking trains and the increasing distances that electric cars are capable of, to changing the tax regime so that instead of being charged taxes per flight \u2013 which blindly penalises those who rarely fly as much as those who jet off every other weekend \u2013 taxation could be based on an individual\u2019s flight patterns over the course of a year, in order to truly reflect the social cost of our newfound habits. So far, in the few weeks of its operation, several hundred people have signed up to FlightFree. It will have succeeded if it makes people think more about how modern flying patterns have changed, and how the impacts of this can be managed equitably, without destroying the planet. The village It all started with full-page ads in the parish magazine, but the effort to get the villagers of Loddiswell, Devon to switch to a renewable energy provider now involves the printing of several hundred postcards. The man behind the plan is 65-year-old Plymouth city council worker Paul Vann: \u201cI started a campaign to get villagers to switch to a green supplier like Bulb after finding out it offers 100% renewable energy. I was hoping to get a village-sized solar farm in the parish but unfortunately the power lines around here are at capacity.\u201d The local parish has been supportive of the idea and Vann believes that if his village can make the change then the benefits to the environment would be great: \u201cEven if only 100 households switch that would be equivalent to planting thousands of trees. Imagine if all villages could do it. \u201cIt\u2019s all been done at a relatively low cost to me. The ads only cost a few tenners and the postcards around \u00a375. I\u2019ll be saving money too by delivering them myself. \u201cI\u2019ve gone out on a limb but my hope is that we will achieve at least 100 switches.\u201d Rachel Obordo The theatre Showcasing some of the best folk productions in Ireland, the Siamsa T\u00edre National Folk Theatre is used to playing a pivotal role in the country\u2019s cultural life. With the greening initiative it\u2019s also having an impact on its carbon footprint by reducing the theatre\u2019s energy usage by 41% since 2016. \u201cRemarkably the election of Donald Trump spurred me into action,\u201d said Catr\u00edona Fallon, CEO of the theatre. \u201cWe have 40 solar photovoltaic panels on the roof and replaced our oil-fired heating system with an air-to-heat pump which is run on electricity sourced from renewables. We\u2019ve also halved our waste to landfill in the last year, which has saved us \u20ac1,000.\u201d In terms of the future, Fallon is proposing to allow flexible working to reduce the theatre\u2019s carbon footprint further: \u201cWe could look at closing the building on a Monday when there\u2019s very little activity (October to April only) and allow most of the staff team to either work remotely or to rearrange their hours into four days rather than five. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of an environmental nerd in my private life. When Trump was elected I sensed that this was the moment when my colleagues began to understand some of the dangers facing us in terms of climate change and environmental degradation, so I grasped the nettle. They may have since regretted this!\u201d Rachel Obordo The scientists If emissions of carbon dioxide are inevitable, can we avoid the effects on global warming by capturing, reusing or in some other way preventing the gas reaching the atmosphere and contributing to climate change? Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been mooted for more than two decades as a potential solution to climate change, but little progress has been made in that time. There are a handful of plants currently operating and no widespread plans for its adoption on a scale that would make the difference needed to stave off dangerous levels of warming. The Carbon Capture Machine (CCM), built by scientists from the University of Aberdeen, is a prototype capable of converting 200kg of carbon dioxide a day to liquid. The machine is now one of five technologies in the final for the NRG Cosia Carbon X Prize, and its grand prize of $7.5m (\u00a35.7m). Inside the machine, the gases arising from coal combustion are \u201cscrubbed\u201d, which is done with a water solution of sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide. This process \u2013 which relates to techniques used a century ago to purify the air in submarines \u2013 separates carbon dioxide from other gases, such as water vapour and nitrogen, and produces stable dry solids, white in colour and harmless. Fred Glasser, emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of Aberdeen, says: \u201cThe expensive bit [of CCS] is that to pump carbon dioxide to the disposal site [usually offshore] it has to be liquid. To make a liquid requires separation of carbon dioxide from nitrogen and oxygen. The separation process is expensive and potentially polluting.\u201d By solving this critical part of the CCS problem, Glasser believes the CCM \u2013 which will be tested at a site in Dry Fork, Wyoming, as part of the X Prize \u2013 provides a vital solution, and will be cheap as the components are off-the-shelf parts common in other industrial processes, and the dry byproducts can be sold. Glasser, with partners Zoe Morrison and MS Imbabi, has spun off CCM from Aberdeen University, and though the company is still small (\u201cI also help to wash up the teacups,\u201d notes Glasser) the partners are \u201caware of the transformational nature of the work we are doing and realise its potential impact on combatting climate change\u201d. Yet the partners are unhappy that despite the international recognition of the X Prize, they have been \u201cunable to get UK government support despite repeated applications and amicable discussions\u201d. If the demonstration in Dry Fork is successful, the company expects to be about 12 to 18 months from commercial production of a scaled-up machine. When the large-scale capture and storage of carbon dioxide was mooted widely in the early 2000s as a solution for coal-fired power plants, coal was cheap and alternatives expensive. Since then, the price of renewable energy from wind and the sun has plunged. Expensive CCS on such a massive scale may no longer be needed if these trends continue. But there are chemical processes in vital industries that will continue to emit carbon dioxide even if the fuel used is renewable \u2013 cement is the classic example, as the breakdown of calcium carbonate it requires releases carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Removing and storing the carbon dioxide from concrete production is a potentially massive market where CCM is also applicable.

At about 2am, a lightning bolt hit the cathedral\u2019s south transept and started a fire that raged through the building, collapsing the roof and causing millions of pounds\u2019 worth of damage. \u201cI remember some people coming to the building in tears,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that emotion. I was just thinking \u2018let\u2019s get it all cleared out and get it rebuilt\u2019. There was no doubt in my mind that we could repair it, sympathetically, and in the same spirit that it was built.\u201d On Monday night, David watched in horror as the 850-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris burned. But he remains optimistic that the building can be brought back to its former glory. \u201cThe roof\u2019s completely gone and there is damage to the vaulting, which does concern me, but the rest of it is repairable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who can do it.\u201d According to Prof Stefan Holzer, from the building archaeology and construction history group at the ETH Z\u00fcrich university, the first priority needs to be the installation of a temporary roof to prevent further damage from \u201catmospheric influences\u201d such as rain. He said scaffolding should be erected inside the building to check that the structure was secure. It is possible that water used to extinguish the fire has caused damage to plaster, masonry and furnishings, while the high temperatures during the fire may have made the stone work less solid. Of particular worry at Notre Dame were the rose windows, three immense round stained-glass windows that date back to the 13th century. On Tuesday afternoon, they were reported as saved. Sarah Brown, the director of York Glaziers Trust, which preserves and restores the stained glass at York Minster, said she had emailed her French counterparts to offer help and support. \u201cStained glass, of course, is made in heat,\u201d she said. \u201cThe glass is manufactured in heat and the painted decoration is fused to the glass\u2019s surface in a kiln so it can be surprisingly robust and resistant to fire.\u201d In the case of the York Minster fire, the solder that holds the pieces of glass together melted, leaving the structure unsafe. The glass also suffered from thermal shock, in part because cold water had been sprayed on it by firefighters, said Brown. \u201cThis causes rapid cooling, so the combination of fire and the cooling effect of the water causes lots of little micro-cracks to form on the glass.\u201d On 20 November 1992, a fire broke out in Windsor Castle \u2013 one of the official residences of the Queen. The blaze began in the Queen\u2019s private chapel at 11.15am when a curtain was set alight by a spotlight pressed against it. It caused extensive damage to about an eighth of the castle, including the collapse of a number of ceilings. The restoration project cost \u00a336.5m and was finally finished in 1997. Francis Maude, the director at Donald Insall Associates which managed the Windsor Castle restoration, said the speed of the Notre Dame project would depend not on the availability of materials, but on the availability of skilled craftspeople. He said it was too soon to estimate the cost, but pointed to plans for the restoration of the Palace of Westminster, which is estimated to be at least \u00a33.5bn. Notre Dame was smaller, he said, but more thoroughly damaged. He said his work on the Windsor project had provoked a debate about the use of fire resistant materials in any reconstruction \u2013 some parts were rebuilt using wooden beams and others using steel. \u201cI think there\u2019s a discussion to be had about whether the roof should be rebuilt to entirely replicate the original,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be other voices out there who say that they can recreate the form of the roof using materials that people use today \u2013 in other words a steel structure that can\u2019t catch light. Though with an effective fire suppression system, you can build in oak and have a thatched roof, like the Globe theatre in London.\u201d David said he hoped that Notre Dame would be restored in the \u201ctraditional manner with traditional materials\u201d and that \u201cthere was nothing wrong with the materials that the building has been built with\u201d. \u201cYou can add fire precaution measures and things like this, but the expertise is there,\u201d he said. \u201cBuildings represent so much. They represent a history of a certain period of civilisation. And York Minster, like Notre Dame in Paris, represents the city.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Is there a beautiful, briny solution to the world\u2019s clean water crisis?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/10/desalination-world-clean-water-crisis", "date": "2019-04-10", "transcript": "It\u2019s tipped to be the key environmental challenge of the century \u2013 and there\u2019s plenty of competition for that accolade. Water. The planet has plenty of it, but most of it is unusable, locked up in salty oceans. But demand is soaring and the strains are starting to show, from China to Latin America, India to California. Almost a billion people lack access to clean water, and the forecast is for this number to grow sharply in coming decades. Last year, Cape Town came dangerously close to running out of water. Even rainy England has been told: carry on like this and you\u2019ll run out of the stuff in 25 years. There are no easy solutions \u2013 but one technology that has proved controversial in the past may be on the cusp of a new dawn. Call it desalination 2.0. Freshwater supplies are under increasing pressure across the world, with the 4 billion people currently living in water-scarce areas predicted to rise to 5 billion by mid-century. Climate change, growing populations and our consumption habits are all key factors, while the technology we use relies on groundwater being extracted at a faster rate than it can be naturally replenished, which just stores up problems for the future. The process of converting seawater to something less briny that could be used on farms and in homes has long been viewed as a last resort for meeting our water needs. The technology is expensive, energy-intensive and only suitable in some areas. It also generates a potent byproduct: highly salty brine, which is usually released back into the sea, and the process has the unfortunate effect of disrupting local fish populations by sucking them into the inflow. But could desalination be reformed enough to make it a viable solution to our water needs? David Binns of early-stage innovation company Epicuro believes that advances in renewable energy technology could make small-scale desalination units a revolutionary advance for poor communities in the developing world, particularly in hot countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a life-saver,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could make an enormous difference to a terrible problem.\u201d In a prototype he co-invented with seed funding from the drinks and property tycoon Howard Raymond, Binns uses solar collectors which heat water to boiling point, then condense it separately from the salt or dirt that rendered it undrinkable. A small photovoltaic system is attached to power the processors necessary to regulate the machine. This method can be used not just for desalination, which requires the users to be near the coast or another source of saltwater, but also in areas where water is available but grossly contaminated, which involves a much bigger slice of the global water-stressed population. Binns is now seeking government and charitable partners to make the technology widely available, and estimates that between \u00a32m and \u00a33m would enable the company to start manufacture. He envisages the devices being used on a small, local scale, with each unit enough to supply the drinking-water needs of an average family. Other innovators are also exploring the possibilities of renewable energy, as one of the biggest handicaps for traditional desalination is its huge consumption of fossil fuels. For instance, US engineering and technology company Honeywell has supplied water stations (which clean water contaminated with fluorides, nitrates and salinity to 480,000 people) in India, where as much as 70% of water supplies are contaminated and 200,000 people die each year from lack of access to safe water. Along with Safe Water Network India, Honeywell has installed 150 stations that rely solely on solar energy. Newer technology is also coming to the assistance of desalination advocates. The wonder substance graphene is inevitably one avenue being explored. A graphene \u201csieve\u201d was created two years ago at the University of Manchester which cleans salts from brine and, if it can be scaled up, could be used for cheap desalination. Reporting on the work in the peer-review journal Nature Nanotechnology, Professor Rahul Raveendran Nair said: \u201cRealisation of scalable membranes with uniform pore size, down to the atomic scale, is a significant step forward and will open new possibilities for improving the efficiency of desalination technology.\u201d Separately, the British company G20 is working on an alternative way of using graphene oxide filters for desalination, with a process used to apply a coating of graphene oxide to existing polymer-based water filtration membranes. More traditionally, the $1.75m XPrize Water Abundance was awarded last year to technology that uses distillation to take the water content out of humid air. Skywater machines use a distillation process to turn water vapour to liquid, then treat the water with ozone to prevent contamination with micro-organisms. The more humid the air, the more water can be extracted. However, the technology is still expensive, with prices of $18,000 (\u00a314,000) to $28,000 for units that can process up to 300 gallons a day. For some large urban areas, desalination offers an urgent way out of an increasingly pressing problem. Cate Lamb, the director of water security at CDP, which measures companies\u2019 environmental performance, points to the success of Cape Town, which last year managed to stave off the worst of its water crisis by investing in desalination, as well as restricting water use. Some businesses are also investing in the technology on a smaller scale to supply their operations in water-scarce regions. Lamb says: \u201cDesalination is already having a role to play in aiding cities and companies to respond to water challenges. The deployment of the technology in Cape Town is one of the primary ways in which the city is aiming to enhance resilience.\u201d A recent positive report by financial analysts at Moody\u2019s Investor Service found that the success of Cape Town\u2019s desalination, along with demand management and increased investment in water, was paying off in economic growth and stability, too. \u201cA resilient water sector is critical for the health of Cape Town\u2019s economy and the city\u2019s fiscal position,\u201d said Zoe Jankel, senior analyst. \u201cNew investment will enhance that resilience.\u201d If Cape Town is the most recent prominent example of desalination being used to plug an urgent gap, Israel holds the crown for long-term investment in the technology as a strategic public service. The country is home to the world\u2019s biggest reverse-osmosis desalination plant, and can now produce more water than it needs from desalination and water recycling. This could potentially allow for freshwater exports to the surrounding region, and more importantly for the export of \u201cvirtual water\u201d \u2013 that is, agricultural goods from vegetables and grains to clothing fibres, and manufactured products \u2013 to boost its economy. As much as 80% of Israel\u2019s drinking water comes from coastal desalination plants, depending on the time of year and the weather. This is proving so energy-intensive that the biggest plants operate mainly at night, to avoid overloading the power grid. Crucially, however, the country has also invested heavily over decades in the treatment of waste water, recycling nearly 90% of its waste water through sewage treatment plants which then redirect the treated water to irrigation. The sludge byproduct is also used as fertiliser and to generate biogas. This strategy highlights the need for desalination, as it is in Cape Town, to be integrated into an overall water management plan. There is no point in relying on such an expensive way of generating water while wasting the resource in other ways. But where desalination is used without renewables on a large scale, there are always accompanying problems. \u201cIt does come with a cost \u2013 a carbon cost,\u201d says Lamb. \u201cFurther, there are risks associated with the discharge of the large quantities of salt generated. Finally, it\u2019s important to realise that this is a technology that is really only applicable close to the sea. For those that don\u2019t have this luxury, other interventions will be required.\u201d The use of large-scale desalination plants is posing an increasing threat to the health of the seas, a recent report from the UN University found. For every litre of freshwater created from a conventional desalination plant, an average of 1.5 litres of brine is also made. Globally, desalination plants now discharge 142m cubic metres of highly salty brine every day, which is about 50% greater than previous estimates. In a year, that quantity would be enough to cover an area the size of Florida with 30cm of brine. The report\u2019s authors warned that the outflows of brine were depleting the dissolved oxygen in the surrounding seas, with damaging effects on marine life. They called for investment in promising new technologies which could reduce the amount of effluent that is wasted, by converting the metal byproducts \u2013 such as sodium, magnesium, lithium, calcium and potassium \u2013 to a useful form, which is currently uneconomic to do. They also suggested the saline byproducts could be used in fish farms, where saltier water can result in bigger fish, and in the irrigation of salt-tolerant crops. Even with advances in desalination technology, there will still be drawbacks to its widespread use, not least issues of scaling up technology to the size of the water shortage problem. Virginia Newton-Lewis, senior policy analyst for water security at the charity WaterAid, says governments need to focus on myriad ways of providing the most fundamental service \u2013 clean water \u2013 to their populations, before becoming mired in what could be expensive and hi-tech desalination equipment. \u201cWhat we need to see is universal provision of household drinking water to become a top political priority,\u201d she says. \u201cLack of access to safe water supplies is often down to insufficient finance or political will to support basic services, rather than a physical absence of available water.\u201d Even in areas where water is physically in short supply, there are alternatives that should be explored as a matter of urgency. \u201cImproved water management that prioritises household water supplies could have a huge impact, with very low economic costs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of prioritising communities\u2019 clean water supplies ahead of industry and agriculture. Desalination is expensive, causes pollution and has a number of limitations. Therefore, although it definitely has a role to play in certain areas, there are often much more appropriate solutions available.\u201d \u2022 Fiona Harvey is an environment correspondent for the Guardian \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

This is no film script, however, but an ominous picture of future warfare that is moving ever closer. \u201cKiller robots\u201d is shorthand for a range of tech that has generals salivating and peace campaigners terrified at the ethical ramifications of warfare waged via digital proxies. Now, two women armed with nothing more than a Nobel prize, knowhow and a lot of conviction are standing in front of the march of deadly killer robots. They want them banned. And they\u2019ve done this kind of thing before. Jody Williams won her Nobel for leading the long, global effort to get anti-personnel landmines banned. Mary Wareham was a prominent supporter in that campaign. \u201cWe were there at the Nobel peace prize ceremony,\u201d Wareham recalls, \u201cand I said to Jody, \u2018This is how you finish your career, not start it! What are we going to do now?!\u2019\u201d The answer? Lethal autonomous weapon systems, also known as Laws. The women expect the struggle to be far harder. \u201cIn relative terms, landmines are chump change,\u201d Williams says, pointing to the billions of dollars manufacturers could make selling AI-enhanced weapons. Artificial intelligence is already spreading rapidly through policing, healthcare, farming and social work. AI experts are cautioning that militaries will be next. The big question is: what would stop armies from deploying upgraded drone bots to search for, identify, and then take out every man in a village between the ages of 18 and 50? Or to send a killer drone to ID and assassinate a head of state? Weapons manufacturers are riding the same artificial intelligence wave as other industries. Militaries, eyeing each other in a quiet but fierce arms race, are funding some of the most cutting-edge trials. To some, the advantages are clear: killer robots would never fatigue like a human soldier. They could potentially stay out on the battlefield for months. They would never get angry or seek revenge. They would never defy an officer\u2019s orders. They would remove the imperfect human from the equation. Algorithms would determine who to kill. But other military experts have expressed concerns. \u201cThere are not only legal and ethical concerns about lethal autonomy, but practical ones as well,\u201d says Paul Scharre, a former US army ranger who wrote the Pentagon\u2019s earliest policy statement on killer robots. \u201cHow does one control an autonomous weapon? What happens if there\u2019s a glitch in the system or someone hacks it?\u201d To Williams, the machines represent the very definition of cold-blooded slaughter. With killer robots, World War III would allow little space for what shred of humanity surfaces in wars. There will be no Christmas truce along the western front in any 21st century conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s men getting hard-ons over new weapons,\u201d seethes Williams. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it simply because they can. They\u2019re doing it because they want to see where it can go.\u201d Israel already has some of the most advanced machines, including an armed ground robot that has patrolled the Gaza border and the Harpy, a missile that circles the skies until it finds its target. Marketed ostensibly to destroy enemy radars, no technical barriers exist to stop engineers in the industry from developing similar weapons that would one day attack people. In the valleys of central California, the US military is running drone swarm experiments. Russia has declared its desire to form an entire battalion of killer robots. And no one really knows what China is doing. No law governs this AI arms race. Countries currently face a free-for-all. Scientists have sounded the alarm, and more than 250 research and academic institutions and 3,000 prominent players in the field have called for a ban on killer robots. But beyond a petition, activists reckon the best way to stop this technology in its tracks is through the tedious, unheroic task of passing an international treaty. That is the strategy of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. More than 100 organisations in 54 countries have joined the coalition, with the aim of getting a deal by 2021. Williams is an idealist, but she is not naive. She has battled the military-industrial complex since her days protesting the Vietnam war. Sceptics had thought banning landmines would be impossible. \u201cAnything is inevitable if you do nothing to stop it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they were drumming that at us \u2014 \u2018it\u2019s inevitable, it\u2019s inevitable\u2019 \u2014 the reason people do that is to disempower you.\u201d In that campaign, Williams and others had lobbied the United Nations to pass an agreement. When that process flagged, they took negotiations outside the UN framework and began corralling countries on board, one by one, until a historic deal in Ottawa in 1997 when more than 120 nations committed to eradicating anti-personnel landmines. Today, the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is following a similar roadmap. The UN has held several rounds of talks in Geneva, including a session at the end of March. But the CSKR has lost faith in that process, and is now focusing on individual western states. Williams and Wareham hope Germany will take the lead. The country joined the UN security council at the start of the year, and its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, cares about the issue. He recently called killer robots \u201cnothing less than an attack on humanity itself\u201d. Behind the scenes, Berlin has reached out to other states to push for more progress. At least some politicians in Germany recognise it has the opportunity to be the first country to ban killer robots and if it does, other European states would follow suit. But the country has also, at times, acted with uncertainty on the matter, especially in its discourse at the UN. In part to put Germany on the spot, members of the CSKR came together in Berlin last month to drum up public support. Standing in front of the organisation\u2019s own \u201cfriendly\u201d robot mascot, Williams urged the crowd before her to reach out to their political representatives and to spread the word. \u201cPeople freak out over the word \u2018activism\u2019,\u201d Williams told them. \u201cAll it means is \u2018to act.\u2019\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

As advancing nationalist parties prepare to meet in Milan on Monday to forge an alliance in the run-up to May\u2019s European elections, anti-populist activists in Switzerland may have some lessons on halting \u2013 even reversing \u2013 the seemingly unstoppable rise of rightwing populists. \u201cIt\u2019s about the political space, who\u2019s defining and shaping it, who\u2019s communicating strategically within it, who, basically, is holding it,\u201d says Flavia Kleiner, 28, the group\u2019s self-assured co-president, over tea in a Zurich bookshop and coffee house. \u201cAt the moment, in lots of places, it\u2019s populists. Everywhere, the conversation\u2019s about identity: who we are, where we\u2019re from, the past. But that\u2019s their turf. We have to go on the offensive \u2013 clear the fog, refocus attention, reframe the debate.\u201d As the ground zero of postwar European populism, Switzerland is home to arguably Europe\u2019s most consistently successful rightwing populist party, the Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP). For 25 years, the SVP had been steadily building its electoral success through a series of increasingly nation-first, anti-immigration popular referendums. In February 2016, months after the SVP had scored its highest ever share of the vote, 29.4%, in national elections, with the political mainstream seemingly helpless to halt its advance, Switzerland went to the polls again, this time for an SPP-sponsored referendum demanding the automatic deportation of immigrants found guilty of even minor offences. Had the proposal passed, any of the country\u2019s two million non-Swiss residents \u2013 a quarter of the population \u2013 caught, for example, speeding twice in any 10-year period, could have been automatically returned to their homeland, with judges barred from considering personal circumstances. It didn\u2019t pass. Voters rejected it overwhelmingly by 59% to 41%, on a higher turnout \u2013 at nearly 64% \u2013 than for any popular referendum in years. \u201cOne moment we were talking about immigration and doing just fine,\u201d the SVP\u2019s leader said at the time. \u201cThe next, everyone was talking about rule of law. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d What happened was Operation Libero. The movement had just chalked up the first in an unbroken series of victories over popular referendums pushed by the SVP. The latest, on giving Swiss law precedence over international law, was defeated in November last year by 66% to 34%. In cantonal elections in Zurich last month, which are seen as a reliable indicator for October\u2019s national elections, the biggest losers, by far, were the SVP, whose share of the vote plunged lower than at any time since 1995. \u201cThe populists don\u2019t know what\u2019s hit them, and they really don\u2019t know how to deal with it,\u201d says Constantin Seibt, one of the country\u2019s most respected journalists and editor-in-chief of Republik, a record-breaking, crowdfunded news startup. \u201cAll they can manage is to bleat \u2018It\u2019s not fair. They\u2019ve got all these young people, and somehow they keep turning everything we say against us\u2019. Well, those young people have changed the dynamics of the country. The populists seem to be running out of steam. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Operation Libero was formed by a handful of mainly student friends soon after the \u201cpolitical earthquake\u201d of 2014, when the SVP narrowly won a potentially crippling referendum to curb EU immigration. \u201cWe had to fight because we did not want to live in a country like this,\u201d says Kleiner. Also there at the beginning was communications director Silvan Gisler, 31, a former journalist. \u201cIt was just, \u2018Fuck, this really has just happened,\u2019\u201d he says in the group\u2019s offices, which are based in a slightly scruffy office block around the corner from Zurich\u2019s red light district. \u201cAnd had everyone done enough to stop it? No.\u201d Operation Libero was a working title but it \u201ckind of stuck\u201d, Gisler said. \u201cYou know, in football there used to be a player called the \u2018libero\u2019 \u2013 the last defender, but also the one who gives the first pass to the attack. And \u2018operation\u2019 conveyed urgency. We are a movement, not a party. But above all, we\u2019re about values and action.\u201d From the outset, the group adopted a radically different approach. Its first, modest campaign was in late 2014, against another popular referendum, Ecopop, which envisaged \u201climiting the population to a level compatible with the preservation of the country\u2019s natural resources\u201d \u2013 notably, of course, by restricting immigration. Helped by small-scale crowdfunding, the group launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign. An army of young volunteers handed amused nightclubbers condoms in bright pink packaging, commanding them to \u201cprevent disaster: have sex against Ecopop\u201d. Soon after, it launched a campaign for same-sex marriage, which it is still pursuing (\u201cIt\u2019s vital that we\u2019re not just reactive. That we say what we\u2019re really for, not just what we\u2019re against,\u201d says Gisler) with viral social media videos featuring cute same-sex couples on ski-lifts in wedding gear telling passersby they are \u201cunhappily unmarried\u201d. The breakthrough, though, came that day in February 2016. \u201cIt was clear that if we talked about criminal foreigners, we\u2019d become the defenders of criminal foreigners,\u201d says Kleiner. \u201cWe\u2019d have lost before we started. \u201cInstead, we set the terms of the debate by portraying the SVP\u2019s proposal as an attack against fundamental Swiss values. Against the constitution as a pillar of our liberal democracy; the rule of law; equal justice for all. We were the patriots here, because this was an attack on things that every Swiss citizen holds dear.\u201d She first thought they might win, Kleiner says, the day she heard two women talking about the upcoming referendum in a shop: \u201cOne said, \u2018Can you imagine? It would mean a family man, a father, being deported, just like that, for driving a bit too fast.\u2019 And the other said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want that happening to me. It\u2019s not right.\u201d Success brought money and the means to do more. Operation Libero has about 1,500 members paying a CHF50-100 (\u00a338-\u00a376) annual subscription; 10,000 donors, mostly giving sums less than CHF250; 5,000 volunteers on call and four regional sections. It employs seven part-time staff and is organised to a degree that is positively, well, Swiss. The office is all charts and whiteboards, with six campaigns \u2013 some, still secret \u2013 mapped across weekly timelines. Post-it notes and to-do lists cover walls and desks. At clockwork-smooth morning meetings plans are discussed, projects refined, ideas floated, timings decided, messages polished, responsibilities allocated. Of necessity, and because it works, much of the group\u2019s work is online. Besides the viral videos, it enlists \u201conline warriors\u201d, more than 100 at any one time for major campaigns, to engage on social media platforms. These are not trolls, Kleiner insists. They use their own names, offer arguments rather than invective and are under orders to stay polite and never escalate. Fuschia pink, Operation Libero\u2019s brand colour, vibrates everywhere. Merchandising, in the form of startlingly pink socks, sits in piles under desks. \u201cTrump sucks, Wilders sucks, Le Pen sucks, Petry sucks,\u201d says one video, from two years ago. \u201cPopulism sucks. Make 2017 great again. Buy Libero socks.\u201d \u201cYou have to have fun,\u201d says Gisler. But the group\u2019s youthful enthusiasm \u2013 most Operation Libero staff are in their 20s or early 30s \u2013 is married to a campaign-hardened professionalism. The slogans, images and posters they devise themselves are as hard-hitting and attention-grabbing as those of their opponents, dreamt up by an expensive political advertising agency. \u201cWe spend so much time getting them right,\u201d says Gisler. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to have the right content, smart content. To frame the debate right. Content has to have substance, depth, rigour. But it\u2019s also how to say it \u2013 the visuals and the message. It has to be short enough, catchy enough, popular enough, to really break through.\u201d Kleiner wants eventually to see a new alliance of progressive, liberal democratic movements and parties across Europe, of which Operation Libero could be a part. \u201cThe SVP say they\u2019re defending ordinary Swiss people against the state and a global elite but they\u2019re actually weakening the structures and institutions that secure those very individuals\u2019 freedoms,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the populists who are on the attack!\u201d Politics now, Kleiner believes, has moved far beyond the left-right divide, or even the progressive-conservative divide. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly, actually, about constructive versus destructive,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s really where we are.\u201d Her top tips for combating rightwing populism? Reframe the debate, obviously. But beyond that, \u201cYou have to be accurate, honest, understandable. You have to be serious about what you\u2019re doing, responsible \u2013 but at the same time keep it fun, light. That\u2019s not always easy. It\u2019s really hard sometimes, actually. And you have to be positive.\u201d Underpinning everything, says Kleiner, is an ambition just to \u201cchange the mood. The thing that\u2019s there but no one sees. To move away from the fear and pessimism the SVP have instilled in the Swiss mentality, change that narrative. We don\u2019t want some defensive, inward-looking museum of a country. We\u2019re looking forward, with hope, to a Switzerland we want to live in in 2050.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Articles quoted neighbours saying Ryan\u2019s father was \u201cthe nicest guy you could ever meet\u201d and that his parents were the \u201cloveliest couple\u201d. In one instance, the domestic homicide was described as being \u201cunderstandable\u201d. \u201cThere was a rush to excuse our father\u2019s actions in the media and to sympathise with him that showed a complete misunderstanding of coercively controlling men,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cThey don\u2019t abuse their neighbours, they target their abuse at the family and put a facade on to the outside world. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised when murdering men appear to be normal men because that\u2019s how they\u2019ve kept their control of their family hidden for so long.\u201d Now, after a year of campaigning, Hart is forcing a change to guidelines on media coverage that will encourage a greater accuracy in reporting domestic homicides. These guidelines will aim for journalists to place accountability solely on the killer, crack down on sensationalist language, and avoiding using trivialising imagery, with a greater sensitivity towards culture and religion. The hope is to end the posthumous exculpation of family killers, which Hart believes might actually have encouraged his father to kill. \u201cOur father was Googling for many months about men who murdered their wives and children before he killed his own wife and daughter,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cHe was looking to see what sort of response he would get, since men who murdered their wives are often quoted as \u2018nice guys\u2019 because they\u2019ve put so much work into maintaining this false reputation. And that\u2019s exactly what happened with him.\u201d The guidelines will be published later this month by the journalism regulatory body , the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso). While they are an advisory resource for now, Hart hopes to make them part of Ipso\u2019s editors\u2019 code of practice, which member organisations must follow or face fines of up to \u00a31m for breaching. Member organisations include the Sun, the Times, the Daily Mail, and the Sunday Telegraph. Created by feminist organisation Level Up, in consultation with survivors such as Ryan Hart and criminologist Dr Jane Monckton-Smith, these \u201cdignity for dead women\u201d guidelines not only aim to increase sensitivity around reporting on domestic violence cases but also act as a checklist for reporters writing about cases. Points to note include only using police-authorised images of the victim and including those of the perpetrator at the bottom, describing the perpetrator\u2019s actions in an active voice, and refraining from using neighbours\u2019 quotes in the absence of family members. The misrepresentation of abusive men is a phenomenon Carys Afoko, the executive director of Level Up, believes occurs throughout the media. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that some victims are more sympathetic than others,\u201d Afoko says, \u201cif you\u2019re a nurse you might get sympathetic coverage, but if you left your partner for a woman, you\u2019ll probably get \u2018lesbian sex shame murder\u2019. Some women are considered appropriate victims and others aren\u2019t, while for the men there isn\u2019t a culture of accountability.\u201d \u201cOur guidelines are focused on making sure that the reporting on women is responsible, and giving them the dignity that they\u2019ve been denied in their deaths,\u201d Afoko says. \u201cToo often these things are reported as crimes of passion, like in the Sally Challen case, when actually they\u2019re crimes of control. We need to dismantle these myths around domestic abuse.\u201d Ipso\u2019s head of standards, Charlotte Unwin, says that while it receives relatively few complaints about domestic violence reporting as an organisation, \u201cthis is a topic with significant social impact\u201d. For Teresa Parker at the charity Women\u2019s Aid, this social impact must also include the voices of those who have survived domestic abuse. \u201cSo much of the reporting on domestic homicide cases is court reporting, which means that often the prosecution\u2019s words are presented as fact,\u201d she says, \u201cthis leaves the victim with no voice, and so it\u2019s important for her story to be included. This new guidance will help achieve that.\u201d As well as providing a voice, ultimately Ryan Hart believes that better media representation could reframe the narrative of domestic abuse for potential perpetrators. \u201cThe men who commit these crimes don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re doing anything wrong,\u201d he says, \u201cso if we keep pushing these narratives through the media, the men will remain in an echo chamber.\u201d Ryan and Level Up also have plans to begin newsroom training. \u201cThe Samaritans campaign to better report on suicide has been so successful and was implemented into the editors\u2019 code, so we hope we can do the same with domestic homicide,\u201d Ryan says, \u201cwe can\u2019t let it become normalised, otherwise the media becomes complicit in murder.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "From Calais to Westminster: five young refugees win parliament award", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/from-calais-to-westminster-five-young-asylum-seekers-win-parliament-award", "date": "2019-04-02", "transcript": "Five young men who spent months languishing in the Calais refugee camp are to be rewarded in parliament for their efforts fighting Home Office mistreatment of child asylum seekers. Nisar, Naqeeb, Tariq, Wasim and Mohamad*, all travelled across Europe alone as minors before reaching the UK in 2016. The five, now aged between 18 and 22, all faced long delays to their asylum procedures but used the time to contact MPs and join campaigns to highlight failings in the system. On Tuesday, they will receive a Your UK Parliament community campaigner award. In February they hosted an event at parliament and invited the chief inspector of borders and immigration, David Bolt, to hear evidence about their experience in the asylum system. After hearing about the severe impact on young people\u2019s mental health from delays of months and even years, Bolt decided to launch an inquiry into how the Home Office treats unaccompanied minors. Despite receiving an award from parliament, Naqeeb has been refused asylum after waiting nearly three years to have his case resolved. He told the Guardian that he will fight for a fairer system as long as he is in the UK. \u201cThe Home Office doesn\u2019t believe the evidence I have given them about my case, which is upsetting as my life will be in danger if I am returned to my country,\u201d said the Afghan national, who is 18. \u201cHowever, I still believe in the UK and its values, and so I will keep contributing to this country and the people here. I believe we would all benefit hugely if people seeking sanctuary were given the chance to fully contribute to this country. So I will continue working as hard as I can for this. I know there is so much we can achieve together.\u201d Elaine Ortiz is the leader of the Hummingbird Young Leaders group, which helped the young men. She told the Guardian: \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell them to do this, we just gave them space to learn public speaking and how to bring about change and they ran with it. \u201cThey knew it wouldn\u2019t help their own individual cases but they wanted to try and help others, that is what is beautiful about this.\u201d Some refugees have had to wait as long as four years for their decisions. Ortiz says the impact on young people has been devastating, with suicide attempts and multiple hospitalisations. Despite facing his own problems, Naqeeb says the award means a lot to him. \u201cThis award gives me strength. It shows there are people listening to our stories.\u201d * The men have asked for their surnames not to be given as some still have open asylum cases.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Slum gods: the Kenyans steering young radicals away from terrorism", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/slum-gods-the-kenyans-steering-young-radicals-away-from-terrorism", "date": "2019-03-28", "transcript": "It\u2019s morning in Majengo, a poor neighbourhood of Mombasa. The palm trees and swimming pools of the tourist resorts scattered around the coastal Kenyan city seem a world away from these narrow, rubbish-strewn streets and tin-roofed homes. In a small community centre, a small group sit on the battered wooden benches in the searing summer heat talking of extremism, police violence and gangs \u2013 and hope and courage. Majengo already had a bad reputation before Islamist militants killed 21 in an assault in January on a luxury hotel, office and restaurant complex in the capital Nairobi, 500km away. The neighbourhood has long been known as a fertile recruiting ground for al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist organisation based in neighbouring Somalia that is responsible for a bloody if intermittent terrorist campaign in Kenya. The suicide bomber who led the assault in Nairobi has been identified as Mahir Khalid Riziki, 25, from Majengo. Investigators are still trying to understand exactly howhe was recruited, trained and then returned to Kenya by al-Shabaab, an affiliate of al-Qaida. In Majengo, locals have a good idea how it might have happened. Rukiya, 27, describes how he came close to being recruited. With a group of friends, he attended local extremist mosques that were later shut down by authorities. \u201cWe felt [going to fight with al-Shabaab] was a religious duty. We were looking forward to being martyrs,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother did not want me to fight but my father was supportive. Many people I know went to Somalia, but I was lucky. I ended up in a religious school where a different teacher made me realise that my ideas about holy war were all wrong.\u201d Rukiya is now part of an innovative \u00a32.5m programme run by Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) , a thinktank in London. Most efforts to tackle extremism aim to \u201cde-radicalise\u201d existing militants but these have had only patchy success since they were first pioneered a decade or so ago. The Rusi programme is different. It has its origins in crime prevention and focuses instead on stopping people becoming drawn into extremism. Since 2016, it has funded dozens of mentors in Kenya who work with more than 200 people seen as vulnerable to recruitment efforts and dangerous ideologies. Thirty-two individuals have \u201cgraduated\u201d from the programme. Along with extremism, Majengo also suffers from soaring levels of unemployment, drugs and gangs. Martine Zeuthen, the team leader, said a wide network of social workers, local clerics and teachers referred those thought to be at risk. There are several indicators: a close friend or relative who had joined al-Shabaab, actively advocating violent extremism in the community, membership of a gang or a recent incarceration. Coming from an abusive family, dropping out of school or converting to Islam were also risk factors, Zeuthen said, though of less relevance. The programme links the vulnerable with a mentor, often someone from the same neighbourhood who has overcome similar challenges, who can help them deal with any serious problems in their lives, support them emotionally and divert them from the \u201calternative community\u201d offered by extremist groups. Zeuthen said the programme was prompting \u201ca lot of interest in the US and Europe\u201d and an approach of looking at terrorism as \u201cjust another serious crime\u201d. Kenya has long suffered from extremism. A first wave of violence between 1998 and 2002 was directed by al-Qaida against foreign targets, including US embassies and Israeli tourists. It had ebbed by the middle of the last decade. But radicalism continued to grow among Kenya\u2019s Muslim minority, fuelled by a sense of marginalisation, the impact of the US-led \u201cwar on terror\u201d and a shift away from traditional moderate Islamic practices to more rigorous versions of the faith promoted by countries in the Gulf. \u201cFirst we starting seeing signs of religious intolerance, and young men were disappearing. It was related to the world picture and the perception that the US and the western world were enemies of Islam, and in Kenya Muslims were feeling that they were second class citizens. We also started feeling the influence of the Gulf states which brought different views about non-believers,\u201d said Sheik Yusuf Abu Hamza, a cleric in the sprawling and very poor Nairobi neighbourhood of Kibera. In 2013 gunmen from al-Shabaab stormed a shopping mall in Nairobi, killing 67 people. Then 148 people were shot dead at a university in Kenya\u2019s north-east. Both attacks were launched from Somalia, where Kenyan troops are fighting the extremists as part of an African Union force, but drew attention to support networks within Kenya itself. Almost all the mentors \u2013 who are paid a small stipend by Rusi \u2013 and the mentees interviewed by the Guardian in Majengo complained of police harassment and brutality. \u201cIt is like a reflex action. Even if there is just a small incident, the patrols come through. After [the recent] Nairobi attack, most of us ended up being arrested, detained, questioned,\u201d said Nolly, 35. Others allege bribes and mistreatment. Recruiters specifically target women, said Fatima, 27, who admitted to having once been \u201cvery close to getting involved\u201d in extremism. \u201cI was going to fight for Muslims. I wanted my revenge on people who judged me because I was a Muslim. I was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe youth just have unemployment, poverty. We don\u2019t have an opportunity to express ourselves. There is a sense the government is targeting a certain community.\u201d Local senior police officials say they make strenuous efforts to \u201cwin hearts and minds\u201d. Recently, Kenyan authorities have faced a new wave of Islamist militants who are better educated, from a wider range of ethnic backgrounds and include more women. All those involved in January\u2019s attack appear to have been born in Kenya, and one is the son of an army NCO from Kenya\u2019s largest ethnic community, the Kikuyu. \u201cAs long as this kind of wrong religion is there, then radicalisation will not end\u2026 There are new teachers and new recruits among young people,\u201d said Rukiya. He and others in the programme told the Guardian they know young people who have gone to Somalia recently. But many are optimistic. \u201cThere is a growing sense of belonging [in the Muslim community],\u201d said Abu Hamza, the cleric. \u201cThis generation feel Kenyan and what to do something for the country.\u201d In Majengo, Fatima, 25, said the mentor programme had taught her to believe in herself, to value the life she has and that revenge is not the answer. \u201cI used to feel there was only me to face so many problems. I used to fear people but now I have courage\u201d,\u201d she said. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

It\u2019s about the tiny number of people available to treat them. Wherever you live, it\u2019s highly probable that there simply are not nearly enough psychiatrists and psychotherapists. The overwhelming majority of countries have fewer than 200 psychiatrists for every million people. The result is often long waiting times, eye-watering fees for private attention and/or the overprescription of antidepressants by family doctors with few other options. Now, however, technology is seeking to fill the vacuum with a formidable dashboard of apps, chatbots, avatars and digital counsellors that promise everything from daily check-ins and mood tracking to cognitive behavioural therapy and preventive \u201cmental health hygiene\u201d. The big question is: are they any good? The majority of these platforms are for-profit businesses and, as such, the global mental health software market had an estimated value of $1.35bn in 2017. Some experts in the mental health field are cautiously optimistic. The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), the profession\u2019s regulatory body, found in a recent survey of 1,987 members that 61% already use digital platforms in their therapeutic work, ranging from messaging to video conferencing. The deputy chair of the BACP, Fiona Ballantine Dykes, says that with text-based online platforms, \u201cthere are benefits to the anonymity, since sometimes it is really difficult to sit in front of a person and talk to them. If this is something that can encourage people to take a first step to counselling or help signpost them to other services, then that is fantastic.\u201d Esther Schmidt, NHS children\u2019s services commissioning lead in Swindon, says that these anonymised online services \u201cseem to reach some people from BME [black and minority ethnic] and minority groups in a way that face-to-face services probably wouldn\u2019t because of stigma around cultural assumptions of mental health\u201d. She notes that these services \u201cwill become an increasing part of treatment, especially for places with geographical challenges\u201d. Yet not everyone is a fan. Sarah Niblock, the chief executive of the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), the sector\u2019s regulatory body, has her concerns. \u201cWhile the immediacy and accessibility of online mental health platforms can be seen as a definite positive, the anonymity can be troubling,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that these platforms can provide a lasting alternative to face-to-face therapy, since the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and client is what allows the person to confront issues which have been deeply buried.\u201d It\u2019s this confrontation that makes the therapist\u2019s office a potentially daunting experience. By far the most popular of all these services are mindfulness apps. Drawing on meditative therapies, platforms such as Headspace have been valued at $250m, and its rival Calm has been downloaded more than 45m times. While these services mainly use the digital format as an accessible alternative to physical diaries or self-help guides, there has been a new spate of apps that offer counselling services and peer support groups via a digital platform. Perhaps the most popular of these, in the UK at least, is Kooth, a service targeted at 11- to 18-year-olds, allowing them to anonymously discuss their mental health experiences with peers, as well as take part in text-based counselling sessions with remote therapists. User numbers are expected to top 100,000 this year, from 20,000 in 2015, and 95% of users say they would recommend it to a friend. Co-founder Zoe Blake credits Kooth\u2019s success to digital anonymity. \u201cThere\u2019s a disinhibition factor associated with counselling via text, where young people feel the lack of eye contact or judging allows them to be themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cOver 86% of our users have said they prefer the online environment to face-to-face counselling.\u201d Ben Griffiths, 16, has been using Kooth for the past 18 months. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely less stigma around using Kooth,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you go to a counselling session in school, it\u2019s hard to be private about it because people can see where you are going \u2013 whereas with Kooth it\u2019s anonymous, you can have as many sessions as you need, and it helps stop your small stresses from developing into something bigger, like depression.\u201d Blake emphasises that Kooth is an early-intervention service, designed to address the exam-related stresses experienced by users such as Griffiths, rather than for crisis management. \u201cWe\u2019re not replacing face-to-face counselling,\u201d she says, \u201cwe\u2019re getting the counsellors to do only the things they can do, without taking up unnecessary time on preliminaries.\u201d While Kooth is facilitated by counsellors with a minimum of three years\u2019 experience, other platforms integrate digital aspects further, using artificial intelligence to take the place of a trained human interface. Silicon Valley firms Woebot and X2AI, as well as Indian startup Wysa, all use scripted chatbots to engage with their users, scanning text to machine-learn cues that they then respond to. Wysa is operated by a penguin avatar that users can chat to, as if using WhatsApp, describing itself as \u201cyour life coach and friend\u201d, while Woebot\u2019s interface is more constructed. It conducts daily \u201ccheck-ins\u201d that monitor users\u2019 moods (from \u201chappy\u201d to \u201cangry\u201d, \u201ctired\u201d, or \u201csad\u201d) as well as allowing users to write \u201cchat stories\u201d to explore emotions in greater detail. For instance, on clicking that I was \u201csad\u201d on one Woebot check-in, it recommended a \u201cthought challenger\u201d exercise to identify my negative thoughts and pick apart the reasons for their existence with a series of short responses. While the experience can feel forced and jarring at times (interspersing emojis with phrases such as \u201ccoinky-dink\u201d and \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d), these chatbots are extremely popular: Woebot receives an exchange of 2m messages a week, X2AI covers 4 million people in the US and Wysa has more than 600,000 users globally. Woebot co-founder Alison Darcy defines her platform not as a prediagnosis tool but instead one that \u201chelps people at the point of the single encounter, changing the conversation away from the domain of the clinic towards the understanding that everyone has mental health, which has to be taken care of every day\u201d. In this way, she believes that logging on and communicating with the app for just 10 minutes a day can have a more powerful effect than the \u201cone-hour lecture\u201d of a counselling session. Similarly, Wysa co-founder Ramakant Vempati says that \u201clabelling and diagnosis is completely irrelevant to the lived experience of a condition. What people want is a safe space to be able to talk, an empathetic experience. So Wysa\u2019s like having a journal which can write back to you.\u201d Yet these complex and rapid technological developments have not always had positive results. A recent test conducted by the BBC found that both Wysa and Woebot failed to notice messages containing allegations of underage sexual abuse, responding in one case that the user should \u201crewrite your negative thought so that it\u2019s more balanced\u201d. But Niblock of UKCP points out: \u201cPeople should be unafraid to work with psychotherapists, since you need the ability, no matter how ashamed or guilty you feel about something, to tell that to a person who then says, \u2018I hear you\u2019, and who isn\u2019t judging. This is where therapy is transformational, and a chatbot cannot replace being supported by a human being.\u201d If reliance on AI chatbots is a step too far, then perhaps digital interventions as part of a holistic treatment is the solution. In this vein, workplace mental health platform Unmind produces informational content, which is signposted to the user by AI, to create a combination of cognitive behavioural therapy and guided self-help. Clinical psychologist and Unmind co-founder Nick Taylor says without digital mental health treatment, the \u00a334.9bn cost of mental ill health at work in the UK last year will only increase. \u201cFrom a clinical perspective, it\u2019s really frustrating that when you see someone for the first time, you think, \u2018If only I\u2019d met you six months before, I could\u2019ve had much more of an impact\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t leave a broken leg for six months without going to the doctor, but that\u2019s what happens with mental health, and it\u2019s incredibly damaging.\u201d To remedy this, Unmind aims to remove the negative stigma around mental health. \u201cDiagnostic assessment searches for problems, and you can\u2019t use that for a population that is well,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to ask someone who is well if they\u2019re suicidal \u2013 it\u2019ll put them off engaging with their mental health full-stop. So, our platform allows you to track your wellbeing and, while we\u2019re not diagnostic, we can develop a good idea of how well someone is, based on how they interact with the platform, and that allows us to assign content or signpost to other services.\u201d Unmind is only available through employers who have paid for access, and its current users include more than 100,000 employees of John Lewis and Yorkshire Building Society, but the company is in talks to expand into the US \u2013 where 65% of the population of non-metropolitan counties do not have access to a psychiatrist. Perhaps early digital engagement with our mental health could reduce the stigma of the therapist\u2019s office, especially if it is not easily accessible. As digital incursions into our life become natural \u2013 none of the companies I spoke to reported concerns from their users on data usage \u2013 these mental wellbeing platforms could become as commonplace as Facebook or Twitter. \u201cMental health is the number one best thing about being a human being,\u201d Taylor says, \u201cso it\u2019s frustrating that we always see it in a negative light \u2013 we need the right care at the right time and we shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of it.\u201d \u2022 Ammar Kalia is a Guardian journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursary \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

The driver, Sutino \u201cKinong\u201d Hadi, laughs as he putters his tiny Bemo in a loop outside a preschool in Tanah Abang, in central Jakarta. It\u2019s all the signal the children need; around 20 flood out to envelope the car, pulling at hangings, clambering into the front seat. It\u2019s an exciting time: their library has arrived. Kinong is one of thousands of Indonesians who have opened their own library in their own communities. Estimates suggest there are thousands of such libraries in Indonesia, started by ordinary people with great initiative to address the lack of books in their area and funded by occasional donations. There is the Perahu Pustaka, a library boat that sails around West Sulawesi. There are libraries on the back of vegetable carts, shelves lugged around by horses in Serang and in West Papua. Across Banten, a 200-strong motorbike gang called the Komunitas Motor Literasi (Moli), brings books to homes from a box attached to their vehicles, delivered with the ease of a takeaway. All of them are run by inventive, ambitious, ordinary people much like Kinong, 59, who left school before he turned 10. Since 2013, he has parked his Bemo near schools in Tanah Abang, and let kids settle in to enjoy a book. He only sometimes allows them to take it home, with a stern promise to return it. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of books that way,\u201d he laughs. With 17,000 islands and a geography that almost spans the distance from London to Tehran, Indonesia has struggled to promote reading across the country. For every 100 students, just one quarter leave school meeting minimum standards of literacy and numeracy. Only 30% of villages have a library; some of the smallest only stock copies of the Quran. The government has attempted several initiatives, including a rule that children must read a book that isn\u2019t a textbook at school for 15 minutes each morning; and on the 17th day of each month, individuals can post books, wherever they want in the country, for free. But the persistent myth that Indonesians aren\u2019t interested in reading still pervades; last September, Jakarta governor, Anies Baswedan, told the Jakarta Post: \u201cWe are challenged to improve our reading interest, particularly in an era where people are far more interested in reading WhatsApp [chats] than in reading books \u2026 People nowadays prefer to skim rather than read.\u201d But civilians argue that interest isn\u2019t the problem, its the lack of infrastructure. \u201cReading appetite isn\u2019t low in Indonesia, its just hard to get books,\u201d says Laura Prinsloo, a publisher and chairperson of Indonesia\u2019s national book committee, citing the millions now posting books on the 17th. \u201cIn Indonesia, if the government fails, the public does something \u2013 then they step up. A lot of the people operating these libraries don\u2019t have an education, which makes it hard in a place where it\u2019s about who you know. So if you don\u2019t know anyone, you just do it yourself.\u201d Like Andri Gunawan, a wiry young man who heads up the Komunitas Motor Literasi. He never had a library in any of his schools and only became a voracious reader as an adult. \u201cContrary to what a lot of people say, it\u2019s not that there is no interest in reading, it is that there are no books,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to start there.\u201d Or Kiswanti, a 52-year-old woman who started out delivering books door-to-door for free on her bicycle. Now, her library and school Warabal, found in Parung, Java, is 21 years old and houses 15,000 books, looked after by 25 volunteers for 1,700 members. Kiswanti, who prefers to use just the one name, only received a few years of elementary education and decades on, still cries at the memory of having to spy on lessons in a neighbouring school through slits in the bamboo wall. \u201cMy father apologised as he couldn\u2019t send me on to further education,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he told me, if I wanted to be smarter, I had to read \u2013 and if I did, I could achieve whatever dream I had.\u201d Her dream was opening her own library \u2013 and she pursued it relentlessly. Her wages from shucking peanuts and harvesting rice went towards books. When she got a job as a domestic helper in Jakarta, she asked to be paid in books. When her husband proposed in 1987, she had rules \u2013 including the freedom to buy any books she wanted. When Kiswanti opened Warabal in 1997, she even began fasting 10 days each month to buy more. \u201cI needed 3,000 rupiah (16p) to eat a day,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t eat, I can save 30,000 (\u00a31.66) in 10 days \u2013 so I could take our best students by taking them to bookshops and buy them any book they want.\u201d Health problems eventually stopped her from continuing this practice, but her resolve remains the same. \u201cReading transports me and introduces me to new worlds \u2013 I want to give children that.\u201d Though they are applauded by the Indonesian government, community library owners like Andri, Kiswanti and Kinong all rely on donations from the public. Even President Joko Widodo has donated books to Kinong, who keeps a small photo of them shaking hands taped in pride of place on his Bemo. Not even Bemos being banned from the road last year has stopped Kinong\u2019s resolve, though it ended his 40-year career as a taxi driver. He now sells drinks on the side of the road, and can only drive this library around the neighbourhood once or twice a week. \u201cMy life situation is a bit unstable right now,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I could earn more, my family would be more stable and I could do this more. I just want children to read more than I did.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The plan from its housing chief states: \u201cInvestors are buying Amsterdam homes more and more frequently, intending to rent them out. This means that \u2018normal\u2019 house-buyers have less of a chance in the housing market, and Amsterdam is not happy with this.\u201d The move comes at time of increasing alarm in the Dutch city and with the national government about three years of runaway house prices, a shortage of affordable homes and ever-growing tourism that some local residents and businesses say is destroying Amsterdam. An estimated one in five homes in the city is sold to investors, and last year about 10,000 foreign nationals moved to Amsterdam from January to the end of November, the same number of Dutch nationals left, while there was a natural increase of 5,000 residents. In the past week, the city housing chief, Laurens Ivens, announced policies to enforce maximum prices for newbuild owner-occupied homes for middle incomes, and a crackdown on the subletting of social houses, which is banned. The Airbnb-style short lets, which account for 12% of overnight tourist stays in the city are also being tackled: the Dutch home affairs minister, Kajsa Ollengren, announced plans for a national registration scheme and to make renting out a home via holiday rental platforms for more than annual maximum of days \u2013 in Amsterdam it is 30 \u2013 a financial crime with tough penalties. There \u201cWe don\u2019t think we have the golden bullet but the city of Amsterdam does have a lot of different measures to improve the liveability of the city for our residents,\u201d said a city spokeswoman. \u201cThe first point of a city is to live in, and the second is to visit.\u201d Amsterdam has become a magnet for international business, especially with Brexit looming. In 2017, the city joined the UBS global real estate bubble index, and is now seventh after London and New York in terms of price-to-income ratio, with median sales price at a record \u20ac448,000 (\u00a3382,000) in the last quarter of 2018. Even though 39% of homes are social housing, there isn\u2019t enough affordable housing, according to the Amsterdam Federation of Housing Associations (AFWC). \u201cWe regularly speak to people who are 31 and still living with their parents, or have three-generational houses \u2013 not through choice,\u201d said Egbert de Vries, AFWC director. \u201cThe population is growing, with people living longer and positive net immigration for the last 50 years. Over the last 10 years we have built 60,000 fewer homes, and people who get a house have on average been on the waiting list for 15 years.\u201d While housebuilding is the most essential action, he said, \u201cit would help to make rules that people have to live in the house that they buy\u201d. Dr David Wachsmuth, an expert in urban planning and governance at McGill University in Montreal, has studied how holiday rentals reduce housing stock. He said a buy-to-let ban could limit tourist rentals in problem cities like London, too. \u201cThe evidence is clear that a lot of new construction is heading directly into the short-term rental market, so trying to make sure these properties are occupied by long-term residents is sound public policy. \u201cMore importantly, it speaks to the challenges that Amsterdam and many other cities are facing in regulating short-term rentals \u2026 mostly because Airbnb and the other platforms consistently work to evade and undermine regulations which restrict their growth.\u201d Others have concerns, though. Emile van Gelder of Amsterdam estate agents Peter Bruin, said the buy-to-live rule would be an \u201cunacceptable infringement of the property right of ownership\u201d and that build more homes was a better solution. The city\u2019s plans are treating the symptoms rather than the disease, said Stephen Hodes of thinktank Amsterdam in Progress, adding: \u201cWhat if parents buy a house for their children when they study in Amsterdam or I buy a house and am sent abroad for six months for work? The real problem is investors who buy up multiple houses for letting, and this regulation will affect them \u2013 but also the freedom of the \u2018normal\u2019 residents.\u201d In a statement, Airbnb said it helped its 20,000 Amsterdam hosts comply with the rules and pay tax: \u201cWe have long supported the creation of a national registration system as a user-friendly tool that allows cities across the Netherlands to get the data they need and effectively discourages bad actors \u2026 We look forward to working together with policymakers on the implementation of a system that is fair, proportionate and in line with EU law.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Life expectancy improved more quickly in countries that switched to democracy over the past 50 years, the researchers discovered, and there were fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease, diseases such as cancer and cirrhosis, and even road traffic accidents. The study, published in the Lancet, said it was not just that democracies tended to be richer: the \u201cdemocracy effect\u201d was far stronger than any GDP effect. \u201cFree and fair elections appear important for improving adult health \u2026 most likely by increasing government accountability and responsiveness,\u201d the study said. \u201cDemocracies are more likely than autocracies to lead to health gains.\u201d The report comes at a time when democracy is being challenged perhaps as never before. A majority of the world\u2019s population lives in democracies, but more than 2 billion people live in countries where democracy has been on the back foot in recent years, such as India, Turkey, Brazil and the US. The rise of populism attests to disillusionment in much of the democratic world, and the relative success of autocracies from China to Rwanda, and Vietnam to Singapore, has raised questions as to whether political freedom is the best system of government for everyone. The study concludes that, as far as health is concerned, it is. Thomas Bollyky, the lead author, from the US Council on Foreign Relations, said: \u201cThis is good news at a time when the news around democracy has been fairly depressing. Health and elections are inevitably linked.\u201d Researchers used existing measures of democratic experience compiled in the V-Dem database and plotted them against a range of metrics such as government health spending and disease outcomes. They then compared trends in countries that had transitioned from autocracy to democracy since 1970 with 55 states that had not. The impact of HIV was factored out, because the huge amount of foreign aid devoted to the virus would have skewed the findings. The conclusions were stark. Life expectancy at age 15 was 3% higher in countries 10 years after their transition to democracy than in counterparts that had not changed government type. Cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, transport injuries and non-communicable diseases also fell as democracy bedded in. These four health dangers cause a quarter of the total death and disability in people under 70 in low and middle-income countries. The implication for further democratisation across the autocratic world is clear. \u201cWe estimate that, between 1994 and 2014, the increases in democratic experience resulted in 16 million fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease globally,\u201d said Bollyky. He added that if China had experienced the same democratic transition that a country such as Poland achieved over that period, it would have saved 10 million lives of people who died from that one illness. Researchers believe free societies achieve better outcomes not because of prosperity but public pressure. \u201cCountries where government is not subject to free and fair democracy doesn\u2019t have the same pressure from voters\u201d to deliver better health services, Bollyky said. Dr Joseph Dieleman, a co-author of the paper, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said: \u201cEfforts to improve the health of adults might benefit from funding programmes that help countries to strengthen their democratic processes.\u201d The study is the biggest of its kind to make such a broad correlation between democracy and adult health: others have focused more narrowly on democracy\u2019s impact on early years health. The work was conducted by the US Council on Foreign Relations and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. It was funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

There is emerging evidence that it can boost productivity for bosses and happiness for workers. Playgrounds, garden centres and gymnasiums are filling up on Fridays with people extending their leisure into a five-day working week that has been a staple of western culture since Henry Ford adopted it in 1926. And it is not just small businesses that might be spotting a chance to save a little money by turning the lights off one day a week. A marketing company in Glasgow, Pursuit Marketing, that switched 120 people to four days in late 2016 claims it has been instrumental in a 30% increase in productivity. Perpetual Guardian, a New Zealand trust business that supervises nearly NZ$200bn in assets, has switched its 240 employees to a four-day week and has reported a 20% increase in productivity. A string of small businesses in the UK have contacted the Guardian to enthuse about higher productivity, greater staff satisfaction \u2013 and even bigger profits. Talk of family lives reinvigorated and stress levels plunging abounds. In January, the Wellcome Trust became the biggest UK employer to join the trend when it announced it was exploring switching 800 head-office staff to a three-day weekend. Labour is flirting with how the idea could fit into its policy programme: the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has commissioned a leading economist, Professor Robert Skidelsky, to investigate. And yet, for all the excitement that we may finally be moving towards John Maynard Keynes\u2019 1930 vision that by now we would all work a 15-hour week and spend the rest at leisure, most people who want to work less simply can\u2019t. Since the financial crisis, people in the UK have in fact been working longer, not shorter, hours, as stagnating wages have seen us try to take on more work to keep up with inflation. In 2011, decades of falling hours went into reverse and Britons started working longer again. If the trend for falling hours had continued, we would be enjoying the equivalent of an extra week and a half\u2019s free time each year by now. Automation and artificial intelligence, billed as drivers of greater leisure, have been harnessed by the barons of the gig economy to the opposite effect for some workers. Many of the 1.1 million self-employed people who access work through online platforms including Deliveroo and Uber, as well as white-collar apps such as Upwork, are squeezing in more and more tasks to keep their earnings in line with the cost of living. They face periods at work \u2013 say waiting for a taxi fare, or for parcels to be collated before delivery \u2013 with no pay at all. \u201cThe economic fundamentals are going against the grain of the politics of hours reductions,\u201d said Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cOur object should be to get them on track.\u201d A growing number of people are trying to do just that. Pursuit Marketing is in the hip west Glasgow area of Finnieston, and is a typical part of Britain\u2019s service-driven economy. Pursuit\u2019s 120 workers staff a call centre and digital marketing operation selling services on behalf of computer companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Sage. Since 2011 they have worked a regular week \u2013 8.45am to 5pm Monday to Thursday, and a shorter day on Friday, ending at 3.30pm. But in September 2016, management wanted to increase workers\u2019 productivity. They had noticed that workers on reduced hours, to fit in school runs or look after family dependents, were making around 17% more sales than the full-timers. Director Lorraine Gray said: \u201cThe time off was valued, so they wanted to make sure they could keep it and they would attack their day. They were clear in their focus and there was less small talk by the water cooler.\u201d The firm took the decision to cut everyone\u2019s working week to Monday to Thursday, without changing pay. She said staff responded with \u201ca lot of noise, a lot of excitement\u201d as the new working week took hold. In the first four weeks, sales spiked by 37%. \u201cPeople thought: if we can make this work, we can keep it,\u201d said Gray. The increased productivity has since stabilised and turnover is up 29.5% after two years, the majority of which Gray attributes to the switch to a four-day week. Gray said clients also appear to like the four-day week, because staff with whom they have built relations are less likely to leave (just two left in the last 12 months). Recognising that water-cooler chats are still an important part of work, the firm offers free pre-shift breakfasts so workers can spend a little time gossiping before business begins. Jon Freeman, 33, a travelling salesman for the firm, said it has given him more energy while at work, he gets to look after his boys aged two and five every Friday, and his wife Clare is free to take on more hours in her work as a pharmacy dispenser. \u201cI am more focused and driven because I appreciate the extra time off,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to really watch the clock at the weekend because I never felt like I had long enough off, but now when I come back on Monday I really attack it.\u201d One of the biggest organisations to make the switch is Perpetual Guardian, whose shift has generated huge global interest, with 400 organisations from around the world asking it for advice. \u201cThis week we have had people contact us from Japan, Canada, the UK, France, Switzerland,\u201d said its founder and chief executive, Andrew Barnes. \u201cThe week before it was Bulgaria.\u201d The day off that each worker takes varies, depending on the team\u2019s needs at the time, but there has been a change in culture with \u201cless time surfing on social media, fewer unnecessary meetings\u201d, said Barnes. Staff have taken to putting flags in pots on their desks as \u201cdo not disturb\u201d signs. \u201cThis is an idea whose time has come,\u201d said Barnes, a four-day week evangelist who says he has spotted \u201ca chance to change the world\u201d. \u201cWe need to get more companies to give it a go. They will be surprised at the improvement in their company, their staff and in their wider community.\u201d He said it helps level the playing field between women and men, partly by making it easier for mothers returning to work because they don\u2019t need to commit to five days, and by making men more available for domestic duties. Research into what we might do with more time has produced some bracing results. A 2010 study by US economic psychologists investigated how 909 women would schedule a 16-hour day to maximise wellbeing. Only 36 minutes were allocated for work, compared with 106 minutes for \u201cintimate relations\u201d, 82 minutes for socialising and 56 minutes for shopping. Maybe more \u201cintimate relations\u201d would be good for the economy. Britons work on average 1,514 hours each annually, a full four weeks more than in Germany, but are less productive. Germans and Americans produce GDP worth $60.50 and $64.10 respectively for every hour, compared with $53.50 in the UK. \u201cProductivity relies not just on the sheer amount of hours put in, but on the wellbeing, fatigue levels and overall health of the worker,\u201d reported Autonomy, a new consultancy and thinktank examining the shorter working week, in February. Productivity drops after the 35th hour of weekly work, according to a 2014 study for the Institute for Labour Economics. A study of call centres found that calls were handled less efficiently the longer people worked. When they work shorter hours, people tend to be more relaxed \u2013 and more productive. But Bell, a former Treasury adviser under Labour, is one of those sceptical that productivity gains would be enjoyed across the economy. \u201cIt is very hard to assert that overall output will rise if you cut 20% of your hours across the economy as a whole,\u201d he said. The talk-radio host Nick Ferrari put it more bluntly recently saying it was \u201can insane notion\u201d. Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry, which represents major employers, is unmoved by a four-day week. \u201cAt a time when flexible working is becoming more essential than ever, rigid approaches feel like a step in the wrong direction,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cBusinesses are clear that politicians should work with them to avoid policies that work as a soundbite but not a solution.\u201d Labour\u2019s Skidelsky review is certainly finding it complicated. Rachel Kay, a researcher on the project, said working fewer hours for the same money could work in task-focused sectors where employers don\u2019t need people available all the time, but is less likely in, for example, retail \u2013 the UK\u2019s biggest employer \u2013 where presenteeism is required. \u201cA common complaint after France\u2019s move to the 35-hour week was that companies intensified work to an unpleasant degree, making work more stressful,\u201d she said. \u201cSo whether a shorter working week without new hires would result in improved wellbeing for employees depends on the existing workloads in any given workplace.\u201d \u201cIf we all shut up shop on Thursday, what do we do on the weekend?\u201d said Kate Cooper, policy director at the Institute of Leadership and Management. \u201cUnless, like the Swedes, we go and commune in the woods, we need other people to be working. So who is the four-day week for? I am desperately trying to see how this isn\u2019t going to be for the privileged few. [In] anything that is customer-facing or involving a dynamic or volatile environment, you don\u2019t have the luxury.\u201d The reasons behind increases in productivity are not yet clear. Cooper said that \u201cthe Hawthorne effect\u201d may be in play; that is, people change their behaviour simply because they feel they are being observed \u2013 in this case they feel that by being granted a four-day week they feel their bosses are interested in their work. \u201cHow sustainable is that?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cWhere does the lovely feelgood factor come from if everybody is doing it?\u201d And she had reservations about what might be lost by the removal of the fifth day of the working week. \u201cWhat is being pushed out? What was happening on that fifth day? Were people forming strong social bonds? Were they getting a sense of the company culture? If work is just about getting a job done, a list of tasks, then the sense of purpose and social bonding that comes from employment might not be there.\u201d \u2022 Robert Booth is the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

A lingerie manufacturer, a lighting design firm and a landscape architect are among a wave of employers experimenting with giving staff three days off per week, for no less pay. The Wellcome Trust, the largest employer in Britain to so far consider a four-day week, is thinking about doing a trial for its 800 staff. Growing calls for a shorter working week are being opposed by the Confederation of British Industry on the basis that more flexibility, not less, is needed. But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has commissioned a study into its value from the economist Robert Skidelsky, and the Scottish National party is due to debate a motion next month calling for a review which could lead to the introduction of the four-day week in Scotland. In the last six months, companies switching to a four-day week include Synergy Vision, a 45-employee medical communications agency, Elektra Lighting, a lighting design company, Lara Intimates, which makes underwear, and the Intrepid Camera company, which makes and exports photographic equipment. \u201cIt has been a beautiful six weeks of having a long weekend,\u201d said Neil Knowles, a design consultant at Elektra, which switched its 10 staff to a shorter week in January. \u201cTwo days out of seven is just enough to recover from a stressful week. Three is enough to recover and have extra time to do something else. It almost feels as if work is interrupting the weekend rather than the other way round.\u201d Maxim Grew, at Intrepid in Brighton, said the switch has ended \u201cFriday afternoon fatigue\u201d and increased morale and energy levels among staff with a feeling that every hour counts, leading to productivity boosts. He said people have quickly adjusted to using the extra time off. \u201cI am learning French, Rocco has joined a theatre group, Hugo is spending more time doing carpentry and Sam is building a robot,\u201d he said. Vanessa Ross, the owner of Arc Landscape in Surrey, said her team had used the time to volunteer, look after dependent family members and teach. The idea of a four-day week has shot to prominence in recent months, for economic, social, health and technological reasons. Overwork results in thousands succumbing to stress or depression each year, according to the Health and Safety Executive; long working hours make parenting and family care ever trickier to juggle; technology, meanwhile, threatens to transform the demand for labour over coming decades. Despite this, Britons work more hours a week on average than they did in 2011 \u2013 and research shows two-thirds would like to reduce the amount of time they spend in the office. One of the biggest experiments so far into the effect of the four-day week was carried out at Perpetual Guardian, a finance company in New Zealand. It claims productivity has increased. Its chief executive, Andrew Barnes, said: \u201cThis is an idea whose time has come. We need to get more companies to give it a go. They will be surprised at the improvement in their company, their staff and in their wider community.\u201d He said it helps level the playing field between women and men, partly by making it easier for mothers returning to work because they don\u2019t need to commit to five days and by making men more available for domestic duties. Billy Jenkins, a middle manager at Synergy Vision, said: \u201cIt has caused a little tension in the household, as my partner works five days a week and seems to come up with a wishlist of errands or chores that need doing on my day off. It\u2019s also hard to shake off the feeling that I should be working, and it has taken time to feel more comfortable using the time as my own.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

When practice is over they put down their bats and fall silent as they listen to a very different form of instruction. \u201cI saw a guy harassing a girl on the street yesterday,\u201d one player says solemnly. \u201cHave you seen this too? What did you do to stop it?\u201d The boys share their experiences. When Manish Sharma, 20, told his teammates about the countless times he had witnessed domestic violence, he realised he was not alone. He says discussing the issue with his fellow players emboldened him to tell a relative to stop abusing his wife. \u201cThey gave me strength to intervene,\u201d he says. From cricket in India to rugby in Fiji and Georgia, sport is being used as an entry point to teaching young men about gender equality and developing healthy notions of masculinity. Efforts to reduce violence usually focus on strengthening laws or teaching women self-defence. But experts say educating teenagers in the context of a pastime they love, at a time when their attitudes about gender are forming, can have a lasting impact. After practice, coaches and players discuss how values universal to all sports, such as integrity, fairness and respect, can be applied to personal relationships. In Fiji, where rugby is the most popular sport, coaches are mentoring children in a series of pilot projects supported by UN Women and Oceania Rugby. At 10 schools, male and female coaches mentor small groups of boys and girls aged 10 to 14 about sports values and gender equality. One goal is to encourage players to think critically rather than lecturing them about what is right or wrong. During one session, coaches ask players to consider whether power is positive or negative and what they can do in situations when people use their power over them in ways that feel uncomfortable. \u201cGoing in and saying \u2018violence is bad\u2019 doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says Farrah Kelly, a technical specialist at UN Women in Fiji. \u201cThe kids have to reflect and understand their own attitudes and beliefs and how to take action in their own lives rather than have all this negative messaging.\u201d Coaches and teachers who participated in the first pilot, which ran from October to December last year, say the mentoring has resulted in less absenteeism, bullying and discipline problems among players. By most estimates, India\u2019s eastern state of Bihar has the country\u2019s highest rates of violence against women. Approximately 56% of married women have reported some form of violence or abuse. For the cricket project in Bihar, which was started in 2013 by Population Council and which operates through government-run youth clubs, cricketers and coaches were trained to mentor teenage boys about sports values and social issues such as avoiding substance abuse and ending dowry. Many of the players had witnessed or experienced violence as children, and the mentors were trained to be empathic. A baseline and endline study showed that boys who participated in the programme were more likely to change specific beliefs such as thinking a man was sometimes justified in beating his girlfriend. Like Manish, many say the project empowered them to intervene when they witnessed harassment. Kundan Kumar, 21, says it motivated him to tell a group of boys in his village to stop harassing a classmate. Amit Kumar (no relation to Kundan), 21, says he and his mentors urged his neighbours to let their daughter finish school. Many claim they now do more housework and have set goals for their lives. \u201cThey were taking this information home with them,\u201d says KG Santhya, a Population Council researcher who led the study. Another aim of these projects is to show boys that sport doesn\u2019t have to reinforce aggression and other stereotypes about men. In Georgia, famous rugby players have visited boys in schools to discuss masculinity and rugby values such as treating other players fairly, an idea they say should be applied to women and girls. The Georgian Rugby Union now makes it mandatory for licensed coaches to teach players about gender equality, and so far a few hundred coaches have mentored about 3,000 boys in schools across Georgia. Sport-based interventions are not without obstacles. In Bihar, some boys admit they were only interested in the project for the cricket coaching. Mentors also had to convince some families about the value of letting their sons participate. Another challenge is funding. While representatives from Bihar\u2019s state government have expressed interest in running more projects like this, it requires technical assistance from organisations with the means to train mentors. In Fiji, UN Women is designing a manual for other organisations to use. The cricket coaching in Bihar has ended, but Kundan Kumar and his fellow players still get together at youth club. They\u2019ve moved on to playing football. \u201cThe guys keep asking when the project will start up again,\u201d Kundan said on a recent afternoon. \u201cAnd I always tell them, just keep teaching more people about what you learned.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Since 2017, it has been compulsory for companies with more than 250 employees to report their gender pay gap figures by the end of every financial year. The first round of data, submitted by the deadline last year, showed men were paid more than women in 7,795 out of 10,016 companies and public bodies in Britain, based on the median hourly pay. Only one in five companies expected to report have filed figures for this year. Of the 1,510 companies who have reported to date for both years, 756 (50%) improved their gender pay gap. A further 5% (72 companies) made no progress on closing the gap, 39% (592 companies) reported a worse gap than last year, and 6% (90 companies) reported a 0% gap for both years. The most recent figures refer to the 2017/2018 financial year, while the previous year\u2019s data covers 2016/2017. Among the companies to have reported the biggest improvements so far is Monzo, the digital bank. Its pay gap improved by 34%, from 48% last year \u2013 meaning women earned 52p for every pound men earned \u2013 to 14% this year. This compares with 17.9%, the average median pay gap for both full and part-time workers, according to the ONS. However, its top quartile of earners was still heavily male-dominated. The company reported just 20% of its highest paid employees were women. Tara Mansfield, the head of people at Monzo, said that among the reasons for the change was that the team had more than trebled in the past year, some women had been recruited to senior positions and others had been promoted internally. \u201cWe have committed to making roles at Monzo as attractive as possible to all kinds of people so we can have a representative workforce,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the initiatives we\u2019ve launched have been flexible working, a generous caregiver scheme and mentorship opportunities.\u201d Svitzer Marine Ltd, a ship towage company, reported a 30% improvement in its gender pay gap, from 45% last year to 15% this year. Kasper Friis Nilaus, the managing director of Svitzer Europe, said the maritime industry was traditionally dominated by men, but that the company\u2019s improved pay equality figures reflected the promotion of \u201cmore talented women\u201d to management jobs. While the gap has narrowed, the company\u2019s workforce is predominantly male and 96% of Svitzer\u2019s top quartile of earners are men. Montsaye Community Learning Partnership, an academy trust in Northamptonshire, also reported a large improvement, from 51% to 21%. They said that, while they would like to take credit for the improvement, the main reason was the significant increase in pay for local government employees \u2013 9% in some cases \u2013 set by the Local Government Association. \u201cAs we are a group of schools, our gender balance is heavily weighted towards female staff, the majority of which are part-time. This high pay rise in the lowest grades predominantly occupied by female employees therefore narrowed the gap without any proactive action from the trust,\u201d they said. Banks have reported some of the worst gaps in the figures so far. Credit Suisse International reported a median gap of 45%, while Credit Suisse UK reported a gap of 29%. Barclays Bank plc reported a median gap of 44%. Multi-academy trusts also account for a significant proportion of the highest gaps so far. Nexus Education Schools Trust, a MAT made up of 10 schools in south London, reported a median gap of 58%. Charles Cotton of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said it was too early to draw conclusions from the gender pay gap figures that had been reported so far. He said there were few quick fixes for closing the gap. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at what\u2019s driving the difference,\u201d he said. \u201cSome gaps can be closed by employer action, such as, for instance, flexible working arrangements, for those who have care commitments. \u201cBut some of the gaps can\u2019t be closed so easily because of things that happen outside the workplace, like the availability of low-cost, high-quality childcare or elderly care, or societal assumptions about who should be looking after the children or the elderly.\u201d Hephzi Pemberton, CEO of the Equality Group, said that one of the most effective ways to close the gap was to get women into the highest paid positions. \u201cThat\u2019s where the chasm really occurs,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are quite a lot of statements around about junior and graduate intakes at various organisations and that\u2019s very good, but it\u2019s not going to move the numbers as quickly as getting more women into senior and more economically powerful positions.\u201d She said she expected this year\u2019s gender pay figures to see a marginal improvement. \u201cI think there\u2019s a huge amount of work for a lot of organisations to do and it isn\u2019t work that happens within a year,\u201d said Pemberton. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural change, but also just practical ability to change the make up of senior executive leadership and that can take whole careers to shift.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Meet the world's first 'minister for the unborn'", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/02/meet-the-worlds-first-future-generations-commissioner", "date": "2019-03-02", "transcript": "Sophie Howe is a public servant with a particularly tricky constituency. The people she represents are remote and unresponsive and they never show up to voice an opinion or tell her if she\u2019s doing a good job. They don\u2019t even vote. That\u2019s because they haven\u2019t yet been born. Howe is the world\u2019s first \u2013 and only \u2013 future generations commissioner with statutory powers. She\u2019s there to represent the unborn citizens of Wales. There is no shortage of issues to champion. So many of today\u2019s crises \u2013 climate, insects, water, population growth \u2013 threaten calamity not for the people currently on the planet but for their descendants. The political trope about \u201cour children and our children\u2019s children\u201d has never felt so urgent. Other countries have also toyed with novel governance mechanisms that allow for the voice of future generations to be heard, with Israel, Hungary and Canada notable examples. Yet none have gone as far as Wales to enshrine in law the principle that future generations deserve a fair hearing in present political debates. \u201cWe have put it in statute \u2026 which means we have to ask how to translate it into the decisions that are made every day throughout government,\u201d said Howe, 41, a former deputy police and crime commissioner who has five children. In the job since its creation in 2016, her mandate \u2013 on paper at least \u2013 is clear: to ensure that political decisions taken today don\u2019t compromise the interests of Welsh citizens tomorrow. As commissioner, it is Howe\u2019s job to advise the Welsh government and the wider public sector of what their statutory obligations entail. Much of her initial period in office has been spent helping the country\u2019s principal public bodies put together formal action plans for meeting their new responsibilities. But the job is not all about hand-holding. Howe has shown she can play tough too. In recent months, for instance, her attention has been focused on a proposed \u00a31.1bn relief road around Newport. The project\u2019s supporters maintain the investment will boost economic growth. Howe, in contrast, argues it will destroy local biodiversity and saddle Wales\u2019s unborn with a huge debt. Mark Drakeford, the country\u2019s first minister, is due to give his verdict imminently. \u201cIt was almost a done deal before my intervention, but now there are serious considerations as to whether it\u2019s in the interests of future generations,\u201d she said. Another major project has been Wales\u2019s new-look planning policy, which makes a big play of the idea of holistic wellbeing \u2013 a key concept within the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act of 2015, which established her office. Howe\u2019s formal powers are limited, however. The commissioner\u2019s role is more that of watchdog than judge. She can force policymakers to justify their decisions, for example but she can\u2019t prevent those decisions from being made. Yet the mere act of asking difficult questions makes a difference, she insists. \u201cJust having an institution that is there challenging the status quo is making people sit up and take notice.\u201d Such notice extends beyond Wales, too. Lord Bird, founder of The Big Issue magazine, is reportedly considering a private member\u2019s bill calling for a similar commissioner role for the UK as a whole. Further afield the New Zealand government recently sent a delegation to Cardiff bay to learn more about the innovative Welsh model. Later this month, Howe will be in Dubai sharing her experience with global policymakers at the World Government Summit. To all who ask, her overarching message is the same: talk is welcome, but cheap; to genuinely protect our future generations, concrete actions are needed now. It is not a popular argument, she concedes. The needs of today are numerous and competition for government resources is fierce all over the world. And much as politicians acknowledge future generations, they also know that the unborn don\u2019t vote. Howe\u2019s response is characteristically direct. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in having these lofty ambitions for future generations if we\u2019re not prepared to take difficult decisions,\u201d she said. She isn\u2019t naive. Wales still has a long way to go to fulfil the aspirations of its landmark legislation, she admits. Some policymakers struggle to conceptualise how to account for future needs in the present, while an old-school minority simply reject the whole idea. It is this battle to win the hearts and mind of those at all ranks of the policymaking process that Howe considers her biggest challenge. To aid this struggle, her office is advancing a new approach to policymaking. Instead of top-down managerialism, government decisions need to be guided by principles such as public involvement, preventative action and cross-government collaboration. \u201cFor me, this is the biggest cultural change programme that Wales has ever seen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to really invest in how we go about changing that culture [so] people will start thinking more about the long term.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Vancouver, Vienna and Brumunddal in Norway have all claimed recently to have the tallest wooden building in the world, and now Tokyo has its own designs on the informal title. Making buildings from wood may seem like a rather medieval idea. But there is a very modern issue that is driving cities and architects to turn to treated timber as a resource: climate change. Concrete is the second most used substance in the global economy, after water \u2013 and one of the world\u2019s biggest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The chemical process by which cement, the key ingredient of concrete, is created involves large quantities of carbon dioxide. The UN estimates that there will be 9.8 billion people living on the planet by mid-century. They will need somewhere to live. If concrete is the only answer to the construction of new cities, then carbon emissions will soar, aggravating global warming. And so scientists and builders have started innovating with other materials, in a scramble for alternatives to a universal commodity that has underpinned our modern life for centuries. Aggregate results The problem with replacing concrete is that it is so very good at what it does. Chris Cheeseman, professor of materials resources engineering at Imperial College London, says the key thing to consider is the vast extent to which concrete is used around the world, and is likely to continue to be used. \u201cConcrete is not a high-carbon product. Cement is high-carbon, but concrete is not. But it is the scale on which it is used that makes it high carbon. The sheer scale of manufacture is so huge, that is the issue.\u201d Not only are the raw materials for concrete available cheaply and in abundance in most places around the globe, but the stuff itself has marvellous properties: Portland cement, the vital component of concrete, is mouldable and pourable, but quickly sets hard. Cheeseman also notes another advantage: concrete and steel have similar thermal expansion properties, so steel can be used to reinforce concrete, making it far stronger and more flexible as a building material than it could be on its own. The steel used can be recycled, reducing its carbon impact, but Cheeseman says the combination of steel and concrete \u2013 giving enormous strength to buildings, while being mouldable and widely available \u2013 is hard to beat. \u201cIt is amazing stuff. Making anything with similar properties is going to be very difficult.\u201d Using wood, for example, is not straightforward. Wood absorbs moisture from the air and is susceptible to rot and pests, not to mention fire. But treating wood and combining it with other materials can improve its properties. Cross-laminated timber is engineered wood, made from gluing layers of solid-sawn timber together, crosswise, to form building blocks. This material is lightweight but as strong as concrete and steel, and construction experts say it can be more versatile and faster to work with than concrete and steel \u2013 and even, it seems, quieter. Stora Enso is Europe\u2019s biggest supplier of cross-laminated timber, and Markus Mannstr\u00f6m, the executive vice-president for biomaterials, reports that the company is seeing increasing demand globally for building in wood, with climate change concerns the key driver. The Nordic countries, where Stora Enso is based, with their large forest resources, have been leading the way, but the company is seeing increasing demand across the world, including in Asia. It plants two or three trees for every tree used, which has contributed to Sweden doubling its rate of forest cover in the past century. Of course, using timber in a building also locks away the carbon that it has absorbed as it grew. Even treated wood, however, has limitations. In Norway, the Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet building is planned to be the tallest in the world with a wooden frame. It will rise 88 metres tall, with 18 storeys, and will be used for offices, hotel rooms and apartments. Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet may not hold its crown for long, if construction goes ahead on a project in Japan, the W350: that will reach 70 storeys, and be made of 90% wood. But it is still in the early stages of planning. Only when these concepts have been proven in practice will it be possible to see wood as a widespread alternative to concrete in constructing tall buildings. Concrete examples Fly ash is a possible alternative. It is a byproduct of coal-burning power plants \u2013 cinders, the unburnt parts of the coal that used to be allowed to disperse into the air, or fall to the bottom of power station chimneys, but in modern power plants are collected instead. It can be incorporated into concrete mixes to make up as much as 15% to 30% of the cement, without harming the strength or durability of the resulting mix. A byproduct of the iron-ore processing industry, ground granulated blast-furnace slag, can also be of use in a similar way. This is incorporated into concrete mixes, and has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But Anna Surgenor, senior sustainability adviser at the UK\u2019s Green Building Council, which is currently engaged in educating its construction industry members on the availability of cement replacements, notes that although these waste products can save carbon in the concrete mix, their use is not always straightforward. \u201cIt is possible to replace the cement content in concrete with waste products \u2013 a built asset could also use alternative materials [such as timber] in construction to lower the overall carbon impact. But there are several calculations that need to be considered across the entire life cycle of the building \u2013 these include factoring in where these materials are being shipped from. If they are transported over long distances, using fossil fuels, the use of alternative materials might not make sense from an overall carbon reduction perspective.\u201d Fly ash from coal and slag from iron ore are abundant in some of the areas where concrete is most needed, including rapidly developing countries such as China and India. But they are heavy and that means it is not only carbon-intensive to transport over long distances, but also expensive. Other mooted materials have pros and cons. Magnesium silicates are not as widely available as the building blocks of concrete, for instance, limiting their appeal. Calcite clays show promise, according to Cheeseman, but will reduce concrete emissions only by about a third \u2013 worth doing, but not a comprehensive solution. Carrots and sticks Research at Lancaster University has found that adding vegetable particles \u2013 yes, carrots or sugar beet \u2013 can strengthen concrete while reducing the volume of cement required. Similar work is being conducted with bamboo and other fibres. Graphene, a wonder material invented in the UK early this century, is also coming into play. Experts at the University of Exeter have used graphene in concrete construction to create a new composite material that is twice as strong as traditional concrete and four times more water-resistant. Monica Craciun, professor of nanoscience in the university\u2019s engineering department, called the new material \u201can absolute game-changer\u201d, and work is continuing on how to develop it further. Commercial introduction is still some way off. While these technologies are all promising ideas, they are either expensive, unproven or based on materials that are not abundant. Thinktank the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House produced an overview last year of innovation in the industry, which reached the gloomy conclusion: \u201cSome novel cements have been discussed for more than a decade within the research community, without breaking through. At present, these alternatives are rarely as cost-effective as conventional cement, and they face raw-material shortages and resistance from customers.\u201d Given the slow take-up of alternatives to concrete and their limitations, attention has turned to solutions such as capturing and storing, or even using, the carbon dioxide that results from its production. CarbonCure, a Canadian company, recycles carbon dioxide in its products. Liquefied carbon dioxide is captured from industrial processes and injected into concrete while it is being made, which helps with the process of cement incorporation. The company has so far reduced carbon emissions through its products roughly equivalent to taking about 5,000 cars off the road. But carbon-capture technology remains very expensive and only a handful of projects have been trying to innovate in this way to reduce the emissions from cement. \u2022 Fiona Harvey is an environment correspondent for the Guardian This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The 15-year-old Yazidi clasps hands with her best friend and stands among the line of women stamping their feet to a Kurdish pop song. Berivan and her mother are from Sinjar in Iraq, the Yazidi homeland, but like thousands of other Yazidis they were kidnapped by Islamic State in 2014 when the group stormed across the border from Syria. Far from here, in the eastern desert, Isis has almost lost control of its last stronghold, Baghuz, but there are at least 3,000 Yazidi women and girls whose fate is unknown. During the genocide, Yazidi men were rounded up and shot then dumped in mass graves. The women were taken to be sold in Isis\u2019s slave markets, many passed from fighter to fighter, who inflicted physical and sexual abuse. Yazidi children have been brainwashed and rights groups say suicide among captives is common. Even for those who manage to escape after years of enslavement and rape, many struggle to survive without an income or identity papers. Berivan and her mother have lost the other members of their family. But at a new women\u2019s commune near Qamishli, in north-eastern Syria, they have had a chance to start over. \u201cI like it here,\u201d she says. \u201cI love going to school, I love mathematics. And I\u2019m going to be a hairdresser when I grow up.\u201d Jinwar is a female-only community, set up by the women of the local Kurdish-run administration to create a space where women can live \u201cfree of the constraints of the oppressive power structures of patriarchy and capitalism\u201d. It opened in November and 12 of its 30 adobe brick houses are home to Kurdish, Yazidi and Arab families. The women built their own houses, bake their own bread and tend to the livestock and farmland, cooking and eating together. On Saturday, people from the neighbouring villages have been invited to a graduation celebration for a group of local women who had attended a course on natural medicines at Jinwar\u2019s education centre. Over chicken and rice, and later music and dancing, residents discuss how the newly planted apricot, pomegranate and olive trees are doing. \u201cWe built this place ourselves, brick by brick,\u201d says 35-year-old Barwa Darwish, who came to Jinwar with her seven children after her village in Deir Ezzor province was freed from Isis and her husband, who joined the fight against the group, was killed in action. \u201cUnder Isis we were strangled and now we are free. But even before that, women stayed at home. We didn\u2019t go out and work. In Jinwar, I\u2019ve seen that women can stand alone.\u201d Jinwar grew out of the democratic ideology that has fuelled the creation of Rojava, a Kurdish-run statelet in north-eastern Syria, since the civil war broke out in 2011. The area has largely thrived despite the presence of enemies on all sides: Isis, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s troops, and Turkey, which regards the Kurdish YPG fighters as a terrorist organisation. The women\u2019s revolution, as it is known, is a significant part of Rojava\u2019s philosophy. Angered by the atrocities committed by Isis, Kurdish women formed their own fighting units. Later, Arab and Yazidi recruits joined them on the front lines to liberate their sisters. But at home, many parts of Kurdish society are still deeply conservative. Some of the women now in Jinwar have left arranged marriages and domestic abuse. Those dynamics, as well as the legacy of Syria\u2019s brutal eight-year war have to be unlearned at Jinwar. \u201cWhen the families first arrived, the Arab children wouldn\u2019t play with the Kurdish children,\u201d says Nujin, one of the international volunteers working at the village. \u201cBut even in just two months you can see the change. The children are already so much happier.\u201d Berivan\u2019s mother, Darsim, was mute when she arrived at Jinwar, a side-effect of trauma. Little by little, she has started to form words again. \u201cThe village is the best rehabilitation for the things these families have suffered,\u201d Nujin says. Jinwar is not finished yet: there are gardens to plant and an empty library waiting for books. The community is still coming up with ideas. Behind the education centre there is a swimming pool that will be filled with water in the summer. Most of the residents will get to use a pool \u2013 the reserve of only men in most of the Middle East \u2013 for the first time. The women have also voted for driving lessons and to start a sewing business. There are plans for a second commune in Deir Ezzor, an Arab province that is still the scene of fierce fighting to destroy Isis \u2013 but there is also a sense that what has been built at Jinwar is fragile and could be taken away. It is not clear what will happen when US troops leave the area in a few months. Renewed fighting is a possibility. \u201cThis place is peaceful and a refuge from the war,\u201d Nujin says. \u201cSo how can we bring guns here if we needed to defend ourselves? I hope Jinwar never has to face that.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Their manufacturers had claimed they were made of pine but customs officers were wary. And their suspicions were well-founded. Gasson, Kew\u2019s research leader on wood and timber, found the blinds were not made of pine but ramin. \u201cAll ramin trees, which grow in south-east Asia, are endangered and trade in their wood is illegal,\u201d said Gasson. \u201cOn this occasion, we got lucky and stopped people profiting from this trade.\u201d But elsewhere, illegal logging threatens to overwhelm the timber trade. It is estimated that almost 30% of sales are made up of illicitly sourced timber. More than 20,000 square miles of forest are being chopped down illegally every year, according to WWF, the wildlife charity, to provide furniture and flooring for people\u2019s homes. The devastation is jeopardising the planet\u2019s ability to absorb carbon dioxide and is destroying the habitats of endangered animals including orangutans and tigers. As a result, researchers at Kew have joined conservationists, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), to set up the Global Timber Referencing Project to create a scheme to identify important forests and create a database for identifying timber sources. \u201cA lot is being done to reduce illegal logging by setting up audit systems to certify timber supply chains,\u201d said Roger Young of AgroIsoLab, another project partner. \u201cBut these efforts are compromised because paperwork systems are fallible, and until now there has been no way to verify the origin and species of timber once it has been harvested. The new project aims to put that right.\u201d The project has two arms. First, scientists working at Kew will confirm the exact species of tree from samples sent to it, said Gasson. \u201cThe laboratory already has many thousands of timber samples in its vaults but these will be increased with new samples for the new identification project,\u201d he added. Once this has been established, other reference collections will be set up in other countries. For example, Kew will receive more than 200 new samples, collected by the FSC, from commonly traded wood species in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Peru this year. The aim is to create a massive tree reference library at Kew, whose samples and expertise can then be distributed to other laboratories. \u201cThis is a unique opportunity to develop a library of geo-referenced wood samples,\u201d said Michael Marus of the FSC. Being able to spot the species of tree is not sufficient to curtail illegal logging, however. The location of that wood\u2019s growth is also crucial. \u201cAll ramin trade is illegal, so identifying the material in imported goods is sufficient to have them impounded, but other woods are more complex,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt is different with teak. Trade from Thailand is allowed but the same wood from Myanmar is illegal. So we need to be able to spot where a sample of teak was grown.\u201d AgroIsoLab scientists will use patterns of isotopes of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon that are found in wood to pinpoint their exact places of growth. \u201cSoil in an area produces a specific isotopic signature that we can recognise,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cWe already use this technology to pinpoint sources of food, such as bacon. We can tell from a rasher\u2019s isotopic signature whether it comes from Britain or from Denmark. \u201cAnd that is important. Bacon from Denmark is cheaper because standards of pig care there are lower and so we can spot when cheap Danish bacon is being sold as the expensive UK variety.\u201d The new project aims to do exactly the same for wood. \u201cWe want to be able to take a sample \u2013 oak from furniture, beech from flooring or pine from a table \u2013 and provide its true identity and place of growth,\u201d said Young. \u201cIf we can do that, we have a chance to halt illegal timber sales.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Alone together, or how to find strength in numbers", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/15/alone-together-find-strength-in-numbers-upside-weekly-newsletter", "date": "2019-02-15", "transcript": "It\u2019s a very singular irony that in a world populated like never before, loneliness has become the disease du jour.

The organisers reached their target of securing the signatures of 10% of eligible voters in the southern German state well before the Wednesday evening deadline. Environmental groups behind the push to radically change farming methods, including turning more grassland into meadow and ensuring a third of farms are organic over the next decade, are due to meet politicians to discuss the next stage in their drive. As part of the campaign, thousands of people have rallied in the streets dressed in bee costumes, as well as staging a mass buzz-in in an attempt to produce the loudest ever buzz in the world. The carnivalesque mood has helped secure popular support for the serious aims of the campaign to secure a long-term political commitment to safeguard the diversity of flora and fauna and improve the habitats of insects and birds, whose populations have plummeted in recent years. Among the demands are for 20% of land to be made bee-friendly within the next six years, and 30% by 2030. Environmental education in schools and businesses should also be increased. The fact that more than 1 million people had signed the petition by Wednesday evening means politicians will ignore its demands at their peril. The campaign was backed by the Greens, the Bavarian Ecological Democratic Party (\u00d6DP) and conservation groups. Ludwig Hartmann of the Greens said the more people signed the petition, the clearer the message was to Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union government under the leadership of Markus S\u00f6der. \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn the tide and set a new course for effective nature conservation in Bavaria,\u201d he said. Some farmers have criticised the campaign, however, saying their efforts to embrace environmentally-friendly policies while the financial pressures on them increase have often been ignored. \u201cWe are already doing a lot, but often this is dismissed,\u201d said Walter Heidl, the president of the Bavarian Farmers\u2019 Association. The campaign also demands that farmers rescue hedges and trees and preserve habitat on stream and river banks. The state legislature is now obliged by law either to enact the petition or to propose alternative options. Negotiations must begin between its organisers and the CSU next week, and voters will have the final say on their outcome in a referendum later this year. Agnes Becker, the leader of the \u00d6DP, a very small force which initiated the poll, said that the bee was the symbol but represented a much bigger issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about the honey bee as it is about a very long and ever growing list of threatened species of animals and plants,\u201d she told a heated televised debate on the campaign last week. \u201cBut the bee is our mascot, our symbol.\u201d She said she and her colleagues would stick to the demands laid out in the petition, which had been compiled after extensive consultation with scientists and lawyers, calling them the minimum required to reverse the damaging effects of intensive farming and global warming. Recent German studies into species decline showed that the number of flying insects had dropped by almost 80% in nearly 30 years. More than 15% of songbirds were lost in the 10 years to 2009. Similar declines have been witnessed elsewhere in Europe and the world. The campaigners said ordinary citizens were also being called on to change their lifestyles, including by not covering garden lawns with wood and concrete.

But when Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement (M5S) had to resolve whether or not to join the far-right Lega, or League, in a coalition government last May, it didn\u2019t retreat into a conclave of party leaders. It asked members to vote online. An overwhelming 94% supported the move. The process was perhaps the most striking example of an emerging trend at the heart of 21st-century politics \u2013 the use of digital technology to bring people into the hearts of movements from Italy and Spain to France, Scandinavia to the UK. The digital world has taken a great deal of criticism for subverting open societies, but could it also be a motor for a democratic revival? Could these digital innovations \u2013 mostly confined to new, populist parties \u2013 help revitalise our liberal democracies? The pioneers of digital democracies were the pirate parties of northern Europe who first broke through in Sweden, Germany and Iceland about a decade ago, using an online decision-making platform called LiquidFeedback. One of its founders, Andreas Nitsche, said the idea was that \u201cempowering the ordinary members would make these parties more responsive to the demands of society\u201d. More recently, the fiercely anti-establishment M5S and the Spanish leftwing populist party Podemos have led the way. \u201cOrdinary citizens will become protagonists, abandoning the current system of delegate democracy in the hands of politicians,\u201d said the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, who masterminded the M5S digital strategy. Given the discredited status of Italy\u2019s political class, this narrative appealed to many citizens. M5S made digital democracy its core creed, with its anthem proclaiming: \u201cWe are not a party, we are not a caste, one man, one vote, one man, one vote.\u201d A variety of new parties have followed suit, to the point where digital democracy has now become a must for all new political movements that want to be seen as in sync with the times. The central innovation is the \u201cparticipatory platform\u201d. This is an online portal, often part of the official party website, that hosts a number of interactive features. These might include donations, training sessions, discussions on policy and online ballots for primaries, elections of party officers, or strategic decisions, for instance whether to enter an alliance or the position to take on a specific policy. The M5S platform is named Rousseau, after the Genevan political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Casaleggio liked to describe it as the \u201ccollective intelligence of the movement\u201d. Podemos has a participation portal named Participa (\u201cparticipate\u201d). It comprises a voting area and a discussion system named Plaza Podemos (Podemos Square) that is similar to Reddit, with threaded discussions and upvote/downvote functionalities, which earned it the moniker of \u201cReddit party\u201d. These sites closely mimic the logic of social media platforms, with discussions, votes, likes and other metrics to assess users\u2019 views. For Miguel Ardanuy, a former participation coordinator of Podemos, the ultimate aim of this \u201cplatformisation of the party\u201d is to \u201cconstruct a different model of party, a party more open and responsive to society, where you do not need a membership card in order to participate\u201d. \u201cWe live in an era of disintermediation, where we are bypassing the old middlemen, such as travel agencies,\u201d said Roberto Fico, a M5S politician and the current president of the Italian parliament\u2019s lower chamber, the Chamber of Deputies. \u201cDigital democracy embodies the same tendency applied to politics, allowing people to have a say directly on important decisions without depending on their representatives.\u201d The strategy has proven highly successful, enabling parties short of economic resources to achieve huge reach and scale. M5S is in government in Italy. Podemos rapidly surged to become Spain\u2019s third largest political force, and underpins the present administration. There are few historical precedents of new political parties achieving comparable results in such a short time. This electoral prowess largely derives from an ability to recruit a large base of members. Podemos and the leftist French group La France Insoumise (France Defiant) boasted more than 500,000 members each at the start of 2019, putting them in Europe\u2019s political major league. (M5S has fewer \u2013 about 150,000; some blame a cumbersome registration process for this.) Opting for a free membership system, similar to the free sign-up model of digital companies such as Facebook, Google or Twitter, has radically lowered the barrier to entry compared with traditional parties. \u201cWe built an open and flexible structure eliding the traditional separation between members and sympathisers,\u201d said Guillaume Royer, who led the development of La France Insoumise\u2019s own platform. The platforms enable parties to solicit ideas from members which can be evaluated by experts before being submitted to a wider online vote. M5S, Podemos and La France Insoumise have all crowdsourced ideas this way for their election manifestos. Yet in practice, most of the online voting tends to relate to the election of officials, or yes/no internal referendums. E-ballots have often been used more as a means of propaganda, to demonstrate the cohesion of party members, rather than as an opportunity for a genuine and pluralist internal debate. Online consultations have often returned highly anticipated super-majority results, with in some cases more than 80% of voters supporting the winning option that was almost invariably the option favoured by the party leadership. Out of more than 40 referendums carried out by M5S, there have been just two instances in which members have gone against the leadership\u2019s will. Of the dozen online referendums held by Podemos since 2014, there has been not a single case of rank-and-file rebellion. For instance, when Podemos\u2019s leader, Pablo Iglesias, was nominated as party candidate for prime minister in the next elections, he secured 90% of the votes. There was no competition. But barely one in 10 members took part in the ballot. According to M5S activist Davide Bono, this tendency towards unanimity stems from the fact that \u201cactivists share a strong collective identity and agree on many common points\u201d. However, landslide results also hint at the strong control exercised by the party leadership over internal decision-making. There are a number of ways in which the leadership can influence internal consultations. The staff responsible for the management of digital platforms are often directly dependent on the party leadership, and therefore liable to pressure. Furthermore, apparently trivial things, such as the formulation of questions, the timing of votes or even the order of options on the ballot, can steer voters towards the preferred option. Finally, the leadership can create a mood conducive to its own will. David Puente, a former employee of Casaleggio, recounts how, in anticipation of important decisions, the employees and the all-important blog of party co-founder Beppe Grillo would adopt a certain line with the aim of influencing the decision. \u201cIt was enough for Grillo to say A, and the members would vote A.\u201d Far from being the protagonists, party members are more akin to non-player characters, or NPCs, to use a term often used in digital subcultures. They are agents who can only respond to the stimuli coming from above, with little room for proactive intervention. \u201cIt\u2019s a wasted opportunity,\u201d said Yago Bermejo Abati, the project coordinator of Media Lab Prado in Madrid, who was originally involved in designing Podemos\u2019s participation portal. \u201cGiven all the initial hope, this is a great disappointment.\u201d Party members themselves seem to have become wary of digital democracy\u2019s limits, as seen in the falling number of participants in the online consultations of Podemos and M5S. These failings may merely be teething problems of a new tendency that seems here to stay. A number of mainstream political parties have already integrated digital democracy functions. In the UK, the Labour party allowed members to vote online in the 2016 leadership election, and the leftwing, pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum has created its own participatory platform called MyMomentum. In Spain, the ruling socialist party, PSOE, used online voting in 2016, allowing members to express their opinion on a coalition government proposal. Local mayoralties in cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Reykjavik are carrying out online consultations and, since entering government, M5S has created a \u201cministry of direct democracy\u201d. We may be only just starting to understand how digital democracy can help address the crisis of legitimacy that is affecting different levels of the political process.

The shop at the foot of the Amager Bakke waste-to-energy project in Copenhagen is packed with families desperate to be among the first to try its unique selling point: the ski slope on the roof. \u201cI live so close by that I could follow the development,\u201d says Ole Fredslund, who lives in neighbouring Amager, as he helped his sons Felix and Victor strap on their boots as the slope opened its lifts for the first time on Tuesday. \u201cI guess 90% of the focus is on the fact that there\u2019s a skiing hill coming, so in a way it\u2019s very clever. Everybody talks about the ski hill to be, not the waste plant to be.\u201d Ten minutes and three magic carpet lifts later, we are standing next to three short fir trees at the top of a blue run, an artificial slope consisting of green and turquoise bristles. Through the smoke from the next door Amagerv\u00e6rket power plant, Sweden is visible across the straits and to the other side a wide span of central Copenhagen. The idea of topping a municipal plant with an urban ski resort won a string of accolades for the Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) before the first shovel was even lifted. Time Magazine judged it one of the most innovative 50 ideas of 2011. Two years ago the architectural model went on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The building is wrapped in a facade of aluminium planters which will later drip with greenery. In the original plan, the chimney was to blow smoke rings, one for every tonne of CO2 generated. But turning BIG\u2019s inspired architectural sketches into reality has been challenging, says Patrick Gustafsson, the project manager who was hired \u201cto prove it is actually a sound idea and not just a fantastic idea\u201d. \u201cNo one has ever done this before, and that\u2019s maybe for a reason, I sometimes think,\u201d he laughs. Above the carpet lifts, workers in fluorescent orange jackets are still finishing the landscaping on the steeper black and red runs and on the button lift that will serve them. \u201cThe roof is very steep, actually too steep for a ski slope. It has an incline of 45%,\u201d Gustafsson explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shovel earth up there, you need to find a way of anchoring it, and then you also have to anchor a ski surface, plants, trees. It starts to get complicated.\u201d The ski resort alone has ended up costing 92m Danish kroner (\u00a38m). The first day of skiing is more than a year late and it is only a two-day preview, with the slope now scheduled to be finished by May. The smoke ring mechanism has been put on hold, in part because Peter Madsen, the artist who helped design it, was sentenced to life in prison for murder. Christian Engels, the chief executive of Copenhill, as the ski facility is called, says he aims to provide a condensed version of a holiday in the Alps: \u201cThe full package, skiing, apres ski, everything, boiled down into a three- or four-hour experience.\u201d People living in the enormous apartment complex 150 metres away were given advance notice of the two-day opening, so they had a chance to snap up the half-price tickets. But others have come from further afield. Behind me on the magic carpet lift is Ricardo Karam, a Brazilian who lectures at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cYou need to get used to it,\u201d he says of the dry slope. \u201cBut after a couple of runs, it\u2019s really fun and I can imagine that once the whole thing is finished, it will be even better.\u201d A keen snowboarder, Karam has been looking forward to the centre opening since he arrived in the city five years ago. \u201cThe idea, it\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ve been looking at this building and just waiting for years.\u201d Once I round the slope\u2019s first and only corner, I accelerate towards a small ridge, only to discover that it is covered in black silicon paste that stops my skis dead and catapults me hands first on to the lacerating bristles. \u201cIt\u2019s like glue,\u201d says Karam as he helps me up. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to help you slide better. When I saw you I thought: oh no, it\u2019s already too late.\u201d At the bottom, Fredslund and his sons seem excited but also slightly disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, a little bit short of course,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are already improving after just three runs.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Girls just wanna do maths - and the women who help them", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/access-all-areas-the-tutoring-scheme-for-underprivileged-kids", "date": "2019-02-11", "transcript": "\u201cI used to think boys were just better at maths,\u201d said Linah. \u201cBut now, it\u2019s like, we go to the same school, we do the same subjects \u2013 so if you can do it, I can do it.\u201d There\u2019s a reason for the renewed confidence in the 15-year-old from Dagenham and it\u2019s sitting next to her in a swanky office in the City of London. Elaine McLoughlin is a business control manager for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. She is also a volunteer tutor on a programme to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds and get more girls studying sciences at top universities. \u201c[Maths] used to be one of my favourite subjects but over the years I\u2019ve gone into autopilot,\u201d said Linah, who lives with her two sisters, her mum, who works as a carer and her dad, who is between jobs. \u201cI would freak out if I didn\u2019t understand a topic in class but now I know we can go over it here.\u201d Since last year, her predicted GCSE maths grade at Lister community school in Newham has jumped from a 4 (the equivalent of a C), to a 7 (equivalent to an A). \u201cPractice makes perfect so it\u2019s going back and looking back at those topics that she\u2019s no longer studying in class,\u201d said McLoughlin. In many ways, Linah is archetypal of her age group: she counts editing Instagram photos for friends among her hobbies and is relieved at getting to skip an extra physics class in order to be interviewed on a Friday evening. She has hopes, though, to attend one of the top-tier UK universities to study forensic psychology. Visiting McLoughlin\u2019s office each week is a source of inspiration. Linah said: \u201cI thought it was going to be really intimidating but you walk in and feel like you\u2019re a different person. You see people who have their lives together and you\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019m so gonna be like that guy\u2019, even if you don\u2019t know what their job is.\u201d Although the divide is steadily shrinking, there is still a gender gap within Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. Women make up 14.4% of people working in Stem professions in the UK, which falls far short of the country\u2019s goal of 30%. On top of this, Britain\u2019s booming private tuition sector, worth an estimated \u00a32bn, is making the playing field even less level for disadvantaged children. Last July, an annual survey by The Sutton Trust revealed that 27% of secondary students in England and Wales have had home or private tuition. The figure rises to 41% in London. The Access Project, founded by teacher Alex Kelly in 2008, works to address this inequality in 28 schools. It has more than 1,000 tutors supporting 1,250 students across London and the Midlands. To Mcloughlin, who graduated with a maths and economics degree from University College Dublin and revises Linah\u2019s topics over the weekend and offers her ad-hoc career guidance, diversifying the workforce is about more than equality. \u201cHaving more women on board and more diverse teams leads to more successful output,\u201d she said, adding that her boss is a working mum who has \u201cturned a lot of things around\u201d. There is a stigma attached to Stem for women, according to Karishma Honap, 23, an assistant engineer at WSP and Access Project tutor in Birmingham. In the engineering sector, fewer than 9% of professionals are women. \u201cWhen I applied to do engineering everyone was sort of like: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t guys do that? That\u2019s rare for a girl,\u2019\u201d she said. But, according to her student, Melissa, a year 10 pupil at Wood Green Academy in Wednesbury, in the West Midlands, mindsets are already shifting. The 15-year-old says there\u2019s a 50-50 split between boys and girls in her triple science class, despite the fact that the percentage of female A-level physics students has stagnated at about 21% for the past decade. Although she\u2019s always enjoyed science at school, since starting physics mentoring with Honap in October, Melissa\u2019s confidence has blossomed. \u201cI know if I was falling back a bit, I\u2019ve got someone who will support me and understand what I\u2019m facing,\u201d she said. Melissa, who lives in Wednesbury with her mum, a retail assistant, her younger brother and stepdad, wants to study at Oxford University. She will visit the campus with the charity next week. There\u2019s still a way to go, including finishing her GCSEs and starting A-levels before she can apply but in some ways it feels like doors are already being opened to spaces she isn\u2019t accustomed to. When she visits Honap at the Mailbox, an upmarket shopping and office development in Birmingham\u2019s city centre, which she hasn\u2019t visited since she was eight, she feels welcomed. \u201cI was nervous to begin with but now I find it cool how the receptionist knows my name, knows who to contact and just tells me to carry on up to the office,\u201d she added.

It\u2019s a solid industry if you want to make obscene profits (Google racked up more than $1,000 a second in the last three months of 2018), but these days it\u2019s a poor way to make friends. Big Tech has become as unpopular as a Brexiter in Brussels, as multiple issues pile up \u2013 from data privacy to fake news, election meddling and obnoxious content. But technology is still a formidable force for good, as Upside reporters pointed out this week. Example one: Senay Boztas, in Amsterdam, reported on how European police are using technology and the wisdom of crowds to identify potential crime scenes from images retrieved from the darkest corners of the web. More than 20,000 tipoffs have resulted. Example two: Kamala Thiagarajan wrote about how computers are now able to diagnose a serious eye condition because an algorithm has analysed thousands of previous cases and can recognise symptoms from images. And finally, a sliver of good news from Big Tech itself, as two companies took action to clean up toxic content on their platforms. WhatsApp said it was deleting 2m accounts each month to stop fake news spreading. Instagram said it would move to ban graphic self-harm content amid a furore in Britain over whether such images are exacerbating the distress of young people. Instagram\u2019s Adam Mosseri said: \u201cWe are not where we need to be on self-harm and suicide, and we need to do more to protect the most vulnerable. We will get better and we are committed to finding and removing this content at scale.\u201d It remains to be seen how this will be done. Every silver lining has a cloud. What we liked A lovely piece from the Boston Globe: when a Massachusetts family gave birth to a deaf child, the neighbours learned sign language so they could communicate with her. Also, this BBC World Hacks item about a Swedish mall where everything is a recycled product. Great to hear also that we have fellow travellers in Hull. More and more editors are recognising that readers want to hear not just about the big problems of the world but about ways to tackle those problems. What we heard We are very much looking forward to Jodie\u2019s book in April: You Are What You Read. Where was the Upside? In Mississippi, at the tattoo parlour that covers up hate ink.

There is nothing particularly surprising about that: he is head of retina services at an eye hospital in southern India. The image on his computer screen shows the first blush of a condition linked to diabetes that affects millions of Indians \u2013 and can lead to blindness. The diagnosis was made not by him, or any other doctor, but by an algorithm. Over the past five years, Kim and his team at the Aravind eye hospital in Madurai have examined about 15,000 images from across the country showing the interior surface of the eyeball, known as the fundus. By grading each image, marking abnormal spots, lesions and indications of bleeding, they have contributed to a database of retinal images from all over the world, compiled by Google and its health tech subsidiary, Verily. The data has been assembled into an algorithm \u2013 a set of instructions built into a computer program to identify eye complications arising from diabetes. Kim is now checking to see whether the diagnosis the program has made is accurate. It is. He points to several yellow spots that look like pin-pricks of light emerging from the reddish-brown orb. Over time, when severe diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels of the retina, he says, it causes them to leak blood and cholesterol. In many cases, the patient does not even realise this is happening. There are no symptoms until retinal tissue begins to swell, vision becomes cloudy and eyesight begins to fail. At this point, it is difficult to treat and in some cases, irreversible. And today, Kim says, it is remarkable that a machine can be trained to identify even the earliest stages of the diabetic retinopathy and grade it with as much accuracy as a human doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s been very exciting to watch this take shape,\u201d says Dr Renu Rajan, a retinal surgeon also involved in the project. \u201cWhen a machine is trained to be capable of identifying abnormal patterns in this way, it saves a doctor so much time in diagnosis; time that could be better spent helping the patient manage the condition and in aftercare.\u201d \u201cBig data\u201d and artificial intelligence has come in for stinging criticism in recent years, over issues of privacy, fairness, accountability and transparency. But in healthcare, especially in developing countries, AI technology that employs data sets for machine learning is now expected to make rapid strides as an effective screening and diagnostic tool. In India, for example, it has the potential to save millions of lives. According to the National Health Profile report of 2017, the country has a little over 1 million doctors to treat its population of 1.3 billion people. Of these medics, only about 10% work in the public health sector. There is an acute shortage of healthcare providers and infrastructure in rural areas. In addition, diabetes is a growing problem in India, where an estimated 72 million people have the condition. Though eyecare may not seem like a priority for those with diabetes, as many as 10% could develop diabetic retinopathy, which can result in blindness. Since 2016, Aravind hospital has been involved in a pilot project to test the algorithm. At this stage, the results it generates is being checked against a manual grading process. \u201cIf there is a big difference between the results generated from the AI software and the manual diagnosis by an ophthalmologist, a senior retina specialist will make the final decision on the grading,\u201d says Kim. These discrepancies are analysed, helping to improve and fine tune the data that will be fed into it. \u201cWith a 97.5% accuracy rate, it hasn\u2019t been too far off the mark,\u201d says Rajan. Two other major ophthalmic centres in India have been involved in building the algorithm \u2013 Narayana Nethralaya in Bengaluru and Shankara Nethralaya hospital in Chennai. Kim hopes the future could include AI-powered machines set up like vending booths across India\u2019s remotest villages, capable of taking photographs of people\u2019s inner eye and offering a digital diagnosis. \u201cThink of it as a screening and referral tool, that could tell you with a great deal of precision whether you needed to see a specialist or not and if so, how urgently you needed to see one,\u201d says Dr H Parida, a retina specialist. Parida assisted the team early on, helping to analyse retinal images to build the algorithm. AI algorithms in development have the potential to work with specialised attachments to ordinary smartphone cameras, making them cost-effective. \u201cAI technology is exciting and has made considerable progress in eyecare possible, but there are areas where we need to exercise caution,\u201d says Dr Rohit Shetty, corneal and refractive surgeon and vice-chairman of Narayana Nethralaya. The quality of the algorithm and how well it works will depend on the quality of the images that are being fed into it, he adds. Regulating the quality of these images as AI becomes mainstream and establishing accountability in case of errors then becomes critical. Google and Verily say they have addressed this issue in India by working with well-established eyecare centres to build the raw data that their algorithm needs. \u201cBy partnering with well-known institutions like Aravind eye hospital and Shankara Nethralaya, we can continue our research and pilot studies in implementing AI-powered screening technology, and then extend it to clinical practice,\u201d says Dr Lily Peng, a Google product manager.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Picture clue: cops turn to amateur web sleuths to help crack cases", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/picture-clue-cops-turn-to-amateur-web-sleuths-to-help-crack-cases", "date": "2019-02-04", "transcript": "It looks like a normal bathroom tile. But when amateur internet sleuths managed to locate it, they found the missing piece in an international child abuse investigation. This was one of the clues that led to the arrest of a suspect and the identification of nine child abuse victims. There\u2019s nothing new about the police asking for tips \u2013 think missing person posters or episodes of Crimewatch. But the Trace an Object crowdsourcing effort launched by Europol in 2017 asks individuals and collectives to find clues for unsolved child abuse investigations by identifying parts of digital images. It could be a slice of cheese that someone recognises as Belgian, a crumpled shopping bag or a brightly coloured child\u2019s duvet cover: it just needs a moment of recognition \u2013 human or digital \u2013 to fill in the gaps that lead police to a suspect or a victim. The pictures Europol posts online are drawn from a grim stash of 30m images of child sexual exploitation, which are often circulating on the dark web. Steven Wilson, the head of the agency\u2019s European cybercrime centre, said that some are linked to crimes happening now and others document abuse from decades ago. Wilson said: \u201cIn the cases we deal with here, we have done as much as we can with law enforcement and this is a final throw of the dice. \u201cIn most cases, we are trying to identify a location and the eyes of the world can look at something that you can\u2019t possibly replicate, even by online analysis. If we can narrow it down to one country or an area, that\u2019s a massive starting point.\u201d The response has stunned investigators: 283 posted images have led to 22,000 emails. Investigative groups such as Bellingcat have set up a Check platform to organise the workflow, and a Reddit community has also got stuck in. \u201cBellingcat has done a huge amount of investigative work,\u201d added Wilson. \u201cWe reached out to them and they have passed on some of their technical expertise to do particular things \u2026 We can\u2019t stay doing the things we have been doing for many years because we\u2019ll only get the same results \u2013 we have to try new ideas.\u201d This pilot has been adopted as a longer-term initiative at Europol, which passes confirmed tips to local police forces to help get victims to safety and start the prosecution process. For one Europol officer, who has spent months studying unedited images of child abuse to build up leads, it is a eureka moment when a crowdsourced tip leads to an arrest. \u201cIt feels awesome,\u201d said the officer, who did not want to be identified. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely motivating element for doing the job.\u201d The officer works in an imposing building in The Hague, where the revolving security door is labelled a \u201ctourniquet\u201d and there is compulsory counselling to help process the effects of such work. Elsewhere in the Netherlands lives Bo, a moderator of the amateur investigative group Serendip. Bo, who would only be interviewed by email and would not give out any personal details, guides a team of 15 people who recently helped identify a rooftop in China for Europol. \u201cWe are pretty sure that we have found 40 images,\u201d Bo wrote. \u201cEuropol doesn\u2019t really ever reply. Sometimes it puts a \u2018like\u2019 on Twitter. That\u2019s a shame. We mostly find the things they ask for quickly but we often don\u2019t know what happens next.\u201d Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, explains that people such as Bo use \u201cweirdly basic\u201d open-source techniques to reverse-search images on publicly shared archives. They look for clues related to lighting conditions or a season to identify a location. Higgins said: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just a matter of recognising shopping bag brands. Some of it\u2019s more obscure. There was a photo taken of a hotel, which showed a whole room with two figures blurred out. Very rapidly someone said that they had been there, and it was in Mauritius. When we went to the website of the hotel, they had a photo that was the exact same angle, of a room that was almost identical. That just relies on someone seeing the tweet who knows what it is.\u201d People may sometimes identify more than a simple item, Higgins added. \u201cSometimes we can find the images of the victims, clearly from the same photo set. There\u2019s at least one case where it was possible to identify a likely suspect as well. That has big issues if that gets out in public and people decide to start tracking these people down themselves.\u201d This also could alert a suspect to destroy potential evidence, said Bo. Getting amateurs involved in police work does have risks, according to Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius, a law professor at Radboud University Nijmegen and a fellow at the University of Amsterdam\u2019s institute of information law. Borgesius said: \u201cCriminal law contains rules that limit police power, to protect individuals suspected of some kind of crime against the state. We can generally assume the police force is trained on those rules: even though you are investigating crime, there are limits to what you can do. I\u2019m afraid crowds don\u2019t always know those rules and might become overly enthusiastic in their own online echo chamber. \u201cIn an extreme case, you could think there\u2019s a risk of a lynch mob.\u201d These are all hazards Europol takes seriously. \u201cYou have got to balance that risk with the huge potential,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cFor the nine victims identified so far, this potentially has made a significant difference to their lives. On many occasions, people perpetrating this abuse are repeat offenders and if you can stop them, for me the most important thing is what future damage is prevented.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Again. In the 1993 film, the Bill Murray character Phil Connors ultimately comes to realise that ditching cynicism for more open-hearted enthusiasm breaks the loop of the same old story repeating itself day after day. In a world in which the same dismal stories have a tendency of repeating themselves day after day, a bit of the Connors approach might go a long way. Take Poland. Persistent reports of the populist, authoritarian government and its attempts to rein in the courts and the media have dominated international coverage over the past four years. You could be forgiven for thinking nothing much good is going on in the country. You\u2019d be wrong. Then there are rising sea levels, the slow-motion consequence of global warming. A formidable threat, of course, and one to take very seriously. But not insuperable, as a group of Filipino islanders are proving. Electric cars are one of the technologies heralded in the fight against climate change. But even here the cynical view can prevail: they don\u2019t have a long enough range, you can\u2019t charge them easily or quickly, they won\u2019t catch on. One Dutch driver sought to prove the naysayers wrong, as Naaman Zhou found out. So is that all we need \u2013 a little optimism to break the Brexit Groundhog Day loop? Or just a bit of humour?

But Maria Saavedra is unworried, and unmoving. \u201cI really like it here on the island because it is peaceful,\u201d she says, sitting in the front room of her inundated home on Ubay Island, in the centre of the Philippines archipelago. The Cebu Strait quietly invades her house on the high tide for nearly four hours a day, more than 130 days a year. But Saavedra doesn\u2019t want to leave the only home she\u2019s known for an uncertain life on a larger island nearby. \u201cWe can eat fresh fish and pick up seashells. We can sell them right away to buy rice \u2026 we cook, we eat and then we go to sleep. \u201cThis is where we want to die. We really like this place.\u201d The flooding was sparked by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in 2013 that caused the land to subside by up to a metre. Now researchers based in Japan, led by Laurice Jamero and Miguel Esteban, are using the islands to examine the environmental, social and economic impacts of extreme sea level rise. Their research, and the community\u2019s efforts to adapt, are the subject of a documentary Racing the King Tide by Liverpool production house Hatch. The subsidence has in effect jumped these communities decades forward in time: offering a glimpse of what could happen when sea levels rise to overwhelm low-lying islands. By 2100, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts global mean sea levels will rise by between 26 and 98cm. The Philippines is a member of the 48-nation Climate Vulnerable Forum, which last month told the UN climate talks last month that islands, communities, even entire nations, faced \u201cextinction\u201d from rising seas. Adapt and flourish When the Philippine islands began to regularly and predictably flood on high tides, the Tubigon municipal government launched a relocation program, offering to build permanent houses for the island\u2019s communities on the mainland island of Bohol. But Ubay islanders are fishers, and their connection to the place they call home is powerful. The water is central to the islanders\u2019 way of life, and their view of the world. Every 24 June, they celebrate the feast of St John the Baptist \u2013 the prophet held to have baptised Jesus in the River Jordan \u2013 by taking to the sea. \u201cWe have been celebrating the feast of San Juan like our parents did,\u201d retired fish vendor Servillana Mejares says at her home on Batasan Island. \u201cThey told us we should swim in the sea to be healed. \u201cWe don\u2019t stop swimming just because of tidal floods. We are not afraid of box jellyfish. We still celebrate as much as we can. They say the tide will ebb anyway.\u201d For reasons of economy, social cohesion, and fundamental identity, almost all residents have chosen to stay, for now. Life goes on: market vendors manage their stalls, domestic animals are moved to bamboo platforms, schoolbags are lifted from classroom floors. In houses that flood, furniture is modified with longer legs, and outdoor cooking fires are raised onto purpose-built scaffolds. Water \u2013 too much and too little \u2013 creates manifold problems. The saltwater kills garden vegetable plants, but there\u2019s little that is fresh to drink. The islanders drink purified water and rely on rainwater for their homes, but it regularly runs out and supplies have to be sent from the mainland. Jamero, lead researcher from the University of Tokyo, said the dominant discussion about sea-level rise focuses on \u201cpeople fleeing the sinking island, the \u2018end-of-the-world\u2019-type narrative\u201d. \u201cBut when I went to these places, it\u2019s completely different. People don\u2019t want to leave their homes, they have found a way to live their lives, to adapt, even to enjoy the floods.\u201d Jamero said staged relocations \u2013 where people move to larger islands for forecast major weather events, such a king tides coinciding with typhoons \u2013 was negotiated between the islanders and government officials. \u201cWhat really struck me was how the government really listened and actually changed their approach,\u201d Jamero said. The Tubigon government has focused on education, offering scholarships to high school and college students from the islands, in order to induce relocation more naturally, over two or three generations. Following the earthquake the government \u201cwas really pushing for \u2026 the islanders to be relocated to the mainland,\u201d Tubigon municipal administrator Noel Mendana says. \u201cBut islanders think that they cannot survive on the mainland, as their livelihood depends on the sea. So what the government is doing is trying to help them to adapt.\u201d \u2018We eat seashells\u2019 Those on the islands have, for the most part, learned to live with the regular inundation, but it does pose significant problems. They understand too, that while they have so far found ways to adapt, their futures, and those of their children, might ultimately lie elsewhere. In the meantime, the islanders make the best of it. Agnes Bulilan teaches at Bilangbilangan Elementary School, standing barefoot and calf-deep in water, her students perched on stools out of the sea. Classes cannot be cancelled: because the flooding is routine, too many days of school would be missed. \u201cWhenever we teach and there\u2019s high tide,\u201d Bulilan says, \u201cthe attention of the kids is not here anymore, it\u2019s with the sea \u2026 they are looking at you, but they are playing with the water with their feet. There is also dirt, it\u2019s fine if it\u2019s just fish that enter the classroom, but\u2026 human waste, also enters.\u201d Nutritionist Amelita Sucano on Pangapasan island says regular inundation makes it harder to find fresh fruit and vegetables. Almost all of the communities\u2019 gardens were completely washed away by Typhoon Queenie in 2014. \u201cVegetables are rare, we have to get them from the mainland. We usually eat fish and crab, but if there is no fish catch, we eat seashells [molluscs] ... but our biggest problem is tidal flooding, when the plants are splashed by seawater they wilt,\u201d she says. Shooting on the tiny islands, film-maker Chris Chadwick from Hatch said he was struck by the islanders\u2019 adaption to their new world. \u201cWhen you arrive, there\u2019s an initial shock at how drastic the experience is. The home we used as our base was someone\u2019s front room, with all the seats and sideboards propped up. Within two-and-a-half hours the same room was filled with water, and a kid, 18 months or two years old, was swimming in it, with no fear at all, a little water baby.\u201d Racing the King Tide is a a collaborative research project between Waseda University, The University of Tokyo, Liverpool John Moores University and production company Hatch.

But almost 10 years since their success in Lubart\u00f3w, the sisters have become figureheads for thousands of Poles determined to secure the clean, democratic governance promised to them in the wake of the collapse of communism 30 years ago. It\u2019s a surprising revelation. Poland has become a byword for nationalist populism in recent years as the ruling Law and Justice party defies European democratic norms with its assault on the media and the courts. But away from the limelight, there is a flourishing grassroots movement against the flaws in the country\u2019s democratic culture on which the populists feed. Tight groups of civic activists are notching up success after success across the country on a vast range of different issues \u2013 from sex education to air quality and the rule of law, from cycle lanes and public spaces to transparency and participation in local decision-making processes. \u201cSomething is happening, something has changed,\u201d says Patryk Bia\u0142as, an environmental campaigner recently elected to the city council in the south-western city of Katowice. In the eastern region of Podlasie, local activists recently ran a disciplined, sophisticated and ultimately successful campaign against illegal state-sanctioned logging in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest. In Silesia, Poland\u2019s industrial south-west, residents forced the closure of a toxic coking plant last year. In Pozna\u0144, in the north-west, citizens are campaigning to publicise allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic church. In Warsaw, a group of parents are running a campaign to put pressure on local authorities to combat the city\u2019s terrible air quality. In Gda\u0144sk, Pawel Adamowicz presided over numerous civic innovations before his brutal murder earlier this month. In 2016, Gda\u0144sk established Poland\u2019s first \u201ccivic panel\u201d in order to develop policies on flood prevention in the city, with 63 residents drawn at random from the local electoral register to \u201craise the level of civic engagement in the areas most challenging to the city\u201d. Gda\u0144sk also runs an \u201copen data programme\u201d, publishing daily data on its expenses. \u201cCivil society is not about enlightened absolutism imposed from the top,\u201d Adamowicz said at the time. \u201cIt takes place through the activism of different entrepreneurs and people of different professions and ideas, as well as through public disputes and conflicts. That is how civil society is created.\u201d The rise of these movements is threatening to reshape the country\u2019s politics. In urban areas, there has been a growth of so-called city movements, networks of campaigners challenging traditional political parties on questions of governance, corruption, planning and the environment. Some local authorities have responded to this growth in demand for accountability by introducing innovative new consultation mechanisms such as citizens\u2019 panels, where groups of volunteers and randomly selected citizens participate in the city\u2019s decision-making process, and participatory budgets, where citizens apply for financing for projects that they have drawn up themselves. In smaller towns across the country, long-entrenched local political leaders have found themselves under pressure or thrown out of office altogether by new candidates with no party-political affiliations. \u201cIn the 1990s and 2000s, the local mayor was like a kind of wizard, a kind of local god,\u201d says Bia\u0142as. \u201cJust because he was elected, he had great wisdom, like a light from the sky, and he had no need to consult anyone because he knew better than the rest of society. \u201cBut nowadays we know that the citizens have expertise, that they often know much better than their leaders. Instead of being local prophets, politicians are learning that they need to build links with society \u2013 not to \u2018manage\u2019 the people, but to serve them.\u201d Observers note the significance of these grassroots actions not just in the liberal opposition bastions of Poland\u2019s larger cities, but in places like Lubart\u00f3w, a small town of just over 20,000 people in the conservative heartland of the ruling Law and Justice party. Having killed off the council\u2019s proposal to sell the town square to private developers in 2010, the following year W\u0105s and Gryta organised a town-wide opinion poll that forced the authorities to abandon a plan to build a waste-processing plant in a residential area near the centre of town. They soon came to realise, however, that protesting against individual decisions was insufficient. The authorities were making poor decisions because they were not consulting local residents, but they did not consult them because they appeared to be under no obligation or pressure to do so; even when the sisters were able to convince the council to hold a public consultation, they struggled to convince their neighbours to attend. Unless this lack of engagement could be addressed, this vicious circle \u2013 poor decisions, leading to anger and disillusionment, leading to lack of engagement in the decision-making process, leading to more poor decisions \u2013 would never be broken. \u201cWe realised that it isn\u2019t just the fault of the authorities,\u201d says W\u0105s. \u201cIf society doesn\u2019t demand it, if they don\u2019t participate in the consultation process, if they are not present when the decision is made, then the authorities will see no point in asking us in the first place.\u201d The sisters started to shift their focus. Setting up a small local foundation, their activities range from submitting freedom of information requests, to a successful campaign for council sessions to be filmed and broadcast online, to pushing councillors to publish more information about their views and decisions. Ahead of October\u2019s local elections, they set up a stall in the town centre where residents could peruse the election materials of all the different candidates, including from past elections, so as to be able to hold them to their promises. They also run civic engagement workshops and have an initiative monitoring and publicising whether councillors turn up to their scheduled consultation surgeries. Gryta and W\u0105s\u2019s relentlessness has won them awards and admirers \u2013 all at a cost. Labelled as busybodies and troublemakers by their opponents, they have endured a form of social ostracism from those whose jobs depend on local authorities. \u201cMany people don\u2019t know they have the right to demand information, and those that do know are often afraid to do so because the authorities often perceive it as an attack,\u201d says W\u0105s. A cancer survivor with a physical disability that makes driving difficult, for years she has commuted to work in a different town so as not to have to rely on the authorities she has been challenging. \u201cIt can be unforgiving work, because we still don\u2019t have a culture of discussion. We will keep on drumming away because people need to know, people need to participate. But are we popular? No.\u201d Activists argue that they are addressing fundamental flaws in Poland\u2019s democratic transition that has facilitated the rise of populist authoritarianism. Decades after the institution of free and fair elections, the relationship between citizens and the authorities in many parts of Poland remains tarnished by a culture of secrecy and mutual suspicion, with important decisions at local level often made with little, if any, public consultation. Many fear crossing powerful local officials, who oversee vast investments of European development funds and enjoy extensive networks of patronage. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know your rights, you would rather wait for orders from someone else, and assume that you can\u2019t do something,\u201d says Katarzyna Batko-To\u0142u\u0107, director of Watchdog Polska, a Warsaw-based NGO. \u201cPeople in Poland are free, but they don\u2019t know they are free, they still don\u2019t realise that they have the power to shape their own future. In my experience, once people start to know their rights, they start to be very self-confident.\u201d These flaws in Poland\u2019s democratic governance were overlooked by many as the economy boomed, creating jobs and a sharp rise in living standards. But as material conditions have improved, and as more and more Poles return from long spells living and working in western Europe, so expectations of public institutions to deliver on the promise of western European standards of living have grown. This shift in expectations was illustrated by last year\u2019s massive environmental protests in Mielec, a town of 60,000 in the south-east ringed by factories that have been accused of polluting air and waterways with toxic discharge. \u201cThe city was able to grow economically, but it seemed like there was always a closed circle of people on the border of business and politics who dominated the council,\u201d says Mikolaj Skrzypiec, who moved back to Mielec in 2010 after 10 years living in London. \u201cWe could see that what was happening wasn\u2019t right and that the government was doing nothing, so we started to take photos and gathered samples for analysis by a scientist in Krak\u00f3w in such a way that the evidence would be admissible in court. One of the carcinogenic substances in one of the samples we found was a million times \u2013 I mean literally, a million times \u2013 higher than the legally accepted level.\u201d Public anger boiled over in March last year and 15,000 people \u2013 a quarter of the city \u2013 took to the streets, the biggest environmental protest in Poland since the disaster Chernobyl. \u201cIt was spontaneous, grassroots, organised over social media by people with no experience of campaigning. I was absolutely head over heels, really happy and proud at the number of people you could see there,\u201d says Skrzypiec. \u201cThere were manual workers, middle-class people, leftwing people, rightwing people, football fans, families \u2013 even employees of the factory we were protesting against. I will never forget it.\u201d In the capital, democracy activists are taking on very different threats. In southern Warsaw, Jan Lawrynowicz and Piotr Przytula set up a local activist group that uncovered digital skulduggery in which a spray of fake online accounts were used to cheerlead for local officials. \u201cWe saw at the micro-level of local politics the kinds of mechanisms that are going on at the geopolitical level around the world,\u201d says Lawrynowicz. \u201cIt is really scary how easy it is to manipulate people using these tricks.\u201d Activists said that while they are focused on a wide range of different issues and operate in very different parts of the country, each with their own set of challenges, some challenges are common to all of them. The first is the difficulty in bridging the gap between citizens and officialdom \u2013 especially at the local level \u2013 in a society that remains in the shadow of communist authoritarianism even decades after the fall of communism itself. \u201cSo much of local government still works in the same way as it did in the communist era \u2013 it is a Soviet style of social relations, where officials use their patronage to keep power, where only the obedient are rewarded,\u201d says Lawrynowicz. \u201cThe only difference is the fact that we have elections \u2013 but when the elections are over, no one listens to the citizens.\u201d The second is the personal cost endured by many activists. Almost all of them said that their work has led them to come under pressure either from local authorities, employers, or their neighbours \u2013 sometimes even all three. \u201cA lot of people end up disappointed because despite their best intentions, other people can be suspicious of their activities and accuse them of being in it for themselves,\u201d says Batko-To\u0142u\u0107. \u201cSomeone who thinks differently, who asks questions, who has a different opinion, can feel isolated and unpopular. There is a lot of fear of upsetting the people in charge.\u201d The third is that although they see themselves as compensating for the existing weaknesses in Poland\u2019s democratic culture and state institutions, some activists note that they will not be able to realise their aims at the national and local levels if the populists in government get there first. Their campaigns rely on independent courts to defend their rights, prosecute corruption, and enforce freedom of information requests \u2013 none of which will be possible if the judiciary is fully subjugated to Poland\u2019s ruling party. Some argue, however, that Law and Justice\u2019s rightwing authoritarianism has only served to electrify the grassroots democracy movement, shaking Poland\u2019s liberals and many others from their EU-induced complacency. In time, they say, the movement\u2019s small victories have the potential not only to transform Polish democracy for the better, but also to inspire their counterparts in western Europe to take the fight to the populists in their own countries. \u201cThe irony is that with Law and Justice in power, people are starting to wake up to the importance of rights and functioning institutions, they understand how much is left to be done,\u201d says Batko-To\u0142u\u0107. \u201cAfter we joined the EU, a lot of our problems started to be solved, and so we started to become complacent and passive. Now that people see that democracy is at risk, they realise how precious it is and what needs to be done to protect it I am actually very positive about what is going on in Poland.\u201d \u201cOverall, it is a positive story,\u201d says Lawrynowicz. \u201cWe don\u2019t win every battle, but we are making progress. People are becoming more aware, people are starting to fight. Eventually we will change this country.\u201d \u201cMaybe there is something in the Polish soul telling us to fight when we see bad things going on, even if we are in a losing position,\u201d says Przytula. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to raise the white flag, we won\u2019t accept that we don\u2019t have influence over the process.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

There are no hard and fast global numbers, but the best estimates put it north of $500bn (\u00a3382bn), or $16,000 a second. That seems like something worth celebrating in a week in which it was established that the 26 richest people own as much as the poorest 3.8 billion. Of course, charity cannot make up for inequality or social injustice. But it\u2019s good to know there are millions of givers out there. Take Scott Wellenbach. He is a rather successful poker player, and as such, a man you might think more likely to take money off you than give anything back. You\u2019d be wrong. Wellenbach is also a Buddhist. And this week, he gave a six-figure sum that he won at the tables to charity. Haroon Siddique found out more. Then there are the people who give up their time. A British survey published on Friday came up with surprising findings that four in 10 people say they have volunteered in one form or another over the past year. Some readers expressed scepticism at this. Others simply opened up on why volunteering makes you feel good, such as TheDudleyOmmer in the comment thread: As someone who has been a volunteer in supporting a scout camp in my area for more than 50 years, I can fully endorse the benefits it has given both myself and my family. In other news, we were mildly encouraged by the latest innovation to remove plastic from household products by expanding the idea of \u201crefills\u201d into the supply chain. And we liked the idea of endpaper, which will never change the world but makes it ever so slightly more beautiful. There were promising spots of data too this week. The number of young working Europeans earning so little that they are at risk of poverty fell to its lowest level since 2014. And surprisingly, particularly for French gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protesters, it emerged France devotes more of its wealth to social spending than any other rich country. And a report from Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre found worldwide terrorist attacks fell by one-third in 2018 compared with the previous year, to the lowest level since 2011. Matthew Henman, the head of Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, said: Over the course of 2018, JTIC recorded a worldwide total of 15,321 attacks by non-state armed groups, which resulted in a total of 13,483 non-militant fatalities. The attack figure represents a significant 33.2% decrease from the recorded number of attacks in 2017. What we liked This is a little old, but extremely noble: an attempt by Bastian Berbner of the German newspaper Die Zeit to get adversaries to simply sit down, talk to each other and find out what they have in common. It\u2019s mostly in German, but some pages have been rendered into English. We also liked an important focus in Positive News on the destruction wrought by pornography \u2013 and the people taking it on.

The survey, conducted by YouGov on behalf of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), involved 10,103 people aged over 18, the largest poll on the subject in more than a decade. Of the respondents 77% said volunteering had improved their mental health, with just over half (53%) saying it had improved their physical health. Young people were most likely to say volunteering had helped combat isolation, with 77% of 18- to 24-year-olds agreeing with this, compared with 68% of all ages and 76% of 25\u2013 to 34-year-olds. \u201cThere is an emerging body of evidence that suggests volunteering can improve your mental health and the language I have read is that it can help with depression, life satisfaction and wellbeing,\u201d said Karl Wilding, NCVO\u2019s policy and volunteering director. \u201cBroadly speaking, it helps as it is a social activity, and when you are doing things with others and groups that conviviality and connectedness is important,\u201d he said, adding that it was most beneficial to people who didn\u2019t have a partner or a job. A 2017 study into Wildlife Trust volunteers found more than half those who started out with low mental health had improved after 12 weeks. The NCVO survey found that 69% of respondents had volunteered at some point in their life, 38% having done so in the past year. Extrapolated over the entire adult population, this means more than 20 million people had given of their time at some point in the year. Older people were more likely to volunteer than younger people, and fully 90% of volunteers said they felt their contribution had made a difference. Wilding said that in the NCVO\u2019s own research the one thing which surprised him about the findings was that a higher number of 18- to 24-year-olds found volunteering a good way of combatting isolation. \u201cFor me, that is at the heart of what do we do next. Essentially, if you have a cohort of the population who people feel concerned about in terms of connectedness \u2026 that strikes me as a real solution.\u201d Colette Lane, 45, said volunteering had brought purpose back to her life after a spell of mental illness had forced her to stop teaching. She started with local groups and now volunteers with the Surrey and Borders mental health trust, counselling people who have suicidal thoughts. \u201cVolunteering gave me a purpose back to my life, gave me my identity again and made me feel part of the community when I was feeling isolated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me feel so proud that my son had a mum now who was keeping herself well and working. I am not well all the time, but now I can say I have the skills and support to help me get through those times.\u201d Other findings in the NCVO report include indications that people from middle class backgrounds were nearly 50% more likely to have volunteered in the last 12 months than those from working class backgrounds (44% compared with 30%). \u201cThose from lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to say they have never been involved in volunteering, and those who have are less likely to be in certain leadership or representative roles, like being a trustee. Research on volunteering, and on participation more broadly, consistently indicates that inequalities of resources and power means that some people are more likely to be excluded from certain activities,\u201d the report notes. The poll also found 74% of people agreed that volunteering had given them more confidence, with the figure rising to 84% among 18- to 24-year-olds. In addition, 71% said they had gained new skills and experience, rising to 85% among 18- to 24-year-olds. And 96% said they were satisfied with their experience and 69% said they would recommend it to others. Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the NCVO, said: \u201cVolunteering can be truly transformative for people\u2019s lives. It reduces isolation, improves confidence, provides new experiences, improves employment prospects and fundamentally it\u2019s deeply rewarding. But sadly, those who stand to benefit the most from volunteering are less likely to be involved.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

But a large section of this refugee population is being denied the ability to work to their full potential. Just as underemployment, the imbalance between skills and job roles, has reached double the rate of unemployment for British citizens, the same issues are affecting Britain\u2019s refugees. And despite May\u2019s stated intention being to prioritise immigration for the highly skilled after Brexit, here is an underutilised source of skilled people who are already in the country. Fortunately, a cluster of social enterprises have formed to help address these worrying statistics. With many based in London, and some even sharing the same co-working spaces, these startups help refugee talent move from unemployment or underemployment into meaningful work. \u201cWhen I first arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker, I wasn\u2019t allowed to work at all and it was very hard for me to accept benefits,\u201d Allahham says. These benefits of \u00a35 per day had to sustain Allahham for the four months it took for his application to be approved. \u201cI used to be a doctor, with a high standing in Syria,\u201d he continues, \u201cso it was humiliating to go to the jobcentre and ask for money. They didn\u2019t care that I am a doctor and can contribute to the country. I had to find any work.\u201d Allahham took their advice. \u201cEven cleaning was better than seeking benefits,\u201d he says. After volunteering at a local community centre, Allahham secured a full-time role as a support worker for asylum seekers. With this stability, he could focus on passing the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam to requalify as a surgeon. Nine attempts and \u00a33,500 in exam fees later, Allahham still works at the community centre. \u201cThe main problem is that I had to work full-time while studying for the language test,\u201d he says, \u201cand the free classes, which it took over an hour to walk to each day, weren\u2019t going to help me to get the high scores I needed.\u201d This high score of level 7.5 for medicine \u2013 where an average native speaker would likely reach 5 \u2013 requires intensive coaching, with one term costing upwards of \u00a33,000. Trapped in this cycle, Allahham found help through the charity RefuAid. Started in 2015 by ex-law trainee Anna Jones and consultant Tamsyn Brewster, RefuAid provides free language courses at 74 partner schools in the UK, as well as interest-free loans of up to \u00a310,000 for refugees to requalify. \u201cLanguage is the absolute first step to integration,\u201d Jones says, \u201cand since we started we haven\u2019t had a single default on the \u00a3215,000 we\u2019ve loaned, while we\u2019ve also placed 143 refugees into language schools.\u201d Jones estimates it takes at least a year of full-time study to pass the IELTS, since \u201cthe level of language they need is absurd\u201d. She says that means there are \u201cthousands of qualified refugees available who are misjudged and misused\u201d. With RefuAid\u2019s help, Allahham is now focusing on passing a new language test, the medically focused Occupational English Test, and once he does he will apply for a loan to take the \u00a32,500 exam to requalify as a surgeon. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road ahead, but I\u2019m sure I will work again as a doctor and help my community,\u201d he says. Another refugee helped by RefuAid to requalify is Syrian dentist Mohammad Alhomsi. The 31-year-old was forced to apply for asylum in 2013 after his student visa expired and the Syrian embassy in the UK shut down, leaving him and his young family stranded. It then took two years for Alhomsi\u2019s refugee status to be processed. \u201cDuring that time I broke down,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a strong man, but the way I was dealt with was undignified, like a criminal on probation. Me, my wife and my newborn baby had the bare minimum to survive on and we were scared that we would be deported. We lived an ongoing nightmare for two years.\u201d Although Alhomsi already had his language qualification from having studied in the UK, the \u00a34,000 cost to requalify as a dentist meant taking any job to save money, as with Allahham. \u201cI had to work many different jobs on temporary contracts,\u201d he says, \u201clike for British Gas, and even selling secondhand books, since the jobcentre doesn\u2019t care about you getting back to your career, just that you have some sort of employment.\u201d Exhausted from the low pay and long hours, Alhomsi was persuaded by a Syrian friend to contact RefuAid. \u201cAnna gave me hope in my life. She got me an interest-free loan that I used to pay for exam fees and preparations, which I\u2019m forever grateful for,\u201d he says. \u201cRefuAid gave me a belief that I would be able to do what I\u2019ve spent one third of my life learning, and be able to live again.\u201d RefuAid is just one of a number of refugee startup charities that have flourished in the capital in the past three years. Staffed almost entirely by under-30s \u2013 Jones is 28 \u2013 they refer refugees to one another, based on their needs. Breaking Barriers, an organisation focused on refugee employment and reskilling, helped Syrian fashion merchandiser Ammar Alsaker, 23, to get back to university and gain employment at a high-street brand. \u201cBreaking Barriers helped me kickstart my new life,\u201d Alsaker says. \u201cThanks to them, I finished first in my class at university. I have never been the first at anything, and I\u2019ve got to experience what that feels like despite all the challenges my family are going through and me being away from them for three years now.\u201d Since its founding in 2015, Breaking Barriers has helped more than 600 refugees get back into the workplace. Chief executive officer Matthew Powell, 28, says: \u201cUnderemployment is perhaps a bigger issue than unemployment for refugees, as most don\u2019t want to go on benefits, but they have families to support. The asylum process is also lengthy and you can\u2019t work during that time, so combine the two and you have a big gap on your CV that is very hard to articulate to employers.\u201d One organisation specifically targeting this asylum \u201cgap\u201d is Timepeace. An app designed to encourage skill-sharing among refugees and the public, it combats the isolation and dejection that Alhomsi found during his two-year asylum process. Co-founder Alexandra Simmons, 27, says: \u201cWe recognised that a lot of refugees were lonely once they arrived in the UK. They are dealing with a lot of trauma and being part of a community can have a hugely positive effect and help their language skills too.\u201d Timepeace is a means for refugees to meet up with others in their local area to either teach skills or to learn them, and aims to place refugees on an equal footing with the rest of society. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges around the perception of refugees is that they don\u2019t contribute, that they just want to take benefits,\u201d says Simmons, \u201cbut a lot of people aren\u2019t aware that they\u2019re either not allowed to work or they don\u2019t have the means to be adequately employed.\u201d And if there are no adequate jobs available, the Entrepreneurial Refugee Network helps people start their own businesses. \u201cWe want to reclaim the negative connotations of the word \u2018refugee\u2019,\u201d says co-founder Charlie Fraser, 25. \u201cThat\u2019s why we kept the word \u2018refugee\u2019 in our name and combined it with entrepreneurship, which is such a positive concept. We want to launch 1,000 refugee businesses by 2025, since at the moment the majority of refugee entrepreneur talent is being lost because they\u2019re in too vulnerable a position in terms of mindset, money and time.\u201d Once they have requalified, Allahham and Alhomsi plan to stay in the UK. \u201cI want to get back to the standing of the profession I had in Syria,\u201d Allahham says. \u201cJust as I helped those in the Red Cross who saved me, I want to give back to my community here. I will pass my language test soon, I know it.\u201d As for Alhomsi and his family, he says: \u201cThis is home for us now. If you ask my little one, \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 she will say Britain. She knows no different. She loves it here and we love it too, even though both our best and worst times have been here. We will always keep our culture and heritage but we will also integrate into the UK \u2013 we\u2019ll make it a richer place.\u201d \u2022 Ammar Kalia is a Guardian journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursary", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Here, here: the Swedish online love army who take on the trolls", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/the-swedish-online-love-army-who-battle-below-the-line-comments", "date": "2019-01-15", "transcript": "When a young woman with rainbow hair and a reputation for hostility towards sexual predators won a Swedish lawyer of the year award late last year, the online reaction came in two waves. The first was unpleasant, a torrent of bile from people who objected to Linn\u00e9a Claeson\u2019s looks, her feminist politics, her gender, her youth and her instagram account @assholesonline. The second was less familiar: a blizzard of positive messages \u2013 congratulations, praise for her bravery and for acting as a role model despite the abusive comments. The surge of support was orchestrated by an organisation called #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r (#Iamhere), a Facebook group of about 75,000 people, most of them in Sweden. Fed up with the rude, confrontational nature of online conversation and the way that a few bad mouths can ruin a discussion, they have made it their business to turn bad threads good. Every day, the group aims to do what government and social media companies have failed to do: defend people being attacked online by trolls and push back against the spread of misinformation. #Jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r mobilises members to add positive notes on comment sections where hatred and misinformation is being spread. This, they believe, rebalances the discussion online and disrupts Facebook\u2019s algorithm. \u201cOf course, social media does not reflect the overall population, but when you read the comment field, you often get the sense that 80% of the population thinks that homosexuality is a disease, for example,\u201d said Mina Dennert, #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r\u2019s founder. \u201cWe want the comment section to look more like society and the way to do this is enable people to speak and participate.\u201d After #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r intervened in the comment sections talking about Claeson, the tone of the conversation improved palpably. The daily Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet even began moderating comments on its Facebook page, deleting the worst examples of hate speech. \u201cIt\u2019s so tiring that everything that has to do with me has such a negative connotation. Thank you for the love,\u201d Claeson said in a Facebook post in the #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r group. Dennert, a journalist, launched her initiative in 2016, after seeing more and more disturbing remarks on social media. \u201cWhat made me want to do something was seeing people I didn\u2019t expect this from starting to repost really racist things.\u201d She created a small Facebook group which started out by asking those spreading misinformation for facts to back up their statements. The morning after Donald Trump was elected, Dennert was overwhelmed with requests from thousands of people to join her group. In the months that followed, #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r would change its approach, espousing neutrality in how its members reacted, and in most cases, simply mobilising support for people who were being harassed online. Dennert has won several awards for her work, including the prestigious Anna Lindh prize in 2017 for supporting just and democratic ideals. The Swedish rock group, Kent, even donated the proceeds of a photo auction to the group. But the attention also brought a massive backlash. Dennert regularly receives death threats, and at one point her father received bullets in the post. Trolls also doxed Dennert and her husband, Magnus Dennert, also a journalist, publishing sensitive personal data which they said related to the pair. As the personal attacks mounted, Dennert saw a sharp decline in support. At the beginning, many companies wanted to collaborate. But that changed. \u201cThe first year, we were so loved and we won all these prizes, and everyone wanted to work with us. But once the attacks started, the people who wanted to collaborate with us, they completely stopped. They were scared.\u201d Critics call #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r censorship, but Dennert and the moderators on the group are quick to emphasise that #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r never comes with an agenda. They don\u2019t tell people what to say. They simply want to defend those who are being attacked online. Orla Vigs\u00f6 is a professor in the journalism, media and communication department at the University of Gothenburg. He is skeptical that #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r can actually have an influence on the social media algorithms because trolls and people on the far right are much more prolific and are very organised. He hopes that #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r is reducing the amount of online hate speech and misinformation people see, but he adds that it is \u201cextremely hard to measure\u201d and it may be wishful thinking on his part. Roger Wiklander, one of 18 group administrators for #jag\u00e4rh\u00e4r, says that for him the group is about speaking up against hate and misinformation in a united way and giving others the courage to do the same. One comment really sticks out to Wiklander. On an article encouraging people to donate clothes to refugees, a person wrote \u201cHa-ha-ha, garbage for trash!\u201d For him, it\u2019s comments like this one that make him do this sort of work. Since 2016, the Swedish online love army has spread to other countries in Europe. Sister groups have been created and are now active across the continent, most notably in Germany and Slovakia, whose groups have 45,000 and 6,000 members respectively. The groups largely function independently. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

As it burned down around him, he soaked his underwear in the toilet water to bind around his face against the smoke. He was trapped for seven hours before police came and broke the wall down. Two months later, homeless and traumatised, he was invited to meet the leaders of the group he blamed for his attempted murder. On the other side of the table was Idris Gidado, a powerful leader of Fulani herdsmen, the nomadic cowboys who have trodden the Sahelian countryside for centuries. At the dialogue, something extraordinary happened. After the two sides had had it out, Dangyang offered a rare commodity in this bitter feud: forgiveness. Attacks on cattle herders by farmers and vice versa may seem trifling alongside the problems of poverty, terrorism, corruption and climate change facing Africa. But a recent escalation in this centuries-old deadly conflict is causing massive social upheaval across west Africa. In Nigeria\u2019s middle belt, it has claimed nearly 4,000 lives in the past three years \u2013 more, according to some tallies \u2013 than the deadly Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east. Both groups need land, but for very different reasons. Fulani herding families are always on the move, looking for food and water for their animals; they cannot and do not want to own the vast landscapes they pass through every year. For farmers, who live and work in one place, land ownership is essential. As families grow and grazing lands turn to fields of rice, ancient livestock migration routes close up and herders\u2019 cattle trample farmers\u2019 fields. Farmers kill the cattle, herdsmen take revenge; the reprisals go back and forth. Ethnicity, religion and political affiliation play into the divisions. Some of the suggestions to solve the crisis include fencing off fields, drilling more boreholes so cattle and humans do not have to share water, microchipping cattle to prevent rustling and mapping traditional cattle grazing routes. Cattle ranching is a more drastic route. It would necessitate a complete change in the nomadic Fulanis\u2019 way of life, and one that requires specific expertise, expensive animal feed, access to enough water, and \u2013 that increasingly rare commodity \u2013 land. It would also mean the end of an ancient culture. Adamu Ibrahim\u2019s family were pioneers. His father sold cows to buy land in the 1980s. These days, his family own around 10,000 cattle and he is a millionaire (though you wouldn\u2019t know it from his well-worn sandals and plain robe) \u201cI was so upset,\u201d Ibrahim said. But now, with their former grazing lands off limits, his father\u2019s foresight is obvious. \u201cIf our dad hadn\u2019t done that, where would we be now?\u201d The piece of land he bought is a safe place for the family to retreat to, but it has nowhere near enough grazing for their herds, and so the Ibrahims are thinking of taking their father\u2019s approach even further. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of sending our children to school and selling some cows to buy more land,\u201d he said. Not everyone can afford to buy land, and not every herder is ready to give up their way of life. In the meantime, the main approach for those trying to stop the killing is rather less complex: talking. Defusing tension has always required that herders and farmers build relationships, but the mistrust that the constant attacks have engendered in the past few years has made this extremely difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s more about managing the conflict than solving it,\u201d said Tog Gang, of Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation working to create peace in central Nigeria by organising meetings like the one Dangyang was persuaded to attend, to meet the men he held responsible for trying to kill him. At their meeting place, a hotel on neutral ground in Plateau state, the men and women began to take off their dark glasses, put down their mobiles, and talk. They discussed the theft of huge herds, sometimes with the involvement of outside criminals, the slaughter of women, children and older people, the recent abundance of guns, the problems of unemployment and drug abuse among the young and the lack of intermarriage between communities. Dangyang, an influential leader in the Berom community, often used to meet and talk with the herdsmen before the attack. Now, surrounded by those he considers his enemies, he stared at the table with a pronounced frown, fiddling with a toothpick. Gidado got up to speak. \u201cWe should learn to forgive each other. We have all suffered enough and can\u2019t move forward. We need to put an end to this,\u201d he said in Hausa. But then he began to blame the Beroms for the whole conflict. \u201cYou can\u2019t discipline your children,\u201d he said. A Berom leader got up and threw the blame back. \u201cWhenever someone steals or kills a cow, you respond by killing a person.\u201d Dangyang rose to his feet. He told the group how it had felt to be almost burned alive, and the indignity of losing everything. Then his tone suddenly changed. He said: \u201cI forgive the people who did this to me.\u201d Readiness to forgive is something Saleh Momale, the development geographer who was leading the dialogue, has often seen in his peace-building work between herder and farmer communities. \u201cThis is typical Nigerians. People forgive and forget very easily,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is difficult to resolve is political malice and mismanagement.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s security forces are slow to respond to calls for help, so communities arm and defend themselves. President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s critics say that because he is an ethnic Fulani, he turns a blind eye to his marauding kinsmen, and with Nigeria\u2019s presidential election looming in February, tensions are even higher than usual. Mercy Corps spends time getting to know the various players intimately to ensure they are inviting the right people to their meetings. The point is not to get the participants to sign agreements they are unlikely to stick to, but to make them sit next to each other, eat together, talk honestly about the killings and the factors behind them, and, ideally, take each others\u2019 phone numbers and plan future meetings. \u201cSmall interventions like this have done a lot of good,\u201d said Momale. \u201cThis is the best hope \u2013 building these community institutions. I see hope in these guys. I don\u2019t think we can count on our technocrats.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Not so at the ethical wholesaler Suma, which says it is the largest equal-pay co-operative in Europe. First, because it doesn\u2019t have a CEO. And second, because all of Suma\u2019s 190 employees, or \u201cmembers\u201d , earn exactly the same: \u00a315.60 an hour, equating to \u00a333,000 for a 35-hour, five-day week, plus bonuses and shares. From the 26-year-old newbie to the 65-year-old who has been with Suma since its birth as a co-op in 1977, there are no exceptions. In Suma\u2019s home of Elland, a market town near Halifax in West Yorkshire, that salary can buy you a home (a three-bed apartment in a converted mill is currently on sale for \u00a3103,000), plus \u201ca decent car, a good family life and a nice holiday\u201d, according to Nathalie Spencer, 35, who has worked at Suma for 14 years. Her main job is in international sales \u2013 the business turned over \u00a355m last year and exports 7,000 vegetarian products to 40 different countries \u2013 but like all Suma members, she multitasks, and can sometimes be seen driving a reach truck in the warehouse or loading up lorries. \u201cIt sounds a bit random, but l like the team spirit involved in loading lorries, that sense of achievement at the end of each day, rather than leaving scattered notes on your desk and forgetting half of them,\u201d she says. When the Guardian visits, Paul Collins, the account manager for one of Suma\u2019s national chain customers and the brand coordinator for Suma\u2019s Ecoleaf household range, is serving up vegetarian pizza in the free staff canteen. Jenny Carlyle, 33, who is in charge of hiring (and, only very occasionally, firing) in the personnel department, likes to go off and spend an afternoon in the deep freezer when she needs to clear her head. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s nice to put on the freezer suit and pick products at -20C,\u201d she says, and anyway, it makes her better at her main job if she understands all aspects of the business. \u201cWorking in the freezer or warehouse might be looked down on at normal companies, but actually it is such an integral part of our business as a wholesaler that we all need to understand it, and so it makes sense that our warehouse workers are paid the same as everyone else.\u201d When she first heard of Suma, she assumed there must be a catch, but she soon realised the benefits of equal pay. \u201cBeing all paid the same is liberating,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I was probably overpaid when I started and now, 11 years on, with all my experience and all the courses I have done, I am probably being underpaid. But it evens out. Overall I have probably been paid more than if I had climbed the ladder at a normal business. \u201cIt takes some of that career pressure off as well. One of the great things I love about Suma is that we all have times in our life when we can\u2019t put 100% into our working life, and at Suma you can step back for a little bit when you need to and then step back up when you can and there is no penalty for that.\u201d Though the co-op is understanding if members need to take time out \u2013 whether to have a baby, move house, care for a relative or, like Carlyle, get a master\u2019s degree \u2013 they are all expected to engage in big strategic issues of the business. New hires are warned: \u201cYou\u2019re not just a worker, you\u2019re an owner \u2026 you can\u2019t just coast along, you need to take responsibility, taking part in the democracy and putting yourself forward to make things happen.\u201d Between 120 and 550 people apply each time Suma has a recruitment round, in which the co-op generally hires up to 12 members. Applicants are wildly varied, says Carlyle: \u201cIn one round we might have someone with 40 years\u2019 experience in logistics and then someone in their early 20s straight out of university.\u201d Regardless of experience, newcomers are put on probation and spend their first three months working in the warehouse or driving \u2013 proving their ability to work safely, quickly and accurately in the less glamorous side of Suma\u2019s operation. For a further six months, they work in a variety of departments and complete various targets. Only then, after an exhausting round of feedback, is there a vote from everyone at Suma to decide if they should be allowed to join as a member. More than 90% make it through the process, says Carlyle, who at 23 found herself on Suma\u2019s management committee, its version of a board. \u201cThat was an experience most 23-year-olds would never be able to have. It\u2019s that mixture of freedom and opportunity as well as the flexibility to step back when you need to without losing your place that\u2019s really wonderful, and that\u2019s all enabled by equal pay,\u201d she says. Isis Carrasco, 47, a former charity manager, took a pay cut when she moved to Suma to become a project manager three years ago. \u201cEqual pay is equal opportunities in terms of opening horizons and being able to do jobs that you would not be able to do unless you change your career,\u201d says the cheerful Spaniard. \u201cFor example, I like DIY a lot and now I have the opportunity not just to project manage but also put shelves up. I am getting the opportunity to develop these sort of skills at work, skills you\u2019d normally have to change career to learn.\u201d It can take a little time to adjust to co-op life, says Carlyle. \u201cIt can be stressful at first figuring out how it works where there\u2019s no clear hierarchy for decision-making. At a normal company you might only need to have one conversation to get something done. Here you will have to have five or six, and sometimes the whole co-op votes. Sometime people come here thinking it is a real utopia, but people are flawed and they do make mistakes.\u201d One of Suma\u2019s six founders, Jim Crabtree, still works a few days a week at the co-op. Carlyle says she sat next to him in the canteen once and asked whether he ever regretted the decision to turn the business into a member-owned co-operative. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u00a350m business now, so he would have a one-sixth share in that rather than a one in 190 share. He stopped eating and said: \u2018Never.\u2019 I feel really grateful to those six people who decided to share the company back when I wasn\u2019t even born. It was a really generous thing they did and I am very, very proud to carry on their work.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

For centuries, the nearby town of Borja was best known for its wines and splendid 16th-century town hall. All that changed six years ago when a simple act of devotion was transmogrified into an object of ridicule, a meme and, eventually, a tourist attraction.

Gim\u00e9nez, then 81, decided that if she did not act, the face of Christ that the artist El\u00edas Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez had painted almost a century earlier would disappear for ever. Pained at the idea of its loss \u2013 and keen to conserve the interior of the church in which she had been married \u2013 Gim\u00e9nez began work, applying thick blocks of colour on which she planned to retrace the divine countenance. Had she been able to finish the job, things might have turned out differently. But Gim\u00e9nez had to leave town on a trip and her incomplete efforts soon came to the attention of the local historical association, which indignantly posted before-and-after pictures of the painting. From there, the story and images went viral. Before long, Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s work had ceased to be known as Ecce Homo and, as Monkey Christ or Potato Jesus, has become an irresistible visual shorthand for anything tending towards the disastrous. The townsfolk were up in arms, the media descended and Gim\u00e9nez lost 17kg through stress, worry and the thought that she had made a laughing stock out of Christ\u2019s suffering face. Then two things happened: the anger in Borja subsided when people found out who had undertaken the restoration. And the tourists began arriving. \u201cAs soon as people knew that it was Cecilia who had done it, everything changed,\u201d says the mayor, Eduardo Arilla. \u201cAnd this has become a social phenomenon and a pop art icon.\u201d Between August and December 2012, 45,824 people visited the sanctuary. The numbers may have dropped off since then, but Borja still receives 16,000 visitors a year \u2013 more than four times the number who came before Gim\u00e9nez picked up her brushes. Not only has the picture\u2019s fame provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum\u2019s two caretakers, it also helps fund places at Borja\u2019s care home for the elderly, a haven for those who would not otherwise be able to afford to live there. Arilla is careful not to condone the actions that put Borja on the map \u2013 and to point out that there is more to the town than just the Ecce Homo \u2013 but he welcomes the interest, the tourists and their euros. \u201cIt was a media phenomenon, but it\u2019s also been a social phenomenon when it comes to helping people,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t happened, maybe Borja would have become famous for something else, like its wine. But we wouldn\u2019t be as well known as we are now.\u201d The media phenomenon has not been limited to Borja. In June this year, the overenthusiastic restoration of a 500-year-old statue of St George in a church in Estella, Navarre, elicited comparisons with Tintin, while the treatment meted out to a group of 15th-century wooden statues in Asturias left a professional restorer torn between tears and laughter. Estella\u2019s mayor, Koldo Leoz, says the town has seen an increase in visitor numbers but adds that it predates the St George incident and is down to a concerted effort to restore the old Jewish quarter and attract pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago. Estella, he says, has no plans to capitalise on the botched restoration. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to attract visitors because of the poor treatment of our heritage,\u201d he says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t publicised it and nor will we.\u201d Ana Gal\u00e1n P\u00e9rez, the chair of Spain\u2019s Professional Association of Restorers and Conservators (Acre), argues that such cases show that the country needs to do more to protect the myriad and often forgotten treasures of its past. \u201cWe seem to be rather indifferent when it comes to the heritage around us,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go and that\u2019s why we need to educate society and public bodies so that they understand that every time someone without the right qualifications tries to restore a work, they run the risk of damaging or even destroying it.\u201d Gal\u00e1n and others also dispute the notion that Spain is more prone to dodgy conservation than other countries. \u201cWhen we talk to our colleagues from other European countries, they tell us that these things are happening but that they\u2019re not picked up by the press.\u201d Rom\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez-Baca Casares, director-general of fine arts at Spain\u2019s culture ministry, describes the unfortunate restorations as \u201cisolated cases\u201d and says that almost all the country\u2019s regional governments adhere to strict conservation rules. Gim\u00e9nez has come to terms with both her actions and the fame they have brought her and her town. As the mother of two disabled children, she is used to looking past the surface. When she looks at the Ecce Homo today, she sees \u201ca handsome face; a face that I love\u201d. She also insists that she would do the same thing again. \u201cIt was done with good intentions and despite what happened, it\u2019s been a good thing for Borja,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople from all over the world are visiting the sanctuary now. That\u2019s the best medicine. I used to cry a lot over all this but I don\u2019t cry any more because I can see how much I\u2019m loved.\u201d But Gim\u00e9nez is aware that things could have ended less happily. What advice does she have for other amateur restorers? \u201cDon\u2019t do it. It turned out well in the end here, but it doesn\u2019t always end well in Spain - and you\u2019ll find yourself in the papers.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

But there may be signs here of a new future for the beleaguered country. It was here that the local authorities planned to solidify ethnic divisions that have persisted since the 1992-95 war by creating two separate schools \u2013 one for Croats and one for Bosniaks. It was here that students fought back. \u201cWe know that divisions are not good, and that we would all lose by this plan,\u201d says Nikolas Rimac, a 17-year-old student. \u201cThe way Trump divides America is very, very similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina; he wants to divide the US like Bosnia.\u201d Schools in Bosnia tend to operate under ethnically-defined education systems, with each group being taught a separate syllabus. In many cases there is a \u201ctwo schools under one roof\u201d system, with, for example, Bosniaks attending a morning shift and Croats an afternoon one. When the plan was unveiled to go a step further and actually create a separate Bosniak school, many felt that it was a political gambit to win nationalist votes \u2013 and create jobs for party loyalists. Students from the school started a series of protests, including marches with the flags of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, and a demonstration outside the regional ministry of education. \u201cI believed that we needed to keep a common space,\u201d says Ivica Jukanovi\u0107, one of the original leaders. \u201cAt school we all became family. I want to raise my children in a city that\u2019s normal, and multi-ethnic.\u201d Ju kanovi\u0107 and many of the other pupils and teachers credit the strength of their movement to years of work by the Nansen Dialogue Centre (NDC) Sarajevo, an NGO that works to strengthen inter-ethnic cooperation and communication. Strictly apolitical, the organisation is backed by \u2013 but independent from - the Nansen Centre for Peace and Dialogue, based in Lillehammer, Norway. \u201cI truly believe that the protests were very much influenced by Nansen\u2019s work,\u201d says Mirjana Jelica, a teacher. \u201cThis may be a drop in the ocean, but if they help just 1% of the population become better people, they have achieved something.\u201d NDC Sarajevo also operates in other towns and cities in the country that were among the most-affected by the war, including Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were massacred, and Bratunac, where dozens of Serb civilians were killed on Orthodox Christmas Day 1993. The organisation\u2019s leaders, such as general manager Ljuljjeta Goranci Brkic, gradually established the trust and confidence of local people through months of work, including many nights staying in people\u2019s houses, and a willingness to engage even hardliners, rather than merely talking to those already receptive to Nansen\u2019s methods. Bosnia remains a society in which ethno-nationalist rhetoric and war memories permeate politics and public discourse. \u201cWhen Nansen first came here in 2008, we said: \u2018What the hell\u2019s mediation?\u2019\u201d says English teacher Mirko Ljubez. \u201cThings were pretty bad. Most parents were involved in the war, and that influences their children\u2019s political beliefs. But meeting people beats prejudices.\u201d Azra Keljalic, a pupil who made television appearances during the campaign to keep the school together, credits the organisation with helping pupils deal with the media, as well as providing space for them to work together and develop new skills. The NDC also organised activities with a school from across Bosnia\u2019s internal border, which lies 11km away from Jajce. \u201cOur kids are pretty open-minded, but don\u2019t have so many opportunities to talk to people from other ethnic groups, or visit other parts of the country,\u201d says Tarik Zjajo, who teaches German and led some of the joint activities. To the north, another Nansen Dialogue Centre, separate but loosely affiliated, operates from Prijedor, a city of 90,000 people in a mining region. Prijedor, a mixed city, saw some of the most vicious ethnic cleansing of the war, with thousands of Bosniaks and Croats killed. While many Bosniaks have returned to Prijedor and the region around, the wounds of war are still visible. One chilly mountain morning, a long crocodile of primary-school children winds up a large concrete staircase through the trees to the grassy summit of Mrakovica, a large meadow with the towering cylindrical Kozara Monument at its centre. Looking something like a modernist interpretation of the Tower of Pisa, it is built to commemorate the dead of an earlier war \u2013 the victims of fighting and ethnic cleansing in 1942. The children, local Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats, are attending a regular gathering organised by NDC Prijedor. They participate in group games, romping through the forest, on what is a rare opportunity for many of them to mix in large numbers with counterparts from different ethnic backgrounds. One aim is to develop an understanding of how much the children have in common, while also respecting their differences. \u201cNobody else is doing this, bringing them together,\u201d says Faris Hasanbegovi\u0107, mayor of Sanski Most, 30km from Prijedor in the Federation. \u201cBefore, it was missing. You have kids from Sanski Most, who have never been to Prijedor. Even if they don\u2019t have a hostile opinion of others, they don\u2019t think about them.\u201d NDC Prijedor has been bringing together community leaders including teachers and politicians, some of whom are otherwise known as hardline nationalists. Rather than lecturing participants on the past, Nansen focused on allowing them to share views and experiences openly. The Nansen Centre for Peace and Dialogue brings mixed groups to Lillehammer every year, providing a remove from the charged political atmosphere of Bosnia. But at first, some of the exchanges were heated. \u201cWhen we arrived, we had no mandate, no agenda,\u201d says Steinar Bryn, a senior adviser at the Nansen Centre for Peace and Dialogue. \u201cThis isn\u2019t The Hague. We invited people to discuss: why did it happen? Why was it so violent? But also it was social and cultural \u2013 we just went to watch jazz or basketball, or discussed problems at work.\u201d This may not sound groundbreaking, but in the context of a shattered and embittered postwar Bosnia, it is very significant. Azra Alic-Pasic, a doctor from Prijedor, was forced to sign her property over to the Serb-run municipality before fleeing in a refugee convoy that was then attacked. Both her father and stepfather were killed. She worked for a while in a refugee camp in Croatia before returning after the war to Prijedor, where for a while she was the only Bosniak doctor working in the city. \u201cIn 2000, Priejdor was a black hole on the map of Europe because of what had happened,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never speak a word to a Serb after the war, that I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to anyone who wasn\u2019t a fellow Bosniak. But NDC supported a space where we could discuss with our counterparts of other ethnicities. We saw that we could live together, we brought people together to become friends, to build bridges. We realised that this is the better way \u2013 the only way.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Riders throw their front wheels into the air and wheelie their way across the road. Others stand to the side making last-minute fixes to their bikes and paste stickers on their frames that read \u201cStand up against knife crime\u201d. This is not your typical mass cycle ride. It is BikeStormz, a biannual ride-out during which thousands of people from across the country bring central London to a halt as they ride together in protest against violent crime. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting the kids together without fighting,\u201d says the event\u2019s co-founder Mac Ferrari, 35. \u201cTogether they can put down the knives, just for the day.\u201d As many as 1,000 people joined the ride on Saturday to promote the message of \u201cBikes Up, Knives Down\u201d. Since the first BikeStormz ride in 2014, more than 4,000 people \u2013 mainly teenagers, but also children as young as nine \u2013 have joined to protest against youth violence. The idea is to give young people an alternative to crime through bike riding. In the last four years, the movement has spread to cities across the UK from Birmingham to Liverpool, and to Paris and Amsterdam. The most skilled riders have become celebrities in the community. One of the founders, Jake100, has 100,000 followers on Instagram and a deal with Nike. \u201cThese are different kids from different postcodes, but the bike is the glue. It\u2019s the connection between different areas,\u201d Ferrari says. \u201cNo one cares where you\u2019re from when you ride. No one cares about the colour of your skin, they just care about riding. The minute the wheel is in the air, it\u2019s a total mind block of anything going on in your life.\u201d The latest event comes at the end of a year during which the number of knife crimes has risen alarmingly. A 20-year-old man was stabbed to death in north London just hours before Saturday\u2019s ride, taking the number of homicides in the capital to 132, the highest annual figure in a decade. Across England and Wales, the number of knife and offensive weapon offences rose to 21,381, its highest level since 2010. For the BikeStormz riders, the reality of knife and gun crime is painfully close to their lives. \u201cI can\u2019t ignore the dangers for young kids around me,\u201d Ferrari says. \u201cMost of these kids know someone who has been stabbed.\u201d Jay Buttigieg, 13, sits on his yellow bike as others practise tricks around him. Wearing a black hoodie and gelled hair, his youthful face masks a sense of sadness. \u201cMy dad has been stabbed. It made me really upset, but when I ride I\u2019m enjoying myself. When I\u2019m here I feel safe.\u201d He is here cycling alongside his father, so \u201cit makes the ride even more important\u201d. The BikeStormz community is a lifeline for many riders. \u201cBy doing this we\u2019re giving kids another path rather than picking up a knife,\u201d says Czar from west London. The 31-year-old witnessed his mother stabbed at the age of nine. \u201cAs a kid I was without direction, but riding helped. BikeStormz has changed a lot of people\u2019s minds. It\u2019s not going to stop knife crime. The mayor says it could take up to 10 years to stop it, but by doing this that 10 years can be cut into five, or even less than that.\u201d Aggressive behaviour and fighting is not tolerated at BikeStormz, but it hasn\u2019t always been perceived that way by outsiders. As part of a growing movement of bike crews that take to the streets stopping traffic and filming tricks to be shown on social media, riders have often been portrayed as \u201cyobs\u201d and regarded as a nuisance by some members of the public. BikeStormz only received official backing from the mayor of London and the Metropolitan police for the first time this year. \u201cWhen people see everyone riding down the street they think we\u2019re a nuisance or a gang,\u201d says Clark Jones, 23. \u201cBut because they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about, they don\u2019t see the positive.\u201d A spokesperson for Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: \u201cThe number of violent deaths both in London and across the country is tragic, and events such as Bikestormz can bring together young Londoners and raise awareness that carrying a knife is not the answer. Serious violence devastates communities, and the mayor is taking drastic action to provide the Met with the resources they need to keep Londoners safe, including increasing council tax and committing an additional \u00a395m next year to policing and tackling crime.\u201d As more young riders fill the street, Ferrari climbs on to a wall and shouts over the mass of people. He says this year\u2019s event is especially emotional as he recently lost a friend and fellow BikeStormz rider in a motorcycle accident. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking the stereotype every single day. Today there is no beef, no knives, no guns, no robbery. I want you all to be proud of yourselves, no matter what anyone tells you.\u201d The crowd shouts back: \u201cBikeStormz.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Can folk music save the honeybee?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/can-folk-music-save-the-honeybee", "date": "2018-12-20", "transcript": "Folk music has long gone hand in hand with political protest. From Pete Seeger\u2019s 1959 rendition of the African American gospel We Shall Overcome, which became an anthem for the civil rights movement, to Dick Gaughan\u2019s Ballad of \u201884, a clarion call for the Scottish miners\u2019 strike, the combination of one singer and their guitar has had a potent effect on galvanising activists. Now, folk is turning its attention to the bees. Bees are responsible for pollinating around 80% of plantlife in the UK and over a third of crops globally, yet from 1985 to 2005 the number of honeybee colonies in the UK fell by 53% and wild honeybees are now thought to be almost extinct across Britain. This is due to a variety of reasons including climate change, infectious diseases, the use of harmful pesticides, and the reduction of natural habitats. These worrying developments have led some to claim that if the bees become extinct, humanity would only have four years left to survive. The stakes are high and 25-year-old fiddle player Rowan Piggott believes that folk is the answer. \u201cThe environmental crisis is one of the biggest issues of my generation,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of our political and economic problems pale in comparison, since they tend to go in cycles, whereas we have done irreversible damage with climate change.\u201d A waifish presence in a tweed jacket, Piggott is surprisingly optimistic about the future. \u201cPeople\u2019s knowledge of the crisis is very general,\u201d he says, \u201cand they often don\u2019t know what they can do to effect a meaningful change, so that\u2019s why I started the Songhive project, to give people chances to get involved with the bees.\u201d Since Piggott\u2019s father is an acclaimed traditional Irish folk musician and his mother is a beekeeper, the project seemed inevitable. Piggott noticed an accumulation of folksongs about the plight of the bees, such as Lau\u2019s 2012 instrumental Save The Bees, and decided to create an online archive to raise awareness. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be a nice way of reminding people that for thousands of years we\u2019ve had a healthy respect for bees as part of our life-cycle and now that people are more distanced from the process of producing food, we have forgotten that and bees have become a mild annoyance,\u201d he says. With the archive up and running and the folk community responding, Piggott decided to up the ante. \u201cI always had the idea for making a record,\u201d he says, \u201calthough I initially thought it would be a compilation of already-recorded music from the archive.\u201d Due to costly licensing fees, the record became a collection of 11 songs written and recorded especially for the project. Piggott invested \u00a31,000 of his own money and raised a \u00a32,000 grant from the English folk dance and song society to print the finished CDs. Featuring Piggott himself and some of the British folk scene\u2019s young stars, such as Rosie Hodgson and Georgia Lewis, as well as more established acts such as singer Nancy Kerr and songwriter Nick Burbridge, the album combines traditional folk instrumentation with bee-themed lyrics in the service of this environmental cause. Even the bees themselves are almost present, as their buzz is imitated by a shruti drone on Burbidge\u2019s Queen\u2019s Dream of Lost Fields, while Kerr\u2019s Dark Honey addresses the production of honey from the sugary remnants of discarded Coke cans. Since the CD was released in March, half of its 1,000 copies has been sold, raising \u00a35,000 for a Friends of the Earth campaign, the Bee Cause. Piggott has also been encouraging his audience to learn and perform bee folksongs from the archive and sign petitions. One such petition, to ban the use of the harmful insecticide neonicotinoid, was successful and passed the EU in April. \u201cThe response has been great,\u201d he enthuses, \u201call ages have gotten involved. The older fans buy the record and the younger ones are active in spreading the message.\u201d Rosie Hodgson, 26, contributed two compositions to Songhive and believes folk is the perfect vehicle for the environmental message. \u201cFolk music was mostly created and performed by those who were in positions of vulnerability,\u201d she says, \u201cinjustice is a common theme and it harnesses the power of a personal story, so one well-placed tale will inspire sympathy for a cause in a way that talking about the cause as a whole will not. There\u2019s a magic that binds people when they sing together, especially in times of hardship.\u201d Another contributor, Nancy Kerr, has made environmental awareness an integral part of her writing in recent years, with her last album, Instar, comprising folksongs about nature and conservation. For Kerr, born to a family of traditional musicians involved in protest music, folk is an activist\u2019s genre. \u201cThe act of relating a narrative that stems from the experiences of disenfranchised people is an act of protest,\u201d she says, \u201cand that makes me view folk music as intrinsically political.\u201d With CD stock expecting to be sold out by the end of the year, Piggott is looking towards a second album, perhaps widening the scope beyond the bees. \u201cIt\u2019s not just bees, it\u2019s other pollinators like butterflies that are in danger \u2013 everything\u2019s in trouble,\u201d he says. For now, though, he is planning a Songhive tour with Rosie Hodgson and some of Songhive\u2019s other musicians. They are currently booking venues that have links to conservation, even hoping to serenade the bees in a wildflower meadow. \u201cBees are the perfect species to drive meaningful action because we feel so positively towards them. They are a linchpin species,\u201d Hodgson says. For Piggott, the bees are a vehicle for optimistic action and a means for folk to be refocused to its political roots. \u201cFolk music here isn\u2019t the people\u2019s music anymore,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s become commercialised and the general public don\u2019t know what it should sound like. This project is about tapping back into that heritage and aiming it towards a cause that people can actively change right now, today.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How I recovered, by the people who did | Julie Powell and others", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/recovery-addiction-bereavement-mental-illness-cancer-debt", "date": "2018-12-19", "transcript": "\u201cI\u2019ve been falling for years,\u201d writes the Canadian author Katie Inglis in her memoir about grief and the death of her baby son, \u201cscrambling up again, sorting out in fits and spurts, freshly sorted reasonings collapsing in on themselves to make space for new wrack\u201d. The sense of loss she chronicles is both past and present. Grief is a continuum, recovering is continuous, with no identifiable moment of arrival. Is there ever? Elusive, intangible, magical, recovery is, at best, something to be hoped for, though not necessarily to be believed in. After all, you can\u2019t see your recovery, you can\u2019t touch it, as you can a healing wound. Recovery suggests that you can get back to where you were before, which is to say, back to your old self, your well self, your whole, unwounded self. As such, it is a dark word, as well as a magical one. It is the mythical tree in the fairytale forest that has the power to protect you, or crush you. Recovery is teamed with the verb \u201cto recover\u201d, and to recover means to retrieve your former self, to find what you have lost. But with recovery, you cannot go back. Instead, you need to let go of your old self or your old way of living, and to accept who, and what, you have become, and to live differently. To recover, you need to be able to see a future with you in it, you just as you are, however changed, damaged, flawed or fearful. This is what recovery looks like, and another word for it is hope. As well as hope, you need resilience because, as all the people I have spoken to have said again and again, you\u2019re still on your own, and because the thing that took you down might come back. In order to understand how someone recovers \u2013 and the people I talked to are in recovery from alcoholism, cancer, loneliness, depression, penury and abuse \u2013 it is necessary to see what each has lost. For loss, along with an acute sense of isolation, is what takes each of them down. A sense of connection with others is what saves them. It is the key to being in recovery. Addiction Julie Powell, 58, never consciously swapped her family for alcohol. A sociable mother-of-two, she was brought up in a pub with a functioning alcoholic for a mother. She and her husband, Colin, a doctor, had a vibrant, party-filled social life themselves that \u201crevolved around alcohol\u201d. But when Colin secured a job in Australia in 1993, she had to give all that up. But the shock of being in an unfamiliar culture with no support network left her stranded, lonely and isolated. Having a husband and sons \u201cwasn\u2019t enough\u201d, she recalls. \u201cYou have no history when you emigrate.\u201d For the next six years, she numbed her acute homesickness with alcohol. \u201cIn the morning, I\u2019d put the kettle on, get the milk from the fridge and have a swig of wine. Do another job. Have another swig. When it was an acceptable time to have a drink, I\u2019d put the wine in a glass.\u201d Acute homesickness has similar debilitating symptoms to depression. Panic attacks, grief, loss of motivation, and social withdrawal all dogged Powell, but anger, directed at her husband, was the only emotion she recognised. Her marriage unravelled. \u201cI thought, do I stay for the sake of my husband\u2019s job, or say what I want to say, which is: I can\u2019t do this any more.\u201d Her \u201cvery loving\u201d husband agreed to return to the UK, but Powell, instead of reintegrating, became a carer to both her parents while struggling with a behaviourally challenging teenage son. Her sense of isolation intensified, and her self-esteem plummeted further. \u201cThe only thing that was there 24 hours a day when I needed it was alcohol. It became my partner. I didn\u2019t know how to stop. I\u2019d vomit up the wine, and have another drink straight away.\u201d Then came the crisis point. \u201cVomiting blood,\u201d she says, \u201cwas the start of my recovery. I thought, I don\u2019t want to die like this, you know. I can\u2019t have my children knowing that I died through doing something to myself.\u201d A nurse told her about the Living Room, an addiction recovery centre in Cardiff. The empathy shown by her Living Room counsellor, a recovering alcoholic and \u201cthe most compassionate person ever\u201d, was the next step in her recovery. \u201cI was talking to someone who understood the hopelessness of my situation.\u201d Attending group therapy corroborated this empowering sense of connection. \u201cThere was just this glimmer of hope, that yes, I can do this. I suddenly thought, I want what they\u2019ve got.\u201d Powell says her recovery isn\u2019t over yet. \u201cIt is a process. You are never cured of this. The people who relapse tend to be the people who get complacent.\u201d She attends regular group therapy and now volunteers as a receptionist one day a week for the Living Room. \u201cFor me, it is very important to connect with other people in recovery. It is a reminder that I still have to work at it. \u201cTo me, recovery means hope. It\u2019s re-establishing my identity, a positive identity, and having meaning to my life \u2013 and taking responsibility for it.\u201d Mental illness As an introverted only child, Jaabir Ramlugon saw his father as the centre of his universe. \u201cWe were always very close. I really looked up to him. My dad\u2019s side of the family is Hindu. My dad converted to Islam when he met my mother, so they disowned him.\u201d Ramlugon\u2019s parents moved to north London, from Mauritius in 1981. Ramlugon was bullied at school, and it made him believe that he was not good enough. When he was 13, his father died. \u201cI went back to school in the September and I was just very vulnerable, still in shock. My vulnerability must have been picked up. I became even more reserved, and I was singled out even more. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to feel suicidal.\u201d A year after his father\u2019s death, Ramlugon cracked: \u201cI just want to kill myself, I screamed at my mum.\u201d He was sent to a psychotherapist and put in a special unit at school for pupils with behavioural issues. \u201cMost of my bullies were in there: I was closer to them than before.\u201d By the time he was an adult, Ramlugon had become convinced he brought the suffering on himself. \u201cI have an internal bully now,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt under attack, even though I was trying to work as hard as I could. My depressive episodes started getting more intense. I cried on my way to work.\u201d Being passed over for a promotion in 2014 was, says Ramlugon, \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d. The following Saturday, he attempted suicide. \u201cI chatted to my friends so they wouldn\u2019t suspect anything and then I drove to Beachy Head.\u201d He was on the cliff edge, ready to jump when he heard a man\u2019s voice behind him. \u201cPlease step away from the edge,\u201d he said. \u201cI just need to talk to you.\u201d It was the expression of concern Ramlugon had been waiting for. \u201cI thought, someone wants to talk to me,\u201d says Ramlugon. \u201cThe spell was broken.\u201d Ultimately he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. He did therapy, but has since settled on human connection and nature as his lifebuoys. He reaches out to fellow mental health sufferers via Elefriends, the mental health charity Mind\u2019s online support forum, and is now in a relationship with someone he met via a mental health dating website. He also leads one of Mind\u2019s walking support groups. \u201cSocialising is very therapeutic,\u201d says Ramlugon, \u201cand trees, birds, rivers, they are a distraction for me. The connection with nature just feels good, so does the act of walking and talking, having a laugh and a joke. \u201cMy anger has gone. It\u2019s strange. I almost try to empathise with my bullies. They were probably in a really bad place and what they did to me was their only way of coping. It doesn\u2019t make it OK.\u201d For him, recovery hinges on letting go of the past. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t own me or define me. It has for a long time, but I am in a place where it doesn\u2019t any longer. Talking about it reduces my own shame; it is empowering. \u201cI say to my younger self, \u2018There is nothing wrong with you. Nothing that happened to you is your fault.\u2019 \u201cI am proud to use the word recovery. I don\u2019t see darkness all the time, and I have hope. Sometimes I am able to enjoy my life, and that\u2019s a feeling I have not had since my father passed.\u201d Bereavement When former RAF navigator John Hyde, 85, from Cambridgeshire, was growing up in south London in the 1930s, his father tuned into dance band star Victor Silvester on the radio and taught his sisters ballroom dancing. The young Hyde watched on. Some 70 years later, dancing would rescue him from acute loneliness following the sudden death of his wife on the eve of his 80th birthday in 2013. Hyde met Joan at an RAF flying course when he was 21. A year later, they married. Almost 60 years of marriage ensued, three children and a proper air force family life, sociable and lively. Retirement and civilian life came as a shock \u2013 \u201cwe met lots of people who wouldn\u2019t invite you into their home\u201d \u2013 and the sociable John and Joan gradually withdrew. \u201cWe had each other. We did most things together. We went shopping together, visiting the family together, weekends away together.\u201d Three days before his 80th birthday, the couple picked up Hyde\u2019s birthday cake \u2013 \u201cJoan was so excited about it. It had a model of the Victor aircraft I once flew on.\u201d They went out for lunch and as Joan reached for the dessert menu, she had a stroke. She died later that evening. Hyde\u2019s family offered to stay with their father in the short term but, after 40 years in the RAF navigating in Canberras, Valiants and Victors, steeliness and self-reliance were part of his makeup. \u201cI knew that I had to get over it myself. I said: \u2018No one can cure the way I feel at the moment. Only I can do that.\u2019\u201d But he had not bargained for how the shock of his wife\u2019s passing would manifest itself, and how the grief and the loneliness would play tricks on him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember her, my mind shut off, my body shut down. It was as if they were protecting me by saying, we are going to shut her out of your life now.\u201d For the next months, Hyde says he existed in a vacuum. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d stand in the kitchen, crying. It sounds crazy for a man of my age. I lost a lot of weight. I wasn\u2019t eating properly. I\u2019d make something and not fancy it. Joan and I used to take it in turns to cook. \u201cThe bed seemed big and empty. I\u2019d get up and go into the kitchen, and say to her, shall I put the kettle on? Men can\u2019t do loneliness,\u201d he says. Then one day, 18 months after his wife\u2019s death, Hyde thought: \u201cI\u2019ve got to do something because, well, you either go under or you survive.\u201d He accepted an invitation to a dance class at the University of the Third Age (U3A). \u201cDancing again was the start of my recovery,\u201d says Hyde, who was then further persuaded to take up an art class and singing at U3A. He now sings for two hours a week in a choir of fellow pensioners and they perform hits from musicals in a residential home. Gigi and Oklahoma are among his favourites. He is naturally outgoing, and he likes people. He has connected to his old self, even going for a flying lesson, but his recovery has come at a price. \u201cI feel guilty because I am doing things that, had Joan been alive, I never would have done. I think, it\u2019s not fair. If Joan came back tomorrow, I would give it all up.\u201d He still finds himself talking to his late wife. \u201cSometimes I come in and I almost say: \u2018I\u2019m home.\u2019 That\u2019s when you expect to see her, and she\u2019s not there.\u201d For Hyde, being busy and having connections and commitments to others has given him a sense of purpose. He is now an ambassador for the charity Campaign to End Loneliness, and has recently started up a men\u2019s dining club in the village. \u201cWe go to the pub and have a coke, about 10 of us. I think we should be able to talk about being on our own, about finding it hard. We should be able to help each other. The trouble is, the men who have joined are the outgoing ones; it\u2019s the ones that haven\u2019t you\u2019ve got to get to.\u201d Cancer Amy Carr has always pushed herself to her physical limits. \u201cI was doing Olympic weightlifting at 15. Being a goalkeeper is all about power and speed, but I wanted to be endurance fit.\u201d By the time she graduated in sports and fitness from Northern Illinois University as an overseas student in 2014, former goalkeeper Carr had played in the Fifa U17 Women\u2019s World Cup in New Zealand in 2008 and played for Il Sandviken, Norway\u2019s women\u2019s squad. She decided to retrain as an American universities women\u2019s football coach, securing a place on a graduate assistant football coaching programme at Hastings College, Nebraska, starting in 2015. But in February 2015 she had a seizure. An MRI scan revealed she had a benign brain tumour. She was 23. Pre-op surgery revealed a glioblastama, an invasive malignant tumour that affects the central nervous system. The surgery was delayed until July 2015. \u201cI had to tell Nebraska I wasn\u2019t coming. I was devastated.\u201d Carr, who lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, trained hard for her 10-hour surgery. \u201cThey told me I was going to be paralysed, and it could last six months or it could be forever. I was awake at one stage during the surgery, for just a few seconds, and I heard the nurse say: \u201cShe\u2019s not doing too good.\u201d \u201cWhen I woke up, I was paralysed down my right side. I couldn\u2019t speak for eight days. My first movement was in my hand. It was probably the best feeling ever,\u201d she says. \u201cI took my first steps on day nine. I went home on day 12 and on day 13 my mum helped me on to my stationary road bike in my lounge. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to my training in the US now. I don\u2019t know how I would get health insurance or travel insurance. I like to plan months and months in advance; I don\u2019t like the unexpected. I\u2019ve had to let go of everything I had planned.\u201d But she still exercises intensively. \u201cToday I am still not in control of the cancer \u2013 I exercise so much because I like to be in control. I would happily say I am addicted to exercise. Even if I am behind a desk, I sit on a Swiss ball; it is kind of an obsession.\u201d This year she ran a marathon and is training for a triathlon. \u201cThe doctors told me not to do open-water swimming. I will prove them wrong, and prove to myself that I am fine.\u201d Carr longs to recover her pre-cancer self or rather, a new one that is not defined by cancer. \u201cI don\u2019t know when it will stop being in my life. My doctors say I am technically cancer-free, but that I will have to go back for six-monthly tests for the rest of my life. I am always going to have this cloud over me. I am trying to live with it. \u201cIf recovery means being fitter than anyone else I train with and know, then yes, I am recovered, but mentally I don\u2019t know if I have. There are two mes now, two extremes: upbeat me, and downer me. Cancer-me is not very sociable. If I\u2019ve been on my own for a while, I slip into isolated, lonely me. I\u2019m not very nice. I\u2019m angry, frustrated. Cancer-me can appear anywhere. I will hide it for a while, and then I\u2019ll take myself off \u2013 either to the gym or I\u2019ll go to bed, depending on the time. The thoughts start swirling and go negative. Be sociable, Amy. Why are you on your own? I am disappointed in myself, annoyed. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not OK because I\u2019ve just survived cancer, and how many people can say that? \u201cPeople say, look at you, you\u2019re strong, you\u2019re fit, you\u2019re healthy. I\u2019ve got a good shape, but inside isn\u2019t so great, inside I am not really healthy.\u201d Carr now has a cancer rehab qualification and is working with people who have just been diagnosed or are in recovery. \u201cHelping them helps me,\u201d she says. Carr has written a book about her experiences, The Scars No One Sees: A professional footballer\u2019s life changes when diagnosed with a brain tumour. \u201cI want to get rid of that stigma surrounding recovery. I don\u2019t even know what it means to be recovered. I don\u2019t think you can be fully recovered, ever. Can you?\u201d Debt For Pete Moss, the debt and depression that would one day drive him to a suicide attempt were linked to a series of changes in his employment status. Over four decades, he went from being an employee of British Rail, BA and Cunard Line to being on the minimum wage and then zero-hours contracts for various call centres. Along the way, Moss was passed over for promotion, suffered job losses and once was told he could keep his job but with an increased workload on the same pay, a proposition he rejected. It felt like a degradation, says Moss, from Solihull, West Midlands. \u201cI felt worthless.\u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019d always held down good, well-paid jobs, but I always spent more than I earned.\u201d Credit cards bought holidays, clothes for his sons, and alcohol. \u201cI got drunk every single night.\u201d His Sunderland house fell into negative equity and, following his legal separation in 1999, his wife had custody of their two sons. He quickly became isolated. On sick leave for anxiety and depression from a call centre, he lived \u201cin fear of bailiffs at the door\u201d. If he wasn\u2019t working, he watched TV all day and, every evening, spent five or six hours on Facebook. He had two contacts with the outside world: a weekly coffee morning and, on a Friday, a community dinner plus a choir group provided by his housing association. \u201cI was outgoing, gregarious. No one knew how lonely I was. I felt like a prisoner in my own flat. I thought I would be better off dead \u2013 even though I\u2019ve got two beautiful grandkids.\u201d Moss had had cognitive behavioural therapy, which teaches techniques for managing destructive thought patterns, following a breakdown in 2012. \u201cBut when I was isolated, the last thing I was able to do was to turn negative things into positives,\u201d says Moss. \u201cEverything was black. I had no hope. \u201cI thought, I can\u2019t bear this any more. I haven\u2019t been a good grandad, I don\u2019t feel worthy of being a grandad. I\u2019ve never been able to buy them anything, not even on their birthdays and Christmas. It doesn\u2019t make it easier, when you see other kids getting lovely gifts from their grandparents.\u201d In February 2016 he attempted to take his own life. \u201cI thought, to hell with it. This is it.\u201d The first step in his recovery was talking to a counsellor at the debt counselling charity Christians Against Poverty (CAP). \u201cThey showed me it would take me 16 years to repay my \u00a311,500 debts.\u201d On CAP\u2019s advice, Moss took out a debt relief order. \u201cIt was a weight off my shoulders. Somebody cared. \u201cMy zero-hours contract dried up. I now haven\u2019t worked since November 2016. But I started volunteering for CAP, visiting people who have been where I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve found some value, and I\u2019ve broadened my social horizons and started going for walks, too. \u201cI was doing something other than being inside four walls. Interacting with others, outside of the flat \u2013 that was the big thing \u2013 and people from CAP visited me. \u201d CAP has taught him how to budget. \u201cI live off \u00a3385 a month, and I live within my means. It\u2019s difficult. I struggle every month. I was paid four days ago and I\u2019m skint. \u201cI\u2019ve started to learn to put money aside \u2013 I\u2019m saving to see the grandkids \u2013 and I\u2019ve got a full cupboard of food for a month.\u201d He has not managed to buy the grandchildren any presents yet. \u201cMy son says my company is the gift.\u201d \u2022 Genevieve Fox is the author of Milkshakes and Morphine: A Memoir of Love and Life", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Sweden's first MP in a hijab challenges swing to the right", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/17/leila-ali-elmi-somali-born-mp-sweden-swing-right", "date": "2018-12-17", "transcript": "Swedes will this week be treated to a new sight: a Swedish MP giving a speech in a hijab. Leila Ali Elmi, who arrived in the country aged two after her family fled civil war in Somalia, will make her parliamentary debut after winning a surprise victory in this autumn\u2019s polls, promising a voice for people targeted by the groundswell of hostility to immigration. \u201cMy getting elected has caused a lot of reactions from the racists,\u201d she says in the Green party offices in Stockholm. \u201cThey weren\u2019t really ready for it, but here I am.\u201d Ali Elmi, 30, represents the other side of an election that was dominated by the issue of immigration and had an increase in the far-right vote. She fought on the issues closest to residents of Angered, the disadvantaged, immigrant suburb that has been her home for the past 28 years \u2013 unemployment, overcrowding, exclusion and segregation. \u201cThe only people who were not surprised at my election victory are those who know that the suburb needs a voice. I speak for the suburb, not about it or to it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have not lived there or spent a day in those people\u2019s shoes, you cannot represent them.\u201d Ethnic segregation in Sweden\u2019s suburbs drew international attention in early 2013 when young people rioted in northern Stockholm, torching cars and schools and fighting with police. They said they were angry at police racism and felt like second-class citizens despite having been born in the country. There have been flare-ups since, most recently when masked youths armed with molotov cocktails set 80 cars ablaze in a Gothenburg suburb. Problems with gangs, shootings and even grenade attacks have led some politicians to claim the suburbs are ungovernable no-go zones. The far-right Sweden Democrats have been effective in linking these problems with immigration. The party won 17% of the vote in September\u2019s poll, up from 12% in 2014, but not enough to push the Conservatives down to third place as had widely been expected. The party has also shifted the political mainstream to the right. Sweden has moved a long way from the years leading up to 2016 when it welcomed 370,000 asylum seekers \u2013 by far the largest number relative to population of any European country. For Ali Elmi, the issue is not immigration but rather the conditions in which most people with immigrant backgrounds live. \u201cThe Sweden Democrats say everything that is going wrong here is because of the immigrants, because Sweden is bringing too many people into the country, but this is a fiction. It is not true,\u201d she says. \u201cI am trying to say instead that this is a national issue. People don\u2019t have jobs and they live in segregated areas, which puts them even further from becoming part of the society. People feel dignity when they feel part of something bigger. Criminality is due to social exclusion \u2026 we need more equality in this country, harder laws against discrimination and racism.\u201d It is too soon to say precisely who voted for Ali Elmi, according to Jonas Hinnfors, a professor of politics at Gothenburg University. But the election of a young, liberal Muslim points to fundamental changes. \u201cThere is something stirring out there, a new trend,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did not play the immigrant card. It was not: \u2018We Muslims must stick together.\u2019 Instead it was schools, segregation, jobs \u2013 all the issues that are important to people who live in the suburbs. And because she comes from there, Ali Elmi also embodies what she is talking about. That is unusual.\u201d Ali Elmi worked as an interpreter, helping newly arrived immigrants and refugees to navigate the administrative process. Before her election to parliament, she was a city councillor for the Greens, campaigning on the party\u2019s broad agenda of social and sexual equality, feminism and climate change. Her political inspiration is Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to the US Congress. Ali Elmi\u2019s speech comes in the week that Sweden marks 100 years since its parliament voted for women\u2019s suffrage. \u201cI addressed all Gothenburgers who share my values and those of the Green party,\u201d she says. \u201cMy election gives hope to people who recognise themselves in me, whether they are black, female, Jewish, Muslims or young people.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Their physical and mental health is fragile. Life expectancy for homeless women in Dublin is 38. For men, it is 42. These challenges seem insurmountable. But Dr Cl\u00edona N\u00ed Cheallaigh thinks otherwise. For her, a solution is to be found in a more joined-up medical approach designed to stop marginalised individuals bouncing around between hospitals and the streets with no single service \u201cowning\u201d their care. N\u00ed Cheallaigh, who is a hospital consultant, heads up a service for socially excluded groups, including homeless people. The programme she has established at St James\u2019s hospital is unique. And it looks like it is working. She has always had a strong sense of social justice. Both sets of her grandparents grew up in inner-city Dublin tenements. But the idea of this service grew during her training in HIV medicine. \u201cIf you take HIV tablets daily and come to clinic twice a year, you\u2019ll have a normal life expectancy,\u201d she says. \u201cYet there was a small cohort in their early 30s who just wouldn\u2019t do either.\u201d By the end of her first year all those patients were dead. There were practical reasons for missing appointments. They could not afford taxis, or had no family to bring them. N\u00ed Cheallaigh set about rethinking how to do care for people are socially excluded. \u201cYou set up drop-in services, have people remind them to come, pay for taxis.\u201d Then they can stay well, have relationships, look after their kids. The alternative: watch them die young. It is part of a broader approach called inclusion health which addresses health and social inequities among the most vulnerable and excluded (homeless people, individuals with severe mental health issues, drug users and prisoners, for example). Its foundation lies in the integration of health and social services. St James\u2019s has the first hospital-led inclusion health team in the world. This is important because homeless people are five times more likely to attend A&amp;E but up to 40% leave without being seen. They are 3.2 times more likely to become inpatients with longer stays and more readmissions. When homeless patients arrive to A&amp;E, they are flagged up on the system so N\u00ed Cheallaigh and her team are aware. These patients get pyjamas, socks, underwear, toothpaste and a toothbrush if they wish. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling shamed [about being unkempt], you\u2019ll try to reassert status or you\u2019ll leave.\u201d Every one of these medical patients goes under her care. But care must go beyond patching people up and returning them to the streets. Further down the chain, a homeless and drugs charity by the river brings N\u00ed Cheallaigh together with social workers, nurses, psychiatrists, accommodation providers, addiction workers, and GPs once a week. Here, a housing officer talks through options for Sofia. A keyworker has found a missing patient. The ideal is to prevent medical complications and indeed homelessness, but rough sleepers often flit between hospitals; without this meeting, they might fall through the gaps entirely. N\u00ed Cheallaigh heads to her next stop of the day. \u201cFunnily enough, it\u2019s the old tradition of medicine,\u201d says Dermot Murphy, who is a senior services manager for DePaul at Sundial House, a long-term accommodation unit for chronic street drinkers. \u201cBring the doctor to the patient, not the patient to the doctor.\u201d This approach is distinctive, Murphy believes. \u201cBeing consultant-led \u2013 it gives a sense of gravitas and strength that\u2019s changing the hospital\u2019s focus. It couldn\u2019t be done if it was GP-led because it\u2019s a silo, that place. Beyond the hospital doors, you\u2019re on their grounds.\u201d Christy, 60, has benefited from the coordination of care. \u201cHeart attacks, brain clots, fractured legs, a broken back. You name it, I\u2019ve had it,\u201d he recalls. Now, his nurse has a direct dial to the inclusion health team. His health issues have abated. He has stopped drinking. \u201cI\u2019ve an exercise bike and I do my best with that. I\u2019m trying to lose the belly. I\u2019ve cut down on the biscuits and chocolate. Maybe someday I\u2019ll move out but not now. I\u2019ve a beautiful life here.\u201d One argument is that these patients are getting special treatment. But that\u2019s the point. \u201cNHS trusts, they\u2019re like here \u2013 large entities of bureaucracy that are meant to work with the mean,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cWe\u2019re saying there are a significant number of outliers whose needs can\u2019t be met with this traditional model. Asking someone with a chronic heroin or alcohol addiction to attend an appointment at a specific time is slightly ludicrous.\u201d He adds: \u201cWorking with a consultant who is willing to walk out of the hospital and go \u2018this man absolutely needs an appointment and I\u2019ll make myself available when you can get them to the hospital\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s the difference between saving that person\u2019s life and that person dying.\u201d N\u00ed Cheallaigh\u2019s service saved almost \u20ac1m (\u00a3904,000) in direct costs to the hospital and 3,066 bed days in a year-long pilot study. Yet finance for the service remains uncertain, with no promise of extension beyond a two-year funding round. Back at St James\u2019s, Sofia recounts a previous visit to another hospital. \u201cThey left me sat in the waiting room, vomiting in front of people. They discharged me at 2am, a female on my own.\u201d But St James\u2019s was different. \u2018The two times I\u2019ve come here before, they\u2019ve brought me straight through. I didn\u2019t feel judged.\u201d Since her latest hospital admission,she has detoxed fully and is being discharged to a residential recovery unit. The inclusion health team will keep tabs on her. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my life back,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m shocked I\u2019ve lost everything the way I have but in my head if you\u2019ve had it once you can have it again.\u201d Her hospital team here looked beyond a bed for the night.

Instead, he grew up watching it from afar, in television reports of massacres and gun battles deep in the countryside. Reporters would often only show the point of view of the military \u2013 the only group who could regularly grant them access to the battlefield. Rural Colombians, who bore the brunt of conflict, were often ignored; coverage instead focused on urban incidents such as kidnappings of public figures and attacks against government buildings. Media would also turn a blind eye to military atrocities. When members of the army in 2002 began abducting and murdering civilians in an effort to boost their body counts, it went largely unreported for six years. A peace deal signed with the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc) rebel group in late 2016 formally ended 52 years of bitter war that left 260,000 dead and more than 7 million displaced. But unrest continues, as other armed groups seek to muscle in on former Farc territory. Now, a project is seeking to change how the conflict is covered, taking reporters to far-flung corners of the country, and giving a voice to those caught in the crossfire. Colombia 2020, launched in early 2016 with funding from the European Union, aims not only to report on the transition from war to peace, but to educate a nation on what led its citizens to kill each other for generations. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that Colombia is like a gringo movie with good guys and bad guys \u2013 that every guerrilla is a monster in the jungle,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said in the newsroom of El Espectador, the country\u2019s oldest newspaper. \u201cBut Colombia is a country where war is a way of life for children \u2026 we have ask ourselves, why is that the case?\u201d As the scars of war are revealed in tribunals, S\u00e1nchez and his colleagues are documenting the successes and failures of the peace process \u2013 and shedding light on a conflict that was often far from the consciousness of many Colombians. \u201cWe can\u2019t cover it all from the capital,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez. \u201cWe have to go and talk to the people living there because if we don\u2019t understand the dynamics of the war, we can\u2019t get rid of the dynamics of war.\u201d Reporting in Colombia still carries risks. S\u00e1nchez recently had to cancel a trip to Catatumbo, a lawless region on the border with Venezuela currently disputed by two smaller rebel groups, after local sources advised it would be too dangerous. Earlier, he had to run from a shootout that broke out in Tumaco, a Pacific coast city rife with drug traffickers. Gloria Castrill\u00f3n, the project\u2019s head, previously spent decades covering the war\u2019s brutality. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the aftermath of massacres, heard the survivors speak of how they were abused and raped \u2026 while we journalists were smeared as being allied with the rebels,\u201d she said. One of Colombia 2020\u2019s goals has been to change the language used to report conflict, Castrill\u00f3n said. \u201cDuring the war, we would only have access to remote regions if we travelled with the military, and of course that would skew our perspective, down to the words we used to describe skirmishes and combatants,\u201d she said. Colombia\u2019s mainstream media would often downplay massacres carried out by state-aligned paramilitaries, referring to them simply as \u201cmurders\u201d, she said. Another challenge has been building trust with local sources who have long been suspicious of major media companies in Colombia. \u201cBuilding those links with people out in the field has been our biggest challenge,\u201d said Natalia Herrera, the platform\u2019s content editor. \u201cBut it\u2019s also one of the things we are most proud of: giving a voice to these people.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The plan, crafted by more than 50 economists, historians and former politicians from half a dozen countries, includes huge levies on multinationals, millionaires and carbon emissions to generate funds to tackle the most urgent issues of the day, including poverty, migration, climate change and the EU\u2019s so-called democratic deficit. Published as the British parliament is set for a climactic Brexit vote, the \u201cmanifesto for the democratisation of Europe\u201d says EU institutions are stuck in \u201ca technocratic impasse\u201d that benefits the rich. \u201cFollowing Brexit and the election of anti-European governments at the head of several member countries, it is no longer possible to continue as before,\u201d says the document. \u201cWe cannot simply wait for the next departures or further dismantling without making fundamental changes to present-day Europe.\u201d The move underlines the gulf between the preoccupations of the UK and those across the Channel. While the UK is consumed by its tortuous EU exit process, Europe\u2019s pro-EU political forces are concerned with avoiding losses to anti-European populists in next May\u2019s European elections. The left-leaning authors criticise movements dedicated to \u201chunting down foreigners and refugees\u201d, but also parties espousing what they call \u201chardcore liberalism and the spread of competition to all\u201d. Signatories include Italy\u2019s former prime minister Massimo D\u2019Alema and the Belgian political scientist and socialist mayor of Charleroi, Paul Magnette. Michael Jacobs, who advised the UK\u2019s former prime minister Gordon Brown, is also a signatory. At the heart of the manifesto is a call for a European assembly that would have a budget of up to \u20ac800bn a year, financed by taxing corporate profits more effectively, as well as income and wealth. The EU has been accused of failing to address the manifest unfairness of huge multinationals such as Apple, Google and Amazon channeling profits through member states where taxes are lowest. The budget would be worth 4% of the EU\u2019s GDP \u2013 four times the current budget. Funds would be raised from four sources: an extra 15% levy on corporate profits, tax increases on individuals earning more than \u20ac100,000, a wealth tax on personal fortunes above \u20ac1m, and a tax on carbon emissions. Half of the proceeds would be returned to member state governments. A quarter would go to research, innovation and education. A fund to better manage migration and a fund to make agriculture and industry greener would also benefit. Insisting they do not want a \u201ctransfer payments Europe\u201d, countries would see only a 0.1% difference in what they collect and get in return \u2013 a big difference from proposals for a eurozone budget that many economists see as a long-term necessity for the 19-country bloc. The money would be overseen by a new European assembly consisting mostly of national politicians and some MEPs. While the assembly would be in touch with EU institutions, it would sit outside EU treaties and have the final word on spending. The public are invited to comment and improve the proposals, which the authors said were \u201cnot perfect, but \u2026 do have the merit of existing\u201d. Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel thinktank, who did not sign the letter, questioned the need for a continent-wide project. \u201cIf the cross-border transfer element is only 0.1%, why do the whole thing at EU level?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnything we would do at the euro-area level would mean doing something less at the national level and that is politically why it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said, pointing to failed attempts to create pan-European national insurance schemes. Richard Corbett, Labour\u2019s leader in the European parliament, said the manifesto appeared to reinvent the wheel. \u201cInstead of using the already existing EU budget and the already existing directly-elected Parliament, and building upon them, it suggests that the member states of the EU would all agree to set up a brand new hybrid Parliament and give it a budget in which it alone would decide on spending four times the size of the existing budget. They\u2019d do better to lend their support to proposals that can actually be achieved.\u201d There have been a series of failed and faltering attempts at voluntary collaboration on economic policy. After the French president, Emmanuel Macron, came to power on a mandate of \u201ca Europe that protects\u201d, Paris and Berlin renewed their vows on Franco-German cooperation, opening talks on corporate tax harmonisation as well as a common position on an EU digital tax. With Angela Merkel hamstrung by coalition difficulties and in the twilight of her time as German chancellor, the agenda has stuttered, causing frustration in Paris. The limits of voluntary cooperation were also exposed in Europe\u2019s search for a financial transaction tax. In 2014 a coalition of 10 willing EU member states embarked on plans for the so-called Robin Hood tax on shares and derivatives, but five years later that agreement remains elusive and some countries have dropped out. Meanwhile, European diplomats bemoan the lack of leadership from capitals that hampers the EU reform agenda, from strengthening the eurozone to overhauling asylum policy. Wolff said the eurozone debate had been \u201cbasically stuck\u201d for at least five years. \u201cIt remains very, very small steps if at all. We will see only a change when the next big crisis happens; then decisions will be taken. But in the absence of a serious crisis, there is no leadership across Europe to agree.\u201d \u2022 The manifesto is published by the Guardian, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, La Vanguardia, Gazeta Wyborcza, La Repubblica and Politiken \u2022 This article was amended on 10 December 2018.

A small beetle was devouring large swathes of the region\u2019s valuable pine forests, leaving millions of trees dead as infestation spread. The government waited anxiously for cold winters \u2013 which would kill the beetles \u2013 but year after year the cold never came. By 2008 the decimation of the forests, along with a series of intense storms walloping the province, prompted British Columbia to take action on climate change. The provincial government introduced a carbon tax, putting a price on fossil fuel emissions. And, crucially, all the money raised was returned to the people in tax cuts. \u201cIt was groundbreaking,\u201d said Karen Tam Wu of the Pembina Institute, an environmental thinktank. \u201cIt was the first one in the world that was revenue neutral.\u201d A decade later, as climate scientists and policymakers converge on UN talks in Katowice, Poland, urgently seek mechanisms to rein in carbon emissions in a bid to halt the inexorable rise of global temperatures, the British Columbia experiment with the tax is setting an example to others. Economists and environmentalists have voiced support for it; the World Bank has called it a \u201ctextbook\u201d way of developing environmental policy. Earlier in October, the economist William Nordhaus, winner of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize for economics, threw his support behind the British Columbia model as an ideal model for export to other economies. British Columbia is a province known for its environmental lean: yoga and hiking are the region\u2019s main cultural exports. For many Canadians, it seems fitting that the continent\u2019s most progressive carbon tax would originate amid mountains, surf and forest. But the man who helped to usher it in, the former premier Gordon Campbell, rejects the notion that love for the environment is unique to the region. \u201cIf you talk to people in rural communities, in urban communities, in Ontario or Alberta, and they all care about the environment,\u201d Campbell told the Guardian. \u201cThey all want to go to pristine places.\u201d Troubled by the compounding effects of climate change he saw both at home and abroad, Campbell and his government believed a carbon tax represented the most effective way to address the problem \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t a time to point fingers. \u201cAre we willing to do something to try to stop [climate change] from taking place, to slow it down?\u201d he said. \u201cEven for people who say: \u2018It wouldn\u2019t matter, Canada could have all of the emissions in the world and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\u2019 That\u2019s not the point. We should do our bit.\u201d The carbon tax isn\u2019t anything new. The world\u2019s best known carbon tax to carry that name began in the European Union in 2005, with the Emissions Trading System. With initial success the price of pollution permits reached more than \u20ac20 ($22/\u00a318) for the right to emit a ton of carbon. But heavy lobbying by industry led to a massive oversupply of permits and a price crash to \u20ac3 in 2013 \u2013 far too low to drive carbon cuts. Reforms have taken the price back above \u20ac20 in recent weeks. China has seen the attraction of carbon markets as an efficient way of delivering the biggest carbon cuts at the lowest cost. Its carbon market is being established and will, on completion, be the world\u2019s biggest. In the world\u2019s second biggest polluter, the US, 10 east coast states have had a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system for carbon emissions since 2009, under which companies have their greenhouse gas emissions capped and then must trade any surplus or deficit with others. But Barack Obama, while president, was unable to pass a nationwide system. Some prominent Republicans have backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax, but with little success. Many fossil fuel companies claim to back carbon taxes, notably in Australia, where climate policy rows have toppled prime ministers. The oil giant BP is among the supporters of carbon taxes, yet recently spent $13m (\u00a310.22m) in helping to defeat a proposal in Washington state. In the rest of Canada, despite the success story in British Columbia, other provinces are dragging their heels. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has legislated to impose a carbon levy on reluctant provinces, generating a storm of opposition. Ontario\u2019s premier Doug Ford, who recently repealed the province\u2019s carbon tax, has called it \u201cthe worst tax ever\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word,\u201d said Wu. \u201cIt\u2019s really a key tool in the toolkit to incentivise the transition to a low carbon economy and curb carbon pollution. In British Columbia, it has definitely worked.\u201d Nonetheless, the outlook for carbon taxes looks bright: 88 nations, representing more than half of global emissions, say they are or will uses carbon pricing to tackle climate change. Furthermore, some states have suggested they would impose carbon border levies on imported goods from nations that do not tax carbon. By design, the British Columbia plan was simple: it slapped a tax on any fossil fuels used for heating, electricity and transportation. Each person and business was expected to shoulder the burden of pricing pollution; no loopholes, no exemptions. In everyday life prices ticked up, most noticeably at the gas pump. Companies with emissions-intensive work passed their increased costs on to consumers. But the critical selling point of the plan \u2013 the tax\u2019s revenue neutral design \u2013 was unprecedented. With a revenue-neutral tax, the government keeps none of the money collected from the levy. Instead, it redistributes all of it \u2013 close to $1.8bn in its first three years \u2013 back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts. As a result, the increase in energy costs for residents was offset by a tax cut of roughly equal value. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour to reduce emissions would end up in the black. \u201cThe nice thing about the revenue-neutral carbon tax was that it didn\u2019t judge people: if you want to buy something that emits more than somebody else, you\u2019re going to pay more tax,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cPeople who wanted to have their taxes actually reduced had to change a little bit of their behaviour, and their tax load would have been reduced.\u201d Low-income residents, as well as those living in rural areas that relied more heavily on fossil fuels, received extra tax and cash benefits. The tax began as a $10/ton levy on carbon emissions, eventually reaching $30/ton by 2012. In speeches touting the tax, Campbell said the reduction in emissions would equate to removing 750,000 cars from the road in the province. The move \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 placated both conservative economists and environmentalists. And, it worked. \u201cWe saw fossil fuel consumption decrease by more than 17% and in the rest of Canada fuel consumption increased by more than 1%,\u201d Wu said of the four-year period between 2008 and 2012, when the first tranche of increases went into effect. Fears that the tax would have a negative impact on the economy quickly melted away when the numbers came in, she said. The province grew its economy by 16%, far outpacing any other region of the country. \u201cIt was leading edge at the time,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, 11 years later, it\u2019s still leading edge.\u201d By 2012, when the tax reached its first maximum level ($30 per ton), 64% of the population supported it. By 2016, it garnered the support of nearly 70% of residents. In Victoria, the province\u2019s capital, residents remain unfazed over the constant increases \u2013 a testament of how the tax has drifted into the background. Devon Crosby, who has worked in the oil and gas industry for much of his career, said he has little patience for the current feud across the country. \u201cLook, I\u2019d rather pay an extra 15% on gas for a cleaner and nicer British Columbia.\u201d For others, the tax cuts outweigh any increased costs. \u201cMoney talks,\u201d said resident Kim Hollingsworth. \u201cPeople need incentives to change their behaviour.\u201d She based her decision to buy a new, more energy efficient heater on the climate rebates \u2013 part of the suite of climate policies Campbell introduced. The revenue-neutral aspect of the tax is novel but has frustrated some environmental groups, who feel the tax does not do enough to reduce emissions. Others felt it was too onerous: between 2012 and 2016 Campbell\u2019s successor as premier, Christy Clark, froze the tax and repealed a number of environmental policies. \u201cWhen the carbon tax was frozen, we saw emissions go back up,\u201d said Wu. By 2021, the tax is slated to reach $50/ton, but the current British Columbia government is examining modifying the revenue-neutral aspect of the programme in order to allocate funding for green infrastructure, deviating from its original revenue neutrality \u2013 a move Campbell feels defeats the purpose of the tax in the first place: \u201cI\u2019m not happy when we say it\u2019s going to be revenue-neutral carbon tax and it isn\u2019t really. Don\u2019t play that game with people.\u201d He remains optimistic that the current feud in the country will dissipate over time. Too many people, he says, are on the defensive, feeling the problems of climate change are not directly their fault. \u201cI think the relevant question is: are we willing to do something about it when it\u2019s happening?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can help, are we willing to?\u201d Figured out The numbers that are fuelling international concerns about global warming and climate change are stark. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by a third over the past 100 years, to more than 400 parts per million. That has happened as a result of sharp rises in annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which have roughly doubled since 1971, to 53.5m tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. (CO2 from industrial processes and from forestry and other land uses makes up about three quarters of greenhouse gases; methane comprises another 16% and nitrous oxide about 6%). Annual global emissions flatlined for three years from 2014-2016, but rose sharply again last year. Meanwhile, over the past century, average global temperatures have risen more than 1C. The one bit of good news is the exponential rise in renewable power supplies, which have surged over the past 20 years to comprise more than 8% of global electricity generation. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, signatories are supposed to rein in carbon emissions so as to keep global temperatures from rising to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the 1.5C threshold is now looming, mechanisms for implementing Paris are still weak, and many observers are predicting that rises of 3C or more are now far more likely by the second half of this century.

Behind him is an impenetrable tangle of undergrowth, self-seeded trees and what looks like the long-discarded parts of an a vehicle. \u201cThe old path went up here,\u201d he says, waving his walking pole further into the thicket. \u201cI first spotted it on Milne\u2019s county map of Hampshire from 1791.\u201d Howland emerges from the nettles and shows me an image on his phone which confirms his suspicions: we have just found one of Britain\u2019s missing footpaths. \u201cThis is Greenwood\u2019s 1826 county map and you can see the path. It was called the Markway and goes straight up to this line \u2013 now the A30 road. But compare that with the current Ordnance Survey map.\u201d He unfolds a paper map and points to our position. \u201cInstead of going straight, the footpath turns hard left at this point and heads back towards Andover. What we have here is a missing mile to a forgotten right of way \u2013 and a very useful missing mile, because it links to other footpaths.\u201d England and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but there are an estimated 10,000 more that have been lost from current maps. Even that figure looks like a huge underestimate: a recent survey in Cornwall alone identified 3,000 possible paths that had fallen out of use and needed to be checked. That work of rediscovery is being done by volunteers, people such as Howland, who has so far made 85 legal applications for the recovery of lost paths in a small corner of Hampshire. A government deadline of 2026 for such claims has given Howland\u2019s work a renewed sense of urgency. \u201cIt sounds like plenty of time, but I reckon that in our area we\u2019d need to make two applications every week until 2026. There is just so much to be done.\u201d As a walker, I reflect, I\u2019m used to losing my way. It\u2019s a bit alarming, however, to find that paths can get lost, too. Howland chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s easier than you think.\u201d We give up any attempt to force a way through the bushes and set off up the path to the left. Two deer watch us warily from a stubble field and the giant white dish of a radio telescope appears to hover on the horizon as we catch up with a group from the Ramblers, among them Jack Cornish, project manager for the nationwide campaign Don\u2019t Lose Your Way. He explains how government legislation in 1949 ruled that every council should draw a definitive map of footpaths and bridleways, a laudable aim, but one carried out piecemeal. \u201cSome parishes recorded hundreds of paths, others did almost nothing. You ended up with footpaths that led nowhere or simply disappeared.\u201d Once those paths failed to appear on OS maps, people stopped walking them. The nettles grew, the ash and sycamore seeds blew in and, within a few years, they were invisible. If a housing estate or a major road then appeared, that path was truly lost. And it did not only happen in the countryside. The Open Spaces Society has pointed out that urban areas were often exempt from the 1949 regulations and produced no definitive maps, leaving footpaths in cities and towns particularly under threat. Howland has a rough estimate of losses from his own experience. \u201cIn my area I expect an annual loss of half a percent \u2013 mostly from new buildings and roads.\u201d \u201cThose missing paths can be the vital element in a good circular walk, or access to great countryside.\u201d \u201cThese are ancient rights of way,\u201d Cornish adds. \u201cRights built up over centuries. And it\u2019s not just about walkers: cyclists and horse riders need them, too.\u201d We reach a sign \u2013 \u201cPrivate road, access only\u201d \u2013 and ignore it. \u201cIt\u2019s a public bridleway,\u201d says Howland, reassuringly. One of the ramblers finds a sign lost in the undergrowth and, producing a pair of secateurs, quickly makes it visible again. Walking with Howland is to see the British landscape through a fresh pair of eyes. Where I see walls of thorny bushes, he sees a double hedge hiding an ancient drovers\u2019 path; where I see neat white posts at the entrance to someone\u2019s drive, Howland sees a devious attempt to gull the public into believing they are on private land; most of all, where I see cul-de-sacs and dead ends, he spots opportunities to discover lost routes. He reads the landscape like a detective, building the physical elements into narratives of growth and change. He shows me a patch of land on his OS map called Bransbury Common that was declared open-access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Almost surrounded by a chalk stream, it was both biologically important and a local beauty spot. For as long as it has been an open-access area, the two bridges that once allowed entry have been unusable. They have never been replaced. \u201cThe public have the right to be on Bransbury Common,\u201d says Howland. \u201cBut getting there is harder.\u201d He has seen abandoned railways, used as footpaths and recorded as such on OS maps, summarily closed when new owners arrive. In other places, agricultural schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship demand that landowners open up paths in return for payments. When the schemes finish, these \u201cpermissive\u201d paths can disappear overnight. On other occasions, new owners simply don\u2019t understand local traditions. In October 2016, for example, villagers in Bratton, in Wiltshire, were astonished to find a traditional riverside path through watercress beds blocked by barbed wire and \u201cprivate property\u201d signs. A London property dealer had bought the local mill and erected the barriers. It took a two-year court battle to establish that the path was a legal right of way. \u201cThere are two ways to recover a lost path,\u201d Cornish says. \u201cBy proving regular public use over a 20-year period without any attempt to prevent access by a landowner, and by detective work on historical maps.\u201d What about the Markway, I ask. How did that disappear? \u201cAlmost by accident.\u201d Howland says. \u201cIn the second world war, a Hurricane fighter base was built here and the path temporarily blocked. That order was not rescinded until 1956. By then it was too late: the last mile of the route had got overgrown and forgotten.\u201d If not for Howland, this right of way would have permanently disappeared. We stop talking to stroll along a short section of busy road, before turning once again on to a path where spindle flowers gleam like nubs of coral in the hedge. A kestrel cuts away across the field, glorying in its freedom. We come eventually into the pretty thatched village of Chilbolton and, in the way of all good country walks, reach a pub. Over a bowl of hot soup, Howland shows me the paperwork that each Definitive Map Modification Order entails. \u201cIt does take hours of work, but a lot of the information and maps are now online. The National Library of Scotland website is particularly useful. You don\u2019t need to be spending days in the National Archives at Kew, interesting as that would be.\u201d The campaign has put pressure on under-resourced local councils. Hampshire\u2019s executive member for rural affairs, Edward Heron, pointed out to me that Hampshire has seen a rise in applications from five a year to 35. \u201cWe expect that these increases will continue until the closure date of 2026.\u201d The good news is that any application submitted by the 2026 deadline will, eventually, go through the legal process of assessment and consultation. Meanwhile Howland is planning more routes. His diffident manner masks a steely determination, and he clearly likes the elements of research and historical analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s given me a better understanding of how the landscape changes and develops.\u201d In theory, that research could go back to the era of Richard I. His reign, which began on 4 July 1189, is the beginning of legal time. In practice, many rights of way date back to the enclosure acts of 1750 to 1850. Either way the sense of a long game being played is palpable and Howland knows it. \u201cA restored right of way will usually last for ever.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many tasks in life that you can say that about.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Four experimental drugs are starting to be used as part of a groundbreaking trial under extremely difficult conditions in an outbreak in conflict-ridden eastern DRC. But, says Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases expert and the director of the Wellcome Trust, any data gleaned from the use of those drugs will be put together with evidence from future outbreaks in a five-year programme that may lead to effective and licensed treatments. That could take Ebola out of the isolation units where patients are cared for by nurses in masks and allow them to be looked after at home. \u201cYou could turn Ebola from something that really is feared and horrific in communities to something that is preventable and treatable,\u201d Farrar said, adding that if a drug could be produced in pill or injection form \u201cyou could start thinking about home care\u201d. And if it could be done for Ebola, he said, the model could be used to find treatments for other diseases such as Nipah and Lassa fever that also manifest in sudden lethal outbreaks. A blueprint for a five-year programme to trial drugs against Ebola is close to being signed off by the World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health in the US, the Department for International Development in the UK, the Wellcome Trust, the pharmaceutical companies making the drugs, as well as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), organisations running field clinics. Farrar, who is chair of the WHO scientific advisory group, said: \u201cWe need to move away from seeing these as discrete episodes \u2013 DRC in 2018 and then it stops. Then maybe Uganda in 2020 and it starts again. The plan in place would be essentially to say this is a five-year programme: multi-epidemic, multi-country, multi-partner. The world tends to make drug trials really complicated. They are really simple. You have a protocol, people give consent and you randomise them.\u201d The design will be adaptive, so if another drug comes along or one of those in the trial is found not to be working at all, they can be brought in or ruled out. This sort of flexibility is a new approach. Most trials are designed around the information drug regulators require to license a new treatment. During the west Africa outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the US Food and Drug Administration argued that a placebo would need to be included in trials to establish how well any drug worked. Other experts and doctors in the field refused to accept this, saying it would be unethical to give drugs to some Ebola patients and nothing to others. That argument has now been buried. In the DRC, the four drugs to be trialled will be randomly given to patients and information collected on how well they work in reducing the death rate compared with each other. ZMapp, which was used in west Africa, is one of them. The others are mAb114, Regeneron\u2019s Regn-EB3 and remdesivir. Patients have already been given some of these drugs on a compassionate basis. The trial is beginning in record time. Researchers from Oxford University\u2019s centre for tropical medicine and global health finally managed to launch a trial in Liberia in January 2015, after five months of negotiations over the ethics and how it should run. By the time it began, the epidemic had waned to the point where there were not enough cases to show whether the drug they had chosen, called brincidofovir, actually saved lives, and the manufacturer withdrew it. The drug and vaccine trials in that huge outbreak had changed people\u2019s thinking, said Farrar. \u201cThe biggest thing out of [the west Africa outbreak] was acceptance by everybody that research is an integral part of the response. That was hugely controversial. It is now mainstream. \u201cAlso there was a success story: 35,000 or 36,000 people have now been vaccinated. The commonsense view is that it is the reason why this epidemic has not gone horribly wrong so far.\u201d One of the vaccines used in Guinea, made by Merck, is now being deployed in DRC to immunise a \u201cring\u201d of contacts of any person who becomes ill. to immunise a \u201cring\u201d of contacts of any person who becomes ill. Everyone in the family and neighbourhood is offered the vaccine. In a departure from that protocol, neighbouring Uganda, where it is feared Ebola may spread, has vaccinated about 2,000 healthcare workers. When outbreaks happen out of the blue, they take a toll of nurses and doctors who are the first in contact with the sick and are unprotected. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop Ebola. We all know that. There is an animal reservoir. To stop the initial outbreaks is impossible,\u201d said Farrar. But vaccination, if it works, \u201cwill stop the tragedy of healthcare workers dying\u201d. And if the novel plan for trials of drug treatments is successful, it could take the terror out of this and possibly, in the future, other infectious diseases as well.

Treatment has improved dramatically over the past 20 years, but people who are infected will remain so for the rest of their lives, and must take one pill daily \u2013 at one time it was a cocktail of 30. But now, as another World Aids Day pulls into view, scientists are beginning to ask if the biggest breakthrough \u2013 an out-and-out cure for the tens of millions who have contracted the virus \u2013 could be in sight. The excitement lies in research that is having some success in drawing the virus out of a latent stage (in which it can lie undetected for long periods) so that it could be destroyed. \u201cThe last couple of years have been very exciting on this front,\u201d said Satish Pillai, an associate professor in HIV research from the University of California San Francisco. \u201cWe\u2019re now attempting find the holy grail of HIV research.\u201d \u201cIn the first instance, we want to identify the signature characteristics, in a reliable and accurate way, of latently infected cells,\u201d Pillai said, speaking of HIV-infected cells that evade current treatments. \u201cThe other side is that we\u2019re developing novel strategies to destroy them once we\u2019re able to identify them.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re entering this new era of finding a functional cure to eradicate the virus,\u2019 he explains. The difficulty in dealing once and for all with HIV is that, unlike other viruses, HIV-infected cells are able to \u201chide\u201d by entering a resting phase that makes them invisible to our immune system and current treatment therapies. These \u2018latently infected\u2019 cells then exist in reservoirs in the bodies of those with the virus, and can launch new, resistant attacks if treatment is discontinued. Over the last few years, scientists have determined that destroying this last reservoir of cells will be the future of a cure. \u201cPeople have been looking into latency long before this became a focus for a cure,\u201d said Dr Jonathan Angel, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. \u201cThere have been people working on HIV research for a long time, but only recently has the tone shifted.\u2019 \u201cIn my personal opinion, our therapies have become so good that looking at better therapies has become futile. People are taking a pill once a day with no side affects. That\u2019s hard to improve upon.\u201d In fact, the increased efficacy of antiretrovirals has curbed the deadliness of the disease significantly. The virus exists in around 36.7 million people around the world and, although it killed around 1 million people in 2017 according to UNAids, that represents a drop of almost 50% from 2005, when mortality from Aids-related illnesses was at its peak. This drop is due to improved medicine, as well as logistics and patient awareness. But the virus remains a grave health problem in rural areas that lack these resources, especially in regions such as Africa \u2013 more than a quarter of people in Swaziland have the virus. The deadliness of the disease in some regions, the tremendous expense and the pressure on patients, means that a cure remains an important goal. There are a number of different approaches currently being studied. One approach, often named the \u201ckick and kill\u201d or \u201cshock and kill\u201d, aims to kick the resting cells out of their sleep so they can be pinpointed and eliminated. Sarah Fidler, professor of HIV medicine at Imperial College London, who recently led a major study testing the efficacy of the kick and kill method said: \u201cThe idea is to reactivate the latent cells so they start producing the proteins on their surface so they look different from healthy cells. We would do this with some kind of drug, which is what we\u2019re in the process of determining.\u201d The other research approach wants to find and destroy the HIV-infected cells while they\u2019re still in the resting state. The key to doing this would be finding something distinct about an infected, resting cell \u2013 as opposed to a healthy one \u2013 so that an antiviral agent can target them. Scientists call this elusive target a biomarker. There is promising work being done with antiviral-viruses \u2013 viruses that are engineered to target and destroy other viruses. A specific strain, the rhabdovirus called Maraba virus (MG1), has been engineered to seek out faulty cell communication, something that happens in both cancer and HIV. A difference as small as this, between healthy and unhealthy cells, is enough for something like MG1 to target. Angel says the MG1 approach only occurred because of the physical proximity of scientists researching cancer and HIV. \u201cThe MG1 project came up on the side from being on the same floor as oncology, and seeing seminars from guys in cancer research,\u201d Angel said. \u201cThere are viruses that are able to kill cancer cells based on the fact that they have impaired interferon signalling [proteins made by cells to prevent virus replication]. This is an innate antiviral molecule, present in all of our cells to ward off viruses. \u201cWe know that HIV can interfere with those pathways, but what is not known is whether that is the case with latently infected cells, because they occur with such a low frequency in the body. \u201cMG1 as a potential therapeutic agent that can exploit these cells.\u201d Although there is consensus that destroying the virus reservoirs is the next step, there are disagreements about whether this could be properly called a cure, as we understand the term. \u201cCompletely eliminating the reservoirs of HIV would result in a cure. The dissension might exist on what is referred to as a \u2018functional cure\u2019,\u201d Angel said. \u201cThis refers to establishing a state where the immune system itself (without antiretroviral therapy) can control the virus so it is not detectable in the blood and there is no effect on the immune system. \u201cWhile the scientific community might consider this a cure, the general public might not,\u201d he said. The speed of the research has been made possible because of the advocacy community that stands behind it, says Fidler. \u201cWe are talking about a community of people with HIV that have been an extraordinary driver in researching the condition,\u2019she said. \u201cIn our most recent trial, no-one dropped out, which is practically unheard of.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s still a very stigmatising condition. People don\u2019t feel comfortable with talking about it, as they might with diabetes or cancer,\u201d Fidler said. \u201cI think it motivates this collaboration. People still feel that they are somehow different and that\u2019s what makes people join together, they relate to these other people who have the virus. They are a potent advocacy force.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Yet there are no rows of scientists and flight controllers wearing headsets, all of their faces fixed on a large screen charting spacecraft. And no astronauts telling them they have a problem. Instead, three large computer screens display a world map showing a satellite, roughly the size of a large shoebox, orbiting the globe. It is one of many private autonomous \u201cspace labs\u201d conducting experiments for paying clients including pharmaceutical firms, universities and chemical companies. This is the new frontier of space exploration and research. Enormous, slow-moving government agencies such as Nasa no longer have a monopoly. The sector has commercialised, making room for large aerospace companies including SpaceX and Boeing, but also plucky startups exploiting increasingly cheaper access to the heavens. The one in Israel, SpacePharma, is attempting to tap into one emerging space industry: microgravity experimentation. At the core of what it provides is the ability to run tests in a situation that is currently impossible to replicate on the planet \u2013 a zero gravity, or very close to zero gravity, environment. And without gravity, an unavoidable constant that has forever restricted every experiment, a new field of science is promising breakthroughs. \u201cIn space, everything is different,\u201d said Yair Glick, the research and development director at SpacePharma. Almost nothing \u2013 chemicals, plants and even human cells \u2013 behave the same in microgravity as they do on Earth. Even the most simple experiment produces new results: \u201cIf we mix water with oil, we know the water goes down and the oil. Not so in space,\u201d said Glick. National space agencies have been conducting microgravity research for decades, often on the effects of muscles and bones of astronauts, but also on how it affects other elements, for example, flames \u2013 they don\u2019t flicker upwards but instead form a ball. The results have been astonishing. One experiment conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency looked at the proteins associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which primarily affects young boys and leaves them immobile. Proteins, the building blocks of cells, crystallise differently in space as they are unburdened by the Earth\u2019s pull and form in a more orderly way. Researchers were able to record their new structure and make medicine that drastically delays the effects of the disease. Its creators claim it could potentially double the lifespan of patients and keep them walking until 25, instead of 12. Rich Godwin runs the US firm Space Technology Holding, which takes research done in space and applies it to the real-world market. Commercial microgravity testing is a potentially huge market, he believes, and expects more big successes as it privatises. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing chemistry. It\u2019s changing physics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the invention of the microscope.\u201d Yossi Yamin, the chief executive and founder of SpacePharma, estimates there are about 30 private companies selling microgravity experiments. There are three main ways to do it. The first can be done on Earth by renting a plane and nosediving in parabolic flight, simulating weightlessness. But the process is extremely imprecise and only lasts a few seconds. Most companies instead rent space 250 miles up on the International Space Station, which acts as a sort of real estate agent for low Earth orbit. They make small automatic laboratories that are sent up on a rocket, often when astronauts are delivered, and are plugged into the wall. In these, liquids can be heated, cooled, and tiny automatic pumps allow customers to mix chemicals. SpacePharma also provides free-roaming satellites, which orbit the Earth independently. Its first was sent up on an Indian rocket in 2017. In the small office in Herzliya, a city that is the tech hub of Israel, the nanosatellites are handmade, in a lab with a plastic 3D printer and a soldering table. \u201cIf you have autonomous mobile units, you can command and control it from your mobile,\u201d said Yamin, who worked for the Israeli army\u2019s satellite fleet for 25 years. Each satellite costs about \u00a32.4m but has enough space for 12 clients, whose experiments can run concurrently, dramatically lowering the cost. The commercial space research business is worth about half a billion, he estimates. But he is betting on a market boom. Pharmaceutical companies are looking at creating drugs in space that are more effective than those made on Earth. Once these more-perfect proteins are formed, they can be used as \u201cseeds\u201d to duplicate back on Earth. \u201cThese are masterpieces created in orbit,\u201d Yamin said. The next stage in the field of microgravity, industry insiders believe, will be \u201cspace factories\u201d where materials that can only be made in space are manufactured. Twyman Clements, the chief executive of Space Tango, a US firm that began launches last year and has conducted 88 experiments in space, including one commissioned by Budweiser on barley and another that looked at how cannabis reacts in space. But now it is moving into making products in space and bringing them back. \u201cThis is not just about research. It has scalable application,\u201d said Clements, who grew up on a farm in Kentucky and made his own rockets. \u201cWe look at high-value products made in microgravity for Earth,\u201d he said. They need to have a high price tag because it costs so much to send material up and down. There are already customers looking to make fibre optic cables, which are more efficient when manufactured in space. And another product that could be produced in orbit are retinal implants to restore vision, which are made from light-activated proteins but do not form well on Earth under their own weight. Space Tango is looking at how it could make them in space. \u201cThe next steps are toward production,\u201d said Clements. \u201cThat has not happened quite yet. The retinal impacts could be the first.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Outside the front door, an elderly woman raking fallen leaves welcomed him like a long-lost friend. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see the postman as I don\u2019t usually see anyone else all week,\u201d said Janine, 81, as Dezeure handed her a tax bill and an envelope addressed to her husband who died several years ago. She ushered him into her kitchen for a chat. A rural postman politely checking on a lonely elderly person might seem a natural part of French countryside life. But Dezeure\u2019s carefully planned visits to Janine each Monday morning are part of a new strategy for the French post office as it tries to find a joint solution to two very different challenges; the growing number of elderly people living alone; and a decline in letter-writing in the digital era, which means France is looking for new ways to make a profit from its 73,000 postal workers. In 1990, delivering letters accounted for 70% of the state post service\u2019s turnover; in 2020 it will be less than 20%. The new service in which customers pay for postal workers to check on their elderly relatives during morning rounds has been hailed as a clever solution to the modern epidemic of loneliness. But some trade unionists have cautioned that people should not have to pay for something that used to happen informally for free. La Poste, France\u2019s publicly owned postal service, says it is using its extensive presence in every corner of France to bring new services to elderly people in isolated areas. The service, Watch over my parents (Veiller sur mes parents), was launched last year. Customers \u2013 often in their 50s and living in major cities \u2013 pay from \u20ac20 (\u00a318) a month for postal workers to visit their parents living alone far away. Visits can be weekly or more regular, with a report delivered to the family and an option of a 24-hour helpline and alert system. About 6,000 elderly people are currently availing of the service \u2013 the average age is 82, the oldest is 98. In Janine\u2019s kitchen, with her neat display of copper pots and china teapots, Dezeure, 37, who has been a postal worker for 16 years, carried an official list of questions for small talk, including: \u201cWhat did you watch on TV last night?\u201d But he has got to know Janine quite well in their 15-minute chats each Monday, so he improvises. \u201cIn any case I don\u2019t watch TV,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I did watch Out of Africa on DVD last night.\u201d Dezeure said: \u201cShe knows loads about me. We talk about my days playing rugby, my aching shoulders, knees ... \u201d After the chat, he sent a message straight to Janine\u2019s two daughters, in their 50s, who live more than 370 miles (600km) away in the Paris area, telling them she was OK. \u201cI agreed to do this for my daughters,\u201d Janine said. \u201cThey worry that I\u2019m on my own in the middle of nowhere.\u201d Her package includes a 24-hour helpline and an alert system if she has a problem. \u201cI used to boast I never went to the doctor, but then I had a fall recently. I feel more secure this way.\u201d She has lived for 40 years in the same house, built by her husband, and never wants to move away from the secluded spot. \u201cThe radio is a marvellous companion,\u201d she said. \u201cMy motto is: \u2018Turn the radio on, fill the house with sound.\u2019\u201d Dezeure sees the human link with customers as one of the best parts of his job. He grew up in this corner of the Vaucluse in southern France and his own grandparents, in their 80s, live on his delivery route. \u201cThe postman is a key figure. People come up to you in the street. We\u2019re always there at the same time of day. People virtually set their watch by us, saying: \u2018Ah that\u2019s the postman, it must be time for lunch.\u2019\u201d Eric Baudrillard, in charge of developing new strategy at the French postal service, said: \u201cNo other postal service in the world has done what we\u2019re doing for elderly people. We\u2019re pioneers on this. People are living longer, and more of them want to stay in their own homes as long as they can. We know there will be more need for social links like this as mobility grows and adult children move far from their ageing parents. Despite all the digital tools that we have, there is still a need for human connection.\u201d He denied that the French post office was cashing in on friendly gestures that postal workers had been doing for years for free. \u201cPostal workers always spontaneously and informally connected with clients and looked out for them, and that will continue. But what we\u2019re doing is adding new services and bringing greater value.\u201d Other schemes have already been rolled out \u2013 postal workers in France can deliver elderly customers supplies from shops, basic prescriptions, books from libraries and hot meals \u2013 though they are paid for by local councils. This week La Poste began offering a service delivering elderly people a regular printout of photos and messages from relatives, which it described as \u201ca kind of Facebook on paper\u201d. Pascal Fr\u00e9mont, from the Sud trade union, who was a postal worker in Loire-Atlantique for 15 years, said he had reservations about the post office capitalising on the silver economy. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not a problem for postal workers to keep an eye on older people, because many of us already did that. But if it is a paid-for service, that excludes some people who can\u2019t afford it, and affects the notion of public service. We would prefer partnerships, such as with the health ministry. And we\u2019d prefer for any support of the elderly to be funded by the price of stamps. Also, postal workers aren\u2019t healthcare staff, so we should be cautious about that.\u201d Yves Lecouturier, a former postal worker who ran a postal museum in Caen, Normandy, said: \u201cThe social link between postmen and postwomen and the population always existed in France. In the late 1970s, we delivered Monday to Saturday and I remember some older people in remote rural locations subscribed to a daily newspaper just so the postman would come round to deliver it \u2013 that would be the only person they saw.\u201d As Dezeure left to continue his morning\u2019s round, Janine said: \u201cI want to stay living at home and I appreciate my adult children want to know I\u2019m OK. It\u2019s pleasant to see the postman for a regular chat, and what choice do I have? It\u2019s this or leave my home.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Now, a Ukrainian bank is offering better rates of interest to customers who prove they are taking 10,000 steps every day, as part of efforts to make its clientele not just richer, but healthier at the same time. Monobank, a rapidly growing bank which has signed up more than half a million customers in just over a year, has offered the variable rate to about 1,500 savers on its mobile platform. It works like this: customers use a smartphone health app to monitor their physical activity. Monobank accesses the data on a daily basis. People who manage the 10,000 steps are granted a rate of 21% on their savings. Anyone who fails to walk the walk for three days in a row will see their rate slump to 11%. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to look fitter pretty soon,\u201d says Alexey Drozdov as he marches through another chilly Kiev evening to clock up the mileage. \u201cThey say, \u2018I bet you can\u2019t do it every day.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll prove you wrong.\u2019 \u201cNormally, a deposit only makes you happy at the end of a period; with this one, you can enjoy it every day because you get to show yourself that you have the guts to keep on going.\u201d The concept was devised by Monobank\u2019s three CEOs, Dima Dubilet, Misha Rogalskiy and Oleg Gorokhovsky, in an effort to aid both personal and national economic wellbeing and address obesity-related health problems. Ukraine has the second highest death rate from coronary heart disease in the world at 395.73 per 100,000; almost 50% of men are predicted to be obese by 2030. \u201cEveryone knows exercise is important but life often gets in the way,\u201d said Dubilet. \u201cIf our sports deposit account gets people exercising more, that can only be a good thing \u2013 for our account holders and for Monobank.\u201d There were some early concerns about customers gaming the system \u2013 particularly when some users hit their 10,000 steps more quickly than humanly possible. Bank officials quickly discovered that products were being sold to help run up the 10,000 steps without human involvement. The offenders were punished with an immediate relegation to the lowest interest rate.

Earl Forlales, 23, a graduate in material science engineering, took inspiration from the bamboo hut his grandparents lived in outside Manilla. Forlales was awarded first prize by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) for his house, known as Cubo, for its use of low-cost, sustainable material, and the speed at which it could be constructed. John Hughes, the competition head judge and Rics president, said: \u201cThe world\u2019s cities are growing all the time and there is a real need to make sure they are safe, clean and comfortable places to live for future generations. \u201cThere were many exciting, original designs among the submissions. However, Earl\u2019s idea stood out for its simple yet well thought through solution to the world\u2019s growing slum problem. \u201cAs we look at our entrants, who are our next generation of leaders, I believe that real progress will be made in tackling the world\u2019s biggest issues.\u201d Forlales\u2019s house could be manufactured in a week, constructed in four hours and costs \u00a360 per square metre. Its use of bamboo \u2013 which releases 35% more oxygen into the environment than trees \u2013 was praised by the judges. The ability of the houses to be constructed in any bamboo-producing area was one of the key attractions. Forlales has already identified a suitable area of land to start building his Cubo houses. He plans to begin work next year with experts from the Rics in an attempt to help relieve the huge pressures on housing in Manila, where a third of the 12 million population live in slums. He said: \u201cThis is a huge step forward to helping the people of Manila. The state of housing in the city is at crisis point, and will undoubtedly get worse with this new influx of workers. \u201cCubo started as nothing more than an idea, conceived while spending time at my grandparent\u2019s house \u2013 it is incredible to think that it now will become a reality. \u201cI would like to thank Rics for the opportunity to develop the idea, and look forward to working with them to put this money to good use in Manila, and then hopefully elsewhere around the world.\u201d The Cities for our Future competition launched in January 2018 aiming to find practical solutions to problems that the world\u2019s cities face. There were more than 1,200 entries, which were narrowed down to 12 finalists, who were given a mentor from the Rics to help them develop their idea over several months. The final judging took place this month. Dr Beth Taylor, a competition judge and the chair of the UK National Commission for Unesco, said: \u201cOne of the reasons Earl\u2019s entry stood out from the other finalists was through its use of traditional, sustainable technologies and materials, to solve an issue facing modern cities across the world.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

His eyes reopen with a glimmer of excitement, tinged by a profound scowl of disapproval. All over Europe, every day, many thousands of people will perform this same ritual. Hundreds will do so, like J\u00f8rgen, in drug consumption rooms. But none of these will be in the UK, where drug addicts are mainly confined to back streets, crack houses and hostel bedrooms. While European overdose rates are falling, the UK now has the worst drug death rate across the continent: one in three of the approximate 8,000 people who die as a result of drugs in Europe will do so in Britain. It could all be very different. In Denmark, there has been no shortage of overdoses in the Skyen (Cloud) drug consumption room I visited \u2013 more than 800 at the last count. But no one has died. Drug-related deaths in the country have stabilised since 2011. In fact, there has never been a recorded death in any of the 78 drug consumption rooms in Europe. Why? Because nurses quickly administer antidotes and immediately resuscitate the person before calling an ambulance. Elsewhere, the death rate from opiate overdoses is about 6%. \u201cThese people are really sick, they cannot just suddenly stop taking drugs,\u201d says Anders Larsen, a social worker and chemist at Skyen, as he scrapes a small quantity of powdered heroin from under the microscope and into the bin after testing its purity. \u201cAll we can do is make it as safe as possible, and if they decide that they want to give up, then we will immediately direct them to addiction support services.\u201d At Skyen, visitors can get clean needles and are allowed 24-hour access. There had been fears the opening of a consumption room would increase the numbers of new drug users, but this has not happened. Rather it has transformed the fabric of Copenhagen\u2019s historic \u201copen drug scene\u201d. As many as 10,000 syringes were found every week on the streets of Vesterbro, the Danish capital\u2019s former meatpacking district, prior to the consumption room opening in 2012. That figure fell below 1,000 within a year, as drug-taking in the city\u2019s main hotspot \u2013 where users would formerly inject behind bins, in stairwells, and on the street \u2013 became largely shielded from public view. There are now five such medical facilities across the country, where drug addicts take cocaine and heroin as well as methadone, under clinical supervision. At Skyen, staff have overseen more than 7,500 people administer more than 1m fixes in six years. Their wraparound service delivers harm reduction and social work, in conjunction with the shelter next door, by providing assistance with housing applications and organising hospital appointments. Crucially, most of their visitors are extremely marginalised - \u201chard-to-reach, hard-to treat\u201d - and may never have any other contact with non-users, or officialdom. In the UK, pressure is growing on Westminster to allow the Scottish parliament permission to open a drug room in Glasgow, where overdoses are reaching unprecedented levels having quintupled in just 20 years. The government has repeatedly blocked any attempts to permit a Scottish exception, however, citing fears about the challenges the facility could pose to law enforcement agencies, and of the implied acceptance of wider criminality. In a statement, the Home Office said there was no legal framework for the provision of drug consumption rooms in the UK and that there were no plans to introduce them. A spokesperson stressed that drug dependency must be prevented through treatment and recovery. Such services, however, are in decline. An addiction service recently blamed the 26% rise in drug-related deaths in England between 2013 and 2016 on the 18% cut to treatment budgets in that time. \u201cDrug consumption rooms have operated across Europe for the last four decades and they have been proven to be effective at engaging some of those most marginalised in society, providing safe spaces for those who would previously have been injecting in a risky way in public places,\u201d says Niamh Eastwood, executive director of the drug information charity Release. \u201cDrug consumption rooms reduce the risk of fatal overdose, reduce public injecting, and increase access to health and treatment services for those with who have a history of problem drug use. \u201cThe only thing that stands in the way of the UK following the example of other European countries is the British government, who continuously state that they will not support drug consumption rooms despite the evidence and the fact they could save lives. It seems they are happy for the backstreets of our city and town centres to continue to provide such spaces.\u201d Although the government has acknowledged the potential public health benefits of consumption rooms, it would rather \u201csee our most vulnerable and desperate fellow citizens suffer and die for ideological reasons, than allow cities like Glasgow to open one\u201d, according to Martin Powell from Transform Drug Policy Foundation. \u201cEurope\u2019s overdose prevention centres have supervised millions of injections, and treated thousands of overdoses without a single death.\u201d Across Europe the legal status of injecting rooms differs. Germany and Switzerland changed the law to allow for drug consumption rooms. Spain did not need to because it does not criminalise personal possession. In France, the safe spaces (housed in public hospitals in Paris and Strasbourg) are more contentious because the country has some of the strictest narcotics laws in Europe. In Portugal, which is set to soon introduce consumption rooms, the decriminalisation of drug use caused a steep fall in the drug death rate which now stands at a 10th of that in the UK. Ireland and Belgium are also soon to introduce them too. In Denmark the provision of the service was sparked by a longstanding campaign led by residents and activists focused on improving public health that eventually gained the support of the majority of the wider population. In an act of civil disobedience on the day of the general election in 2011, a mobile facility in an ambulance run by volunteers in Copenhagen began offering a sterile space for drugs to be taken. \u201cIt was quite controversial at first and there was real tension,\u201d says Ivan Christensen, who now manages the men\u2019s shelter next door to Skyen. The volunteer social workers were waiting to be arrested, but nothing happened. Weeks later, the second-hand ambulance, known as Fixelance, parked in front of parliament to draw attention to the debate taking place inside: the first reading of a bill to establish consumption rooms. Some months later, the municipal government asked them to establish a fixed drug consumption room \u2013 which it has since funded \u2013 and a change to the law was passed in the summer of 2012 to allow individuals with severe problems to possess drugs for their own use, thus enabling such facilities to work within the law. A stationary facility was opened shortly after, and since then an even bigger consumption room has opened nearby, along with three others across Denmark. They are hectic places where minor disputes often erupt, yet workers and visitors snatch sanguine moments together where they bond over stories, meals and shared frustrations. Skyen visitors, who tend to buy their drugs locally, are allowed 35 minutes in the smoking room and 45 minutes in the injecting room. \u201cI take drugs to numb my pain,\u201d says a Muslim veteran of the Bosnian war, after inhaling heroin fumes in Skyen\u2019s smoking room. \u201cYou cannot begin to imagine what I have seen.\u201d Another tells me that he would otherwise be taking drugs on the streets. \u201cIt\u2019s more calm here, and I do not have to worry about being attacked,\u201d says an Afghan cocaine addict who fled the country after war began in 2001. \u201cHere I have dignity.\u201d A longtime heroin addict who was in care growing up in Denmark explains that visitors to Skyen are treated with \u201cempathy, not judgment\u201d, as he recalls his tumultuous life story. \u201cWe are not condemned, we are cared for,\u201d he says. \u201cThis place gives us greater control over our own destiny.\u201d Skyen\u2019s employees\u2019 views are shaped by their every day experience, watching people come and go, while committing crimes to fund their addiction which means they are in and out of prison. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of sending people to jail, where there are no harm reduction measures despite drugs being so easy to buy,\u201d says Larsen, sitting next to a man who has just taken a shot of heroin. \u201cPeople will scratch a needle on the floor to sharpen it so they can get their hit. I wish we could give them free, clean drugs. All this crime is for nothing, the proceeds go back into crime. The war on drugs is lost.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

It is a technique that coach Ghulam Abbas has taught students for more than 30 years, and one he dearly loves to see. \u201cI forget my troubles when a student takes the opportunity,\u201d says the 57-year-old coach of the Maiwand wrestling club in west Kabul. But he can no longer demonstrate the move. As he strolls among his 40 teenage students, grappling and grunting, his left sleeve hangs conspicuously loose over where his arm should be. Two months ago, Isis suicide bombers attacked the wrestling club. At around 6pm on 5 September, Abbas heard gunfire and a cry of \u201csuicider!\u201d. He charged to the door, slamming it shut onto the foot of the attacker, who promptly detonated a bomb held in a sports-bag. Another detonated a car-bomb just outside as help was arriving. It was only when Abbas regained consciousness in hospital that he realised his left arm had been severed in the explosion. In total, 30 people were killed and a further 50 wounded. \u201cBefore, I was very good at showing students the throws, but now I have to tell them to practise with other boys,\u201d says Abbas. \u201cThat has been very hard for me.\u201d At home, too, he has had to adapt. His wife helps him put on his left sock in the morning. \u201cWhen she was washing the carpet, I used to like to wash it with her,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I cannot.\u201d But Abbas never doubted he would return to the Maiwand wrestling club. While in hospital, hundreds of visitors showed up by his bedside, thanking the man who put their children on the right path \u2013 or, in the attack itself, saved their lives. Abbas paid for the repairs to the club building himself. A black scar still rings the wall where the entrance was. A patch of lighter paint marks the hole blown through it while yellow foam pokes through a patched up roof. He also kept fit waiting to come back: running, unsteadily at first, around the hospital grounds. Ten times in the morning, and ten at night, as soon as the wound stopped bleeding. His tenacity is paying off. Around half the usual 100 or so students are attending a free-practice session this Thursday, the beginning of the Afghan weekend, but the number, says Abbas, is growing. As students trickle in, a security guard frisks them lengthily at the gate of a newly-constructed entrance tunnel shielded by concrete bollards topped with barbed wire. One 23-year-old admits he was scared to return. But wrestling itself is a form of resistance. \u201cThe enemy wants us not to play,\u201d says a defence ministry official, \u201cbut we are showing that we can come back and make things better.\u201d Pausing from a batch of rapid squats, 16-year-old Sajid Omid says that on the day of the attack, a piece of shrapnel hit him in the chest and his wrestling partner was killed. \u201cI am scared to come but my love of wrestling means I cannot not come,\u201d he says quietly. He hopes to become the latest in a long line of champions trained by Abbas, but security concerns means nobody knows when the next match can be organised. \u201cThose who lost limbs and can\u2019t come back here are in an even worse situation,\u201d says Bashir Ahmad Faizi, \u201cI hear they want to die.\u201d The attack on the Maiwand club was Isis\u2019s fifth strike this year in the same area of west Kabul, a poor Hazara neighbourhood of low brick houses. Hazara pride is wrapped up in Afghanistan\u2019s wrestling scene; champions in four weight-categories were killed in the assault. By targeting the 6-million strong, mainly Shia Muslim, minority Isis hopes to breed sectarian strife between it and the Sunni Pashtun majority. Fears of a collapse into the kind of blood-letting seen in Iraq have so far proven exaggerated, but Hazara resentment of the government is growing. Abbas founded this branch of the Maiwand wrestling club in 1980. Like so many Afghans, he has already recovered from more than most will suffer in a lifetime. During the 1990s civil war, a rocket killed his first wife. The small shop he owned was burned down, too. Outside the gym, he walks past a rolled-up wrestling mat that rests by a chain-link fence. He paid $700 for the mat \u2013 the finest available in Afghanistan. One day he will open it and see if it, too, can be re-used. For now he cannot bear to look. It is \u201cfull of blood and body parts\u201d, he says. Inside the gym, the end of the session nears.

When the rains come, the sandbars in the middle \u2013 where fishermen have built temporary encampments consisting of straw huts \u2013 will disappear, making the river wider still. Local people will tell you it\u2019s just a rivi\u00e8re; in this country, they reserve the word fleuve, a big river, for the mighty Congo alone. Mushie is built on one bank of the Kasai river, in the way that towns in other countries spawn from main roads. The town is two hours in a fast boat from Bandundu, and seven hours along the river in the other direction from the provincial capital, Inongo. There is no road. It\u2019s only when you travel these inland waters, passing the standing fishermen paddling their pirogues \u2013 passing the dugout canoes and the big, flat cargo boats, laden perilously low in the water with families sitting on top of their goods \u2013 that you get a true sense of the scale of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country is as big as western Europe, with its people scattered across small villages lying along the rivers, in the forests and on the plains. If you were going to try to stamp out a lethal disease, you wouldn\u2019t want to be doing it here. Yet that is what\u2019s happening. In DRC, a country tarnished in international eyes by war and violence, Congolese doctors are finally winning the battle with sleeping sickness, a disease of west and central Africa that became an epidemic thanks partly to the enforced displacement of peoples and poverty caused by the policies of invading European colonialists. Rowing pirogues along the river. At the turn of the millennium, there were roughly 30,000 cases in DRC. Last year, there were 1,100. In the first half of this year, 350 were recorded. On the horizon is the tantalising prospect of elimination. The vast majority of the world\u2019s remaining cases, 85%, are in DRC. \u201cIf DRC eliminates sleeping sickness, the world eliminates sleeping sickness,\u201d says Dr Victor Kande, former head of the government programme to fight the disease. Kande, the man they call the father of sleeping sickness, is 68 now and walks carefully, eyes on the uneven ground, taking the long way around to avoid steps to the hospital ward at Mushie. He is venerated. And passionate. \u201cYou have to love it,\u201d he says of the work. Dr Victor Kande in the sleeping sickness ward at Bandundu general hospital. At the age of 27, shortly after finishing medical school, he was the only doctor for 11,000 people in a village in \u00c9quateur province, to the north of Bandundu. A 12 year-old boy was brought in by his parents, tied up with ropes. His name was J\u00e9rome. \u201cHe was talking a lot. He was angry. His parents said we brought him here because he can\u2019t be with other people. He is very agitated,\u201d says Kande. \u201cThey took him to a traditional healer but he could do nothing.\u201d Kande had been briefed on the diseases he would see in this region and the symptoms rang a bell. He went away to look through his medical textbooks: sleeping sickness. The early stages were innocuous \u2013 headaches, joint pains, fever. Then the symptoms would apparently go away. Sometimes it would be several years before the madness began. Victims would shout, accuse people, get violent. And start sleeping a lot. Then a lot more, until they could barely be woken for food. Finally, they would slip into a coma and die. The parasite that causes sleeping sickness, trypanosome, is seen here magnified under a microscope. These parasites are transmitted to humans by tsetse flies, resulting in sleeping sickness. \u201cI went back to see the patient and felt his lymph nodes,\u201d he says. They were lumpy, the most telling sign. He took a fluid sample. The lab confirmed that the trypanosome could be seen under the microscope, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, transmitted from one person to another through a bite from the tsetse fly, which feeds on human blood. \u201cI asked the nurse how we treat sleeping sickness,\u201d says Kande. \u201cHe said that there was a store where there were drugs from Belgian times.\u201d This was in 1977. The Belgians left after independence in 1960. \u201cWe opened the box and found melarsoprol. There was no expiry date,\u201d says Kande. \u201cI read in my book how to use it.\u201d Melarsoprol was an arsenic-based drug introduced in 1949. The rapid spread of sleeping sickness during the late 19th century was a result of the opening up of Africa, and followed the sequence of the European invasion along the Congo River. Melarsoprol, an arsenic-based drug, was introduced for the treatment of sleeping sickness in 1949. For over half a century, it was the only drug for the late stage. It kills 5-10% of the patients treated. J\u00e9rome was among the lucky ones, probably because he was young. He had nine injections over three weeks and was cured. \u201cI was really happy. The young man became really close to me. He came to my house and ate with me and became like my son,\u201d says Kande. An image of a tsetse fly outside a sleeping sickness treatment ward at Bandundu general hospital. DRC, a country riven with problems, is an ever present near the bottom of global leagues for development indicators. The war that raged in the country from 1998 to 2002 war was the most lethal anywhere in the world since the second world war. A second Ebola outbreak in a year is now slow-burning in the worst possible region of the country, conflict-riven North Kivu, where UN peacekeepers try to deter rival factions from slaughtering each other. But amid political uncertainty and disturbances, Congolese doctors have not wavered in their determination to end the scourge of sleeping sickness. The national programme for the control of African human trypanosomiasis sends out screening teams to actively search for cases in villages, offering blood tests, lymph node fluid testing and even lumbar punctures. They target settlements in the forests and on the river banks, where the tsetse flies live and feed on the blood of fishermen, farmers and their families. In these remote rural areas, where there is no running water or electricity without a generator, Congolese doctors and nurses have been running clinical trials of a new drug that could transform treatment. Flying over Bandundu. Bandundu alone, where most cases occur, spans 300,000 sq km \u2013 an area bigger than the UK. And it\u2019s what they call \u201cdynamic\u201d. Whole villages move. They run from sleeping sickness and are not on the map. The government does not know they exist. Using satellite technologies, heat sensors that can suggest where there are inhabited houses in the forests, and sampling data from census teams that give an idea of how many generally live under one roof, the programme has found 10,000 villages that nobody knew were there. Life on the riverbank. In the bigger villages, mobile screening teams set up under shelters made from palm leaves and branches. A massive, battered register on the first of three tables lists every family in the village \u2013 with spaces for children yet to be born \u2013 and the years in which they have been screened. Everyone who arrives is allotted a number and joins the queue, sitting on a snaking row of plastic chairs, moving up one chair at a time until they reach the second table, where basic screening \u2013 the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (Catt) \u2013 is performed. They get to choose which finger is pierced with a needle, and their blood is then collected in a thin plastic tube. The screener, in a white coat, mixes a drop with a deep-blue coloured fluid containing antigen on a paper slide. When 12 blood spots are ready, the paper is gently vibrated for five minutes in a small machine. If there is a clumping of dark specks in a blood spot, the person is recalled and sent to a third table for further tests. Mobile screening teams perform card agglutination tests. Some faces show fright, even horror, as they sit alone at the third table. Belinda Bizaka, 17, in school uniform with two blue biros twisted in her hair, looks bored and embarrassed. She\u2019s back for a rescreen because this happened three months ago. The confirmatory tests that time were negative. There are three, involving two more blood tests and a sample of lymph node fluid from her neck. Belinda Belinda says she didn\u2019t know tsetse flies carried sleeping sickness. \u201cI was bitten on the farm,\u201d she says, muttering the words with teenage hostility. \u201cThis month. I go to school every day and then work on the farm.\u201d Once more, the tests are negative. Belinda stares into the middle distance. Mini mobile teams on motorbikes access the remoter villages, carrying all the screening kit they need. The tablets they bear \u2013 which have the potential to transform not only the fight against this disease but, in future, others too \u2013 record information about the location and health of individuals that is automatically uploaded to a data bank owned by the ministry of health in Kinshasa. Malaria cases, childbirth, vaccinations. One day, all that knowledge could be collected and acted upon. The motorbikes could not get to Chaida\u2019s village, however. The little boy is seven, but looks like a four-year-old. He has been ill for years, says his father, Zindo, and suffers from headaches, fever and lack of appetite. Zindo: \u2018My son was sleeping and whining all the time\u2019 \u201cHe used to cry all the time,\u201d says Zindo. \u201cWe went to health clinics and were told it was malaria. When the treatment the boy had did not work, we thought it was sorcery. We went to a traditional healer.\u201d Chaida got no better and was falling asleep all the time. His father heard about the screening team visiting Lebida village. He put his small son in a pirogue and paddled the half hour along the river to get there. The tests revealed the parasites. A lumbar puncture in the base of the spine showed it was stage two sleeping sickness, affecting the brain. Chaida and his dad were put on the back of motorbikes and taken straight to Mushie hospital. Chaida was given fexinidazole, the new drug that Congolese doctors have been trialling. It was discovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDI), an international collaboration that grew out of the frustrations of volunteer doctors of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, who did not have the treatments they needed to save lives. Because he is in a trial, run according to strict protocol, we are not allowed to use Chaida\u2019s full name or show his face. But after two weeks of daily pills, he has become a happy little boy with a cute grin and an infectious laugh. He capers around the ward and chases chickens in the hospital grounds. The doctors say he sings and dances. His father sticks both thumbs up at this reincarnation of the boy he barely remembers. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t play with others. In the classroom he was sleeping all the time,\u201d he says. He now intends to take his wife to the screening team. \u201cMy wife may also have sleeping sickness. She sleeps. She can\u2019t cook well for the children.\u201d If anyone suggests she is under a spell, he says: \u201cI will tell them it is not witchcraft.\u201d This belief that sleeping sickness is caused by sorcery has destroyed lives. Alfred Mpayambe, 55, was a fisherman in Mushie, with his own dugout canoe and an income that supported his wife and two children. Then he started suffering headaches, developed skin lesions and lost weight. Over two years, he spent 300,000 Congolese francs \u2013 roughly \u00a3146 - visiting health clinics (where he was told it was hypertension) and traditional healers (who said he\u2019d been bewitched by his uncle). Alfred Mpayambe: \u2018I thought it was witchcraft\u2019 \u201cI stopped working because it was very serious. My mother, my brother and friends thought I was going to die,\u201d he says. Marie Kibuku Bizier, 74, his mother, was almost sure it was sleeping sickness. Her generation had seen a lot of it. \u201cWhen he was ill he had many troubles and he was very aggressive,\u201d she says. \u201cHe shouted that I was a witch. He even beat me. I ran away. That is why my brother was angry.\u201d When the disease brings on its madness, family and neighbours believe the victim has been cursed. Witch hunts are not unknown and have sometimes ended horribly, with a blazing tyre around the neck of the accused. In the end, Alfred went to Mushie hospital, where Dr Tim Mayala, lead investigator there of the fexinidazole trial, diagnosed and enrolled him, at a very late stage. His left arm and leg were partly paralysed. \u201cHe was sleeping in the day and in the night. We had to take him to bathe, to wash or to clean his clothes,\u201d says the doctor. Alfred took the fexi tablets he was given in hospital once a day for 10 days and was cured. His problems are not over: his arm is still too weak for paddling or fishing; his wife has left him; and someone stole his boat while he was ill. \u201cI want my wife to come back but now it is not possible because I must bring money into the family,\u201d he says. His uncle is still not speaking to him. \u201cI must find a solution, because living this way is not good. My mother and I are just alone. We need to make it up, but my uncle doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d Dr Wilfried Mutombo Kalonji and his team. Dr Wilfried Mutombo Kalonji of DNDI, the coordinator of the trials, cannot forget two patients who died from melarsoprol in 2004, when he was a young doctor in Kasai province. It marks you. \u201cBoth men were about 20 or 25, and young and strong. I was the only medical doctor for about 800 people. They came in and we did the lab tests and found they had sleeping sickness and I gave them the only treatment we had. The guys started feeling worse and worse. They had seizures and confusion, went into a coma and died. \u201cThey come with their parents and they trust you. Sometimes the family will look at you like a criminal, as if to say: \u2018You killed my son.\u2019 This was a very, very bad experience. \u201cMelarsoprol was terrible. We also had many relapsed cases. In Kasai, half the patients relapsed. Half were cured but half were not.\u201d Kande, who rose to become the first director of DRC\u2019s sleeping sickness programme, lobbied for diagnostic tests and treatments with the World Health Organization, donors, European tropical medicine institutions, NGOs and anyone else who would listen. The arrival of the Catt test was his first triumph. But he, like every other doctor who had nothing else to give his patients, was appalled by the deaths from melarsoprol. A sleeping sickness patient at Mushie hospital. \u201cI asked the question at that time, at the WHO \u2013 \u2018We don\u2019t have drugs, the few drugs we have cause severe side effects, they kill, people die. What are we to do?\u2019\u201d he says. None of the pharmaceutical companies wanted to help. There was no chance of any financial reward. DNDI was set up in 2003 to find drugs for a group of tropical diseases for which there could be no profit for pharma. For sleeping sickness, it decided to trial a combination including a drug called eflornithine, which worked in the second stage but was prohibitively expensive \u2013 although it made money in the west in hair removing cream. Combined with other drugs as nifurtimox-eflornithine (Nect), less of it would be needed, making it cheaper. Clinical trials are complicated, bound up with rules and protocols that make them difficult even in Europe and the US. Running such a thing in the heart of DRC was at the very least ambitious. Dilapidated local hospitals had to be refurbished. Wards needed paint; they needed new, easily cleanable floors, better beds, an incinerator for hospital waste, microscopes, centrifuges, ECG machines to check the health of hearts, and other equipment to meet standards required in the western world. Hospitals had to be selected that were reachable by the small planes run by the Mission Aviation Fellowship, which transports aid workers. Local medical staff had to be trained in record-keeping and how to gain informed consent from a sick patient who cannot read or write and has no concept of what a clinical trial might be. \u201cWe developed tools and pictures, explaining in a very easy way,\u201d says Dr Wilfried. \u201cMost patients are poor. We provide food and the treatment is free. So to be fair, we give food and free care to all the patients with sleeping sickness, whether or not they are on a trial.\u201d Nect was licensed with the help of trial evidence from DRC in 2009. But it has to be given through twice daily infusions by trained staff in a hospital for a week. The kit for one patient weighs 10 kilos. DNDI\u2019s investigators were given access to some of the big pharmaceutical companies\u2019 compound libraries, where records are kept of molecules that have been discovered but for which a commercial use has not yet been found. They hit on fexinidazole, which Hoechst, now part of Sanofi, had begun testing in the 1970s but abandoned when it appeared there was no longer a big market in the affluent west for drugs against infectious diseases. Pharma focused on cancer, heart disease and other chronic illnesses instead. Dr Helene works at Bandundu General Hospital. DNDI\u2019s trial compared patients on NECT with those on fexi. The cure rate was much the same, but the advantages of fexinidazole were great. It works in both stages one and two, obviating the need for a painful, invasive lumbar puncture to identify the relevant type. It is in pill form, which makes it easy to transport and administer. The Congolese doctors are now waiting to hear whether fexi will be approved by the European Medicines Agency. It\u2019s a triumph for the Congolese doctors, who are now moving into trials of another pill, which they hope will be a single-dose cure that patients could take at home. Dr Erick Miaka, with his tsetse fly trap. Dr Erick Miaka, the head of DRC\u2019s sleeping sickness programme, says the hardest cases are the last ones \u2013 not only villagers in the remotest places, where motorbikes can\u2019t reach, but also people in more accessible homes who don\u2019t come for screening because they no longer fear it. He is looking forward to getting 15m tsetse fly traps in place on the rivers to cut the chain of transmission. \u201cIn 2019 it is necessary to intensify all the activities, if possible,\u201d he says. He is proud of what they have achieved in DRC. It is a quiet triumph for a country that has such a bad image. \u201cOn the TV they talk more of the war in the east than the medical success story,\u201d he says with a wry smile. https://interactive.guim.co.uk/docsdata-test/1bHJvQudK2K38GQ4kTihmIAhJ-oWOoAWEAqukn5KVjiI.json Commenting on this piece?

People have given on average \u00a31 every second for an inflation-adjusted amount of \u00a32.89bn since the appeal fund was launched in 1921. Fundraisers say this armistice centenary year could bring in record donations of more than \u00a350m. More than \u00a31bn has been raised in the past 25 years alone, comparable to totals raised by Comic Relief and Children in Need respectively since their establishment in the 1980s. The appeal remains controversial, however. The newsreader Jon Snow refused to wear a poppy on air in 2006, decrying what he called \u201cpoppy fascism\u201d, and in 2016, Fifa banned the England team from wearing them in World Cup qualifiers. This week, the Novara Media co-founder and Labour supporter Aaron Bastani called the poppy appeal \u201csickening\u201d, saying \u201cas a country, Britain spends \u00a345m on poppies to feel good and help a worthy cause, while 13,000 ex-veterans are homeless\u201d. Despite the charged debate, there has been the biggest spike in donations in the past decade since the end of the second world war. The money raised has gone to veteran care homes, family respite and advisory services, among other causes. More recently, with the realisation of the scale of mental health problems among military personnel following campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, attention is turning to mental health through the likes of Forward Assist, a Newcastle-based charity that helps with social integration of veterans. The proportion of personnel with a diagnosed mental health condition has almost doubled in the past decade. Lisa Gordon, 46, joined the army in 1990 and served for 11 years in Northern Ireland and Bosnia, before being medically discharged due to injuries and going on to experience social isolation and depression. \u201cIt was my own pride that was stopping me from accessing support,\u201d she said, adding that Forward Assist helped her turn things around. \u201cI was scared of people judging me, but as soon as I walked through the door there was no judgment whatsoever. I was among people that understood me. They put me back together and helped me find myself again.\u201d Through group activities including nature walks and fishing, Gordon was able to connect with others who had had similar experiences. \u201cThe other veterans understood depression,\u201d she said, \u201cand a lot of the females were socially isolated too, so we helped each other\u201d. Like Gordon, Bob Wilson also volunteers for Forward Assist. He experienced bouts of depression following 16 years of service, starting in Northern Ireland. \u201cI saw some horrible things which play over in my mind, like when you see your best mate blown to pieces by a bomb and then you have to kill the dogs to stop them from running away with the bones. That\u2019s not a nice thought to go through your head. \u201cI do whatever they [Forward Assist] need me to do \u2013 driving or going fishing \u2013 as long as I\u2019m doing something, I\u2019m not thinking. We\u2019re very grateful for the help the poppy appeal gives because places like Forward Assist have given me a community.\u201d Royal British Legion research found veterans are twice as likely to become unemployed than civilians, resulting in about 120,000 being currently out of work. The Officers\u2019 Association, which receives 60% of its money from the poppy appeal, has set up an employment app to help veterans find new careers, with almost 2,000 registering for assistance each year. One such former officer is Anthony Thompson, 31. After joining the Royal Marines in 2008 and completing two tours of Afghanistan, Thompson sustained an injury and was medically discharged in 2017. \u201cI had a really awful transition from the military,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel supported. I applied to 256 positions over the seven months that I was unemployed and was unsuccessful in all of them.\u201d A veteran friend recommended Thompson contact the Officers\u2019 Association. \u201cI started networking through the OA and things started turning around for me then \u2026 luckily I reached out before things went too far,\u201d he said.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Filling the gaps: why homeless does not have to mean toothless", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/08/filling-the-gaps-why-homeless-does-not-have-to-mean-toothless", "date": "2018-11-08", "transcript": "For Jon Brennan, all it really took was a mouth full of teeth. His life fell apart when he was 32. He was running a successful carpentry business, but alcohol and drugs had crept into his life, then slowly taken over. One day he came home to find his house empty. His wife, with whom he was raising two children, had packed her bags and left with the children. She left a note saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I signed up for.\u201d \u201cThat just devastated me,\u201d says Brennan, now 59. For the next 10 years, he drowned his sadness in even more drugs, spending his savings and losing his business along the way. A harrowing trip to the emergency department finally jolted him awake and he cleaned up. He was left with just one persistent problem from his chaos days. His drug use had taken a heavy toll on his mouth: his teeth were a mess. A counsellor introduced Brennan to Dr Jay Grossman, a dentist and the director of Homeless Not Toothless, a Los Angeles charity that provides free dental care to the homeless, as well as to veterans, foster youth and other at-risk groups. \u201cMy teeth were so bad, he decided to just get rid of the uppers,\u201d says Brennan. \u201cHe went ahead and gave me a set of dentures.\u201d It is a service that is not available to many in the homeless community, but good dental care \u2013 and specifically dentures \u2013 can transform a homeless person\u2019s life, Grossman said by phone from his office in Brentwood. Providing people with false teeth can put them out of pain, prevent infection, and restore their sense of pride. And while dentistry in general can be expensive, a set of dentures is relatively affordable, and can last for a decade or longer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take away from the importance of food, shelter and proper medical care,\u201d says Grossman, who has been running Homeless Not Toothless since he founded the charity in 1992. \u201cBut even if we provided all that, and they have no teeth \u2013 so aesthetically they don\u2019t look the part \u2013 what kind of job are they ever going to get?\u201d Brennan noticed the difference immediately. With his dentures, he was finally able to eat properly, which improved his health. His pain was gone and he regained his confidence. \u201cI could get out working again and not be embarrassed by my teeth,\u201d he says. \u201cA first impression is a first impression. We all say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t judge people\u2019, but everybody does.\u201d The need for dental services in the homeless community is enormous, says Grossman, noting that Homeless Not Toothless has a waiting list of 900 people. A handful of other charities are trying to meet the demand in other parts of the world: an Irish dental technician fits homeless people for dentures on the streets of Dublin. In Houston, Healthcare for the Homeless offered dentures or other dental care to more than 6,700 people last year. And in Geneva later this month, the homeless charity Carrefour-Rue will begin offering free dentures to the homeless people who come to its weekly dental clinic. Its first patient, a man in his 30s, has lost all but six of his teeth. This week, a volunteer dentist will fit him out for a set of dentures in a small room at one end of the container-cum-health centre on the edge of Geneva\u2019s Parc Beaulieu. Three weeks later, the prosthesis \u2013 which could last for a decade or longer, if the man takes good care of it \u2013 will be ready to wear. \u201cI think he has no idea what he\u2019s getting, but I\u2019m certain it\u2019s going to completely change his life,\u201d says Dr Edoard Coquoz, a volunteer dentist who oversees Carrefour Rue\u2019s dental services. Coquoz has already identified two dozen other candidates for the service. But he is sure the need is much greater. \u201cOur goal is to help people re-establish their lives, bit by bit,\u201d says No\u00ebl Constant, a ponytailed 79-year-old who is Carrefour-Rue\u2019s director. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of being able to chew, but also of appearance,\u201d he adds. \u201cOur society is very intolerant. It puts a huge importance on the way you look.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Her son was in prison. She was trying to look after his two young children, who were aged one and two. Their mother was emotionally unstable. Bugget-Kellum did not want the chaos of the adults\u2019 lives passed down to another generation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if they would be safe with their mother,\u201d she recalled recently. \u201cI began to pray, please God, I need some help. There were so many things going on.\u201d While at the clinic, Bugget-Kellum learned about a new parenting programme designed for carers of young children who have faced early adversity such as domestic abuse, homelessness or the loss of a parent to incarceration. \u201cIt was like I had my ammunition and I knew how to fight,\u201d said Bugget-Kellum of the programme. The scheme, called Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-up (ABC), pairs parents with a coach trained in the needs of infants and toddlers who have experienced trauma. Bugget-Kellum\u2019s coach reinforced simple techniques to form a healthy bond between adult and child, and helped her work through her own emotional wounds to create a less stressful environment at home. The results were so transformative, she said, that she started working as a parent coach for the same programme. \u201cI have a son who is 26 and in prison, so I\u2019m thinking maybe had I had an opportunity to get some of this, I don\u2019t know, maybe I could have been more nurturing,\u201d she said. \u201cABC gave me the confidence to say, you can do this. I don\u2019t have to be angry with myself any more.\u201d Traumatic or highly stressful childhood experiences are known to have lifelong emotional, behavioural and physiological impacts. Children who are abused, neglected, or exposed to conflict, violence and horror, are far more likely to have drink and drug problems, criminal records and perhaps resort to violence and abuse themselves. But researchers have also found that interventions such as the ABC programme can significantly buffer the damaging effects of stress and trauma, even at a biological level. A growing number of advocacy and public health organisations are working to bring \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d approaches into the mainstream for doctors, carers and first responders. The crucial role of caring and calming adults Scientists are continuing to untangle the complex biological effects of childhood trauma on the brain and body. Research in the past decade points to \u201ctoxic stress\u201d as the root of the connection between adverse childhood experiences (Aces) and health problems in adult life. The theory is that continuous or repetitive exposure to stressful situations through, say, domestic abuse, or growing up in poverty, causes the body\u2019s natural fight-or-flight stress response to stay switched on. Researchers say that without the influence of a caring and calming adult the stress becomes \u201ctoxic\u201d, and elevated cortisol levels change the functioning of the child\u2019s brain, weakening the immune system and even altering the way a child\u2019s DNA is \u201cread and transcribed\u201d. \u201cThis is the source that a lot of the problems in our society can be traced to,\u201d said Leena Singh, programme director for the National Paediatric Practice Community on Adverse Childhood Experiences (NPCC), which has an office in San Francisco. \u201cThere is a saying in public health \u2013 we need to move upstream. This is the work that is the root of the root.\u201d Singh\u2019s organisation is working to integrate screening for adverse childhood experiences into standard paediatric primary care. The programme hopes to recruit 1,000 clinicians to screen 300,000 children for Aces over three years and is running pilot sites at six clinics across the US, with plans to add more. Singh says paediatricians have a vital role to play. They could refer patients for behavioural therapy or social support, but in medical schools they are rarely trained in the impacts of toxic stress. There are logistical hurdles to overcome too, such as how to add another process on to providers that are already overburdened, and how to bill insurers for time spent screening. NPCC says it is working through its pilot sites and member network to resolve those problems. It is also involved, through its parent organisation, the Center for Youth Wellness, with a clinical study on the effects of Ace interventions on certain biomarkers. Ultimately, Singh believes, their work could contribute to long-term shifts in the paediatric field. \u201cIf we can address and intervene early when some of these things happen in very young children we can actually prevent some of the risky behaviours and health impacts later in life.\u201d A two-generation approach can short-circuit the cycle of abuse One of the main challenges in pushing the model further, say proponents of trauma-informed care, is the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the approach. Researchers, including the CYW group and Mary Dozier, creator of the ABC intervention, say they are working to fill that gap. \u201cIn some regards [Aces are] a universal experience,\u201d said Leslie Lieberman, director of special initiatives at Mobilising Action for Resilient Communities (Marc), a collaboration between 14 American cities and communities focused on trauma-informed programmes. Many programmes take a two-generation approach to try to short-circuit the cycle of physical, emotional or substance abuse. Tennessee, for instance, is in the third year of its Building Strong Brains initiative, a $1.25m scheme to fund innovative Aces-focused programmes across the state. One programme funded under the initiative, called Thrive by 5, will conduct Aces screening on all pregnant women at the Baptist Memorial Hospital for Women in Shelbyville. Women who report four or more of the different types of childhood adversities (physical, sexual or emotional abuse, neglect, domestic violence, household substance abuse or mental illness, parental separation, divorce or incarceration) will receive programme interventions and parenting education. Another programme called Handle With Care, which started in West Virginia and since expanded, allows police officers to notify a child\u2019s school if they are called to their home for potentially traumatic event like domestic abuse or a shooting. School officials don\u2019t receive any incident details but the notice allows them to better respond to behavior changes or offer necessary support to the student. The \u201cinfant courts\u201d are also expanding. Zero to Three, an advocacy group for early child development resources, started piloting \u201csafe babies court teams\u201d in 2005, and now has more than 20 sites across the US. The teams work with young children separated by the court from their parents, often because of abuse or neglect, providing developmental medical screening, mental health services and community advocates to ease the trauma of entering the foster care system. In Tennessee, they\u2019re calling for drugs education in schools Parents can receive psychological services too to deal with traumas of their own \u2013 a study by such a team found that more than two-thirds of parents in the programme had an Ace score of four or higher. For families who are reunified, the teams\u2019 work appears to have an impact. Zero to Three reported that maltreatment recurrence rates over 12 months among children in the scheme was 1.2%, compared with more than 9% nationwide. As part of its statewide initiative one Tennessee court is building a new programme based on the scheme, with an emphasis on preventing Aces in children stuck in the court system, and on addressing parents\u2019 own childhood traumas. The opioid drug epidemic, which kills more than 100 people every day in the US, has also brought into focus Ace interventions tailored to families facing substance abuse. Vermont experienced a 40% increase in the number of children taken into care between 2013 and 2016; more than half of children under five in 2016 were there due to parental opioid abuse. The state\u2019s Opioid Coordination Council has recommended an \u201cintergenerational approach\u201d, calling for expanded maternal health and infant care programmes for high-risk families to mitigate the trauma of children born to opioid-addicted parents, and drug education programmes in schools to help prevent addiction in the next generation. Tucked inside a bipartisan opioid epidemic bill just signed by Donald Trump, called the Support for Patients and Communities Act, are several federal provisions encouraging wider recognition of Aces and trauma-informed care. The bill calls for an \u201cinteragency task force\u201d to identify best practices within three years for mitigating the impact of trauma on infants and children and to create a national strategy to improve coordination of trauma-informed care at a federal level. The bill also authorises the Department of Education to provide grants to schools for mental health programmes to help mitigate the impacts of childhood trauma. Experts say greater cross-sector collaboration and more funding is needed for trauma-informed care to really make a difference. \u201cThe lifelong manifestations of that childhood trauma are cross-sector \u2013 it effects educational outcomes, employment opportunities, it affects your health,\u201d said Marc\u2019s Lieberman. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make a population-level impact without a cross-sector approach.\u201d That makes the execution of trauma-informed care inherently complicated. But at bottom there is a simple and revolutionary idea, says Lieberman: \u201cIt\u2019s about moving from \u2018what\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 to \u2018what happened to you?\u2019\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Four years ago two young Australian men saw a gap in the market and fitted out a van with a washer and dryer, driving it to parks, churches and drop-in centres in a bid to bring hygiene services to the homeless community on their own turf. Lucas Patchett, co-founder of Orange Sky, said washing was initially viewed as a low priority for the community, and there was widespread scepticism about the plan. \u201cWhen we dreamed this up it was a world first, and we had a lot of practical issues to overcome. How would we power the machines, where would we dispose of the waste water?\u201d says Patchett. \u201cBut we strongly believed that access to hygiene was a basic human right.\u201d There are more than 100,000 homeless Australians, and the population has complex needs. Patchett says Orange Sky has been able to forge bonds with the community by bringing the vans to its doorstep, and because it has no agenda besides the straightforward, free services it offers. Health benefits of the mobile laundry include halting the spread of mould, scabies and bed bugs, but Patchett says it is the mental health boost that is most significant. \u201cWe\u2019re not preaching anything, or teaching anything or pushing anything. But it does take an hour to wash and dry someone\u2019s clothes and during that time people tend to hang around. That\u2019s when the conversations start. \u201cNinety-nine percent of the day, these people are walked past and ignored and not even looked at, and that can have a huge impact on psyche and sense of self-worth. So we just say g\u2019day and offer something really practical that makes people immediately feel more confident to engage with the broader society.\u201d There are now 27 Orange Sky laundry and shower vans operating in Australia, using generators and solar power to run the machines. Operated by volunteers, they do around 15-20 laundry loads and showers each day. Last month Orange Sky expanded overseas, unveiling a van in Auckland, New Zealand, with plans to venture to the US next. It costs around NZ$100,000 (\u00a351,235) to kit out a laundry and shower van. A number of other mobile laundry services have launched around the world, including in several US states, Brighton in the UK and Athens, Greece, where 20,000 people are homeless. Orange Sky has also been asked to provide services to Singapore, Hong Kong and other British cities. According to Auckland council, at least 1,000 people sleep rough in New Zealand\u2019s biggest city every night, and Orange Sky\u2019s expansion has been welcomed by those caring for the community, saying the service has been embraced. The New Zealand housing and urban development minister, Phil Twyford, said Orange Sky offered rough sleepers something many New Zealanders took for granted, and was one part of giving them back their dignity and self-respect. \u201cWhile superficially the service is about clean clothes and showers, the main benefits are the social interactions,\u201d said Twyford. Mike, one of the first clients to use the Orange Sky van in Auckland, said it was a relief to be able to wash his clothes and bedding, as well as himself, on a regular basis. \u201cIt is a bit tricky, it\u2019s hard enough to find somewhere to live and something to eat, let alone find a place to wash your clothes and have a wash,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good concept \u2026 and it has a roll-on effect. Your clothes are clean, you\u2019re clean and you feel good about yourself.\u201d Patchett says homeless women find the service particularly valuable, as many struggle finding a safe place to shower in privacy. \u201cThere was a woman who came to shower and she said she hadn\u2019t had a safe space to do that for a number of years,\u201d says Patchett. \u201cAnd even just being locked in the back of a van with volunteers out the front really gave her some peace of mind.\u201d Another man who had not showered for more than four months moved his social worker to tears when he climbed into the back of the Orange Sky van for a few minutes of privacy and relaxation. Cities in New Zealand such as Wellington, Whangarei and Christchurch have been in touch requesting Orange Sky services in their towns, and Patchett says with enough funding and volunteers, the service will soon spread countrywide.

The tiny Pickersgill\u2019s reed frogs \u2013 each the size of an adult thumbnail \u2013 were making history of a kind, by hopping one step further away from the abyss of extinction. It was a small dose of encouraging news at a dismal time for conservationists. Study after study shows how human encroachment is annihilating wildlife and insect populations. The latest WWF estimate this week found that people have wiped out 60 percent of animal populations since 1970. The question is: can we become as good at saving species as we are at destroying them? In the case of the frogs, rapid expansion of farming and other development near the South African port city of Durban has reduced their remaining kingdom to a land area of only 144 sq km (56 sq miles). But thanks to captive breeding, the 20-strong population has multiplied tenfold in only one year in a project run by frog experts Dr Adrian Armstrong and Dr Jeanne Tarrant. They are not sure how many will reach old age in the wild, but the turbo-boosted population growth gives them hope that this threatened species has a better shot at survival, in combination with other conservation action. The Durban frogs are not alone in being on the brink of survival, and their rescue begs a question: can species be rescued by programmes like this in which they are bred in captivity? Worldwide, more than 26,000 wild species face extinction and are listed as such on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Dr Richard Young, head of conservation science at the UK-based Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, says the true number facing extinction is likely to be much, much higher, as scientists have yet to formally classify or assess the multiple forms of life on our planet. Of the more than 93,500 species assessed so far, Young says it looks like 41% of amphibians are threatened with extinction, along with 25% of mammal species, 13% of birds and 33% of corals. No surprise then that conservation experts are resorting to some pretty desperate measures to protect and multiply vulnerable species before it\u2019s too late. Breeding them rapidly in captive or semi-captive conditions is one strategy, largely pioneered by Welsh ecologist and Durrell chief scientist Prof Carl Jones, who was awarded the 2016 Indianapolis Prize for his role in saving nine species of wildlife from extinction. Over the last 35 years, Jones and fellow scientists have been involved in projects to protect more than 50 threatened species, mainly in Mauritius and Madagascar. Numerous similar restoration projects are underway globally, says Dr Kathy Traylor-Holzer, senior program officer at the Conservation Planning Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). She says examples include the Iberian lynx in Spain, the Eastern sarus crane in Thailand, the Kihansi spray toad in Tanzania, golden lion tamarins in Brazil or American burying beetles in the US. And while the conservation benefits of captive breeding and other techniques to artificially boost the number of threatened species may seem obvious, there are still some question marks about just how far scientists should go in managing or manipulating the living conditions of species they are trying to save. Young and his Durrell colleague Dr Andrew Terry acknowledge that intensive breeding is \u201csomething of a last resort\u201d. \u201cThese programmes are expensive, complicated and difficult,\u201d says Terry. \u201cIf you are breeding species with the intention of putting them back in the wild, you have to monitor the outcomes very carefully and also ensure that you don\u2019t introduce new diseases or pathogens back into the wild by accident.\u201d Because they are dealing with species that often have very low genetic diversity, project managers must also guard against the potential for inbreeding. \u201cYou can\u2019t always breed animals in captive conditions and simply open the cage doors. Sometimes they need a bit of time to adapt to predators and learn what to eat in their new environment.\u201d He cites the example of the Pygmy Hog Conservation Project in Assam, India, where captive-bred hogs are released into a large enclosure containing plants found in their wild environment. \u201cThey still receive supplementary feed in the enclosure but we try to eliminate all human contact so that the young animals start to learn to support themselves. Then we move them to soft release areas to acclimatise, and to leave at their own speed. After three to four weeks, we find them coming back less often for supplementary food.\u201d Young says the survival rate for captive-bred animals varies greatly, depending on the species: \u201cWith amphibians you expect a high mortality rate, but when we released ploughshare tortoises back to the wild, we experienced a near 100% survival rate.\u201d Is there a point that should not be crossed with intensive management and other emerging de-extinction projects? \u201cYes, in my view, there probably is a line,\u201d says Young. \u201cWe need to focus more on the species that are still with us, rather than those that are already extinct. There are possibly 70-80 Sumatran rhinos left alive, so it does not feel right to be investing in trying to bring the woolly mammoth back to life, instead of saving the Sumatran rhino.\u201d Following the recent death of Sudan, the last Northern white rhino male, Edinburgh Napier University ecologist Dr Jason Gilchrist panned expensive plans to resuscitate extinct or near-extinct species. In an article published in The Conversation, Gilchrist argued that instead of investing in \u201cJurassic Park\u201d technology, such money was better spent on protecting the Southern white Rhino, Asian rhinos and other threatened species. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pluck a species off the extinct-shelf, like the woolly mammoth, and put it back in an ecological niche that no longer exists. But, we are facing an absolute crisis,\u201d says Terry. \u201cSo there is also a place for new cutting-edge technology. Some might seem outlandish today, but in a few decades they will become commonplace.\u201d \u201cWhat we find so frustrating is that global biodiversity loss is happening under the radar, whereas there should be international outrage before it slips away,\u201d says Terry. \u201cIt should be right at the top of the global political agenda.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

At the end of hunting season each year, thousands are rewarded for their efforts with a swift execution. Some are throttled with wire to save on bullets. Now, however, the movement to confront such barbarity is gathering pace as rescued greyhounds \u2013 galgos in Spanish \u2013 become more and more popular among hipster communities and city dwellers in northern Spain. As many as 2,000 animals are saved each year. Finding new homes for them used to be difficult, but not any more. According to Anna Clements, the co-founder and director of SOS Galgos, it is becoming more common to see young couples walking the dogs in Barcelona. \u201cIt is uplifting to see a happy galgo being walked in the city instead of how it used to be, when they miserably roamed the streets in search of food and water.\u201d Rescuing galgos in distress is not always easy or possible. \u201cWe all know that someone who is cruel to an animal can become violent towards people and unfortunately hunting is widespread and popular in rural areas of Spain, so dealing with hunters is very unpleasant,\u201d says Clements, while taking part in a rescue operation in southern Spain. Sometimes, dogs are rescued following a call from a member of the public. But sometimes dog owners get in touch themselves, Clements says. \u201cThey use emotional blackmail on the phone, saying \u2018if you don\u2019t take my useless dogs I\u2019ll have to get rid of them\u2019.\u201d \u201cThere is a huge loop in the legal system which enables hunters to do as they please with their dogs and there is no concern from the authorities whatsoever.\u201d Klea Levin, a Swedish former model and galgo activist, has also noticed a rise in interest in rescued greyhounds. \u201cFor a long time our awareness campaigns highlighted the horrible ways in which greyhounds are treated, showing images of mistreated dogs. This mobilised people from animal protection associations,\u201d she says. \u201cWe realised, however, that we would reach a wider audience if we talked about this terrible situation but showed greyhounds as they really are \u2013 elegant and beautiful.\u201d Levin has used her villa in the foothills of the Tibidabo mountain, in Barcelona\u2019s exclusive Sant Gervasi neighbourhood, as a temporary home for rescue dogs: currently two greyhounds, Jungle and Nico, are awaiting adoption. Levin believes that the attitude towards greyhounds in big cities has changed since she arrived in Barcelona two decades ago. She says: \u201cWe see more and more greyhounds in the street. Not only has it become normal, but it has become something fashionable: my neighbourhood is full of elegant greyhounds.\u201d \u201cIn Barcelona you don\u2019t buy galgos, you adopt them,\u201d says Levin. It does not matter if they are fast runners or good hunters. \u201cThe adopters want to know if the dogs are sweet and gentle, and white galgos are the most popular.\u201d Marc Velasco and Marta Huguet are the founders of Brott Barcelona. They design collars for \u201cmodern dogs\u201d and have two adopted galgos \u2013 Brot and Penny. \u201cThe owners care about the quality and style of the accessories because they mirror their lifestyle,\u201d says Huguet. The galgo movement is also gaining momentum abroad. A march for galgos was organised in Germany earlier this year, and dozens of galgos are adopted each year in the US. Petra Postma lives in south-central Pennsylvania and has been working in international galgo adoption for almost 20 years, the first 10 years in the Netherlands. \u201cNine years ago I moved to the US and brought my personal dogs with me, within a year Sage [Save a Galgo Espa\u00f1ol] was born. When I arrived, there were maybe three or four organisations bringing galgos over occasionally. In recent years I have seen how many greyhound adoption groups have tried their hands at galgos: some successful, others not so much.\u201d Clements says there is still a long way to go. Tens of thousands of creatures are thought to be destroyed in southern Spain alone every year. \u201cWe strive to maintain a balance, to not only do rescue, but also to work equally at lobbying for the situation to change,\u201d she says. \u201cThere should be a strict census led by the authorities to regularly check how many dogs a hunter has and their whereabouts. This is not the case. There is a huge loophole in the legal system, which enables hunters to do as they please.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

But for Palestine\u2019s foremost luthier, fixing instruments in refugee camps and using music to bring people together in a divided region comes a close second. Shehada Shalalda, 28, is thought to be the only professional sanie kaman, or violin maker, in Palestine. The other luthiers in Palestine specialise in Arab instruments. Thirteen years ago he was an unremarkable high school student growing up in the old quarter of Ramallah when he heard the aching strains of a single violin wafting up from a newly-opened music school. He was mesmerised and in that moment his life changed. Since that day, Shalalda spent hours in the Al Kamandjati music school, sometimes skipping school to be around the sounds. There, he learned how to fix and clean instruments and how to transform a piece of wood into a violin, planing away at the edges to bring out the curves and hollows, the f-holes and the waist. \u201cI grew up in the middle of the war zone. I didn\u2019t think I would survive,\u201d said Shalalda. \u201cMaking violins offered me a way to remain alive. It was a chance to see the world and do something for my community: bringing peace through music.\u201d At Al Kamandjati, he met Italian violin-maker Paolo Sorgentone, who invited him to study luthiery in Florence in 2008. \u201cWhen I arrived in Italy, it was a shock and a surprise to see there weren\u2019t checkpoints and soldiers with guns in the streets as in Palestine,\u201d says Shalalda. \u201cMy friends and I had imagined that the entire world was like our country.\u201d In Florence, he created his first violin. He continued his studies at Newark School of Violin Making in the UK. Shalalda returned home to Palestine in 2012 and set up a workshop in the Al Kamandjati music school, which is still just up the road from his house. Shalalda\u2019s instruments are sold to customers worldwide. \u201cThis is a way to show that my homeland is producing beautiful handicrafts. Palestine is known only for conflict, but we also have a strong cultural tradition,\u201d says Shalalda, who is back in Ramallah after participating in the prestigious International Triennale Violin Making Competition Antonio Stradivari in Cremona, Italy. It was the first time a violin made in Palestine was submitted to the competition. Bringing music where there is the noise of war moves him. He has repaired musical instruments in the refugee camps of his hometown Ramallah as well as in Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon. He plans to continue these efforts with his friend, Italian luthier Alberto Dolce. \u201cThe refugees have no potable water, no electricity. They are not allowed to work,\u201d said Shalalda. \u201cMusic is an important tool to express their feelings, as a universal language.\u201d Next February, he plans to go Gaza City, and repair instruments of the few music schools left standing after the Israeli airstrike of 9 August, which destroyed the Said Al-Mishal Cultural Centre. He has not yet received permission to go to Gaza. Almost 100 km separate Ramallah and Gaza, an hour\u2019s car trip, but Shalalda will spend an entire day travelling as he cannot pass through Israel. He will probably have to fly to Egypt and then drive to Gaza. But he is worried that the Israeli security forces might close the borders and he will not be able to return to the West Bank, where his wife Buthaina and his three children Nabil, Juri and Omar will be waiting for him. \u201cMusic is a powerful instrument of peace,\u201d says Shalada. \u201cI won\u2019t stop building bridges between cultures thanks to these beautiful instruments, violins.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

It was 2007, the global plastic binge was already well under way, but the millions of tonnes of waste seeping into the oceans as a consequence had not reached the public consciousness. \u201cI was with a friend and we thought, \u2018Let\u2019s just clean up this one beach.\u2019 We had no idea then of the scale of the problem.\u201d It took six weekends, working long hours, to collect all the plastic litter. \u201cWe shifted 30,000 plastic bottles and large pieces of plastic,\u201d said Dale. \u201cYou would pick one piece up, and underneath was another and another in layers. Some of the stuff went back 20 years.\u201d Today, as Dale stands outside an Edwardian summerhouse in the west of the island at Niarbyl bay, he believes Manx beaches are the cleanest in Europe. But the regular sweeps of the 100-mile coastline, conducted by his charity Beach Buddies, are just one facet of the island\u2019s approach to ocean protection that makes it a global leader. In the charity\u2019s visitors\u2019 book, alongside comments from schoolchildren, teachers and parents, there is a signature that stands out: that of Dr Han Qunli, a senior figure within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). It was after his visit that the Isle of Man joined the likes of Mauritius, Menorca, Jeju in South Korea and Noosa in Australia in being singled out for a commitment to protecting and enhancing the coastal environment and biodiversity. The island\u2019s determination to protect the coastal environment from the multiple threats of plastic pollution, climate change and overfishing has earned it the status of a Unesco biosphere region, designated because it is an outstanding example of a place where people and nature work in harmony. It is the only entire island jurisdiction to be granted the status. One indication of the islanders\u2019 commitment to a better marine environment is the numbers that turn out for Beach Buddies. It has attracted 10,000 volunteers over the years \u2013 12% of the Manx population. Dale said: \u201cWe have kids who come with their schools to do a beach clean, then tell their parents: \u2018Dad, I want to go and do a beach clean on Saturday,\u2019 and they bring their parents here. These beaches are virtually self-cleaning now.\u201d For marine biologist Dr Fiona Gell, who grew up on the Isle of Man, the grim reality of what is happening to the world\u2019s oceans is all too familiar. She has spent her life studying the damage being done to the sea\u2019s flora and fauna, and has seen first-hand the devastation that means just 13% of the world\u2019s oceans are untouched by the impact of humanity\u2019s footprint. Now a marine scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Agriculture in the Isle of Man government, she heralds the steps being taken on the island as proof that all is not entirely lost. In 2011, there were just two protected marine areas in the seas off the island. But in the past seven years Gell and her team have been instrumental in throwing a protective ring around the island, increasing the number of marine protected areas to 10, which cover 50% of the inshore waters. From the Calf of Man, a tiny island off the south coast where seals sunbathe on the rocks and basking sharks swim in the summer, to Ramsey Bay in the north, these marine nature reserves restrict trawling and dredging by fishermen and other damaging activities, in order to protect sealife habitats. Looking out over Ramsey Bay, which in 2011 became a marine nature reserve covering 94 sq km, Gell points out the location of seagrass beds, horse mussel reefs and maerl beds that are once again thriving. \u201cSeagrass has declined globally in a really scary way, particularly in the UK, since the 1920s,\u201d said Gell. \u201cIt looks like a green meadow under the sea and has a really high level of carbon storage. It is also really important for juvenile scallops.\u201d Each marine feature being protected and enhanced by the reserve creates diverse habitats that allow scallops, juvenile cod, lobster and other fish to thrive. And while in many areas the fishing industry finds itself at loggerheads with environmentalists, fishing businesses on the Isle of Man \u2013 which fish for king and queen scallops, brown crab, lobster and whelk \u2013 have been involved in drawing up the protective marine belt around the island, even if some had to be heavily persuaded at first of the case for the protection zone. Dr David Beard, chief executive of the Manx Fish Producers Organisation, is also a marine biologist. \u201cBack in 2009, Ramsey Bay had been overfished, there was very little stock left in there and the industry volunteered that area to be closed for a period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an important source of both king and queen scallops from a value point of view and because the whole area supplies the spats [young scallops] to other areas in the Irish sea it affects the recruitment of the other stocks.\u201d The bay encompasses one of the most restricted fishing areas in the coastal waters, where dredging or trawling for scallops is banned throughout the year, except for two weeks before Christmas when up to 30 boats are allowed to go out. Each year the fishermen carry out a stock survey, so by the time they are allowed to fish they know the location of the highest quantities of scallops. \u201cThey get the highest value for the least impact,\u201d said Beard. \u201cIt is a very low-carbon action because they know where to go and they are allowed to trawl for 20 minutes maximum, and it means there is less impact on the seabed. The fishermen know that if they destroy the seabed by overfishing you prevent the spat from settling, so you destroy the fishing, and it is a vicious circle.\u201d Gell has been instrumental in trying to bring the public and fishing industry along with the conservation efforts. \u201cWe are trying not to impose from the top,\u201d she said. \u201cEach marine protected area comes from a lot of engagement with the local people. We go out all over the island to villages and towns and hold stakeholder meetings, with maps to discuss why an area needs to be protected, and to involve people and bring them onboard. It is a slow process but when I look back to 2008 and see what we have achieved I think it shows that people working together in communities can make a difference. \u201cWe have to stay optimistic. From my experience here over the past 10 years, I think we have shown people can get involved in a real community approach and can make a change.\u201d As one of 52 Unesco island and coastal biosphere areas, the Isle of Man is focusing now with partners in Menorca, the Maldives, the Philippines and other islands on eliminating single-use plastic from their shores. If that eventually puts Bill Dale out of a job, he could not be happier. \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

So he took a camera to the streets of Tel Aviv and began filming conversations with citizens and posting them on YouTube. Gil-Shuster wanted to improve dialogue between the two sides, as well as educate outsiders about the realities of the conflict. \u201cPart of the problem is Israelis and Palestinians are very cut off from each other,\u201d he told the Guardian. Instead of coming up with interview questions, Gil-Shuster decided to solicit them from internet users around the world. Thus the Ask an Israeli/Ask a Palestinian Project was born. His first video asked people in Tel Aviv what they thought of the idea of a one-state solution to the conflict. In the six years since, he has interviewed thousands of Israelis and Palestinians across hundreds of videos and has racked up 44m views on his channel. Use of the vox pop \u2013 from the Latin term vox populi meaning voice of the people \u2013 is a common journalistic tool to provide a snapshot of public opinion, but is rarely used on such a large scale; Gil-Shuster produces new videos every week. Gil-Shuster, who self-funds the project, says he has strict rules to ensure it remains as representative of public opinion as possible. Admitting it is not an exact science, he says he tries to randomly select \u201cthe most average\u201d people he can find on the street, ensuring a mix of different genders, ages and backgrounds. Soon after starting the project, Gil-Shuster went to the West Bank to seek the views of Palestinians, working with a Palestinian translator. The channel, which has more than 100,000 subscribers, has largely found popularity in Europe and the US. But Gil-Shuster says he often receives feedback from Palestine and other parts of the Arab world \u2013 some negative, some positive \u2013 with his videos getting a lot of hits in Saudi Arabia. Gil-Shuster, who works by day as an administrator at Tel Aviv University, does not shy away from asking the controversial or offensive questions requested by his viewers. If there is a common perception about an aspect of the conflict, he thinks there is value in putting it to people on street. \u201cAs a person involved in this conflict, I\u2019m trying to figure out where perception meets reality,\u201d he said. Once he has picked an interviewee, Gil-Shuster says all their answers are included in the video. \u201cPeople say horrible things that I think make Israelis and Palestinians look horrible. It has to be included.\u201d \u201cI never cut or edit anyone,\u201d he says. This pre-empts viewer criticism that he has chopped the videos to make a political point. He is variously accused of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian bias, depending on the video. But Gil-Shuster says he sees the project partly as a mirror for Israelis and Palestinians to hold up to themselves. He says the videos are a great way for foreigners to learn about the conflict. \u201cIf you want to understand a conflict, you need to know what it\u2019s about,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to know all those small issues that are happening.

Of course, individual actions are hugely important. But so is the work being done by scientists, social entrepreneurs, innovators and activists. And this week we had a little something from each. In the Amazon, as deforestation continues apace and the frontrunner in Brazil\u2019s presidential race eyes another swathe of destruction, we found scientists embarking on the long job of putting trees in the ground rather than taking them out. It\u2019s too early to say whether this is the start of something. But reforestation is catching on around the world: from New Zealand to China, from Europe to west Africa, people are planting hundreds of millions of trees. They\u2019re planting trees in India, too (remarkably, to celebrate the birth of girls) \u2013 but not nearly enough to make a difference to smog season, which is about to start in earnest. The reason air quality gets so bad at this time of year is partly down to the burning of farmland, to get rid of crop residue once the harvest is in. A number of enterprises have spotted a business opportunity in buying up the biomatter and turning it into useful stuff, as Rishika Pardikar found out.

Jungle rivers are ripped open into a delta of sand dunes and stagnant, discoloured ponds. Ant-sized bulldozers roll down mud paths on the soggy moonscape dotted with glinting corrugated iron rooftops. Amid the roar of the propellers, Cesar Ascorra eagerly points to a cluster of newly planted saplings in the sand. They are evenly spaced, like a polka dot pattern, but the area they cover is dwarfed by the swathe of destruction carved by illegal gold miners. \u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d says Ascorra. \u201cWe\u2019ve reforested 42 hectares (104 acres) of land deforested by illegal gold mining,\u201d he says. The amount, so far, may seem like a proverbial grain of sand in a desert of carnage. In this region of south-eastern Peru, there was more deforestation last year than ever: 9,860 hectares or 38% of the total amount. Since 1985, the uncontrolled alluvial mining has destroyed nearly 100,000 hectares of rainforest, according to the CINCIA Amazon research institution. But the damage goes beyond felling trees. Around 180 tonnes of mercury are dumped every year into the rivers, lakes and soils of the biodiversity hotspot which was visited by Pope Francis in January, according to studies by Peru\u2019s Artisanal Gold Council. As part of the reforestation experiment, scientists are trying out tree species which can survive in the sand left behind by mining. They are also using bio-char compost, made from locally grown Brazil nut shells, to block the absorption of mercury from the soil into the trees and to regenerate the topsoil. Among the saplings planted is the mighty shihuahuaco which could grow to be one of the tallest trees in the forest and is the preferred nesting place for the rare harpy eagle. Miles Silman, head of the Wake Forest Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainability which partners with CINCIA, says these are by far the largest trials of restoration on mined lands in the lowland tropics. The practice is not confined to Peru but is common in the forests of Brazil, Colombia and increasingly Venezuela, driven by its economic crisis. \u201cMining is about as destructive a land use as you could think of short of nuclear annihilation,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cBut, there are trajectories where it is a tragedy, full stop, and there are trajectories where you are left with a landscape that can heal for future uses.\u201d At this experimental stage, the scientists are \u201clooking at methods and technologies to address the problem at scale,\u201d he explains. The next step, he says, is to work with the miners and communities to \u201cimplement them at scale\u201d. The gold fever, which exploded after the 2008 global economic crisis and the metal\u2019s vertiginous price rise, has brought tens of thousands of fortune-seeking migrants to the jungle from poor Andean regions nearby. While the use of mercury is cavalier and commonplace, some miners have been persuaded to try out new machinery which uses gravity separation and bypasses the use of the toxic heavy metal to bind with the gold. \u201cThey get more gold,\u201d says Walter Torres, engineer with Peru\u2019s innovation and technology institute CITE, in Madre de Dios. \u201cAt the moment they (the miners) are getting around 50%, with these machines they can increase their yield to 80%. That\u2019s guaranteed.\u201d The mining corridor stretches like a festering wound along the basin of the Madre de Dios river, and has spread to other rivers. But there are still provinces untouched by mining, such as Tahuamanu, at the intersection of Peru, Bolivia and Brazil, which has become a model for sustainable forestry. Some 70% of the province is made up of logging operations approved by the Forestry Stewardship Council, says Nelson Kroll, manager of the 220,000-hectare Maderacre concession, which supplies sustainable timber, mainly to Europe. \u201cThe way to go forward has to do with science and technology,\u201d says Kurt Holle, the new director of WWF Peru who for two decades ran Rainforest Expeditions, an eco-tourism business in Madre de Dios. \u201cYou have to form citizens who want to do, rather than have to do, what is right for nature,\u201d he says, citing his experience in engaging an indigenous community in nature tourism and creating a natural buffer against mining. Mining\u2019s get-rich-quick appeal makes its spread seem inexorable, but some local people are fighting to secure their region\u2019s long term survival. \u201cWe bring the science closer to the people to help them solve everyday problems,\u201d says Ascorra. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of green and the green is hope.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Autumn in India is smog season, the worst time of year for some of the world\u2019s most polluted cities. There\u2019s a reason for this. In addition to everyday problems such as traffic, industry, domestic cooking and road dust, this is the time of year when farmers set fire to their post-harvest fields. It\u2019s called \u201cstubble burning\u201d \u2013 a cheap and easy way to deal with crop residue that needs clearing for the next planting season. Though technically illegal, it is rife across northern states like Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh \u2013 home to some of India\u2019s most polluted cities: Delhi, Kanpur, Ludhiana and Allahabad. Some estimates say that stubble burning contributes as much as one quarter of the air pollution in Delhi over the winter months. A study conducted by Harvard\u2019s John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences said: \u201cOn certain days, during peak fire season, air pollution in Delhi, which is located downwind of the fire, is about 20 times higher than the threshold for safe air as defined by WHO.\u201d But now a slew of private companies are coming up with a range of offerings they say can help. A Hamburg-based company called Bio-lutions has set up a factory near Bangalore to convert agricultural residue into fibres that can be used for packing material and tableware. The end products could also help tackle the burgeoning plastic crisis, as they are as cheap as plastic to produce, and take about three months to biodegrade. As proof of concept, the company ran a pilot for about a year and a half where about 750\u20131,000kg of agricultural waste was procured each month from a farmer located in Mandya, Karnataka and used to manufacture about 4,000 boxes, which were sold to Big Basket, India\u2019s largest online food and grocery store. \u201cMore than 95% of these farmers were burning such agricultural waste earlier,\u201d said Maheshchandra Guru, director of Vikasana, a sustainable agriculture NGO that works with Bio-lutions. \u201cVikasana pays about 500 rupees per tonne of residue collected and per acre of agricultural land generates about 4-5 tonnes of waste, so they earn about 1,500-2,000 rupees additional income each month,\u201d he adds. Other innovators are also working in the agricultural residue space. Papyrus Australia, an Australian company, has developed a technology that can convert the banana tree trunk into products like paper, packing material and furniture. The technology is especially welcome, considering the huge volume of farm waste on banana plantations in the world\u2019s biggest banana producer. New Leaf is another innovator company based in New Delhi that is helping farmers use farm waste like rice husk and coconut shells alongside biomass like dung cakes to extract renewable energy in order to power cold-storage and ripening facilities. \u201cThe storage facilities are completely off grid and do not require diesel generating sets,\u201d says Akash Agarwal, director and co-founder of New Leaf. \u201cThe machine uses about 40-90kg of waste a day to heat water, and using such hot water, it refrigerates 5,000-30,000kg of fruits and vegetables.\u201d Named GreenChill, the bio-waste based cold-storage system and ripening chamber is installed on farm. \u201cThe facility is completely automatic in the sense that the farmer only needs to dump the waste into the system and it takes care of the rest,\u201d Akash says. Sumanta Bagchi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, says that the rapid commercialisation of farm produce has resulted in a decline in the \u201cpastoral use of farm residue\u201d. \u201cWith initiatives like these, farm waste is being put to good use, especially considering how stubble burning contributes to air pollution,\u201d he said. Speaking about Delhi in particular, Bagchi notes that during winters, windless weather conditions help trap airborne pollutants to initiate a smog over the city. \u201cThe pollution from crop burning from in and around Delhi only adds to this problem. So, with innovations like these, one of the factors of air pollution can be mitigated.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

When the movie ends, the faces of nearly 500 children turn gloomy and tears fall down their cheeks. They come from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, and the time has come for them to return to their tents and metal containers in the squalid Moria camp on Lesbos. No one is getting out of here on a magic carpet. Dozens of the 3,000 minors here have attempted suicide because of overcrowding, squalor and their hopeless situation. But one man is trying to make things a little better for the children abandoned on Europe\u2019s doorstep. Moved by the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who made global headlines when his lifeless body was pictured lying face down on a Turkish beach, Salam Aldeen headed to Lesbos three years ago and dedicated his life to migrants. In a warehouse 200 metres from the camp, the Iraqi-Danish founder of the aid group Team Humanity constructed a playground, with inflatable castles and a small football pitch. Several hundred children arrive at 4pm, holding hands. \u201cIt was difficult for the children to leave behind what they were experiencing in the camp,\u2019\u2019 says Aldeen, who has recruited volunteers among the refugees in Moria. \u201cThey\u2019d watch their Syrian parents quarrel with their Afghan neighbours, and they\u2019d bring the same tensions into the playground. \u201cWe worked hard to try and convince them that in here, just as in the camp, we\u2019re all the same: no colours, no religions, just human beings. And you know what? They understood it better than the adults.\u201d In the evening, the volunteers set up a large screen where cartoons and films for children are shown in Arabic or Farsi. These are the final moments of peace for the children, who know that soon they will have to return to the camp, where the air is foul because rubbish is scattered everywhere and mothers sleep with knives under their pillows to defend themselves from rape. Ayat Abuznade, a 31-year-old Palestinian doctor who often visits Lesbos to volunteer, says the venture has given the children hope. \u201cI saw hope and happiness begin to light up in these children\u2019s eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cDay to day, I experienced children just being normal children, without any worry or fear showing in their eyes. This centre gives these children suffering hope and somewhat of a temporary normal life.\u201d Aldeen has also devoted himself to saving migrants on the perilous journey to Europe. His name has become known across the Middle East, spoken of by people in destroyed homes in Mosul or at camps in Syria and Jordan. In January 2016, he was arrested in Greece and accused of aiding illegal immigration because, according to the authorities, one day he went too close to the Turkish waters to search for two sinking migrant boats. He spent 48 hours in jail but faced a trial that lasted two years. He was acquitted of all charges in May 2018 and eventually resumed his work. A few weeks later, a Danish businessman asked him what he would do with a sizeable donation. \u201cI\u2019d build a playground,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cA place where the children of Lesbos could go back to being kids.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

An answer from Botswana", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/how-to-grapple-with-soaring-world-population-an-answer-from-down-south", "date": "2018-10-10", "transcript": "At the end of a dusty road in the southern African hinterland sits a small concrete building with an orange door. It is a structure so modest and remote that it is hard to believe it could hold lessons for addressing one of the world\u2019s biggest challenges. The unit is the medical hub for Gasita, a village of 2,000 people in the south of Botswana. Inside one of the rooms, pharmaceutical supplies are neatly stashed on shelves while a photograph of the country\u2019s president, Mokgweetsi Masisi, is propped up on a counter next to a window that is ajar, letting in a warm breeze. Outposts like these \u2013 offering family planning services, contraception, education \u2013 have helped bring about one of the world\u2019s most remarkable demographic shifts. In a continent where fertility rates are the highest in the world and populations are soaring, Botswana has a different story to tell. Fifty years ago, Botswanan women would have seven children on average. Now they have fewer than three. It\u2019s one of the fastest falling fertility rates anywhere in the world \u2013 a dramatic decline that merits scrutiny. The world\u2019s population is on track to hit 8 billion in 2023, and almost 10 billion by 2050. Sub-Saharan Africa is set to grow faster than anywhere: there were 1 billion Africans in 2010, but that number will grow to 2.5 billion by 2050. Some have warned that this growth risks \u201cdriving civilisation over the edge\u201d, a controversial view given that it is rich countries, not poor, that lead the way on consuming the world\u2019s resources. But enabling women to control their fertility \u2013 a move that almost inevitably leads to them having fewer babies \u2013 is not just about a tussle over resources, or the environment: it brings enormous ramifications for women\u2019s health, education and employment \u2013 with knock-on effects for society and the economy. So what did Botswana get right? *** In a ground floor office at the University of Botswana, in the country\u2019s capital of Gaborone, Dr Chelsea Morroni considers the issue. \u201cEveryone is always asking how did this happen?\u201d An expert in international sexual and reproductive health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Morroni has lived in Botswana with her family for five years. As founder and director of the Botswana Sexual and Reproductive Health Initiative, she spends her days delving into issues around fertility and contraception. But Morroni says understanding Botswana\u2019s dramatic fertility decline involves teasing apart a complex web of factors. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge amount of change in Botswana,\u201d she says, pointing out that since Botswana became an independent country in 1966 the landscape developed quickly, with high levels of economic growth and development of both healthcare infrastructure and education infrastructure, enabling young women to become educated and have employment opportunities. \u201cAll of those things on the macro level are really important to fertility declines anywhere in the world,\u201d says Morroni, whose work is part of the Botswana UPenn Partnership: a collaboration between the Botswana health ministry, the University of Botswana and the University of Pennsylvania. But the country made more direct strides, too. \u201cBotswana also was very proactive in the early years in establishing a family planning programme, so in setting up a programme that was far-reaching in terms of its geographical reach, providing access to most people in the country to a range of contraceptive methods,\u201d says Morroni. Maternal and child health and family planning services were integrated from the outset more than 40 years ago. A suite of contraceptives are now available through facilities ranging from the most rural health posts to urban hospitals. An NGO, the Botswana Family Welfare Association (Bofwa), works with the government to reach out to even the most rural of locations around the country to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services, particularly among young people. There are other considerations, too. The infant mortality rate decreased from 97.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1971 to 17 in 2011, while an increasing proportion of the population living in urban settings could also play a role: fertility rates are generally higher in rural areas. And there is another issue. \u201cBotswana \u2026 has been very hard hit by HIV, one of the hardest hit countries in the world,\u201d says Morroni. And as she points out, research suggests there is an association between HIV infection and reduced fertility, although how much of contribution that has made to the steep fertility decline is very difficult to say. \u201cLuckily with the advent of universal access to antiretroviral therapy we are seeing a narrowing of the gap between fertility in HIV infected and uninfected people which is really, really a step in the right direction,\u201d she says. All of which mean that women like Chyna are becoming statistically rarer. \u201cI have seven children and all the time I was bearing these seven children, there was never a break in between eight years,\u201d says the 30-year-old, sitting inside the Gasita room, the fabric around her hair bright with the colours of the Botswana flag. A single mother, Chyna found respite from multiple pregnancies through the work of Bofwa. \u201cI eventually got to find out about the implant from Bofwa \u2013 I asked for help because the pregnancies were getting out of hand and, knowing myself, if it wasn\u2019t for the implant I would still be pregnant now,\u201d says Chyna, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cI am very, very grateful. My only problem is that I have got so many kids that I can barely take care of [them]. They need clothing, they need to be fed.\u201d While the health post is government run, Bofwa makes a visit about once a quarter to Gasita and nine other settlements around Kanye, led by nurse and midwife Phenyo Ntoko. These outposts are replicated across rural Botswana, where women are increasingly keen to embrace contraception, including the implant which sits in the upper arm and lasts for years. Their priorities are as individual as the women themselves. For some it is about preventing pregnancies at an early age, for others the main goal is to space children. Many women gathered at the health posts said they only want two, with many years between them to help them raise their first child well. Despite the complex range of factors behind the dramatic fertility decline, and the fact that different countries have different political histories and cultural and social influences that make comparisons difficult, Morroni believes other nations could take a leaf out of Botswana\u2019s book. \u201cFrom my perspective it is really about having the political will for the development and implementation of a high quality family planning programme with reach,\u201d she says. A World Bank report on Botswana\u2019s fertility revolution says myriad other factors contribute to a more measured approach to family planning: the education of girls, encouraging women to enter in the workforce, and reaching individuals in their homes by means of visits by family welfare educators. Una Ngwenya, the chief executive of Bofwa, agrees that the family welfare educators were a key factor behind the fertility decline. But, she adds that national averages don\u2019t tell the whole story. \u201cWhere I work, mothers still have six kids,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople tell you in Botswana you have an average of women having two kids \u2013 I ask you, where? I cannot see that. \u201cWe are one of the most unequal countries in the world \u2013 what happens here in the big villages and in the cities, does not necessarily happen in Lorolwane,\u201d she adds, referring to a remote village beyond Gasita, as yet without electricity. A member association of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Bofwa receives core funding from the organisation, as well as some government funding and contraceptive commodities and antiretroviral drugs from Botswana\u2019s Ministry of Health and Wellness. Other partners include the Positive Action for Children Fund from private firm ViiV Healthcare. \u201cWe have five centres,\u201d Ngwenya says, ticking off sites around the country. \u201cIt gives me satisfaction to see a group of girls speaking very confidently about how they want to make their choices.\u201d Ngwenya rejects the idea that contraception is being pushed on women, pointing out that communities are impatient for Bofwa to work with them. \u201cIt used to be difficult to go into a community and talk about about contraception. Now they even [say] \u2018hey you are taking too long, come to our community, we need you people here, now\u2019,\u201d she says. But Bofwa has had to close at least two centres because of Donald Trump\u2019s reinstatement of the controversial \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d which prevents US federal funds going to any group that performs or even provides information about abortions. Among the Bofwa services suspended are projects specifically engaging with populations, including sex workers and men who have sex with men, as well as another working with vulnerable children. \u201cAh, that was such a blow,\u201d says Ngwenya with a sigh. \u201cThe impact of the gag rule was so much on the clients, but also on Bofwa\u2019s reputation. It really impacted our work in a very negative manner.\u201d Bofwa does not provide abortions, but it does counsel women who might be seeking one \u2013 which is legal under certain conditions in Botswana \u2013 and those who have had an abortion. \u201cFor me, it is rewarding to see Bofwa help one girl to terminate a pregnancy that came from incest,\u201d says Ngwenya, adding that improving understanding of when abortion is currently legal is important. \u201cWe want the community to know their rights,\u201d she says, noting that the team see cases of young teenagers becoming pregnant. \u201cOur research tells us there is a lot of need here. What has happened to these kids? Could it be rape, could it be defilement?\u201d Nonetheless, Ngwenya is sanguine. \u201cBofwa is a very resilient organisation, we have been here for 30 years and we will go on for a good while to come.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Raising his head, he saw that Missira, his village in southern Senegal, was burning. Marina ran towards the fire. The children were still in the village, being babysat by his eldest daughter, Satou. Gathering them up, he and the whole family ran through the forest and over the border into Senegal\u2019s tiny southern neighbour, Guinea-Bissau. That was in 1991. They have never been back to Missira. Ever since, they have lived with thousands of others in limbo in Guinea-Bissau, waiting for a nearly four-decade conflict to end. Now, they are on the verge of becoming full Guinean citizens, as beneficiaries of a sweeping policy that stands in stark contrast to many countries\u2019 reluctance to take in those fleeing war, persecution and poverty. Seven thousand refugees will join Guinea-Bissau\u2019s 1.8 million citizens, equivalent to the UK naturalising 256,000 refugees at a stroke. The government made the declaration last December and approved it in July. Since then the UN refugee agency has been working with a local contractor to produce and distribute ID cards, naturalisation and birth certificates for the refugees and their children, most of whom have never known any other home except the verdant, Creole-speaking, gumbe-playing country they grew up in. \u201cThey were facing the risk of being stateless because of having no documents,\u201d said Mamadou Lamine Diop, the UNHCR\u2019s recently appointed chief of mission in Guinea-Bissau. \u201cIt can be a lesson to others: how Guinea-Bissau managed to get rid of its caseload.\u201d When he arrived, Diop realised that a major obstacle to getting the refugees naturalised was the astronomical amount the government wanted in order to turn each one into a citizen \u2013 900,000 CFA (\u00a31,230) per person. Under his leadership, the UNHCR managed to negotiate down to 150,000 CFA. UNHCR is trying to raise this amount \u2013 $2m (\u00a31.52m) in total \u2013 from donors. Without it the organisation cannot start processing ID cards. \u201cJust imagine how much money we can save and redirect to other people in need,\u201d Diop said. As well as the money, dysfunctional Guinea-Bissau hopes to reap a much-needed reputation boost with the policy. Before the villagers fled, armed rebels fighting for the independence of Senegal\u2019s southern strip had been coming to Missira regularly, demanding animals and warning people to get out. When they arrived in Guinea-Bissau, Marina and his family headed straight for the village of Pelundo, where they had old family ties dating from colonialist days, when Guineans used to go and work in French peanut fields. They were a hungry, ragged group by the time they got there. \u201cWe only had the farming clothes we were standing up in,\u201d said Marina, now a meticulous 73-year-old who became the village chronicler, keeping track of local fortunes in large notebooks. \u201cWe managed to take the children. That was all.\u201d Nevertheless, he said, Pelundo welcomed them in. \u201cThe villagers here said we had complete equality,\u201d he said. \u201cThey even gave us posts \u2013 I was the secretary of the village football club.\u201d He gestured at Pelundo\u2019s simple earthen streets and its veranda-ringed houses. \u201cThis was common land. If you had the money, you could build a house on it.\u201d Marina is looking forward to being a citizen \u2013 he cannot imagine ever being able to return to Senegal. \u201cI don\u2019t dare go back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rebels come and go \u2013 you think it\u2019s peaceful and suddenly they strike.\u201d For Satou, his daughter, naturalisation is less about safety and more about identity. Now 39, she was babysitting at the age of 12 when the rebels came to burn down their village. \u201cMy ID is Senegalese, but now I\u2019m Guinean,\u201d she said, balancing a baby on her hip. \u201cI\u2019m from here. I wouldn\u2019t want to go back. The villagers see us as locals now \u2013 in fact they always have done.\u201d Their old village, Missira, is one of 64 that have been wiped off the Senegalese map. Scouts who have gone to look for it say the streets have become forest and the houses are completely gone. The only way you can tell it was once inhabited is by the clustered fruit trees that drop their mangoes on the forest floor, with no one there to eat them. With the Marinas now happily integrated in Pelundo, Missira will probably stay that way. But not all of the refugees in Guinea-Bissau feel the same. Some still long for home, decades after leaving \u2013 not every village has been as generous as Pelundo. In Tarero, as the families who fled expand, land is running out. \u201cAs you harvest your crops, the locals are sowing theirs right behind you,\u201d said Lansana Tiara. \u201cThere is hospitality, but it\u2019s limited.\u201d Land rights are often a highly contentious issue for newly minted citizens, as in the case of Tanzania when it offered 200,000 Burundian refugees citizenship in 2015. Guinea-Bissau\u2019s $270 per refugee includes a sum for integration, to which land is key, but it cannot solve all land-related problems. For many, the border between the two countries is a frustrating colonial relic, and the whereabouts of \u201chome\u201d is complicated. \u201cIn colonial times, my father was forced to work planting trees in Guinea-Bissau, so the whites could walk in the shade,\u201d said Nfally Tiana, puffing on a pipe in his 1970s-style flowery robes. \u201cHe ran away to Senegal. I fled Senegal to come here.\u201d Tiana\u2019s father told him stories of the time before colonialism and borders, when after work, the men used to rest under a large tamarind tree. \u201cMaybe if this had never happened, we\u2019d be sitting under that tree now,\u201d he said.

But nestled in the Bohemian hinterland, the Pivovar Ch\u0159\u00ed\u010d is not your average brewery. For one thing, it is staffed almost entirely by mentally and physically impaired workers. For another, it diverts all its profits to funding a primary school. Petr Jakubicek is the brains behind the enterprise, tucked away in a village 50 miles west of Prague. A brewery was established on the site in 1573 before being closed by the Nazi occupation authorities in 1943 in a move to requisition grain to feed German forces on the eastern front. It was later converted into a collective agricultural enterprise and stripped of its beer-making machinery by the communist authorities who came to power in what was then Czechoslovakia after the second world war. Reopened in 2016, it is once again producing beer, courtesy of a workforce previously unable to find work because of their disabilities. The idea for the enterprise was hatched by Jakub\u00ed\u010dek and his wife Jana as they sought a business model that could provide work and meaning for disabled people in the area, mostly resident in a state facility in the nearby village of Zavidov. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem in this country that we have social institutions that are full of people physically capable of working,\u201d said Jakub\u00ed\u010dek, 39, an NGO specialist from Prague with experience of devising programmes for the disabled. The initial plan was for a sheltered workshop producing wood or ceramic products, before commercial opportunities in what is the world\u2019s most enthusiastic beer-drinking nation pushed the project in a different direction. \u201cWe had a business manager who was worried about how to get out of the red,\u201d explains Jakub\u00ed\u010dek who revived the long-derelict brewery facility with the help of Propolis, a Czech civic group. \u201cWe had some examples of good practices regarding social business plans. With wood and ceramics, you may find customers buying it once, but with beer we knew they would want to buy it forever.\u201d Wheeling crates of beer from a cooling room, Va\u0161ek Stark acknowledged his debt of gratitude to the enterprise. Stark, 62, has resumed full-time work for the first time since he was 20, when his career as a specialist machine operator was ended by a road accident that left him with serious brain injuries. \u201cI like the idea that the brewery is here,\u201d said Stark, one of about 20 mentally and physically impaired workers. \u201cI would have liked to have worked before but I couldn\u2019t because I had to take care of my parents.\u201d Workers fulfil a variety of tasks, including bottling, labelling, cleaning and delivering, on the basis of individual suitability, and the production process is overseen by a seasoned brewer with 40 years\u2019 experience. All receive a minimum wage of 12,200 Czech koruna (\u00a3420 a month), with the higher skilled earning more. More valuable, says Jakubi\u010dek, is the esteem gained by the workers. \u201cThe most important thing is that working here gives them a sense of pride,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gets them out of the institution, where some residents are more severely handicapped. Some of them might not know the value of money, but most of them can read and write.\u201d The result is a thriving brewery producing half-a-dozen varieties of lager, stout and ale \u2013 including an IPA called Mahatma in honour of Gandhi \u2013 which is sold to pubs and licensed premises in cities such as Prague and Plzen. Demand is increasing, Jakub\u00ed\u010dek says, thanks to word of mouth and customer satisfaction in a highly competitive Czech beer market dominated by long-established breweries such as Pilsner Urquell, Kru\u0161ovice and Staropramen, all of which have been bought by foreign owners in recent years. About 120,000 litres (240,000 pints) of beer have been produced so far this year, with plans to increase production and perhaps recruit more workers. The profits have helped fund the establishment of a primary school next to the brewery, filling a gap left by the closure of the village\u2019s previous state school 10 years ago. Eighteen pupils \u2013 aged from six to 10 \u2013 are taught in a single classroom along non-traditional teaching principles based on Montessori methods, overseen by Jakubicek\u2019s wife, Jana, a qualified teacher.

Twenty women have embarked on the six-month intensive programme run by the Muslim Council of Britain, aimed at equipping them for leadership positions. As well as one-to-one mentoring, the women will visit \u201cbest-practice mosques\u201d and be given media and public speaking training. A national conference in Manchester this weekend on the future of mosques, organised by the MCB, will include a session on the participation of women on boards of trustees and other bodies running places of worship and community programmes. Few mosques in the UK have women on their trustee or management boards, and men outnumber women on all charity trustee boards by two to one, according to the Charity Commission. The MCB said: \u201cThis lack of diversity is unacceptable and it is essential for the management boards of mosques and third sector organisations in general to reflect the communities that they serve in order to function effectively.\u201d The initiative comes as some Muslim women are demanding equal access to and greater involvement in running mosques. More than a quarter of mosques in the UK have no facilities for women, and in the remainder access is often restricted and the space they are allocated is limited. In August, Scottish Muslim women launched a campaign for equal prayer space and inclusion in decision-making bodies. The Scottish Mosques for All campaign said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that many mosques fail to provide basic access for Muslim women to use the facility to pray, or the quality of the space can often be inadequate and not suitable. \u201cIt is also unfortunate that many mosques have limited or no women present at mosque trustee or managerial level, either intentionally preventing women from taking up these roles or not sufficiently providing a welcoming atmosphere where women feel comfortable to get involved. The place and role of women in mosques is in real crisis in the UK and elsewhere, and this status quo must change.\u201d Another organisation, Open My Mosque, is calling for a commitment from mosques to equality, and the Bradford-based Muslim Women\u2019s Council is raising funds for a mosque led and governed by women, \u201cbased on the principles of openness, inclusivity, social justice and sanctuary\u201d. Andleen Razzaq, a former trustee of Al Manaar mosque in west London, who is lead facilitator of the MCB\u2019s women in mosques development programme, said: \u201cMuslim women are doing amazing work in the community, but often have no experience of being trustees or on decision-making bodies. We need to have big conversations around the barriers to women. Most are cultural; in Islam, men and women have equal spiritual standing. \u201cWe can see the direction things are moving in. Women are feeling more empowered \u2013 their voices cannot be ignored, the momentum is definitely there. Young women in particular are hungry for change. If men won\u2019t welcome them, women will be tempted to create their own spaces.\u201d All mosques should \u201creflect the values of equality, inclusivity and diversity\u201d, she added. Ghazalla Hussain, who is taking part in the programme, said it was helping her build her confidence and \u201cbelieve in myself a bit more\u201d. \u201cA lot of mosque committees don\u2019t understand what women want or need. But I think they know times are changing, and they have to change too,\u201d she said. In a speech on International Women\u2019s Day in March, Harun Khan, the MCB\u2019s secretary general, backed calls for gender equality. It was \u201ctime to ensure that everyone understands their own responsibility in achieving equal access and opportunities for men and women in British society today\u201d, he said. Referring to domestic violence, pay inequality, abuse and harassment, he said: \u201cCloser to home, why is Muslim civil society still full of many mosques that only have prayer spaces for men and none for women, as if to imply that prayer and a sense of community is only for men?\u201d The marginalisation of women in mosques was \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d, Khan added. The MCB\u2019s training programme for women will be reviewed at the end of the current pilot scheme, and there are plans to offer a similar programme to men in the future.

The short-stay school would provide children aged four to seven with therapy and education to prepare them to rejoin mainstream schooling. The proposed Your Place academy in Norwich has had input from leading psychiatrists and psychologists and aims to create a template that could be copied elsewhere. Harmful early experiences including physical, sexual or emotional abuse, loss of a parent or exposure to drugs or alcohol in the womb can have a significant impact on a child\u2019s social and emotional development. Schools often respond with behaviour management approaches such as isolation booths or, if those fail, expulsion. Existing alternative provision tends to be for older children and of variable quality. Daniel Thrower, an executive headteacher with the Wensum Trust, the academy chain behind the proposal, said: \u201cChildren experiencing significant early-life trauma have been typically failed in UK schools. This is not the school\u2019s fault. \u201cWe wish to use and build on the knowledge we have gained through a two-year pilot project and combine this with the findings of the latest brain-based research, to support those children more effectively and, through the training arm of the school, educate and support fellow professionals.\u201d The pilot project, funded by Norfolk county council, resulted in 83% of children with the highest level of need avoiding exclusion. However, the pilot \u2013 an outreach project \u2013 also demonstrated the need for a permanent facility. Anne Oakley, who works with children with developmental trauma and attachment difficulties in Norfolk schools and is part of the Your Place team, said: \u201cThe work we do has to be repetitive because you\u2019re altering the structure of the brain, so it has to be really regular. Rather than the bolted-on once-a-week session it has to be many times a day. That\u2019s the real difference.\u201d As well as helping troubled children and their families by preventing exclusions, the Your Place team estimates it can deliver \u00a38.7m of savings within five years. If one were opened in each of the 152 local education authorities in England and Wales, this would translate to \u00a31.3bn over the same period. The benefit over the longer term would be far greater as the figures do not take account of potential costs such as demands on the health, welfare and criminal justice systems. The proposal is for a school with 32 places, half of which would be full-time, with referrals from social workers, teachers or parents. Pupils would be accompanied by a key person from their mainstream school, most commonly a teaching assistant, who would help them transition smoothly between the two sites. Thrower anticipates most children would attend for a term or two before being ready to rejoin their mainstream school. The school would work with families to ensure the home environment is stable and outreach provision would continue, including with former pupils. The academy is waiting for the backing of Norfolk county council to submit an application to the Department for Education next month. If successful, it could open in the 2019-20 school year. Peter Fonagy, the chief executive of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families (AFNCCF), said at least 50 years\u2019 worth of research had shown the impact of early life trauma on subsequent development. \u201cSchool is probably the most important and appropriate platform for intervention available to us in society,\u201d he said. \u201cSo making a school for these children therapeutic is, to me, the only logical solution we can offer these children to rescue them and ensure they have the life they deserve to have.\u201d Fonagy has advised the project and, if it comes to fruition, the AFNCCF and University College London, where he is head of psychology, will carry out research on the outcomes for its pupils. Other backers include Adoption UK \u2013 adopted children have typically had adverse early experiences and are disproportionately excluded from school \u2013 and Dr Bruce Perry, a psychiatrist at the Child Trauma Academy in Houston. Thrower said responses from parents had been positive, with some even wanting to move to Norwich so their children could attend. Chloe Smith, the Conservative MP for Norwich North, who helped secure the backing of all Norfolk MPs for the project, said: \u201cUnfortunately in Norfolk we have a disproportionately high number of excluded children and this is the kind of solution I think can be good for our county but also revolutionary nationwide.\u201d Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Norfolk and a health minister in the coalition government until 2015, said the trailblazing nature of the proposed school meant it did not fit neatly into the current education framework, particularly for funding, but he hoped it would get the go-ahead. \u201cNorfolk, through a gap analysis, identified the need for more provision for trauma children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe resulting pilot study funded by the local authority was so successful and cited the need for the school. I am sure the successes Norfolk have had will help them overcome the funding challenge and use the savings already generated to support the school.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Who hasn\u2019t kidded themselves that they really are going to touch up all those grubby spots with the leftovers in years to come? With an estimated 50m litres of paint going to waste each year in the UK (that\u2019s enough to fill 20 Olympic swimming pools), we are all guilty. No wonder the average home is thought to have at least 17 half-empty pots gathering cobwebs under the stairs. Enter Community RePaint, a network of 74 projects which aims to reduce the paint going to landfill. Founded in Leeds the network wants to cut household hazardous waste and provide a cheap way for charities, community groups and low-income households to freshen up their walls and woodwork. Like the repair cafes that fix broken appliances the movement is growing fast as people turn away from the throwaway culture and try to put less in the rubbish bin. One of the largest RePaint schemes is run by ReciproCity, a social enterprise on the Wirral which has evolved from a building materials swap shop into a budget decorators\u2019 paradise. Last year they received 81,100 litres of paint, donated by members of the public, manufacturers and trade wholesalers. The paint is piled high inside their warehouse near Birkenhead, a democratic jumble of brands and finishes: 2.5 litres of Little Greene traditional oil gloss in Bone China (RRP \u00a365) sharing a shelf with the Wilko equivalent, Pearl Grey, which costs barely a tenth of the price. In the RePaint world all paint is equal, whether recommended in Elle Decoration or sold in B&amp;M Bargains. All paint brands are sold here for \u00a31.20 a litre and sample pots are ten for a pound. Before resale the paint is checked by ReciproCity\u2019s eight members of staff to ensure there is no mould and that it is exactly what it says on the tin, says Rebecca Owens, who set up ReciproCity 10 years ago with her partner, Mike Close. It is pot luck whether they have the colour you are after and in the right quantity. But that is where their new paint recycling project comes in. Two years ago they joined forces with a company called Newlife, whose founder, Keith Harrison, an industrial chemist, cracked the enigma code of the paint world: how to reprocess waste paint back to a superior grade emulsion. Harrison patented the process and guards it jealously; the Guardian was not allowed to take close-up photos of the equipment or ingredients, lest his rivals figure out his secret. But what we can tell you is that it involves big plastic barrels, a massive whisk, some sort of filter and a sprinkle of additives to increase shelf life. \u201cMike says it\u2019s a mixture of art and science,\u201d says Owens, who professes herself a \u201crubbish\u201d paint reprocessor. \u201cI tried to make a duck egg and it turned out navy. It\u2019s not a job for monkeys. There\u2019s a definite art to mixing the colours.\u201d The recycled range, called ReColour, has a selection of 20 shades with the requisite silly names: silver sonnet (a mid grey), gilbert green (mossy), powder puff (a Germolene pink). A 5-litre tub of colour costs \u00a39 and it\u2019s \u00a36 for white or magnolia; a bargain compared with commercial prices \u2013 5 litres of Farrow and Ball\u2019s Sulking Room Pink is now a staggering \u00a378. Prices are even cheaper for charity shops who buy wholesale to sell on to their customers. Greys are the top-seller locally. \u201cWe can\u2019t get enough grey,\u201d said Owens. \u201cApparently we sell a lot more red than the other ReColour outlets down south too.\u201d Last year ReciproCity managed to redistribute 65,100 litres of the paint it had received \u2013 28,500 of which were recycled into ReColour. Owens\u2019 only frustration is that they end up sending all the empty plastic tubs to landfill (though the metal tins can often be recycled). Anyone can buy ReColour, regardless of income. But some housing associations give new tenants vouchers to buy the paint when they move into a property. In Greater Manchester, the RePaint branch is operated by Rochdale Boroughwide Housing, which offers a 10% discount to its residents. You have to put any paint snobbery to one side when buying ReColour. A look around the Wirral paint mixing plant shows what a mongrel the finished product can be: the batch of Bailey Blue that Close has just finished appears to be a mixture of Crown, Dulux and Homebase own brand, all from tubs with less than a litre left upon donation. But feedback from decorators is good, says Owens. \u201cWe would never use a whole barrel of budget paint to make a batch of ReColour because it would be too watery,\u201d she says, while issuing a warning to those who always believe you get what you pay for. \u201cWe have learnt a lot about the quality of what\u2019s on the market. I can\u2019t name names but there are some budget paints which are much better than you might think \u2013 and vice versa.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

An Ipsos survey found, for example, that 90% of teenagers in Kenya, Mexico, China and Nigeria were hopeful about the future. \u201cYoung people believe in the Nigerian dream,\u201d said Olasupo Abideen, a social activist. \u201cWe are trying to change the rhetoric around how Nigeria is being perceived.

Half the world away, in the north of England, the problems young people face concern not just jobs but homes as well. Our reporter Mattha Busby caught up with a social enterprise trying to kill those two birds with one stone. Speaking of two birds and one stone, a British charity called Think Ahead is trying to do something about the lack of mental health resources and career opportunities for young people. Its first cohort of young mental health social workers graduated on Friday, as our reporter Ammar Kalia found out. What we liked With the anniversary of the #MeToo movement pulling into view, the Christian Science Monitor took a global look at all kinds of ways of teaching men how to treat women with respect, from anger management classes in Mexico to lapel badges on Japanese schoolgirls\u2019 coats.

What we heard This is what happens when the media, our guardian, dig in deeply to the lives of the everyday people. We learn about the wonderful things going on.

But it is exactly the kind of work that Britain, with its mental illness epidemic and social care crisis, urgently needs. As of today, there will be almost 100 new mental health social workers entering the workforce \u2013 the first graduates of a two-year programme run by Think Ahead, a fast-track training scheme. \u201cMental health social work is not a profession which historically people coming straight out of university would\u2019ve known about,\u201d says Natalie Acton, co-founder of the charity, which has almost 300 recruits training to graduate in future years. Social work may have long fallen out of fashion, but Acton says there were 23 applicants for each place \u201cshowing there\u2019s a real demand for this kind of work amongst young people\u201d. Chambers-Cook\u2019s experience helps explain why. She was working for a pharmaceuticals recruitment company, but felt like an outsider because of her values and ethics. She wanted to work for disadvantaged people \u201cand agitate for them on the frontline\u201d, an aspiration that chimes with the broad values and sensibilities of a generation. The average age of the first cohort of Think Ahead graduates was 26 \u2013 almost half the age of the 45-year-old average of social workers as a whole in the UK. For Alec Tooms, 23, social work is the perfect environment for young people to flourish in. \u201cYoung people have the opportunity to challenge the status quo,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019ve been supported to pilot new ideas because social work is all about change and adapting to the people we\u2019re working with.\u201d There is a pressing need for increased adult mental health care . According to the latest Care Quality Commission research, the number of NHS mental health nurses fell by 12% between 2010 and 2017, while the total number of detentions under the Mental Health Act rose by 26% in 2012-16. Councils made \u00a3420m of cuts to adult social care in 2015-16 alone. One in six social workers left their jobs in 2016 and 11% of vacancies remained unfilled. All this means 400,000 fewer adults are receiving social care compared with 2010. High-profile childcare social work scandals, such as the Baby Peter case and the historical abuse in Telford, have compounded the situation by tarnishing the public\u2019s perception of the career. Yet young people continue to train in social work. Last year, applications for social studies degrees were the fourth highest among all courses. Maisie Satchwell-Hirst, 23, is a Think Ahead graduate who works with psychosis patients in Cambridge. She says the positives of the job far outweigh the negatives: \u201cIt\u2019s a real privilege to be allowed into people\u2019s lives and their private spaces. It lets us work in a holistic way and actually make a difference.\u201d Chambers-Cook adds: \u201cNormally you might be seen as an intruder, but the fact that most people welcome you allows you to help them in so many ways.\u201d This help has resulted in Chambers-Cook\u2019s earlier client making a significant recovery in hospital. She is also pleased with the outcome in another case: \u201cA young person using our support now doesn\u2019t feel the need to be taking her medication anymore; she feels empowered and has even set up her own fitness company where she is thriving.\u201d The learning curve has been steep. Satchwell-Hirst says: \u201cSince I look quite young, I was worried about going to people\u2019s homes and advising them. I would wonder how anyone could take me seriously.\u201d For Tooms, his age was also an initial concern because he mostly works with older people. However, he says: \u201cOverall, people are just happy to have someone coming to see them and to have a conversation with.\u201d Satchwell-Hirst has found that \u201cin a professional capacity, people trust my training to put me on an equal footing\u201d. While Think Ahead is not the only scheme to draw graduates into social work \u2013 there is Frontline which trains childcare social workers and the government\u2019s own Step Up to Social Work traineeship \u2013 it is the only one to specifically address adult mental health. With one in six adults in the UK currently experiencing mental health problems and suicide the most common cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 49, it is a field that still needs attention. \u201cThere\u2019s no double standard with mental health,\u201d Tooms says, \u201cit affects the people we work with and it can affect us, too.\u201d Now recruiting for their fourth intake, Think Ahead is looking towards expansion into several new mental health trusts in England. \u201cYou won\u2019t always get a thank you and that isn\u2019t why we do it,\u201d says Chambers-Cook. \u201cIn a way, saying goodbye to people and discharging them is our biggest reward.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

They have been bleached white by marine heatwaves and killed off en masse by a combination of factors including pollution, overfishing, acidification and climate change. But now scientists in Florida, and other tropical locations worldwide, are attempting to stop the rot by creating coral \u201cnurseries\u201d in which young populations can be raised in controlled conditions before being planted on denuded reefs. Off the southern tip of Florida, a sprawling marine farming operation has been established in which corals are painstakingly grown on anchored fibreglass trees and then planted on the barrier reef. \u201cThe idea is to do as much as we can now to give these coral populations a fighting chance,\u201d says Jessica Levy, programme manager at the Coral Restoration Foundation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t put back the material and diversity that has been lost, the populations are going to crash and become extinct. For reefs, you\u2019re looking at a global extinction of the ecosystem if things don\u2019t change quickly.\u201d Florida has the world\u2019s third largest barrier reef, with nearly 1,400 species of plants and animals and 500 species of fish, but the reef is vanishing fast. Research found that roughly half of the reef has disappeared over the past 250 years. Coverage of acropora, the primary genus of reef-building corals, has plummeted by 97%. \u201cThe reef is pretty barren right now,\u201d says Levy. The maladies are numerous and stretch back decades. A burgeoning Floridian population and mass tourism have led to water pollution and direct damage to corals, while agriculture has sent torrents of nutrients flowing on to the reef. Although regulations have curbed some of these local risks, climate change remains a big threat. In 2014 a spike in water temperatures led the Florida corals to bleach \u2013 when a reef expels its symbiotic algae under heat stress, whitens and potentially dies. It happened again in 2015, as a prolonged global bleaching event gripped the planet\u2019s corals. Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef was cooked to the point that it reportedly smelled of death. The world is on course for a temperature increase that will comfortably wipe out most of the coral ecosystems, a scenario that would strip away a crucial nursery and smorgasbord for countless marine species, diminish fisheries and remove a vital coastal buffer to storms that will intensify as the planet warms. \u201cThe outlook for the Florida reef is pretty grim,\u201d says Kim Cobb, a coral expert at Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cThe threats are overwhelming. Just as the reef is climbing out of decades of systemic problems it is under increasing threat from climate change.\u201d The Coral Restoration Foundation has increased the replanting of corals as the situation has deteriorated, and the foundation\u2019s underwater trees are becoming sought-after items for stressed reefs around the world. Partnerships have formed to provide trees to places such as Jamaica and Colombia. A chartered fishing operation in Mexico is in talks to do the same. This month, it was announced that 100 corals had been successfully planted on the Great Barrier Reef, the world\u2019s largest living structure, using the coral tree frames. The operation came about after tropical fish collector Ken Nedimyer noticed a rare type of coral called Acropora cervicronis growing on his live rock farm in 2003. A loophole in endangered species laws meant the coral was his to keep, so he began cutting it up to grow new coral from the fragments. Nedimyer hoped to regrow enough coral to start patching up Florida\u2019s reef. Initially, the fragments were mounted on sunken concentric blocks that mimicked reefs. But the real breakthrough came in 2011 with the development of fabricated trees on which dozens of pieces of coral can be dangled from the branches. Backed by funding from the federal government and concerned donors, the foundation now has around 700 trees arranged in seven nurseries along the reef system as far as Ernest Hemingway\u2019s old haunt of Key West. Retrieved fragments of wild coral are sliced into finger-sized pieces, sorted into genomic types and strung from the fibreglass and PVC trees, which are anchored to the seabed and buoyed with a float. Alongside the staghorn and elkhorn corals, swaying gently on lines in the currents, are boulder-covering corals that are mounted on nearby platforms. This environment lets the corals grow three times faster than normal. Even so, it takes up to nine months for them to reach the size of a small football, at which point they are taken to be attached to an appropriate reef using a special putty. Diversity is key, says Levy. While some other projects are experimenting with heat-resistant corals that can cope with occasionally warming waters, the foundation hopes a range of coral candidates will produce survivors. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put all our eggs in the heat tolerance basket,\u201d she says. The aim is for the corals to take root, connect and spawn with each other. So far in 2018 more than 18,000 corals have been planted on to reefs, double that achieved annually five years ago. Around eight in 10 planted corals survive at least a year. This work is laborious and occasionally fraught. The trees need to be regularly cleaned of detritus, while around 300 coral genotypes across nine species must be sorted and tagged. Regrown coral can be swiftly wiped out by hot or cold snaps, storms or disease. Hurricane Irma stripped corals off the trees, although the structures themselves were almost all unscathed. \u201cWe lost a fair bit of stock with Irma,\u201d says Levy. \u201cThis work can be very hard as well as very rewarding. You plant corals and watch them grow for several years and then something out of your control like bleaching can happen. \u201cIt just makes us go for the numbers \u2013 the more corals we get out there the more diverse it will be and the better chance something is going to survive past the continued stress.\u201d The largest of the nurseries, located three miles off the Key Largo coast, has around 500 trees, which look a bit like giant, antiquated TV aerials. Branching staghorn and elkhorn coral dangle from the trees just 10ft underwater. A constellation of marine life, such as trumpet fish, hog fish and trigger fish, flit between the trees. A nearby reef site is dotted with replanted corals bearing the tags of the Coral Restoration Foundation, although the overall coral coverage is scant. The bleak scene is completed by stands of lifeless pillar coral, ravaged by a bacterial disease that swept through the Keys last summer. A nearby brain coral is split by jagged white lines, further evidence of disease. The origins of many coral diseases are vague but at least one major outbreak has been linked to human faecal waste: the Keys only gained a fully functioning sewer system during the past decade. Recent research has found that these diseases will worsen as the oceans warm. The scale of the foundation\u2019s task is \u201cmonumental\u201d, says Cobb. But the restoration work could help provide a lifeline for reefs, she says. \u201cCorals made it through the impact that killed the dinosaurs,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe some corals will limp through, the question is how much will be left. There is important work that holds real promise. There won\u2019t be just one solution but a whole basket of them, some of which we can only guess at.\u201d Another form of reef renovation has been taking place in the Bahamas, where scientists have been collecting material from mass spawning events \u2013 when corals release plumes of sperm and eggs into the water en masse \u2013 to help produce more numerous, stronger offspring for replanting. \u201cWe\u2019ve had pretty good results,\u201d says Joseph Pollock, coral strategy director for the Caribbean division of the Nature Conservancy. He worked on a recent spawning event off Cape Eleuthera that has resulted in more than one million coral larvae. \u201cThis in itself is not a solution, it\u2019s part of a suite of tools that can be used. If you\u2019re not working on stressors from climate change down to coastal pollution, you may as well not be doing this work.\u201d Back in Florida, the Coral Restoration Foundation is training a new batch of interns, who will help in educational outreach efforts with the public. At the foundation\u2019s offices, fibreglass trees are being scrubbed clean and plans made to survey a nursery site as the skies clear from a tropical storm. The work, much like the morphing climate conditions ranged against it, seems endless. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to give up,\u201d says Levy. \u201cNo one wants these reefs to die on their watch, so I would rather do something then sit back and watch everything die.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "England has more than 200,000 empty homes. How to revive them?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/25/england-has-more-than-200000-empty-homes-how-to-revive-them", "date": "2018-09-25", "transcript": "Ask most people about England\u2019s epidemic of empty homes and they are likely to think of lavish vacant mansions in London owned by absent foreign billionaires. In fact, the majority of empty properties are in post-industrial areas, where poverty rates are high and house prices languish well below their pre-crash levels. Such a place is Stockton-on-Tees, near Middlesbrough, where Martyn Jones lives. Two years ago Jones, 23, was homeless and relying on friends to let him sleep on their couches while he struggled to find work. Today, he is painting a wall in a gutted home on a quiet street, part of a group tasked with refurbishing some of the area\u2019s many vacant, derelict homes. Last week, Theresa May pledged an extra \u00a32bn for housing associations to fund large-scale developments. But with new house building not providing enough affordable homes for more than 1 million people on waiting lists in England, social enterprises and councils are trying to bring empty homes, which number well over 200,000 and are worth almost \u00a350bn, back into occupancy. One of them is Community Campus 87, which buys such properties in Stockton-on-Tees, refurbishes them and offers them to previously homeless tenants at rents below the going rate for social housing. In the process, it provides jobs and skills training for people such as Jones. Having left school at 16, Jones struggled with substance use and anxiety, unable to hold down a job. When his mother kicked him out, he worried he was out of options. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here today if it wasn\u2019t for Campus,\u201d he says. \u201cThey gave me a home, helped me along the way and now I\u2019ve started going to college.\u201d Amid a dramatic national collapse in apprenticeships, about 15% of Community Campus\u2019 staff are apprentices, according to its director and founder, Simon Virth. The group, which has refurbished about 250 homes so far, also offers help with job interviews, jobcentre appointments and finding free educational programmes at local colleges. At the opposite end of the country, Plymouth city council is offering landlords loans and grants of up to \u00a350,000 per property to bring 375 long-term vacant properties back into use in the next three years. Fifty-nine homes were brought back into occupancy within the first year, but Dan Thorning, a housing officer, acknowledges there have been challenges. \u201cIt can take significant time to build rapport and trust with some owners of empty homes, or to get contractors on board that are willing to work on a project where there are complex issues,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes when owners refuse to work with us, we have no choice but to use enforcement powers to bring their properties back into use.\u201d Plymouth is following the lead of Kent county council, whose pioneering no use empty initiative won a prestigious regeneration award earlier in 2018. Its interest-free loans have helped to transform 5,400 empty homes since 2005. In Stoke-on-Trent, the council has allowed people to buy derelict homes for just \u00a31, on the condition they stay for 10 years and commit to investing in the property. The relative success of such projects has helped fuel calls for community-led housing to play a greater role in alleviating the housing shortage, which has coincided with home ownership falling to a 30-year low. The Giroscope group in Yorkshire also refurbishes empty homes for subsidised housing, and has had success branching out into a microbrewery, bakery, condiment manufacturer and a vegetarian cafe and shop. Profits are reinvested into the business, but funding remains the key challenge. Swingeing funding cuts Money is a constant problem for self-starting groups though. One of the main grants for Community Campus has risen by only 2% over 15 years. \u201cThat represents a 23% cut in real terms,\u201d Virth says. A government scheme, the empty homes programme, was set up in 2012 to provide about \u00a3100m to community groups for refurbishments. It was ended by the Conservative government in 2015. Swingeing funding cuts to local authorities have further undermined renewal schemes, while the money is drying up for charities too; more than \u00a33.8bn in government grants has been cut over the past decade. Banks can charge twice the rate of interest for loans to social enterprises as to commercial firms, if they agree to lend at all. This can hobble local startups and force them to lease rather than buy properties, meaning they ultimately return to the owner after refurbishment. Transferring empty properties to organisations which refurbish them and offer them to let at below local housing allowance rates means local authorities benefit from council tax receipts, the area gradually repopulates and the social enterprises can use the assets to raise money to buy more properties. The alternative is councils paying millions for emergency accommodation because they do not have enough housing stock to deliver their statutory duty to house homeless people, nor the funds to renovate the properties themselves, while whole neighbourhoods elsewhere are cut loose to rot. The homeless charity Centrepoint say that schemes like these provide some of the vulnerable people in society with a chance to develop the skills they need to get on in life. \u201cThese community led schemes offer a fantastic opportunity for them, and all those who unfortunately face homelessness, by not only providing affordable housing but also the hands-on experience and support to develop the key skills they will need in the world of work,\u201d said Paul Noblet, its head of public affairs. \u201cWe hope that the example set by these schemes will inspire both government and employers to take similar action.\u201d The housing charity Empty Homes says the absence of dedicated national funding means community-based approaches are more important than ever. These have a proven track record and they offer the best returns in financial, social and housing terms. \u201cThese organisations see beyond profit to save those in housing need,\u201d says Chris Bailey, a campaign manager at Empty Homes. \u201cThey do so while delivering lower costs and better social outcomes; reinvesting in more affordable housing and improving the local area.\u201d This translates into people such as Martyn Jones finding a path to a better life rather than heading further out into the margins. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know where my life would be heading without Campus,\u201d he says. \u201cThis gives me hope for the future.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The boys, apparently oblivious to the green and white 10-tonne, 19-metre-long vehicle, appeared as bright green figures surrounded by fuzzy yellow dots on the screen in front of Gresing. In this case, the boys were not close enough that the tram had to brake, though it did slow down. But Gresing had little to do with the decision. He was merely sitting in the cab, his hand resting casually on a joystick in case he needed to intervene, while the tram drove itself. The world\u2019s first autonomous tram was launched in unspectacular style in the city of Potsdam, west of Berlin, on Friday. The Guardian was the first English-language newspaper to be offered a ride on the vehicle developed by a team of 50 computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists at the German engineering company Siemens. Fitted with multiple radar, lidar (light from a laser), and camera sensors, forming digital eyes that film the tram and its surroundings during every journey, the tram reacts to trackside signals and can respond to hazards faster than a human. Its makers say it is some way from being commercially viable but they do expect it to contribute to the wider field of driverless technology, and have called it an important milestone on the way to autonomous driving. Travelling in real traffic from the tram depot of Potsdam\u2019s transport company ViP, the articulated Combino model tram whirred its way through a high-rise housing settlement in the south-eastern district of Stern on Friday, contending with bikes, prams and cars which sometimes haphazardly crossed its path during the 3.7-mile (6km) route. Halfway into the journey on a windy day with leaves swirling over the tracks, an emergency was staged, whereby a Siemens employee pushed a pram onto one of the many unsignalled walkways running across the path of the tram. After its sensors alerted it, the vehicle responded by braking suddenly. Gresing calmly restarted the automated driving system once the woman had pulled the pram safely back onto the pavement. Along the track, the occasional tram spotter with a notebook and camera captured the historic moment. Gordian Stark, a visitor to InnoTrans 2018, an international transport exhibition taking place in Berlin, observed the tram in operation from the sidelines, and admitted he had initially been sceptical. \u201cTruth be told, it does looks rather underwhelming, a normal low-floor tram, but closer up you see all the discreet technology like the sensors, and to see it tackle real-time traffic and to think this is the future, it\u2019s a bit like what it must have been to witness the transition from horse-drawn to steam trams or gas to electric,\u201d he said. As in many cities in the former communist East Germany, trams have formed the backbone of Potsdam\u2019s public transport system uninterrupted ever since their introduction as horse-drawn vehicles in 1880. Promoted under communism as an efficient public transport method, it has since expanded to cover a route of 18 miles in length. With the city \u2013 currently having a population of 172,000 \u2013 expanding fast, it is seen as an essential part of its infrastructure. ViP is proud to boast of the new model that runs on renewable energy (wind and solar) and is able to carry up to 250 passengers as the most environmentally friendly form of public transport. Gresing, a native Potsdamer who grew up with trams, said at 63, and semi-retired, he was not concerned about his job security, though he admitted that some of his colleagues were. Nevertheless, ViP has said in the event of the artificial intelligence (AI) trams being properly introduced, drivers would simply be deployed elsewhere in the system, such as to marshal passengers on the platform or to help people with disabilities or prams, and have vowed that the high-tech trams will not lead to job cuts. \u201cOur main priority is safety,\u201d said Oliver Glaser, the manager of ViP, which has 420 employees and ferries 33 million passengers a year. \u201cAnd secondly we think it\u2019ll improve efficiency.\u201d Gresing said he only had to recall his most hair-raising experience as a tram driver to consider the advantages of an AI vehicle: \u201cWhen an elderly man who had left his hearing aid at home pulled out in front of me in his car\u201d . At that point he sounded his bell and managed to bring the tram to a halt. \u201cNo one was injured but the car was a write-off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be a very stressful job: you\u2019re responsible for 250 passengers at a time. And if technology is there to take away some of the decision-making load, I welcome that.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Use carrots, not sticks", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/21/how-to-incentivise-charity-giving-recycling-unwanted-clothes", "date": "2018-09-21", "transcript": "It is a shrewd psychological tactic that all parents will be familiar with: instead of berating an errant child for their wrongdoings, focus instead in rewarding them for good behaviour. Now the idea is catching on outside the nursery, with implications for everything from recycling clothes to policing. Put simply: to get people to do things, throw away those sticks and invest in a prodigious quantity of carrots. Take the modern phenomenon of \u201cfast fashion\u201d: determined to keep prices artificially low for consumers, clothes companies exploit workers and use shoddy materials. The scale and pace of production and distribution is disastrous for the environment, and consumers end up with piles of unwanted clothes. Every year in the UK, 300,000 tonnes ends up in landfill \u2013 235 million individual items. Now however, apps such as ReGain, Regive and Stuffstr are making it simpler \u2013 and more worthwhile - for people to return their unwanted clobber. The ReGain app can be used to find one of 20,000 drop-off points. In return, the diligent consumer earns rewards such as discount coupons for high street retailers. Stuffstr works in partnership with John Lewis to help people get cash in return for unwanted items from the chain. \u201cPossibly the one prediction that we economists get right is that if you incentivise a behaviour, you will get more of it,\u201d says Dr Matthew Levy, a lecturer in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). He cites research, including his own, showing that financial incentives encouraging regular exercise, stopping smoking and losing weight effectively promote healthy behaviours and that there is no backlash when the incentives are removed. \u201cIf anything, the incentives can be used to jump-start a healthy habit that keeps going,\u201d he says. In the four months after its launch, the ReGain scheme received almost 17,000 parcels containing 47 tonnes of used clothes and shoes, of which 95% could potentially be reused, according to its founder Jack Ostrowski. There\u2019s one obvious criticism of ReGain: if fast fashion is the problem, is it helpful to give people discounts to buy more fast fashion? Ostrowski argues that vague notions imploring people to save the planet don\u2019t work. \u201cWe need to find a way to influence behaviour, and discount coupons help,\u201d he says. The platform is also working with brands and retailers to find ways to divert used clothes from landfills and into the production of new clothes, he adds. Other reward schemes have had success in encouraging behavioural change. When police in Canada issued \u201cpositive tickets\u201d \u2013 coupons for free food or movie tickets \u2013 to reward good behaviour among young people, they reported an almost 50% drop in youth-related service calls. \u201cThe ticket is the gateway to the relationship,\u201d says Ward Clapham, the former superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Richmond, British Columbia. \u201cIf you want to build up an environment of trust, cooperation, collaboration and support, you have to have a relationship; and its a lot easier to start that in a positive environment than in a negative one. \u201cMy officers would say \u2018In the old days we\u2019d drive up in the police car and the kids would run away from us, now they run to us\u2019.\u201d Similar ticketing schemes have been trialled in the UK, and rolled out in Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, the US, and elsewhere, as police forces look at new ways to build trust within communities. In a similar venture, Hull city council have announced plans to launch a digital reward token \u2013 the HullCoin \u2013 that can be earned by volunteering and spent at local retailers. Elsewhere, a study on the recruitment of health workers in Zambia found that highlighting economic incentives during the recruitment process caused future employees to be more motivated and task-focused. The new health workers went on to conduct 29% more household visits than previous staff, twice as many community meetings and oversaw a 25% reduction in the amount of underweight children in the treatment areas. \u201cEmphasising the economic incentives led to the recruitment of more effective, and more devoted, health workers than emphasising the societal benefits,\u201d Levy explains. Conversely, if the deterrent for a particular action is not substantial enough (ie if the stick is a twig), people may view it as a licence to break the rules. When two behavioural economists conducted a study at a daycare centre in Israel and introduced a small fine of around \u00a32 for late parents, the amount of latecomers increased. According to the researchers, this was because they could now avoid being guilty by paying the small fine. However, \u201cthis is less important when we are talking about rewarding good behaviour,\u201d says Levy. Nava Ashraf, also a LSE economics professor, says that the more that people engage in altruistic acts, the easier it becomes. \u201cWe humans notoriously underestimate how happy it makes us to give to others,\u201d she says. Ashraf\u2019s research looks into the long-term impact of incentivising good behaviour. \u201cGiving can become a habit and something people want to continue on their own, even if it isn\u2019t rewarded. Platforms could induce people to start something that they may not otherwise do and in the process, they may learn how much they enjoy it, creating a craving for it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know from neuroscience that the more we do something the more easy it becomes,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt goes from something we have to think about to becoming second nature.\u201d Or as Aristotle put it: \u2018We are what we repeatedly do.\u2019 But Ashraf does caution that getting rewarded for one type of charitable giving \u201cmight also make people feel entitled\u201d to get paid for other good deeds, something her research is hoping to shed more light on. For now, the rate of people regularly doing formal volunteer work has remained stable since 2001. If schemes such as ReGain go on to see long-term success, volunteer organisations might consider getting in on the act. \u201cObviously different groups are motivated by different factors,\u201d says Ostrowski. \u201cFor some, the \u2018feel good\u2019 factor is enough, and for others, that reward stimulus is required.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Of all the innovations that have galvanised people in his district in the Ugandan capital Kampala to grow their own food, these vertical box plantations remain his favourite. Kwagala farm, located on half an acre of land, is the brainchild of Diana Nambatya, a professor in public health, who began growing vegetables to save money on food in 2010. After receiving two cows as a dowry, she decided to use their dung to generate biogas for her home. Her burgeoning urban farm soon attracted the attention of the neighbours, and in 2012 she started training women at a small demonstration centre. The urban farm is just one of many springing up in and around Kampala, a city of more than 1.5 million people, as residents find creative solutions to the challenges of urbanisation. Between 2002 and 2010, Uganda\u2019s urban population grew by 5.6%. This process, Martin Agaba believes, is eroding young people\u2019s interest in Uganda\u2019s agricultural sector, which employs approximately 69% of the population. Agaba trains children that live around Kwagala farm in how to grow strawberries, yams and spring onions. \u201cWe are motivating children to not rely just on boda bodas (motorcycle taxis \u2013 a popular form of informal employment) or TV but to do something creative every day.\u201d Brian Ndyaguma, an entrepreneur and restaurant owner, says: \u201cSomehow the young generation deserted the way our parents\u2019 generation did things, so if you are going to convince young people to jump into agriculture, it has to be made sexy \u2013 it has to be made appealing to them\u201d. It was Kwagala farm\u2019s creative reuse of old tyres that first attracted visitors. Then, as they began to experiment with using other materials, such as disused drainpipes and milk cartons, some of the local children began to create their own designs. \u201cNow the children do not copy what we do,\u201d says Agaba. \u201cThey do their own thing.\u201d Harriet Nakabaale runs a small farm called Camp Green in the Kawaala area of Kampala. She collects the plastic bottles discarded by her neighbours. By cutting them, she can use them as flowerpots; by perforating them, they can become watering devices. Nothing goes to waste. Even the shells of the eggs produced by her chickens will be used to grow cress. Kwagala farm has three cows which they feed with banana peel and corn, which is grown using hydroponics, a method of growing plants using a water-based solution instead of soil. Agaba and his colleagues collect the cow dung, which they use to produce fertiliser. Despite the business potential, there are no plans to expand the farm. \u201cWe do not need more than three cows,\u201d says Abaga. \u201cWe are teaching people to keep less but to do more with what they have.\u201d An education programme at the farm has trained more than 700 women and young people in urban farming and how to make organic fertiliser and biofuel. Martin Agaba, who works at Kwagala urban farm, says: \u2018We don\u2019t keep more than three cows. We teach people to keep fewer and do more with what they have.\u2019 Brian Ndyaguma relies on urban farms in Kampala for a large proportion of his restaurants\u2019 vegetables, herbs and fruits. He sees a business opportunity not just for urban dwellers but rural farmers as well. \u201cWe still have a big advantage here in Uganda because we have good soil, so food is largely available. The challenge is the distribution.\u201d Congestion, lack of refrigerated trucks and long hot days in the markets can make it difficult for the food grown outside of the city to stay fresh. \u201cUrban farming gives rural farmers with more space the opportunity to concentrate on perennial crops, like corn or cereal,\u201d he says. Agaba is an engineer and, like most of the people working on the farm, he has a day job, choosing to work at the farm as a pastime. Though he doesn\u2019t sell much of what he grows, he still recognises there are financial benefits to his hobby. \u201cGrowing your own food makes you money by saving you money.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

So it\u2019s time for a different approach. On Friday, the deserted, dried-out bed of the Aral Sea in a remote part of Central Asia will echo to the sound of an electronic music festival, as activists try to raise awareness of the catastrophe, and put the sea back on the map, figuratively, if not literally. Visitors to Moynaq, a forlorn Uzbek town, are usually disaster tourists coming to gawk at the desolation of the apocalyptic landscape, where the carcasses of ships rot on sand once covered by the world\u2019s fourth-largest lake. But this week, hundreds of revellers have been descendingfor the festival of electronic, techno, avant-garde and dance music. DJs from Moscow and Berlin will mix music \u201cthat teleports you mentally to other places\u201d, organiser Otabek Suleimanov enthused. It will very possibly be the first electronica festival to be held in a ship graveyard. \u201cIt\u2019s great!\u201d said Farukh Sharipov, a 25-year-old graphic designer standing on the quay on Thursday under the burning sun, seeking a spot to pitch his tent after flying in from the capital Tashkent and driving two hours across the desert to Moynaq. \u201cThe whole world should know about the Aral catastrophe \u2026 Not everyone pays attention to an ecological catastrophe, but if we come here to party then people will come and start taking an interest.\u201d A lawyer who moonlights as a DJ, Suleimanov dreamt up this quixotic event to draw attention to the plight of the Aral Sea, which has shrunk to a tenth of its original size because of shortsighted Soviet policies. Intense cotton farming that diverted feeder rivers for irrigation has been blamed for the recession of the sea in the late Soviet period. The waters left behind a toxic, salt-encrusted, pesticide-poisoned land that poses a serious environmental and health hazard. The music for the festival will be pumped out beside a reconstructed lighthouse in Moynaq, a once thriving fishing port left high and dry when the waters disappeared from the town in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful\u201d said Keulimzhay Abylgaziyev, 61, recalling with a gesture at the seabed behind the stage how he used to swim in the sea there as a child. \u201cIt used to be all water here, and everyone worked as fishermen, but now it\u2019s all dry. It\u2019s important for people to know about it, and for people to come here \u2013 and for the sea to come too, God willing.\u201d Although the event is starting relatively small, the organisers have big ambitions: they hope the festival, which is free of charge, will become an annual event. In their wildest dreams, one day it will turn into a central Asian version of the Nevada desert\u2019s Burning Man. That may be a pipe dream, but locals including hotelier Mahmud Akbarov are excited anyway. \u201cMore events like this should be held, to attract people here.\u201d There are no big names playing, but there are some interesting acts \u2013 DJs include Orgatanatos, an Uzbek project producing \u201cambient, glitchcore, noise and other experimental styles\u201d and Interchain, a Moscow punk-techno duo. The festival\u2019s name evokes its environmental aspirations: Stihia, a Russian word loosely translating as \u201cthe elements\u201d but with connotations of something \u201cunstoppable\u201d, Suleimanov told the Guardian \u2013 like the drying up of the Aral, which split into two parts in the 1980s. Its northern part in Kazakhstan has been rejuvenated by a dam, but the southern Uzbek section is in a dire state: in drier years, it is just a narrow strip of water on the western side. Stihia has a mystical element as well as a pragmatic one: Suleimanov sees the music-makers as akin to the rainmakers of the area\u2019s ancient nomadic tribes, although \u201crainmakers were using drums, and we\u2019re using electronic music to call the sea back\u201d. On Thursday afternoon, gazing out over the former seabed as he waited for the sound systems to trundle across the desert from Nukus, his main concern was that those making the trip to Moynak should have a good time. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the aftertaste \u2013 how people feel when they leave.\u201d Stihia looks set to rock not just Moynak but all Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country of 34 million people that until recently was known as one of the world\u2019s worst police states. Since long-ruling dictator Islam Karimov died in 2016, his successor Shavkat Mirziyoyev has been experimenting with a thaw often dubbed the \u201cUzbek Spring\u201d. Under Karimov, Uzbekistan was a buttoned-up conservative state that frowned upon fun, discouraging everything from rap music to Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations. Official backing for Stihia is a sign of the changing times \u2013 and Suleimanov believes the festival will send out some positive vibes about Uzbekistan by \u201ctelling the world: look, guys, things are changing \u2013 and if the government is supporting such a crazy idea as having electronic music in the middle of a desert, then you can trust that at least something is going well!\u201d. The idea would have seemed \u201cshocking\u201d not long ago, said Sharipov with a chuckle. \u201cNow this is kind of normal, because our society is becoming more open. People can just have fun, without being afraid of anyone.\u201d Some revellers were embracing the environmental theme with gusto, such as a young man who gave his name as Uncle Chill who was wearing an oxygen mask and a black PVC contraption strapped to his otherwise bare chest. \u201cI came from the future,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThis is an outfit from the future. The thing is, I came to warn people that we\u2019re destroying the planet. This is the outfit that we\u2019re going to be wearing in the future, because there\u2019s no fresh water, polluted air. That\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s why I need the mask. I want to show people what\u2019s happening.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Arce has twice rescued his own small museum in Guatemala from floods and storms, and has just completed a Dutch leadership course to teach others this unusual form of emergency aid. He and a team of \u201cfirst aiders\u201d have offered to help their Brazilian colleagues find the funds and experts they need after a fire engulfed their 200-year-old national museum. A Unesco-led mission is being readied this week to head to Rio de Janeiro to provide concrete help. \u201cThey are still in shock,\u201d says Arce, speaking from the offices of the Prince Claus Fund in the Netherlands, co-organiser of the cultural course. \u201cThey have to assess the damage and we are asking if they have the proper forms, if they need online tutorials and what experts they need.\u201d Art and culture are perhaps more vulnerable than at any moment since the end of the second world war \u2013 and not just in Brazil. Flood, fire, war, terrorism, sabotage, theft, earthquakes and neglect: the causes of cultural dereliction are many and varied. Participants in the Dutch course, backed by Unesco, the Smithsonian Institute and heritage body Iccrom, came from 23 countries and five continents. The event culminated in a faux-disaster scenario: a gas explosion, army and fire officers guarding the scene from protesters, and the rescuers carrying out shattered artefacts \u201cas carefully as you would a baby\u201d. \u201cFirst aid for heritage is very much like first aid to a human,\u201d says course organiser Deborah Stolk of the Prince Claus Fund. \u201cIt is like a cultural ambulance, to stabilise the situation and prevent it from getting worse. After assessing the risks, for example, of whether you can go into the building, people would stabilise a wall, prevent it from falling down or evacuate a vase in a dangerous place.\u201d It is not always that simple. Lama Abboud, an architect based in Homs in Syria, has taken several of the Dutch courses and organised a network of training in Syria. \u201cSince 2011, our Syrian culture heritage [has been] threatened by many complex situations due to the armed conflict and its consequences,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn Homs, the built heritage is in its worst conditions, exposed to all weather elements in addition to vandalism for more than six years. The conflict leads to a large displacement [of people too], so most intangible heritage elements are in real danger. Looting and illegal excavation are a real threat too.\u201d Like a caricature, says Stolk, community tensions and inequalities that already exist have been exaggerated during a disaster. Khan Agha Dawoodzai, an activist from Afghanistan, says that the answer was to get the community involved. \u201cIn recent weeks, there was fighting in the Ghazni province and a museum of Islamic civilisation was destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe documents were blown by the wind through the streets. If the community had understood the importance of their documents and a little about how they could protect them, it could have been the first responder.\u201d Cultural heritage, he points out, can even be a weapon \u2013 when, for example, the Buddhas of Bamiyan wall carvings were blown up by the Taliban in 2001. Such heritage could be important to villages for their future economic development, tourism and shared community. \u201cSmaller conflicts fuel the bigger ones,\u201d he says. \u201cA village may have different ethnicities but our cultural heritage is the same: this is our shared identity and very important to peace building in Afghanistan.\u201d Elsa Arroyo followed this approach last year, after an earthquake struck in Mexico, damaging mural paintings in 16th century monasteries. The lecturer at UNAM university\u2019s Instituto de Investigaciones Est\u00e9ticas helped raise $10,000 in finance and took her 60 students on an extraordinary field trip \u2013 to work on recovering the monuments. In this case, the local community also received government funding for its own reconstruction, but she says poverty continued to be a challenge. \u201cCulture needs maintenance in order to have a good condition, and all these monuments are kind of abandoned, even if they are used for rituals and festivities,\u201d Arroyo says. In Peru\u2019s high Andes Michaela Novotna, another course participant, has been trying to raise awareness of places like the Santa Cruz church in Orurillo, Puno \u2013 supposedly closed because it is falling down, although still used for weekly mass. \u201cWe\u2019re rescuing sad paintings that look like rags, broken sculptures, leaning churches \u2013 it\u2019s something called a slow disaster,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m working with colonial artwork that has been neglected for 200 years.\u201d Treasures of the past are far more than just stuff, especially when local people get involved in their own rescue, adds Stolk. She spoke via satellite phone to advise victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, after they decided to rescue a collection of Quang manuscripts from a collapsed library. \u201cThey changed from being victims to active participants in their own recovery,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything they would take from beneath the rubble would see a future. What happens is that you can connect a past to a future, while people are actually in this very miserable situation in the present. That hope and that pride are very much underestimated.\u201d This is how Abboud feels, thinking about her home in Syria and the restoration ahead in Brazil. \u201cThe conflict will be finished one day, but the cultural heritage \u2013 that will stay. When we rescue and protect our heritage, it is the same as when we protect our children. Both carry parts of our souls and our ancestors\u2019 spirits.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Headlines tend to accentuate the costs not the benefit of good hospitality. Politicians from the UK to US, Germany to Italy, rarely have a good word to say about them. But refugees are not all helpless dependents, hopelessly reliant on charity. They make economic contributions, grow GDP, start businesses and social enterprises, create jobs. For every one implicated in a crime, thousands more are raising children, volunteering, filling the skills shortage in Europe. It is perhaps in Italy where this gap between perception and reality has had the greatest political impact. Here we focus on five who defy the lazy political stereotyping of the Italian far right. Mohamed Shapoor If 20 years ago you had suggested to Cpl Mohamed Shapoor, who was then living among mortar attacks launched by the Taliban, that one day he would become a chef in Italy, he would have laughed in your face. But life is unpredictable, which is the most important lesson Shapoor has learned during his incredible existence. Now 47, Shapoor abandoned his military uniform and decorations in 2000, fleeing from an Afghanistan agonised by a war that continues to claim civilian victims. Today he is one of the most esteemed chefs in Palermo, Sicily, where he has been living for 10 years. \u201cI thought I would wear that uniform forever,\u201d he tells the Guardian with the stern glance of a soldier. \u201cIn time, I learned that that conflict was never going to end, and I decided to leave. Life has taught me that we are not victims of history, just that not everyone is lucky enough to realise it. \u201cI am convinced that today, thanks to having fled my country, Mohamed Shapoor realises that he was not destined to be a corporal, but a chef in the land of pasta and pizza.\u201d A flyer attached to the door of the restaurant Moltivolti in Ballar\u00f2, an ancient quarter of Palermo, announces the opening of enrolment in the \u201ccooking class with Shapoor\u201d. There are many people eager to learn how to prepare dopiaza, an Afghan dish made with onions, curry, garlic paste and chicken, or mantu, large medallions filled with veal and accompanied by a sauce made with vegetables and red squash. But the real attraction, as you might imagine, is Shapoor, a real legend in these parts. His customers, who come by the hundreds to fill the tables of Moltivolti, ask to speak with him after savouring his dishes. To offer their compliments, to be sure, but also to meet the legend of Cpl Shapoor, the nemesis of the Taliban who conquered Sicilian palates. Adibata Konata The \u201cmother\u201d of the inhabitants of Ballar\u00f2, now home to thousands of migrants, is a Junoesque woman from the Ivory Coast. It\u2019s no coincidence that around here she is known as \u201cMama Africa\u201d. Her name is Adibata Konata, she is 65, and for years she has offered the poor of Ballar\u00f2 a warm meal and sometimes even a bed from a small restaurant in Santa Chiara square, just off the famous open-air market. It makes no difference if you cannot pay; Mama Africa\u2019s restaurant is open to all of her \u201cchildren\u201d, including newly arrived migrants. Konata, born into a large middle-class family, has lived in Palermo for over 20 years. Her heart, however, is still in Ziga, a poor village in the heart of Sanmatenga, Burkina Faso, which she visited before arriving in Italy. Here Mama Africa invests her proceeds to refurbish hospitals and offer food, clothing, books, farm implements, and electrical and plumbing material, with the goal of raising the living standards of the inhabitants. \u201cWe started a small workshop with about 10 people who make necklaces, bracelets, and clothing items using raw materials from Africa. After paying the employees, all additional proceeds go to Ziga,\u201d she says. \u201cMy work will probably never save Ziga from poverty, but as an African woman I feel a duty not to forget that our brothers and sisters live in the same conditions that forced us to leave. I cannot forget this.\u201d Boubou Magassa and Adul Balde The story of Boubou Magassa and Adul Balde may seem ordinary. Yet these two 20-year-old migrants, who hail from Mali and Guinea respectively, found rare solace in Sicily in the form of a dignified job, a serene life, peace. Nothing more. They arrived on the coast of Sicily aboard a dinghy at the beginning of 2017, after having spent nearly a year of agony in Libya, among detention camps and harassment at the hands of militiamen and traffickers. Today they work as mechanics in the town of Riesi. Here, not only do Magassa and Balde contribute to Italy\u2019s economy, but like many others, they have also helped revive this small town, which Italians gradually abandoned. The population of Riesi is nearing 10,000, down from more than 20,000 in the 1950s, and the town continues to lose 100 inhabitants each year. There are hundreds of small towns like Riesi across Italy that risk extinction. \u201cWe\u2019re happy here,\u201d says Magassa. \u201cThey treat us well. We didn\u2019t have great expectations. We came here in search of good fortune, and we only hoped to find what we dreamt about: a normal life. This is our greatest achievement.\u201d Atta Jacob Dozens of migrants queue up in front of Atta Jacob\u2019s office each day to speak with him. Jacob, 31, who arrived from Ghana in 2008, is a representative for the CGIL, Italy\u2019s largest labour union. To understand the long road that has enabled Jacob to earn a job, a desk, an office, and the respect of his colleagues, one must enter into the abyss of the San Ferdinando migrant camp, whichtoday is home to 1,000 people. Here, migrants live in shacks with no water or electricity. They have been called \u201cnew slaves\u201d as they are exploited in the tomato fields and olive groves of southern Italy for meagre compensation. Until two years ago, Jacob was one of them. \u201cI used to live in a shack like this one,\u201d he says. \u201cI worked in the fields with the others for \u20ac2 an hour. It was horrible. But people here are willing to withstand this and even more in order to survive.\u201d The migrants waiting for Jacob in front of his office live in the San Ferdinando camp. His goal as union representative is to better their working conditions, while at the same time compelling the state not to forget that behind the \u201cMade in Italy\u201d brand are migrants such as them. \u201cThey are the ones who work in the fields eight, nine hours a day,\u201d says Jacob, who left his eight-year-old daughter in Ghana, and hopes to reunite with her soon. \u201cThey are the ones who sweat under the sun to pick the tomatoes that are shipped all over the world. Ghanaians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Gambians, Malians \u2013 the same people that the government wants to expel.\u201d Mamud Shamsu On the road from Caltanissetta to Palermo, Mamud Shamsu watches the cars speed by. Occasionally, someone stops to fill up. Shamsu walks up to the car, smiles, and begins pumping the petrol. His days as a petrol-station attendant in the Sicilian countryside have the same cadence, week after week. To some, his work may seem monotonous. It\u2019s not a busy road, and it\u2019s not easy to come upon talkative customers, but this is all Shamsu needs to get by in Italy, where the 28-year-old arrived 10 years ago from Ghana. \u201cI consider myself incredibly lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cI know it\u2019s not easy to find work in Sicily, especially if you\u2019re a migrant. People from my country wait years for opportunity like this. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to steal jobs from Italians, we\u2019re here to work. We want to pay taxes like everyone else. No breaks. We just want the chance to build our lives, like everyone else.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'I want to be a doctor, not a rabbi': how Israeli ultra-Orthodox are being drawn into work", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/10/i-want-to-be-a-doctor-not-a-rabbi-how-israeli-ultra-orthodox-are-being-drawn-into-work", "date": "2018-09-10", "transcript": "From the age of three, Yehuda Sabiner harboured a secret ambition to become a doctor. But it seemed unlikely to be fulfilled: he was raised in one of the strictest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel. His education was limited to religious study, first at a private school that barely taught mainstream subjects and later at a yeshiva, a religious school, where he spent 14 hours a day studying Jewish texts. Sabiner, a bright boy and an outstanding student, was earmarked to become a leading rabbi. But he never forgot his dream. When he was 21 he confessed his ambition to his new wife. She was horrified: she had married him on the understanding that he would be a rabbinical leader. Also, he had no knowledge of science. But Sabiner\u2019s yearning would not go away. Now 28, Sabiner is embarking on the final year of his medical degree. He will be the first person born and raised in a Haredi community in Israel to become a mainstream doctor, and he plans to specialise in internal medicine. Sabiner has benefited from a pioneering scheme at the Technion university in Haifa to draw young ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews from largely closed communities into mainstream education and then into the workforce. The numbers are still tiny \u2013 about 60 out of a total student population of 10,000. \u201cBut the idea is to bring the number to 200 within five years, and to 400 within 10 years,\u201d said Prof Boaz Golani, a vice-president of the university. \u201cEngaging the Haredi community is important for Israel. Having a civil society where entire segments live in their own world and with little interaction with others is not healthy. It\u2019s a recipe for tension and animosity.\u201d In 2017 the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel rose above one million for the first time, accounting for 12% of the population. By 2065 they are expected to make up a third of Israel\u2019s population. Traditionally, Haredi men are not economically active. Many spend their time in religious study, relying on state benefits to support their large families, which average almost seven children. But in recent years the Israeli government and educational institutions have taken steps to integrate the Haredi population into colleges and workforces. \u201cThere was a concentrated effort launched a few years ago by the ministry of transport, which needed more engineers,\u201d said Golani. If the Technion could get Haredi students on to its courses, jobs could be guaranteed. \u201cWe knocked on the doors on yeshivas in Bnei Brak [an overwhelmingly ultra-Orthodox town near Tel Aviv]. We found a few rabbis ready to talk to us. The idea was to take young men who had the brain and intellect to meet the scientific admission criteria, and who were not perceived as chief rabbis of the future. \u201cWe said we would not try to force any change of lifestyle of students, such as [strict] dress codes or praying. We kept a low profile.\u201d The Technion team identified 37 young men for a pre-university programme run from an anonymous rented warehouse in Bnei Brak. Over the course of 18 months, teachers tried to close a 12-year education gap to bring the Haredi men up to the standard of high school graduates. They studied from 8am to 10pm. \u201cIt was like a bootcamp, very intensive,\u201d said Golani. \u201cBut they brought from the yeshivas an ability to study hard, to focus, to apply logic, so we built on these skills.\u201d At the end of the programme, about half were admitted to the Technion; they graduated this summer. Bringing the students up to the required educational standard was not the only challenge. Gender segregation, a norm in Haredi communities, was a big issue, Golani said. \u201cWe told them upfront that we would not allow gender segregation on campus, no way. We suggested they arrive at class 10 minutes early and sit together, and they accepted that. We also told them that we have female professors, and we will not tell them they can\u2019t teach certain students. They accepted that too.\u201d Another key issue was use of the internet. \u201cSo each [Haredi student] carries two phones: a kosher phone, with no apps, and a regular smartphone. On that there is an app which tracks the history of all addresses browsed and sends a report of every website visited to a designated person in their community.\u201d Some students have been ostracised by their communities. \u201cOne girl was boycotted by her friends. Someone else told me he was hiding for years, lying to his wife and family, telling them he was studying at another yeshiva when he was at the Technion.\u201d The university also runs programmes aimed at encouraging Arab students to enrol. \u201cThat tends to be easier because their communities are eager to see them gain top-quality education and so the community resistance is much lower,\u201d said Golani. It was essential to integrate \u201cuntapped resources\u201d \u2013 meaning Arab-Israelis and ultra-Orthodox Jews \u2013 into the economy, he added. \u201cThe economy of Israel is largely based on the hi-tech sector. It\u2019s the locomotive that carries the entire train of the Israeli economy. But we just don\u2019t have enough people. Israel is a small country; we\u2019re not India or China.\u201d When Sabiner embarked on the challenge of becoming a doctor, initially he faced scepticism. \u201cI was told it was impossible for me to catch up [academically] and to be accepted, that I would never make it as a doctor,\u201d he said. But staff at the Technion \u201cbelieved in me when no one else did\u201d. \u201cI was sure this was the only thing I want to do in life. I studied day and night, with a baby on my shoulder and my wife studying with me. I finished [the pre-university programme] with 99% in every field, and I was accepted [on the medical course]. \u201cIn the beginning, I kept it as a secret, only my close family knew. But then it became a known secret and I was under the microscope. In the end 99% of people were encouraging me.\u201d Now that the end is in sight, he wants to encourage other Haredim to follow suit. \u201cWhen I started the journey I said I don\u2019t want to be a single episode. So I opened a group on social media telling other Haredim how they could become a doctor. Now we have 35 more in medical school.\u201d Attitudes were changing, he said, with more integration and mutual understanding. \u201cPeople understand we\u2019re not a bottle of Coca-Cola on a production line, we\u2019re individuals. If you want to do medicine, you should do medicine, and if you want to be a lawyer, you should be a lawyer. And if you want to study the Torah, go for it.\u201d \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

And not just for translation. Nervously leading his first patrol in Helmand province in 2011, Aitken recalled coming under fire for the first time: \u201cThe infamous crack-thump of fire in our direction and a crack-whizz of rounds deflecting off undergrowth.\u201d He turned to see his interpreter, Mohammad Hares, looking relatively relaxed. Hares had already spent two years deployed with the British military. He had experienced much worse. \u201cI felt safer knowing Hares was nearby. He probably had more combat experience than even my hardened troop sergeant,\u201d Aitken said. It was the start of a collaboration which turned into a friendship and latterly into a movement that took on the Home Office \u2013 with impressive results. The British military employed an estimated 2,000 Afghan interpreters between 2001 and 2014. About 390 relocated to the UK and an unknown number of others arrived illegally. But many have been unable to bring their wives and children with them; and hundreds more remain in Afghanistan, some in mortal peril from Taliban reprisals, having not met stringent eligibility criteria for the resettlement programme. Aitken suggested contacting the interpreters to set up a network. \u201cI agreed,\u201d said Hares. \u201cI got in touch with other Afghan interpreters and asked what the major problems were. We discussed visas, families, what would happen when our visas ran out. We collected all the information. \u201cWe became the focal point for the Afghan interpreters,\u201d Aitken said. They called the organisation Sulha Network. Sulha (which means \u201creconciliation\u201d in Dari) is now in contact with more than half of the 390 interpreters in the UK. The initial aim was threefold: to secure indefinite leave to remain for those given temporary British visas; to waive residency application fees of more than \u00a32,000, which most of the group could not afford; and to secure the right for families to join them in Britain. They also wanted all interpreters to be eligible for resettlement, not just those in service during the narrow window specified by the British government. Aitken and Hares set about contacting the media, lobbying politicians, senior military figures and anyone else they thought might listen. Favourable press coverage, including a Daily Mail campaign, helped. In April they sent a letter to the Home Office: \u201cWe took great risk because we believed in the integrity of the British army, only to be let down by the politicians who see us as a number and not as people,\u201d they wrote. The letter arrived on the day Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary over the Windrush scandal. Her successor, Sajid Javid, announced a series of concessions intended to ease the way for their resettlement in the UK. Among them, the Home Office agreed to waive the hefty fee to apply for permanent residence. The announcement made national headlines. \u201cWe had an amazing success,\u201d says Aitken, noting that Javid conceded the points on his first day in office. \u201cThis two-man band got the home secretary on his first day in office pledging to make the changes.\u201d Butthis was just the beginning. Many issues remain unresolved, such as the fate of the interpreters who arrived in the UK without visas and those still in Afghanistan and who want to leave. Hares said many interpreters left behind in Afghanistan are even more at risk now. \u201cIt is 10 times worse than 2010,\u201d he said. Messages from interpreters eager to leave the country suggest that the resettlement process is sluggish at best. A dedicated phoneline set up in the British embassy in Kabul is proving problematic. \u201cI called them many times but they don\u2019t pick up,\u201d wrote one former interpreter who worked with the army for three years. \u201cCan you please find out [if I qualify for resettlement],\u201d he asked via the Sulha WhatsApp group chat forum. Family reunion is the other big issue that needs resolving, says Aitken. Interpreters were told they needed to bring family with them immediately \u2013 a now-or-never offer. But many were unable to do so, for practical, bureaucratic or mundane reasons. However, Aitken and Hares have dug in, and late last month received an encouraging letter from the immigration minister Caroline Noakes. \u201cI am \u2026 committed to looking again at what can be done to make it easier for Afghan interpreters to bring family members from Afghanistan to the UK,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe government has said those relocating to the UK can do so with their families and I am determined to respect that commitment,\u201d she added, offering to meet Hares to discuss the issue. Aitken and Hares are not giving up. They also want to secure better working opportunities for the Afghans who are resettled in the UK, as very few have landed on their feet professionally. They see great potential inthis talented labour pool who could be employed as reservists, police officers or social workers. The motivation behind Sulha applies as much today as it did when they founded the organisation: that the UK should not turn its back on those Afghans who worked and fought alongside British troops. \u201cWe are still campaigning. We will keep struggling and keep trying,\u201d Hares said. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

My newspaper was backing a campaign to increase the then paltry number of people carrying donor cards. Claire Corps\u2019s family in Ripon, North Yorkshire, had built a garage extension to house the machine and were anxiously awaiting a transplant. So articulate and smart was Claire that she later became something of a poster girl for kidney transplants and appeared on both Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour and Blue Peter. Her operation came in 1980, thanks to a kidney from a 29-year-old man who had died in Leeds of a head injury. I visited her post-op at St James\u2019s hospital in Leeds, with a teddy bear and a Mike Harding book to hand. We later lost touch. But recently I thought I would try to find out how long Claire, with her eminently Google-able name, had survived after the transplant. The answer was uplifting. Not only was she very much alive 38 years on, but she is now Dr Claire Corps, a senior researcher in transplant medicine, and a key member of staff at the hospital that saved her life. Corps has several academic papers to her name and lectures around the world. She sits on five official medical committees at national level \u2013 and is helping develop a new way of preserving donor organs pre-transplant for much longer than is currently possible. It was obvious when she was 11 that Corps was smart, but taking into account the amount of school she was missing because of her health, her scientific career has been nothing short of remarkable, even if her health has not always been perfect. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t really be here,\u201d she said in her hospital office. \u201cI\u2019ve had three potentially fatal illnesses: renal failure when I was eight, two brain haemorrhages when I was 16 and neurosurgery, then liver failure in my 20s. My kidney transplant was the first success they\u2019d had at St James\u2019s with such a tiny child. \u201cThen I needed a liver transplant \u2013 the first time they had ever done a liver transplant in a kidney transplant patient. When I made it to 50 years old, Professor Peter Lodge, who did the liver op and is now my boss here, said I shouldn\u2019t have made it out of childhood.\u201d When we met, she was also awaiting brain surgery on two aneurysms, which, as she said, were \u2018waiting to blow, like pipes about to burst\u2019. A calm thoughtful woman, supported by a strong Catholic faith, she admitted nonetheless to being distinctly edgy about the procedure. In the event it worked out fine, and she is preparing to return to the laboratory and continue her work. Corps explains that being medically literate can be a double-edged sword for someone who spends a lot of time as a patient in the hospital where she works. \u201cMy doctors do say, a little grimly, that I\u2019m unusually complicated,\u201d she said. Before our meeting, she had emailed a list of 10 highly technical questions to the team at the neighbouring Leeds general infirmary who were about to work on her aneurysms. \u201cThey probably won\u2019t welcome such an interrogation, but since I was a child, I have always insisted on knowing the full story. My patient head and my science head do sometimes clash. When I was 16, I was hospitalised in Plymouth with the first of two brain haemorrhages I had swimming in Cornwall and the doctors told me my notes said, \u2018Must be told everything.\u2019 It was true; I\u2019d always said the only way I can fight this is if you tell me exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d I had imagined 38 years must be something of a record for a kidney transplant, but Corps was anxious to explain that 40- and 50-year survival times for kidney transplants are not unknown today. Health concerns did block her plan to study medicine after her time at Ripon Grammar, however. \u201cThe brain haemorrhages left me paralysed down one side and I had to teach myself to write again and miss a year of school. But I did it. You\u2019re not supposed to be able to have two brain haemorrhages and then get into Mensa. \u201cBut I wouldn't have been tough enough for medicine. Going into liver failure as a junior doctor wouldn\u2019t have made me very useful. So the work I do, partly in the lab, partly on screen, suits me perfectly.\u201d Her PhD, which she gained in 2007, is in organ preservation for transplantation. Corps also finds time to look after her elderly father, take part in the annual Transplant Games (swimming, walking and cricket-ball throwing), and do amateur dramatics. Her partner is a fellow kidney transplant recipient who works for the NHS in Edinburgh. \u201cSo as you can see,\u201d Corps said as I was leaving, \u201clife has had its ups and downs. But surprisingly I am still here and trying to put back some of which I have taken out.\u201d Lodge, her boss, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a remarkable woman to have been through all she has and still have the passion to go to work every day and do her charitable stuff. \u201cIt\u2019s not unknown for people who\u2019ve had transplants to get very interested in helping other people, but Claire has always been extremely bright and that has helped a lot with her science. She\u2019s written a lot of good stuff and we\u2019ve worked together for 25 years on and off.\u201d This article is part of a long-running series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

I didn\u2019t want to die before my kids know who I am. Corey was only three at the time, and I thought if I die he\u2019s not going to remember me at all.\u201d She embarked on chemotherapy, with a poor prognosis of surviving more than five years. While she was in hospital, her children stayed with friends and relatives, but she felt terrible guilt when she realised her illness, and her absence, was taking an emotional toll on them. \u201cI\u2019m a single parent so we spent all of our time together, I was everything to them.\u201d They felt sad and confused, she says. \u201cShenai became really clingy. I\u2019d drop her off at school, she would go in and run back out again and say \u2018bye mummy, I love you\u2019, then she\u2019d go in and run back out again. She always felt that would be the last time she\u2019d see me.\u201d Dady approached social services and charities to see what support they offered children with a parent or carer with cancer. She was given leaflets, but could not find what she was looking for. \u201cMost organisations support people with cancer or children with cancer but there\u2019s very limited support of children with a parent with cancer. I was so surprised. I thought, if my kids are suffering, there must be hundreds of kids who are suffering,\u201d she says. She knew it would help Corey and Shenai to meet others in a similar position. So in 2012, she set up a charity, Don\u2019t Forget the Kids, with funding from the Big Lottery Fund, to support children dealing with the trauma of being bereaved or having a loved one with cancer. Six years on, she regularly fields enquiries for copycat ventures across England, Scotland and even California. Families take part in \u201cmeaningful\u201d arts and crafts that help them to learn more about each other. This might be guessing each other\u2019s favourite films, for example, or drawing family trees. It is also a way for parents, who may not live to see their children grow up, to pass on their values. There are activities involving music and poetry, with the aim of creating positive memories and enjoying some \u201cguilt-free fun\u201d. The group meets regularly in a bright, spacious room at Broadwaters Children\u2019s Centre in Tottenham, north London. \u201cWhen they [the children] first come they don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d says Dady. \u201cThey\u2019re having massive changes at home so they\u2019re very quiet usually and withdrawn. Or you might find with boys they might be over-boisterous. We just embrace them. We don\u2019t force them to get involved in arts and crafts [...] but slowly you\u2019ll see them coming over and join in.\u201d Gemma Hall took her young brother James along after their mother died of liver cancer five years ago. James was nine at the time and did not want counselling. \u201cAt first he didn\u2019t show much emotion,\u201d says Hall, who has special guardianship of her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s deep-rooted, he\u2019s put her in a box and locked it away. I was very cautious of his feelings, of trying to get him to talk and be open with his emotions because I didn\u2019t want him to hold it in and become angry.\u201d Dady, who knew the family, suggested they come to the group. \u201cComing here allowed him to express his emotions, not necessarily through talking because he wasn\u2019t quite at the age where he could express it verbally, so he would do different activities,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt really helped him. He was with other children who had experienced similar things so he didn\u2019t feel so alone.\u201d The charity provides peer support but is not a counselling service, says Dady. The children are under no pressure to discuss their experiences, but \u201cif they want to talk about stuff, it\u2019s a safe environment for them to do so\u201d. Two years ago Dady received a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust fellowship, a special grant to travel around the US to research creative ways of helping children through bereavement \u2013 and in June she was awarded the fellowship\u2019s Viscount De L\u2019Isle award for her determination to succeed to help others. There have been challenges, she admits. Some people are reluctant to discuss their cancer diagnosis with their children and this can stop them coming to the group. However, with new enquiries each week there are plans to expand and launch another three groups across London, as well as to run trips away for families. Dady visited the Avery Center in Chino Hills, California, which offers therapy for people who have suffered a traumatic experience, such as the death of a loved one. \u201cThey\u2019ve expressed an interest in starting a Don\u2019t Forget the Kids out there in California,\u201d says Dady, who is looking into how that could work. It is eight years since Dady was diagnosed. She had been told there was an 80% chance the cancer would come back within five years, but it did not and she is in remission. While Don\u2019t Forget the Kids began as a way to comfort her own children, it has turned into a broader mission for Dady. Her experience, she says, has given her a purpose that she lacked before. She has published two books and recently finished a screenplay. \u201cWe need to live our best life,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for my cancer experience because it woke me up.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

But some have found a solution: growing cannabis. Hemp cultivation has been legal in Italy since 2016, and over the last few years the amount of land dedicated to the plant has increased from 400 hectares (1,000 acres) in 2013 to 4,000 hectares today. The law \u2013 which allows cultivation for non-pharmaceutical use of plants with up to 0.2% of the psychoactive compound THC \u2013 was introduced with the intention of increasing the development of industrial hemp production. Italians have taken advantage of the legal change to produce not only hemp ricotta and environmentally friendly bricks, but also hemp pasta and biscuits. \u201cThe boom in the production of hemp is an excellent example of the ability of agricultural firms to discover new frontiers,\u201d said Roberto Moncalvo, the president of Coldiretti, Italy\u2019s largest farmers\u2019 association. \u201cWe are in the middle of an opportunity for economic and employment growth.\u201d This solution to the crisis affecting Italian farmers can be seen in a small green oasis set in the arid interior of Sicily. Among the clay fields and sheaves of abandoned grain, a sign depicting a seven-point leaf hangs from a gate. Beyond it is Salvo Scuderi, the president of the agricultural cooperative Colli Erei. The 41-year-old has just finished reaping part of his hemp harvest, which will be used to make pasta, oil and flour. This year, Scuderi and 20 other producers of Rete Canapa Sicilia, an association whose goal is to promote and market the use of hemp in the region, have together produced almost 150 tonnes. \u201cHemp saved our business,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year we earned 10 times more than what we used to earn with wheat and it has enabled us to hire four workers.\u201d Wheat yields a profit of \u20ac250 (\u00a3220) per hectare in today\u2019s market, while hemp can generate net earnings in excess of \u20ac2,500 per hectare, according t Rete Canapa Sicilia. And there are many Sicilian farmers who, in order to breathe new life into the dry land and to improve their financial situation have substituted wheat with hemp. In the countryside around Catenanuova, temperatures can reach the mid-40s in the summer. It is where the Italian car manufacturer Fiat used to test its prototypes under high temperatures, scorching weather would force trains to stopbecause of expanding rails. But it is not the heat alone that has caused the desiccation of the land. \u201cYears of monocultural wheat cultivation are the problem,\u201d said Dario Giambalvo, professor of agricultural sciences at the University of Palermo. \u201cIt has caused soil erosion, and is at risk of soon making the land infertile.\u201d According to data from Italy\u2019s Council for Agricultural Research and Analysis of Agricultural Economics, land planted with durum wheat decreased by 7.4% in southern Italy last year, and by more than 9% in the north of the country. Overall production decreased by more than 4% during the last year. This is why the move towards to hemp farming could help, say experts. \u201cThe cultivation of hemp is a valid opportunity for a diversified farming which can be a good solution for the rebirth of abandoned and less fertile land,\u201d said Giambalvo, \u201cThe ancient Romans taught us that diversifying crops can help make the land more fertile. I do not know if this will lead to the growth of the agricultural sector, certainly for Italy is a return to the origins.\u201d Up to the 1940s, Italy was the world\u2019s largest producer of hemp after the Soviet Union. Back then in Italy, more 100,000 hectares were planted with hemp. After the war andthe move towards synthetic fibres, the cultivation of hemp plummeted. The downward trend continued as the campaign against illegal drug use was strengthened. In 1961 the Italian government signed the single convention on narcotic drugs. Despite the international treaty specifically excluding non-pharmaceutical hemp production from the regulations controlling cannabis, it led to further to decline in hemp cultivation in Italy. \u201cHemp has been waiting 60 years to reclaim its rightful place,\u201d said Scuderi. \u201cAnd this could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2% and to develop pharmaceutical experimentation.\u201d The 2016 law does not prohibit the commercialisation of hemp flowers, a gap that allowed market for the sale of light cannabis to blossom, with more than 500 stores in Italy. The flowers, sealed in bags or jars with names such as Gorilla Blue, Amnesia and Raging Bull, can be collected and used for tisanes or as scents for wardrobes. But the majority of customers simply crumble them, roll them and smoke them. The effects are not as pronounced as most cultivated strains of cannabis, which typically have THC levels of 15-25%, but do offer an immediate sense of relaxation. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Italy ranks third in Europe for consumption of cannabis. On his company\u2019s jars of hemp flowers, Scuderi has placed a label: \u201cpizzo-free\u201d. \u201cIt means the product is made without giving a cent to the mafia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe launched a clear message: producing cannabis doesn\u2019t mean just regenerating the land; it is also a way to weaken the mafia, which for decades has continued uninhibited in its quest to control the criminal business of drugs trafficking, and to give back to the farmers what the bosses had taken away from them.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

He has taken off his clerical robe, put aside his white turban and is trying to entertain a group of children in one of Iran\u2019s poorest villages. In between phrases, he troops back and forth to make sure everyone is listening. \u201cAre you with me?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat did Bear want to do?\u201d The children, who are painting their school walls, reply: \u201cBear had a story to tell.\u201d It\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for Esmail Azarinejad, a father of two who is not your average cleric. Iranian theocrats are better known for delivering inflammatory remarks at Friday prayers or fulminating on television against a backdrop of \u201cDeath to America\u201d chants. Azarinejad, 39, sees his mission somewhat differently. When he\u2019s not teaching Islamic philosophy or Arabic literature at his city\u2019s seminary, he travels to villages in the impoverished south-west of Iran, distributing books from the boot of his old Peugeot and reading passages from books such as Bear Has a Story to Tell by the American author Philip C Stead. \u201cSince I came back to my city nearly six years ago after studying in Qom, I realised that 98% of the kids in our villages did not have access to books other than what\u2019s taught in schools,\u201d he said. In his free time, he has started visiting the province\u2019s poorest villages, reading books for kids, showing them films or helping them paint their schools. \u201cReading books and telling tales is an excuse for me,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cMy aim is their intellectual development, so that they have a beautiful world and be able to develop skills. I have a slogan, which says: story, ball, colour. Story will make their minds and world beautiful, ball is playing sport and being healthy, and colour is about painting schools or their libraries.\u201d Azarinejad\u2019s car carries a range of books and films including the Persian translations of titles by the Canadian author and illustrator Peter H Reynolds and those written by the American author Megan McDonald, who is known for her Judy Moody series. \u201cI try to prepare the space for their creativity rather than teach them what to do,\u201d Azarinejad said. \u201cI have no prejudice in choosing book titles, whether written by a foreign writer or by an Iranian, whether religious or not, any book that is fit for developing their mind and skills is good to me.\u201d In his latest trip this week to villages in Dishmok district, Azarinejad showed a four-minute film by the Palme d\u2019Or-winning Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami to 15 children. Early in his career, Kiarostami, who became Iran\u2019s foremost film-maker before his death in 2016, worked at the institute for intellectual development of children and young adults in Tehran, making films about children. Azarinejad said showing Kiarostami\u2019s Two Solutions for One Problem seemed essential in the village because he realised the adults there had been locked in a feud for some time. \u201cAfterwards, I gave them five words to use and compose a story of their own: oak tree, dried-up river, grandma, goat and crocodile. They have oak trees in the area and also a river, and I wanted to draw their attention to the fact that one day their river might dry up,\u201d he said. Iran has a rich tradition of storytelling and fairytales. Its oldest form of dramatic performance is called Naghali, which is on Unesco\u2019s list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding. According to Unesco, \u201cthe performer \u2013 the naqq\u0101l \u2013 recounts stories in verse or prose accompanied by gestures and movements, and sometimes instrumental music and painted scrolls\u201d. Azarinejad said the age of social media has hugely sidelined such ancient traditions that need to be revived, something he hopes to do by encouraging children to write down fairytales told to them by their grandparents, and then recite them to their friends. The Iranian cleric, who earns about 15m rials (\u00a3275) a month, insisted he works on a benevolent basis but encourages donations to support his activities. Provincial locals are raising money to buy him a new car. \u201cI use my private car, use my own petrol, I take my own food while visiting these villages,\u201d said the cleric, who documents his work on social media. \u201cI have not pursued government help, nor they have given me any. This is happening in the sidelines of my life, not related to my job.\u201d Azarinejad, who has two children aged seven and 12, said the tough times Iran is facing because of sanctions and a tense political situation have not taken hope away from him. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of hopeless, there are financial difficulties, but personally I haven\u2019t lost my hope,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is these kids, so long as I can encourage them to read books, I\u2019ll remain hopeful. So long as I see kids with books in their hand, hope will be there.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

She only dares going to see a film with someone she knows won\u2019t mind the disturbances. But when she watched the wildly popular Bollywood biopic Sanju things were different. As the film began, she opened an app on her smartphone and plugged in her earphones. A few taps later she was listening to an audio description of the movie, for the first time in her life. \u201cI felt so independent just to be able to follow and understand the entire film on my own,\u201d she remembers. Kalra is one of the first users of XL Cinema, an app developed in India that can synchronise an audio description of a movie with its cinema audio track. The app, launched in July by the software firm Brajma Intelligent Systems, uses audio descriptions provided by Saksham, an NGO working to empower people in India who are blind or visually impaired. Saksham produced the description in the office and studio of the film\u2019s director, Rajkumar Hirani, a major figure in Indian cinema. In its first two weeks it was used almost 2,500 times at screenings of Sanju, despite being introduced three weeks after the film\u2019s initial release. The app is free but some data is collected, including the name and location of the cinema theatre where it\u2019s been used. The app is the first of its kind. India\u2019s 8.8 million blind and 47.7 million visually impaired citizens have previously been excluded from the national obsession of Bollywood. \u201cI often don\u2019t understand why people around me are laughing during a movie,\u201d says Krishan Kumar Murugan, who has limited vision. While badly needed new legislation that was introduced last year has boosted the rights of disabled Indians, it stopped short of forcing private firms to use tools such as audio description, sign language and captioning when producing media, including movies. Bollywood studios have made positive noises about greater accessibility, though some ultimately argued there was little point in producing audio descriptions if cinemagoers had no way to listen to them. \u201cFilm-makers didn\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d says Dipendra Manocha, Saksham\u2019s co-founder, who is also blind. He\u2019s hopeful that the new technology will now help ramp up the pressure on Bollywood studios to deliver. \u201cThere has been a big shift in attitude from production houses after seeing the app work so seamlessly with Sanju,\u201d Manocha says. Leading film production firms including Sony Pictures, Yash Raj Films, Phantom Films and Fox Star Studios have shown interest. \u201cWe are exploring this idea for some of our upcoming movies,\u201d says Vivek Krishnani, the managing director of Sony Pictures Entertainment Films India. \u201cNext time, we\u2019ll plan much further in advance to ensure that audio description can be part of our films right from day one,\u201d says Hirani, one of India\u2019s most feted film-makers. Before the app\u2019s arrival, the only way to watch a movie with audio description was to wait months after the film\u2019s release to order a DVD from Saksham, if the NGO had created one for that film (it has made 28 so far). A handful of audio-described screenings are also organised a few times a year at film festivals and in auditoriums around the country by interested organisations. The XL Cinema app was originally created to allow cinemagoers to listen to translations of movies in multiple languages, according to Kunaal Prasad of Brajma Intelligent Systems. \u201cMeeting Kunaal seemed like divine intervention. We were so relieved to have found a solution,\u201d says Manocha. Within three weeks, Prasad had carried out trial runs of the app while Saksham\u2019s team gained permission to debut the app at screenings of Sanju. Manocha and Prasad are hopeful of a wider response once word spreads. \u201cThe app is a great example of universal design,\u201d says Manocha. \u201cI hope that the power of Bollywood will be able to draw attention to inclusion.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Now, it sustains his greatest ambition. Aljazairli was a non-swimmer when he fled Damascus and took his chances on a small, barely seaworthy vessel that took him across the Mediterranean. Now he spends four hours each day in a swimming pool and dreams of making it to the Olympics. \u201cMy story starts with the American swimmer Michael Phelps,\u201d the 24-year-old says, sitting in a friend\u2019s flat in north-east London. \u201cI was sitting at home late at night and I saw a video of him on YouTube by chance. \u201cI saw him swimming and flying. He really inspired me and ignited a passion inside me,\u201d he adds. \u201cAfter watching two hours of films, I just said to myself: this is something I have to do.\u201d Aljazairli was training to be an accountant and working as a visual merchandiser, developing floor plans and three-dimensional displays for shops when the Syrian war broke out. He arrived in Britain from Damascus in 2016, settling first in Scotland and then in the outskirts of London. When he was granted a five-year visa to remain in Britain this January, he moved to a hostel. And started swimming. Within six months, he has gone from barely being able to swim at all to clocking 43 seconds for the 50-metre freestyle. His times remain well short of Olympic qualifying levels, but his coaches reckon he could compete in a refugee team if the Rio 2016 innovation is repeated at the Tokyo games in 2020. The swimming Syrian, who lives on a meagre allowance of \u00a35 a day, says he saves on groceries so as to put money aside for his monthly membership at the Waltham Forest Feel Good Centre. \u201cI started practising, and I was so excited at first. When I started, I could not swim two or three metres, and I didn\u2019t know why because it looked so easy on the video,\u201d he says. Swimming takes him away from everything and transports him to another world where he feels untouchable, he says. \u201cWhen you have a hard day and have a lot going on, you just go into the water and enter another world. In the water you cannot hear or see anyone \u2026 All I have is 25 metres and my passion to get to the Olympics.\u201d Daniel Bullock, a local coach who has taken Aljazairli on, says the pace of his progress is remarkable \u2013 but that he has a way to go to get to hit the Olympic standard (currently the best in the world swim approximately twice as fast as him). \u201cI hope that there will be mini-Olympics within the bigger event \u2026 We have been trying to support Eid\u2019s application and find out whether there will be another like that,\u201d he says. He adds: \u201cThe reason so many people have taken Eid\u2019s story to heart and helped him \u2026 is that with little help, he has taught himself to swim in six months. He\u2019s remarkable in his own right and has made rapid progress. His story is really an inspiration. I hope he will go back to Syria and be the next minister for swimming and generate interest in it,\u201d Bullock adds. A crowdfunding page has been set up to help raise money to give Aljazairli the right support to compete. Aljazairli is now learning English and wants to go to university in September, but swimming is now a big part of his life. \u201cI currently swim from 6am to 8am and 6pm to 8pm. I can organise my life around it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people hear my dream of swimming in the Olympics and I tell them I want to be like Michael Phelps, people laugh \u2026 They say, \u2018You are a refugee and you get \u00a35 a day, don\u2019t waste your time and do other things.\u2019 But I believe in myself and that I can do anything. When I hear people say that, it pushes me harder. I am not just a refugee, but I am a dreamer.\u201d Bullock says: \u201cEid wants to go and be competitive. He has a long way to go to do that. He needs help with nutrition and help with strength and conditioning. He needs to swim in a pool bigger than 25 metres \u2026 We are a stepping stone helping him through to the next stage.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Rohingya turn to blockchain to solve identity crisis", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/rohingya-turn-to-blockchain-to-solve-identity-crisis", "date": "2018-08-21", "transcript": "Rohingya refugees are turning to blockchain-type technology to help address one of their most existential threats: lack of officially-recognised identity. Denied citizenship in their home country of Myanmar for decades, the Muslim minority was the target of a brutal campaign of violence by the military which culminated a year ago this week. A \u201cclearance operation\u201d led by Buddhist militia sent more than 700,000 Rohingya pouring over the border into Bangladesh, without passports or official ID. The Myanmar government has since agreed to take the Rohingya back, but are refusing to grant them citizenship. Many Rohingya do not want to return and face life without a home or an identity. This growing crisis prompted Muhammad Noor and his team at the Rohingya Project to try to find a digital solution. \u201cWhy does a centralised entity like a bank or government own my identity,\u201d says Noor, a Rohingya community leader based in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cWho are they to say if I am who I am?\u201d Using blockchain-based technology, Noor, is trialling the use of digital identity cards that aim to help Rohingya in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia access services such as banking and education. The hope is that successful trials might lead to a system that can help the community across southeast Asia. Under the scheme, a blockchain database is used to record individual digital IDs, which can then be issued to people once they have taken a test to verify that they are genuine Rohingya. Noor\u2019s goal is to give Rohingya the power to reclaim their identities with a resilient system that their host countries will recognise, allowing them access to social programmes, legal rights, education and healthcare. At this stage, the Rohingya Project\u2019s main objective is to address the most prominent issue facing stateless peoples: financial exclusion. Noor\u2019s team is one of a group of refugees and stateless peoples around the globe who are harnessing the power of blockchain technology to reclaim their identities. The concept of the blockchain comes from the digital currency bitcoin, which tracks the movement of money around its ecosystem by grouping transactions into 10 minute-long blocks, each of which is inextricably linked to every previous block in a chain of transactions going back to the currency\u2019s creation. Because of how those blocks are created and linked, they can serve as an immutable record of who owns what, even without any central authority verifying the network as a whole. That property \u2013 the idea of a decentralised, \u201ctrustless\u201d database \u2013 has proved appealing to uses beyond e-money, with blockchain startups now offering everything from cloud computing to virtual trading cards. It has gained popularity among humanitarians in recent years, with charities using it to transfer money cheaply and disburse aid to refugees. Tufic Al Rjula\u2019s birth certificate was destroyed in Kuwait during the first Gulf war. Living for two years in a Dutch refugee camp as he worked through the asylum process, Al Rjula met more than 1,000 other \u201cinvisible\u201d men, women and children whose identifying documents were either destroyed or unverifiable. Years later, having personally experienced how centralised, paper-based IDs such as birth certificates, drivers licences and degrees can easily be lost, forged or misused, Al Rjula co-founded award-winning startup Tykn with Jimmy Snoek. Tykn\u2019s mission statement is to provide \u201cself-sovereign identity to all\u201d. Al Rjula cites the punch card system used by the Nazis in the second world war to identify and track people on the basis of ethnicity as an example of the ways traditional forms of ID can be exploited and undermined. Snoek says that while paper-based ID is \u201cnon-resilient\u201d to forgery, discrimination and loss, a blockchain-based system offers better protection. In their host countries, refugees and stateless peoples are often found living on the periphery of society. Unable to work legally and operating in cash-based \u201cdark\u201d economies rife with exploitation, they are prevented from building the network of official connections needed to verify their identity and open a bank account. Blockchain-based initiatives, such as the Rohingya Project, could eventually allow people to build the network of relationships necessary to participate in the modern global economy and prevent second and third generation \u201cinvisible\u201d people from slipping into poverty. It could also allow refugees to send money across borders, bypassing high transaction fees. In Jordan\u2019s Azraq refugee camp, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is using blockchain and biometrics to help Syrian refugees to purchase groceries using a voucher system. This use of the technology allows the WFP to bypass bank fees. But Al Rjula says privacy is still an issue. \u201cThe technology is maturing, yet implementation by startups and emerging tech companies is still lacking,\u201d he says. The involvement of a trendy technology such as blockchains can often be enough to secure the funding, attention and support that start-ups \u2013 whether for-profit or charitable \u2013 need to thrive. But companies such as Tykn still have to tackle plenty of the same issues as their old-fashioned database-using counterparts, from convincing governments and NGOs to use their services in the first place to working out how to make enough overhead to pay staff, while also dealing with the fickle issues of building on a cutting-edge platform. Blockchain-based humanitarian initiatives will also need to reckon with the problem of accountability in their efforts to aid refugees and those trapped in the limbo of statelessness. Dilek Genc, a PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh who studies blockchain-type applications in humanitarian aid and development, saysif the aid community continues to push innovation using Silicon Valley\u2019s creed of \u201cfail fast and often,\u201d and experiment on vulnerable peoples they will be fundamentally at odds with humanitarian principles and fail to address the political roots of issues facing refugees.

The sand under its stately trees looked completely barren, but Souley Cheibou, a farmer in his 60s, was not worried. He crooked a finger, fished in the sand, and brought out a millet seed. In a week or two, this seed would germinate and sprout, and soon the whole field would be green. Cheibou\u2019s peace of mind stemmed from the trees encircling him, which had been standing long before he was born. Despite appearances, these were not any old acacias. They were gao trees \u2013 known as winterthorns in English \u2013 with unique, seemingly magical powers. From the peanut basin of Senegal to the Seno plains of Mali, to Yatenga, formerly the most degraded region of Burkina Faso, and as far south as Malawi: gaos are thriving in Africa. And over the past three decades, the landscape of southern Niger has been transformed by more than 200m new trees, many of them gaos. They have not been planted but have grown naturally on over 5m hectares of farmland, nurtured by thousands of farmers. According to scientists, what has happened in Niger \u2013 one of the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2013 is the largest-scale positive transformation of the environment in the whole of Africa. This is not a grand UN-funded project aiming to offset climate change. Small-scale farmers have achieved it because of what the trees can do for crop yields and other aspects of farming life. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic tree, a very wonderful tree,\u201d said Abasse Tougiani of Niger\u2019s National Institute of Agricultural Research, who has travelled all over Niger studying Faidherbia albida \u2013 the gao\u2019s Latin name. Shielded from the sun, crops planted under the canopy of a tree usually do not do well in the short term, although there can be longer-term benefits. That\u2019s one reason why many west African rainforests have been decimated. But with gaos, it\u2019s the other way round. The root system of the gao is nearly as big as its branches, and unusually it draws nitrogen from the air, fertilising the soil. And unlike other trees in the area, gao tree leaves fall in the rainy season, allowing more sunlight through to the crops at a key moment. Used along with mineral fertilisers, crop yields double under gaos, and the gao-nourished soil holds water better, ensuring a better crop in drought years. Counterintuitively, the great gao regreening is only happening in areas of Niger with high-density populations. With less space to expand into as more people are born, hard-up farmers are increasingly realising that the trees can regenerate degraded land. \u201cIt\u2019s literally a story of more people, more trees,\u201d said Chris Reij, a sustainable land management specialist. \u201cThe whole point is that the trees are not protected and managed by farmers for their environmental beauty, but because they are part of the agricultural production system.\u201d Inadvertently, the farmers are also doing their bit to offset climate change. Trees are crucial for storing carbon, absorbing it out of the atmosphere. \u201cIn mature, fairly dense areas, you get 30 tons of wood per hectare. Half of that is carbon,\u201d said Gray Tappan, a geographer. Efforts to restore 100m hectares of degraded African land by 2030 are underway. The ambitious Great Green Wall project to surround the Sahara desert with trees and other plants has changed beyond recognition after debate over whether desertification - the process by which soil loses its fertitlity - is real. Progress is slow. In Niger, where temperatures often reach the 40s, the trees create a cooler microclimate, and rabbits and jackals are coming back. But none of these grand political projects explains why gaos have caught on. The trees\u2019 pods make very nutritious animal fodder, and fallen branches make good firewood, meaning Droum\u2019s women and children \u2013 whose job it is to collect fuel for cooking fires \u2013 rarely have to venture further than a few kilometres to find it. Women in Droum have also made medicine from their gaos for generations. \u201cPeople come all the way from Zinder [Niger\u2019s second largest city] to buy it,\u201d said Husseina Ibrahim, a busy mother, next to a pot of boiling gao bark. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who makes this here. It\u2019s great for me, it earns me a bit of money which I pay into the women\u2019s cooperative.\u201d Tales about how the gao came to be so revered abound. Legend has it that crimes against gaos have been taken very seriously since the mid-19th century. \u201cIf you touched a branch, you would go to jail,\u201d Tougiani said. In splendid brocade robes and curly-toed velvet slippers, surrounded by self-portraits and stick-wielding guards dressed in red and green, today\u2019s district chief in Droum takes a slightly softer approach. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful to have to come before the chief and explain yourself. Often that\u2019s punishment enough,\u201d Maman Ali Kaoura said. Droum\u2019s reoffenders face fines of between 5,000 to 10,000 West African CFA francs (\u00a36.75-\u00a313.50), a huge amount for hard-up farmers. A sense of ownership has been key in the regreening of Niger. Until the mid-1980s, every tree was considered to belong to the state. When this changed, regreening began, as people were happier to look after trees that belonged to them. In areas with the best cover, they organised patrols to protect their trees from passing farmers and neighbouring villagers seeking firewood. Once people discovered that \u201cone gao was equal to 10 cows\u201d for fertilising, as Tougiani put it, the tree\u2019s popularity took off. Several schemes, including one where farmers with more than 50 gaos were paid 50 CFA for each one, helped it along. But their loyalty to their gaos could make areas around Zinder the most vulnerable to a disease that Reij and Tougiani have recently spotted killing trees near Niamey, the capital. If it spreads, the losses could be enormous, particularly in places where there is a near-monoculture of gaos. \u201cI\u2019m worried, because it\u2019s green oil for farmers \u2013 it\u2019s their wealth,\u201d said Tougiani. \u201cIf they lose Faidherbia albida, they\u2019ll lose their way of life. They\u2019ll have to leave the village.\u201d For Cheibou, losing his trees is unthinkable \u2013 they were his birthright. \u201cI have nearly 100 gao trees in my fields, which I inherited from my father,\u201d he said. On his way back to the village, he paused by a particularly large one, and cracked open its round seedpod. \u201cThis one was here when I was a boy. Just like it is now.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

One problem: the booming local tech scene had turbocharged demand for homes, and they found themselves outbid time and again. As well as security, Mark craved a connection with her neighbours. Previously, she would be lucky to get a quick \u201chi\u201d on the street. \u201cI\u2019m very friendly. I\u2019ve lived in many different neighbourhoods in San Francisco,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d try to make friends but there wasn\u2019t a sense of community.\u201d Then, among the artist studios and loft apartments on the colourful streets of Jingletown, Oakland, Mark found an answer: the Phoenix Commons, a co-housing community for over-55s. Residents own their modest homes while sharing spacious communal areas, including a kitchen, movie room and a hot tub. The community is self-managed, residents work together in committees and each night a group of volunteers cooks for everyone. The four-storey complex of 41 units is designed to foster a sense of community. Apartment windows face each other and walkways create a visible sense of life and movement. Mark was one of the first to move in, two years ago. She appreciates how much residents help each other, from sharing food to supporting someone through the death of a partner. \u201cMy friends jokingly call this the Commune,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they could witness life here, it might allay some of their fears about giving up their independence. It is an incredible feeling of security, safety and peacefulness.\u201d Co-housing is growing in popularity with young and old around the world. There are 165 co-housing communities in the US and another 140 in the planning stages. In the UK, Older Women\u2019s Co-Housing (OWCH) in north London has a long waiting list and there are 20 other established co-housing communities, and 40 in development. Co-housing is a long-established part of the housing mix in the Netherlands and Sweden, where communities are supported by government, and the idea is growing in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. Interest in co-housing has risen since the economic downturn and as housing costs in cities surged. Many may argue it is a lamentable trend, but closer ties with neighbours can provide an antidote to the modern epidemic of loneliness, particularly among older people. Half a century ago in the summer of love, baby boomers were part of a seismic cultural shift, and now another is under way, this time revolutionising retirement. This generation of retirees are the healthiest ever and crave continued personal independence while maintaining community ties. Robby Kiley, 75, a Phoenix Commons resident, describes traditional retirement homes as \u201clanded cruise ships\u201d, where meals and entertainment are provided at a cost. She worries that an absence of responsibilities leads to regression and decline. Phoenix Commons is self-managed, and residents must be able to live independently. That excludes people who require care but encourages those who want to continue to lead a relatively active lifestyle. \u201cWe\u2019re always learning,\u201d says Kiley. \u201cHere you have to keep up.\u201d Christian Zimmerman set up Phoenix Commons because, he says, it\u2019s the way that he wants to grow old: in close proximity with his peers and not a passive consumer. \u201cLiving alone in an apartment is not the best way to live,\u201d says Zimmerman, who spent 45 years managing retirement homes. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people like it. I think they\u2019re just afraid of the other things. They\u2019re afraid that if they move into a community that they\u2019re not going to get along with somebody, or they\u2019re not going to get enough privacy. But what price privacy?\u201d A couple of hours\u2019 drive inland, in the university town of Davis, is another co-housing community, America\u2019s oldest. Muir Commons was set up in 1991 by two architecture graduates, Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, who had researched co-housing communities in Denmark. The design for the multigenerational Muir Commons fills a typical American block, but instead of regimented rows of houses facing the road, homes have been built at angles to each other with open and connected front gardens. Children run back and forth, enjoying a communal playground, an orchard and vegetable beds. Cars are kept out of the way in car parks, and there is a common house where the community eats together a couple of nights a week. Ben Finkelor moved in because he thought it would be good for his children. \u201cYou open your front door and they can play and there\u2019s no cars,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can share parenting. We have social activities. On Father\u2019s Day we have a water fight \u2013 dads vs the kids.\u201d He thinks his children benefit from interacting with older residents. \u201cThe intergenerational thing is very important,\u201d agrees Ray Frank, 72, another resident. \u201cI would never want to live in a community of people of essentially the same age. It\u2019s such a delight to watch children growing up. And we\u2019ve found that the kids here grow up with certain skills that most other children don\u2019t develop easily. They learn how to talk to people of all ages.\u201d Residents say the Muir Commons children have better social skills, and the older residents without children and grandchildren of their own get to enjoy a sense of family. According to Stephanie Cacioppo, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Chicago, loneliness among retirees in the US is becoming an alarming public health issue. \u201cThe availability of community programmes, behavioural interventions and online resources is increasing to address the problem of loneliness. Co-housing is one of these programmes that gives us hope,\u201d she says. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Four months ago, about 70 migrants arrived in the city of Biha\u0107, close to the border with Croatia, and pitched tents in the centre. The mayor, \u0160uhret Fazli\u0107, suggested they move to the concrete shell of a half-built dormitory on the edge of town. \u201cDuring the war, Biha\u0107 was under siege for 1,200 days,\u201d said Fazli\u0107. \u201cWe feel enormous empathy with these people.\u201d There are now about 1,000 people living in the building. Few migrants and refugees want to stay in Bosnia, citing a lack of economic opportunity, but as people have been repeatedly and violently pushed back from Croatia, they have been made to feel welcome by many locals. Asim Lati\u0107, a restaurant owner in Velika Kladu\u0161a, another border town, said: \u201cIn February I saw a man standing in the street in the snow. I asked if he was hungry, and he said he didn\u2019t have any money. \u201cI said it didn\u2019t matter and fed him. That guy texted his friends and the next day they came. More people came, and I had to close the restaurant. Since then, we\u2019ve given out 68,000 meals.\u201d Lati\u0107, 63, now receives funding from the International Organization for Migration, but for two months he and three friends funded the operation. \u201cWe are all war veterans. We know what it means to have nothing, we know what it means to be hungry,\u201d he said during an interview at the back of his cafe, as dozens of people tucked into plates of spaghetti at the front. As the months go on, the mood is beginning to sour, however. On Monday in Biha\u0107, locals protested against the current situation. Most of the anger was directed at authorities for mishandling the situation, but there is also growing unease about the migrants. Harun, 20, held up a sign saying \u201cimmigrants go home\u201d. He said that three days previously, two migrants had stolen his mobile phone, possibly a result of Croatian police stealing or breaking phones, an allegation that came up repeatedly. The situation is made more difficult by Bosnia\u2019s complex and dysfunctional political system, which has four separate levels of authority. Added to this are upcoming elections in October. Milorad Dodik, who leads the Serb-majority entity that forms half the Bosnian political system, has claimed Sarajevo authorities are deliberately settling Muslim migrants in order to change the demographic balance of the country. Fazli\u0107 said the government in Sarajevo was more concerned about scoring political points than finding a workable solution to the issue. \u201cThere are so many scumbags in politics who will say anything for political advantage,\u201d he said.

The plans for Cloughjordan, a settlement in the heart of Ireland, provided for a working farm, solar power, an \u201cedible landscape\u201d and district heating. There would be 130 plots for homes on a 67-acre site and some communal ownership. Then, 10 years ago this month came the financial crisis. \u201cIn 2008, there were deposits on every site,\u201d says Davie Philip, one of the founders. \u201cThen, with the crash, we lost all our staff and 50% of our deposits.\u201d Ten years later, it is remarkable that Cloughjordan is still soldiering on. Harsh lessons have been learned and this is certainly no utopia. But locals are adamant that they are the pioneers of a low-carbon economy and that the world can learn from their example. In all, 55 houses have been built on the 130 sites, with another 20 sites sold. The sustainable heating, drainage and sewage systems have had problems, leading to some ecological compromises, but the basic infrastructure works. And though it may not be fully self-sufficient, the village has a working farm, an array of well-tended polytunnels and a bakery providing the community with good food year round. Philip, a Scotsman who moved to Ireland 25 years ago and now lives on Cloughjordan\u2019s main street, takes me on a tour. \u201cThings are always a bit messy here because we have to do everything ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no municipal services, so we have to cut the grass, keep it clean, plant bushes and apple trees. This isn\u2019t the market square that we envisaged, but it\u2019s still used in various ways.\u201d Some of the houses are self-built \u2013 Philip points out a hobbitish \u201chand-sculpted\u201d dwelling with a roof made of recycled plastic \u201cslates\u201d \u2013 while others are contract-built. They are kept warm by the district heating system up the hill, whose boilers are powered by wood chips from an Irish sawmill. Behind it is a big field of solar panels, which Philip admits has not worked properly since it was installed in 2008. \u201cThe company that installed it went bust in the recession, so there was no recourse,\u201d he says. As a result, the community has had to rely on mains electricity to drive the pumps. Across the road, in his RED (Research Education Development) garden, Bruce Darrell stresses the importance of growing one\u2019s own food in an uncertain world. \u201cI\u2019m at the doomer end of the spectrum, I\u2019m not a utopian,\u201d he says, showing me the plots where he has been experimenting with various approaches to growing, including the \u201cno-dig\u201d method. \u201cThis is about resilience. It\u2019s about how to get by in a resource-constrained future.\u201d \u201cWhen the diesel runs out, we\u2019ll be ready,\u201d says farmer Pat Malone cheerfully. Today he has connected his plough to a tractor but \u201cas often as we can\u201d his team employs horses. \u201cWe\u2019re combining old practices with new equipment,\u201d he says. \u201cHorses provide dung and they disturb the soil much less than tractors. The challenge working with horses is to create time. For that, you need more people. We want to bring people back on to the land.\u201d Similar sentiments are expressed by Joe Fitzmaurice and Julie Lockett at Riot Rye bakery. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the old system of bakeries, where the amount of bread you produced was limited by how far a [delivery] horse could travel,\u201d says Fitzmaurice. Their wood-fired oven restricts output to 350 loaves a week and they supplement their income by running baking classes. The eco-village allows people to put ideas of low-impact living into practice and to promote them to the wider world. What\u2019s harder, it becomes clear, is keeping the community itself happy. \u201cWhen I arrived, I thought the work was to bring a lot of approaches \u2013 green building, permaculture, renewable energy \u2013 together in a community,\u201d says Philip. \u201cNow I see the real work, in every community, is how do we cooperate when we have different values and world views?\u201d At Cloughjordan, rather than relying on (and being failed by) distant administrative bodies, the residents do all the work themselves \u2013 from governance to lawn-mowing. This requires a huge amount of collective effort and no small amount of diplomacy. \u201cYou need to be a good communicator,\u201d says Lockett. \u201cYou\u2019re engaging on a lot more levels. We\u2019re tied together financially, which leads to different conversations with neighbours \u2013 people don\u2019t usually talk about money.\u201d Decision-making happens on a consensus basis; a number of groups and subgroups have been set up to cover areas such as education, land use and development. It can be complicated and often frustrating, but, as resident academic Peadar Kirby says: \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? Give all the power to the board? This governance structure allows a huge amount of creativity to flourish.\u201d Many who consider themselves part of the project, including Philip, live in the old village of Cloughjordan nearby. \u201cSome people in the pub will give out about us after a few drinks, but that\u2019s to be expected,\u201d Philip says. He points out that the population of Cloughjordan has increased, while many other Irish country villages are losing residents, so schools are better attended and staffed as a result. The biggest challenge, says Philip, is getting more young people involved. \u201cWe were in our 30s when we started, but we\u2019re not that young anymore,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cWe need to make it easier for young people to come here, buy plots and build\u201d and contribute to the community. He cites co-housing schemes as one possible way forward here. When I ask another of the founder-residents, the journalist Iva Pocock, if the success of Cloughjordan depends on whether it is replicated elsewhere, she shakes her head. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to save the world by people setting up eco-villages is naive.\u201d A better measure of success, she says, is if other communities take on elements of what has been implemented here: the car-sharing scheme, for example, or what Pocock refers to as Cloughjordan\u2019s edible landscape \u2013 the fruit bushes, trees and herbs around the village, which anyone can make use of. Kirby is more bullish. \u201cIf the question is: what political system could we design to get to a low-carbon economy? I think we\u2019re modelling that, for all our faults and failures.\u201d That evening, the sun is out and the market square is aglow. Children are playing, neighbours are chatting, people are out walking their dogs. The grass is unkempt and a few nearby buildings need a lick of paint, but somehow this seems less significant than it did when I arrived. Cloughjordan has a long way to go, it\u2019s true, but perhaps we should appreciate just how far it has come.

But my life is more enriching | Tuomas Muraja", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/07/universal-basic-income-rich-finland-work-benefits", "date": "2018-08-07", "transcript": "The Finnish basic income trial, of which I am part, finishes at the end of the year. Having been interviewed by nearly 70 separate media outlets, from the BBC to Le Figaro, the question I have been asked most often has been: how has the basic income trial changed my life? My answer is simple. In money terms, my life has not changed at all. However, the psychological effects of this human experiment have been transformative. I vastly prefer basic income to a benefits system fraught with complicated forms, mandatory courses and pointless obligations. Before the trial, the risk of losing unemployment benefits and the cumbersome process of reapplying for them were an obstacle to accepting small job assignments. The bureaucracy involved made accepting some not worthwhile, or simply too risky. The basic income trial started at the beginning of 2017. A random sample of 2,000 people aged 25 to 58 was chosen to take part and receive a monthly income of \u20ac560 (\u00a3475), with no requirement to seek or accept employment. The precondition was that the participants had received either a labour-market subsidy or a basic unemployment allowance from Finland\u2019s social insurance institution Kela in November 2016. At that point I had just run out of a grant I had received and was officially a jobseeker, making me eligible to take part. The Finnish government wanted to find out if jobseekers obtain work more easily when the basic unemployment allowance is replaced with a basic income. During the trial the participants had the right to keep their basic income even if they found work. The idea is that temporary and part-time work is becoming increasingly common, which may mean there is also a growing interest in social security models that support the acceptance of such work. The basic income trial has indeed resulted in work for myself and many other participants, from IT experts, artists and commerce professionals to new graduates. And there is little doubt that the trial benefits people in creative fields, freelancers, people doing expert work and project workers \u2013 an ever-increasing number of people. My income consists of fees I charge as a writer and lecturer as well as grants I receive from various institutions. I have also had occasional brief periods of unemployment during which I have received unemployment benefits. My monthly income has varied from some \u20ac3,000 to nothing at all. The Finnish social security system allows an unemployed person to earn a maximum of \u20ac300 a month with a 50% tax set on any earnings exceeding that limit. While taking part in the basic income trial I have been able to accept speaking engagements in libraries and schools for a fee of \u20ac250, a seat in panel discussions in the SuomiAreena public debate forum and at book fairs. Concerns have been voiced about the high cost of the basic income model. But free school meals, free basic education and universal basic healthcare are expensive too. Critics say that basic income at the level used in the trial cannot be extended to cover the entire population as this would create an adverse balance of some \u20ac10-15bn. But atypical employment relationships are on the increase and our social security system has become outdated. The system requires more investment to boost the minimum income level, to improve the level of financial incentives and to simplify it. Basic income models do come with a small increase in taxation. For a large number of employed people this will, however, be compensated for by the basic income. As more people manage to find work while supported by basic income, taxation for everyone can be eased. In terms of purchasing power, basic income would have a predominantly positive effect as it would help people in low-income jobs the most. The critics fear that basic income will make people lazy. However, limited evidence from several basic-income trials from around the world prove that people use basic income to improve their quality of life and not as a licence to do nothing. Research has shown that unemployed people do not have a low motivation for work. Neither is it justified to say that unemployment on a large scale is the result of an unwillingness to work. The isolated cases of lazy, work-averse individuals so eagerly highlighted by the media do not represent the situation accurately. I hope this trial encourages future governments to examine fresh options. My living costs today stand at nearly \u20ac2,000 a month \u2013 it\u2019s a sum I would never be able to pay with just the basic income. And that was not the idea. Rather, basic income acts as the perfect incentive \u2013 it gives you security to chase other opportunities. It pushes you to seek fulfilling work \u2013 and isn\u2019t that what unemployment benefits should do? \u2022 Tuomas Muraja is a journalist and writer who is taking part in the Finnish basic income trial", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How an army of volunteers helped Paraguay to conquer malaria", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/06/paraguay-eliminates-malaria-regional-outbreaks-soar", "date": "2018-08-06", "transcript": "One recent morning, the halls of Senepa \u2013 Paraguay\u2019s National Malaria Eradication Service \u2013 echoed to the sounds of folk songs and a violin. The health minister handed out medals, and a dancer, balancing a bottle on her head, swished her skirts around the room. The traditional celebrations marked Paraguay\u2019s official elimination of malaria in June \u2013 the only country in South America to have eradicated the infectious, life-threatening disease, and the first in the western hemisphere to do so since Cuba in 1973. For many, it is an achievement akin to a military victory after 60 years of struggle. The campaign began in 1939, when a grueling war with Bolivia, an outbreak of malaria infected 80,000 people out of a population of 1 million. \u201cIt had a huge social and economic impact,\u201d said M\u00f3nica Ozorio, a biochemist and the director of Senepa\u2019s anti-malaria programme. \u201cIt affected all the regions \u2013 we even had it in the Chaco.\u201d Tens of thousands died. The epidemic prompted Paraguay to establish its health ministry \u2013 and, in 1957, the anti-malaria agency. It was the beginning of six decades of sustained eradication, said Luis Escoto, the WHO representative in Paraguay. \u201cPassing through different political moments and governments of different colours, it has become a policy of state,\u201d Escoto said. A lasting commitment to spending of a fixed portion of income from the country\u2019s social security programme \u2013 first 0.5%, later 1.5% \u2013 on battling the disease was a \u201cdecisive factor,\u201d he added. So too were shifts in strategy \u2013 from a top-down, Senepa-led effort that focused on mass fumigation of mosquito breeding grounds, to one that incorporated the national health service and focused on diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cases. Senepa clustered dozens of diagnosis laboratories in malaria-prone regions, and those adjacent to Brazil. Private and public clinics are required to treat cases, free of charge. Businesses and media outlets run information campaigns. \u201cIf there\u2019s an imported case of malaria these days, it\u2019s national news \u2013 all the ministries are informed,\u201d said Ozorio. But most point to the key factor as being a network of up to 5,000 unpaid volunteers \u2013 including urban community organisers and indigenous leaders \u2013 that is still working to educate fellow citizens, eliminate mosquito habitats, and stay alert for new cases. Everyone has a grandparent or cousin who did their bit, Ozorio explained. \u201cWe feel proud that a small country has done it, with our own resources and everyone working together,\u201d she added. By the turn of the last century, these efforts were bearing fruit. The last case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest form of the disease, was registered in 1995. The Plasmodium vivax variety was eliminated in 2011. A five-year program with the support of the WHO and the Global Fund thereafter worked to prevent re-transmission and boost community education, prevention and treatment. Finally, in April this year, the country was certified as having been free of home-grown malaria cases for three years, the first of 21 countries \u2013 including Mexico, Belize and El Salvador \u2013 that were earmarked by the WHO as on course do so by 2020. \u201cParaguay is an excellent demonstration that it is possible,\u201d Escoto said. The victory is a much-needed success story, both for Paraguay and the region. The country\u2019s health service is fragmented and otherwise short on funding, often making the headlines for shocking reason, such as Paraguay\u2019s high rates of child pregnancy. And despite long-term progress, malaria cases have spiked worldwide in recent years \u2013 to 216 million cases in 2016 \u2013 with much of the increase in Latin America. At least 445,000 people died from the disease in 2016. The disease has erupted in crisis-ridden Venezuela, where the government has refused offers of outside help to contain it. In Brazil \u2013 which shares 2,200km of largely uncontrolled borders with Paraguay \u2013 malaria infections grew by 80% between January and June, said Ozorio. \u201cThe risk of importation is very high, it\u2019s undeniable,\u201d she added. \u201c30,000 people, especially students, cross the border every day.\u201d Senepa is boosting coordination between migration officials, hotels, universities, and clinics; two Paraguayan nationals who returned from Africa with malaria in June were treated rapidly. And there are global trends that could see malaria return to Paraguay \u2013 and spread to nearby countries unused to the disease, catching doctors unprepared. \u201cClimate change is a worry for everyone,\u201d said Escoto. \u201cWe can\u2019t let our guard down.\u201d Rising, fluctuating temperatures, heavy rainfall and flooding all create hospitable environments for disease-carrying vectors in previously malaria-free areas, he explained. \u201cIn northern Argentina, provinces where mosquitoes once didn\u2019t exist are now natural habitats,\u201d he added. \u201cChile and Uruguay are now at risk.\u201d But Paraguay remains vigilant, Ozorio said, and ready to share the lessons of six decades in eradicating the illness. \u201cIt\u2019s a national achievement,\u201d she added, describing heroic clinicians sent off to the countryside in decades past with little more than a microscope and a motorbike. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of mystique to Senepa,\u201d she laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history to tell.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Maya Gurung has policed these streets for the past nine years. But she is not a law enforcement officer. She is one of a team of people who scour the Nepali-Indian borderlands for signs of one of the most insidious \u2013 and growing \u2013 crimes in this part of the world: the trafficking for sex of young women. Traffickers target young women from Nepal\u2019s remote communities, promising them employment opportunities abroad, only to sell them into forced labour and prostitution once they reach India\u2019s megacities. These women can spend years locked up in brothels, being made to have sex with over 20 men a day to make money for their \u201cowners\u201d. With no access to healthcare, many fall victim to disease and never make it home. Estimates put the number trafficked at as high as 10,000 a year. The \u201chuman interceptors\u201d, as they are known, work in partnership with Love Justice International, an NGO that coordinates teams at 20 of Nepal\u2019s border crossings. Gurung is tasked with monitoring the constant stream of traffic across the border, and physically intercepting women she suspects are being tricked out of Nepal by human traffickers. Love Justice International has said it averages about 90 successful interceptions a month in Nepal. The interceptors look for several signs that passers-by might be being trafficked, mostly by assessing their body language. Sometimes women were clearly panicking, but most often they were simply nervous, and look unrelated to the person travelling with them. \u201cThe first thing we say is: \u2018Where are you from, where are you going?\u2019,\u201d says Gurung. \u201cWe ask if their family know that they are travelling to India and when they say they do, we call them to check.\u201d At this point holes in the stories sometimes appear. The family may say she was travelling to meet relatives, while her accomplice would mention a job or a shopping trip. Often the women themselves would lie, refusing to give up hope of a better life on the other side. The traffickers have established close relationships with victims, and often came from their own communities. Sometimes they would pretend to be in love with them and trick them into India with promises of marriage. Increasingly, the traffickers were young women themselves. The interceptors do not have any legal authority to stop people crossing the border, and instead have relied on the local police force to apprehend traffickers once they have identified that an attempt at trafficking was being made. \u201cThe hardest part is when we take the girls we intercept to the police station and try to file charges against their trafficker, but these cases are not taken seriously,\u201d says Gurung. \u201cThe police sometimes ignore the cases and even accuse the victims, saying, \u2018This girl is no good and that she wants to be sold\u2019.\u201d Maya recounts one interception where the team identified a young woman being taken across the border by a man who had promised her a job that they later verified did not exist. When the interceptors took the pair to the police station to file a case against the trafficker, he became violent and threatened Maya and her family. \u201cIntercepting human traffickers can be a dangerous job\u201d, she says. Sometimes, the victim can prove reluctant to be rescued. This is where Asmita Thapa steps in. As the youngest member of the team she seeks to build a rapport with the women who were usually of similar age. Young women have found it easier to share their experiences with her and often provided valuable information about how the trafficker approached them and the routes taken from their village toward the border. \u201cIt can make me sad sometimes,\u201d Thapa says. \u201cThe bad environment can be difficult to be around, and fighting and struggling with the girls that do not realise that we are trying to help them can be frustrating. They do not cooperate at first because many of them lack education and they trust the trafficker to be telling them the truth.\u201d When women have been rescued, they were housed in a shelter until their family could collect them. Binsa Mishra, who has been an interceptor at the Birgunj station for the past seven years, explains that reuniting them can be complicated. \u201cThe parents of the girls can sometimes get angry when they come to collect their daughters, especially when they left without telling them,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes they try to beat them but we help them to understand each other where we can.\u201d If the girls could not return to their families, they were connected with other NGOs who could offer long-term support in residential shelters. While most cases have been difficult, the group has managed to secure several convictions against traffickers. Often its success depends on the group\u2019s relationship with the district-level police, but regularly these commissioners have been rotated out of their posts and valuable relationships were lost. Gurung became a human interceptor after she began to understand the scale of the problem, and the realities of what life was like for the women that they did not manage to save. Despite the hardships she encountered, she vowed that she would not stop. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a job \u2013 it\u2019s more than that because I can save my sisters.\u201d The names of the interceptors in this article have been changed to protect their identities.

This could be a future fabric choice according to one Dutch startup, which is extracting cellulose from cowpats to make \u201cmanure couture\u201d. Jalila Essa\u00efdi believes that a non-vegan future will involve recycling cow manure into cellulose fibre, bioplastics, chemical concentrates and pure water \u2013 and being less squeamish about it, too. \u201cLike a lasagne of manure, you need to make something out of it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see manure as a waste material, something disgusting and smelly. But oil [used to make fibre] isn\u2019t clean and beautiful at the beginning. You really have to show people the hidden beauty if you transform this cellulose.\u201d It is just one of a range of innovations seeking new materials for old applications, as the world tries to wean itself off dirty habits like plastics and hydrocarbons and embrace new technologies. Biocouture has in fact been around for several years but faces problems of scalability. Essa\u00efdi, who is working with 15 farmers in Eindhoven to create an industrial-scale manure refinery this year, has already won awards for her innovation including $200,000 from the Chivas Venture and an H&amp;M Foundation Global Change award. \u201cThe process is chemical and mechanical,\u201d she explains, having run trials to create a fashion show in 2016. \u201cWhen you collect manure, it\u2019s a combination of urine and cow poop, 80% water. We separate the dry and wet fraction. The wet fraction is fermented and we [extract] solvents to transform the cellulose, which is nothing other than the grass and corn the cows eat. \u201cWhat makes our process better than the normal textile industry Croft method is that we don\u2019t need high pressure, as the cow stomach is the first step in making the fibre softer. It\u2019s also more energy efficient.\u201d Cow waste is an international environmental issue: in New Zealand, an estimated 60% of waterways are unsafe for swimming due to runoff from dairy farms full of algae-promoting nitrates, phosphates and bacteria. The EU has limits on manure used as fertiliser, to reduce water pollution, but in dairy lands like the Netherlands, there are regular reports of organised \u201cmanure fraud\u201d. The Dutch government\u2019s environmental agency estimates 30%-40% of the country\u2019s 76bn annual kilos of manure enters a black market of illegal waste, secretly traded or spread on the land at night to avoid fines for overproduction. Kim Roetert, public affairs spokeswoman for the ZLTO farmers\u2019 association, believes manure is an inevitable side-effect of animal farming but too much is a real problem. \u201cJust seeing it as a waste product shows limited vision, though,\u201d she says. \u201cManure has a lot of value, not just in making the ground fertile, but also, as Mestic is doing, making textiles, paper and bioplastic ... or bio-energy. There would be no reason for farmers to commit manure fraud if it were no longer a waste product.\u201d H&amp;M Foundation, established by the clothing retailer H&amp;M, reckons we will have to get used to such unusual source materials. \u201cThe world is already consuming the equivalent of approximately 1.6 planet\u2019s worth of resources every year, and there is an urgent opportunity to shift to a model where valuable materials are recovered,\u201d says communications manager Malin Bj\u00f6rne. \u201cFashionista or not, we are all going to have to get used to sometimes unconventional materials as we cannot rely on cotton, for example.\u201d H&amp;M won\u2019t comment on whether it would produce clothes with Mestic, but other manufacturers have told Essa\u00efdi that they would consider using the cost-efficient fabric \u2013 but would not declare it explicitly on clothing labels. Some academics believe cellulose taken from dung has even more high-tech potential thanks to the quadruple-bellied digestion power of a cow. Prof Alexander Bismarck, head of the polymer group at the University of Vienna, is working on creating ultra-thin nanocellulose, for instance \u2013 although he had to start with elephant dung because none of his students would initially work with cowpats. \u201cThe beauty with an animal is that it\u2019s collecting low-grade biomass, processing it for you, regurgitating, [then] acid and enzymes attack the cellulose and it comes out in the back in quite fine fibres,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou expend much less energy in grinding down this cellulose to nanofibers. If you can make thinner paper for printed circuit boards, so your computer or iPhone is lighter, I don\u2019t think the public will mind if the product came out of the back end of an animal.\u201d The key question with manure couture, though, is whether the fabric smells. When the Dutch television channel RTL Nieuws took Mestic on to the streets, some people \u2013 after sniffing it \u2013 said they wouldn\u2019t mind putting it on. Some are more sceptical. Jan Willem van der Schans of Wageningen University, a sustainable livestock farming expert, believes even such innovations are not enough. \u201cThis will not solve the beef and dairy problem [of] gastric methane emissions,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes a \u2018dead end\u2019 technology less bad, so one could argue that it extends the lifetime of a wrong production system.\u201d And what about the farmer? Hans Huijbers, chair of the farmers\u2019 associaiton ZLTO which is working with Mestic, wouldn\u2019t mind wearing it. \u201cIf I\u2019ve been busy in my cowshed, then I\u2019m already coated in manure!\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Now they are running for parliament. The country is conservative and deeply religious and homosexuality is illegal, but it has nonetheless introduced laws that are at the global forefront of trans rights. Pakistan has officially recognised a third gender since 2009. Laws were liberalised still further in March with a wide-ranging piece of legislation that grants intersex people, eunuchs and trans men and women the option to self-identify their gender on official forms. A person born male can now hold a female passport. In contrast, the UK requires a citizen to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have lived for at least two years in their chosen gender. The ruling means a lot to Zara. Kneeling on a mattress that takes up most of the floor of her concrete home, she reaches into a fake alligator-skin purse and pulls out a green identity card, and tears well up. On the card, Zara\u2019s gender is marked as \u201cX\u201d. \u201cI was born with a very small male organ. Inside, my feelings are female,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cI want to live like a woman, cook and do domestic work. \u201cOur appearance is different, so why should we have to have \u2018male\u2019 on our identity card?\u201d There are 13 trans candidates to choose from in Wednesday\u2019s election. Nadeem Kashish, a 35-year-old transgender woman running for office in Islamabad, smokes a cigarette on the street below her makeup studio. Banished from home, she entered the \u201cguru\u201d system, in which an elder khwaja sira houses younger trans people in return for a cut of their earnings as dancers or sex workers. She wants that system abolished, saying it is exploitative. \u201cWhen you see a transgender person, do not give them your notes, give them your votes,\u201d Kashish advised listeners to her weekly radio show. The trans community in Pakistan is divided between a young, international-leaning cohort who believe gender is fluid, and an older group who claim only those born with both female and male genitalia truly qualify. Almas Boby, who launched the country\u2019s trans rights movement by storming a police station in 2004 to call for the arrest of \u201cdirty men\u201d, argued that the law would merely encourage gay men to claim they were transgender in order to claim benefits. \u201cThere were 10,000 khwaja siras counted in the census,\u201d she said, referring to the official exercise conducted last year, thought by many to have recorded only a fraction of the community. \u201cAfter this there will be millions, billions.\u201d One reason for the growing acceptance of the trans community springs from an unlikely source - Pakistan\u2019s mullahs. The Council of Islamic Ideology, a government body that has deemed nine-year-old girls old enough to marry and approves the right of men to \u201clightly\u201d beat their wives, has offered some support to trans rights. Its chair, Dr Qibla Ayaz, noted a trans person, Heet, appears in the hadith \u2013 the sayings, actions and pronouncements of the prophet Muhammad. In practice, Pakistani law forbids discrimination against trans people. It mandates vocational training and enshrines the right to run for political office. Mehlab Jameel , a trans activist in Lahore, said: \u201cGrassroots activists have worked so hard over the years to make this possible.\u201d As a result, Pakistan has among the most progressive, inclusive and culturally sensitive legislation in the world, she added. Trans people have lived for centuries on the margins of society on the subcontinent. Many consider their sexual ambiguities to be God-given, meaning khwaja siras are sought out as intermediaries to the divine and are able to offer curses or blessings. Wedding parties often hire khwaja siras to dance, and indeterminate gender is considered useful in areas where women are forbidden from leaving the house. But trans people are typically cast out by their families, and many of the estimated 500,000 in the country end up as beggars or sex workers. Fifty-eight have been murdered in the past three years Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone. Sceptics of the law note that Pakistan regularly fails to implement positive-sounding legislation. Many of the provisions require the involvement of the four provincial governments, none of which have passed its own version of the law or allocated any funding for trans issues this year.

They\u2019d only come by to arrest,\u201d said Young, whose younger self would be surprised to discover he is now a veteran sheriff of the same northern Florida county where he was born and raised. McNealy, 28, took a different path in his teens, getting involved with gangs and a string of arrests and jail time eventually landed him in state prison for four years. But on a recent stormy Florida Saturday, the two sit in McNealy\u2019s mother\u2019s house across from one another on opposing couches with no tension and no drama. The sheriff and his deputy have come by to say hello to McNealy and his three sons, aged 10, eight and seven, as part of Young\u2019s commitment to a new program to prevent children from following their parents into the criminal justice system. The scheme links children with professional counselors and life coaches. Jaron McNealy, 28, with his children at his mother\u2019s home. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a trend where the children start coming up through this same cycle as those incarcerated parents,\u201d Young said. \u201cWe wanted to sort of wrap our hands around them and put them on the right track.\u201d The scheme is just part of Young\u2019s community policing approach which includes decarceration and prisoner \u201cre-entry\u201d to lawful society to try to tackle recidivism. \u201cI believe in giving folks two, three, four and five chances to get it right,\u201d he said. Since his first election in 2004, Young has pushed prosecutors to get low-level offenders out of long jail stays, and has encouraged deputies to use arrest power with discretion. \u201cIf we pick up a young man with a piece of crack cocaine in his pocket, instead of making an arrest, put it on the ground and just mush it up. Tell him: \u2018OK. The next time.\u2019\u201d And while it\u2019s difficult to attribute cause and effect when it comes to social issues like crime, over Young\u2019s tenure crime in Gadsden has roughly halved and juvenile arrests are down by more than 75%. The county is also sending 65% fewer inmates to state prison than it was eight years ago. Young has survived as the longest-serving black sheriff in Florida state history despite his philosophy facing significant challenge. Prosecutors attempted to run Young out of office in 2014 for his liberal use of furloughs, which allow inmates out of custody for short predetermined stints of time, usually a few days. Young believes resistance to his approach comes down to the financial incentives that incarceration creates. As Major Shawn Wood, Young\u2019s loquacious right-hand man, puts it: \u201cNo one in this country should even make one penny off people being locked up in chains.\u201d But don\u2019t misunderstand the two, it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows either. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a reputation for catching our man,\u201d Young said. \u201cCommit a serious crime and you\u2019re going to go in and you\u2019re going to do time.\u201d But all that is qualified by a few progressive mantras that undergird daily decisions at the Gadsden sheriff\u2019s office: arrests don\u2019t necessarily resolve crime, and when arrests must be made, that\u2019s the exact moment where re-entry ought to begin. \u2018This is the best I\u2019ve been\u2019 Errick Feaster always loved cars and got pretty good at fixing them with his dad as a kid growing up in Gadsden. Yet having failed to ever get his license, Feaster wound up in jail for 11 months last year for driving without one. It wasn\u2019t the first time. Feaster, 44, had been in and out on drug and other minor charges for much of his adult life. But within a few days of getting to jail some inmates suggested Feaster go speak with Ed Dixon, head of the \u201ccrossing over\u201d re-entry program in the jail. The program places inmates at job sites outside the jail during the work day with businesses who train them. No guards. No bars. Rather than sitting in a cell, Feaster was working fixing cars. \u201cIt gave me some time away from that building I was in,\u201d said Feaster. Errick Feaster is now a foreman at a tire store after completing the re-entry program. And after he got out, with recommendations from the program, Feaster found work easily. \u201cI went on interviews and for the first time in my life all of them called me back,\u201d said Feaster, who is now working as a foreman at a tire shop in Valdosta, Georgia. \u201cThroughout my whole adult life, this is the best I\u2019ve been. I am not struggling like I was before.\u201d Dixon, a former county commissioner, was recruited by Sheriff Young to head up re-entry because of his deep ties to the community. \u201cEvery inmate we surveyed said: \u2018Hey, they\u2019ve got great programs in jail and prison, but as soon as I get out, all that support is gone.\u2019 So we said: \u2018How can we make it last?\u2019\u201d Dixon said. Dixon\u2019s philosophy is based on an obvious, but often overlooked fact of local incarceration. \u201cThey\u2019re going back into Gadsden county and they just went from being inmate Johnson to Mr Johnson.\u201d When they do so without support, recidivism is common. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people call us and say, \u2018Look I don\u2019t want to go back to jail, but I need you to help me find a job because if I don\u2019t get one, I\u2019m going to go back to what I know,\u2019\u201d said Maj Wood. For Gadsden\u2019s sheriff\u2019s office, finding that person gainful employment is every bit as much their job as arresting them if they do turn back to crime. \u201cI put the entire community on notice that we all are responsible for this,\u201d Young said. \u2018Church is it\u2019 Race and economics are prologue to understanding Gadsden. It\u2019s the only majority-black county in Florida, and it\u2019s planted firmly in the bottom 10% of median household income in the state. Fully 25% of residents live in poverty, 56% higher than the national average. Through the 1800s and 1900s the county was well familiar with the violent repression that defined so much of life in the south for blacks. Gadsden was home to at least four lynchings in the late 19th early 20th century, including the killing of AC Williams in 1941. Having survived a white mob\u2019s first attempt on his life, Williams was intercepted en route to the hospital, shot dead and left on a bridge. He had been surrendered to the mob, it\u2019s worth noting, by employees of the sheriff\u2019s office. Segregation and outbursts of racist violence against blacks in Gadsden persisted well into the second half of the century. In the 1960s, voter registration drives by the Congress of Racial Equality (Core) were routinely harassed and assaulted by whites, and even had their Quincy headquarters burned down in 1964. The schools here did not desegregate until 1970, 15 years after the supreme court declared segregation unconstitutional in Brown v Board, and only did so under threat of a federal court order. A less contentious form of racial splintering still weighs heavily on Gadsden\u2019s most ubiquitous social institution: the church. Like in much of the country and nearly all of the south, segregation in these spaces is nearly absolute. A Bible study session at the Gadsden county jail. The county boasts about 250 registered churches, one for every 180 residents, which is a lot even for the heart of the Bible belt. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a whole lot of nightclubs and nightlife or those kind of social things to do so church is it,\u201d Young said. As much as possible, Young asks churches to invite the department in, and strongly encourages attendance among his staff of more than 100. At a law enforcement celebration event at First Baptist, Gadsden\u2019s oldest white church, black deputies gladhand and joke with gray-haired parishioners over a breakfast of biscuits, sausage, eggs and gravy. Faith is a major component of Young\u2019s programming, going so far as to perform baptisms of willing inmates behind jail walls. The jail chaplain Jimmie Salters estimates he has performed more than 400 inmate baptisms in a galvanized water tank that sits in a garage on the jail grounds. Religious services are a regular staple in the jail. Sometimes the Gadsden sheriff\u2019s office employee choir comes along to sing. Inmates are encouraged to sing along and even get up and join, standing among their jailers in jumpsuits but unshackled, together in praise. \u2018They got a lot of people behind them\u2019 After Jaron McNealy was sent to prison, the mother of his sons and daughter was arrested too. With nowhere left for them to go, they wound up at the home of their grandmother Natalie Johnson. \u201cIt was a blessing but it was a lot. I was sitting there having a panic attack thinking about \u2013 what are we going to do?\u201d Johnson said. Last year, when the sheriff\u2019s office approached her about putting the boys (his daughter was too young) into a pilot mentoring program for children with incarcerated parents, Johnson admits she was hesitant. \u201cI was afraid it would make them withdraw more,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut it did the opposite, it completely drew them out,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been real good, because they were lost.\u201d The children work with a counselor and life coach who tutors them every day on their academics, and on life skills like self-esteem, social interactions and even basic things like personal hygiene. Jaron McNealy with his daughter, six. He has begun reconnecting with his children since leaving prison. Gadsden isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel. Work release programs are a time tested (and historically exploited) tradition in the US criminal justice system. Mentoring for children with incarcerated parents has been a priority for youth advocates for at least a decade, and even enjoyed a healthy federal grant outlay in the early days of the Obama administration. Community policing is a major priority of many departments in the wake of the Black Lives Matter moment at least in word if not in deed. But what Sheriff\u2019s Young\u2019s team does seem to be showing is that an earnest commitment to rewriting the southern tradition of harsh and punitive punishment can have real impacts on how communities perform and how they relate to the police. When McNealy was released from prison in April and started trying to reconnect with the boys, the program had him a bit miffed initially. \u201cAt first I\u2019d look at seeing the sheriff around and be like \u2018I ain\u2019t talking to them,\u2019 McNealy said. \u201cBut now I look at it as beneficial and I\u2019m loving it. If they get in trouble, guess what? They got a lot of people behind them.\u201d One of the boys, who has watched police arrest both of his parents, says for a long time he was scared of them. Now he wants to be one: \u201cSo I can tell people how to learn to make good decisions and not do bad things.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

People are suffering from mental distress on a scale perhaps never seen before. They wait months for cursory medical intervention, and have to travel hundreds of miles for a rare inpatient bed. In response, all government does is promise something it can\u2019t and won\u2019t deliver, parity of esteem, and then get back to its hysterical obsession with Brexit. Our mental health is fracturing, here and now. It\u2019s a public health emergency \u2013 the numbers are off the charts. Yet the political response is absurd, like fiddling endlessly with a leaky tap while the roof is falling in. Would the hopeless response be the same if the pandemic was a physical illness like cancer? This is why we elect MPs \u2013 to fix things that are broken, not break something that was fixed. That said, we will definitely lose this struggle if we just see it in terms of beds and billions of pounds. Medics often say prevention is better than cure. This is so obviously true of mental illness that it\u2019s shameful how little we strategise about it. There is no shortage of daily advice for enhancing physical health. Reject bacon!Quit smoking! Take up half-marathons! Eat goji berries and salsify! But where are the programmes, the education, the government advisories and the interventions to help protect our mental health? Every week more than 100 Britons take their own lives. These are preventable deaths but the prevention work has to come early. It has to come at the same stage as the running and goji berries. It has to come before the wheels have fallen off. Because we don\u2019t really know what causes mental illness, it is hard to know what advice to give people. Standard lists recommend a healthy diet, moderate exercise, regular sleep patterns, and a rejection of recreational drugs. All obvious, unremarkable \u2013 and ineffectual. I have come up with an alternative list \u2013 things I wish I\u2019d done before depression picked me out from the crowd with a flick of a bony finger. 1. Stop trying so hard The mental illness epidemic among our young people can hardly come as a surprise. Grade inflation and hyper-competition have made this the most stressful time to be a teenager. The message from schools, parents, peers seems to be: get top grades or your life is ruined. Little wonder young people are suffering like never before. Teachers and parents won\u2019t like me for saying this, but exam grades BBB and a clean bill of health might be preferable to four A-stars and a prescription for antidepressants. \u201cIf the homework brings you down then we\u2019ll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown,\u201d Bowie sang to his infant son. That might be taking it too far but a more balanced approach will help stave off burnout. So stop promising to give 110%. I usually aim for closer to 70%, unless the boss is lurking, when I cunningly step it up. Good enough is good enough. 2. Lower your expectations Someone cleverer than me once came up with a neat formula that explains so much about our self-imposed anxiety. Satisfaction = achievement/expectation. By this infernal calculus, in order to feel better, we must either achieve more (and there quickly comes a point where that becomes harder and harder and more and more stressful) \u2013 or simply lower our expectations. We know this to be true: as we attain a higher level of material, professional or athletic accomplishment, we do not rest. Our expectation bobs up, like an overactive ballcock. And so we must outperform again, to advance, to progress. That philosophy, born of the enlightenment and industrial revolution, has become a global religion. And a curse. Our salaries must go up with our self-importance and our status, our companies and economies must grow year-on-year, our cars and kitchens and computers must get better and better, our leaders, our clothes, our holidays must be impeccable. And yes, our sports teams must win all the time. What folly. A life is not a linear chart that goes up. It\u2019s a messy scatter graph of moments and experiences, some joyful, others painful. And it\u2019s so improbable in the first place that we should set our expectations to zero. There \u2013 infinite satisfaction. 3. Take up something you\u2019re bad at Perfectionism is a close cousin of mental unease. Shake it off by taking up something that is an end in itself, not just another means to an end. Fail. Laugh when you do so, whether it is pottery, dancing or fishing. It can be a powerful revelation \u2013 and a huge release \u2013 to understand that you are not perfect and that it does not matter that you are not. Of course, this should be something which will not endanger anyone, including yourself \u2013 so best to avoid gambling, go-karting or ice dance. It is preferable if it is not a \u201cwinning game\u201d. Drawing, singing, walking, yoga, Warhammer, birdwatching. It\u2019s particularly beneficial if you can induce an adverse remark in the talentless execution of this endeavour, ie \u201cGosh, you really have a horrid drone for a voice!\u201d Or \u201cWhat is that squalid little image supposed to be? Can\u2019t make out your brush strokes at all\u201d. Feel the criticism and rejoice in it. You are crap \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t matter! 4. Reject the age of the self Depression is an illness that feeds on isolation. Loneliness and self-absorption are its handmaids. Turn your back on 30 years of individualism, by embracing the communal, the social, the voluntary. Another real human face is an antidepressant. So volunteer. Do something for nothing \u2013 and see how it makes you feel. Remarkably, when we volunteer we can get a far greater sense of making a difference than we get from paid-for transactional arrangements. It goes without saying that rejecting the self means rejecting the selfie. Stop posting for a month and notice the difference. All the great life experiences are offline.

Two-hundred-and-forty staff at Perpetual Guardian, a company which manages trusts, wills and estate planning, trialled a four-day working week over March and April, working four, eight-hour days but getting paid for five. Academics studied the trial before, during and after its implementation, collecting qualitative and quantitative data. Perpetual Guardian founder Andrew Barnes came up with the idea in an attempt to give his employees better work-life balance, and help them focus on the business while in the office on company time, and manage life and home commitments on their extra day off. Jarrod Haar, professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology, found job and life satisfaction increased on all levels across the home and work front, with employees performing better in their jobs and enjoying them more than before the experiment. Work-life balance, which reflected how well respondents felt they could successfully manage their work and non-work roles, increased by 24 percentage points. In November last year just over half (54%) of staff felt they could effectively balance their work and home commitments, while after the trial this number jumped to 78%. Staff stress levels decreased by 7 percentage points across the board as a result of the trial, while stimulation, commitment and a sense of empowerment at work all improved significantly, with overall life satisfaction increasing by 5 percentage points. Helen Delaney, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, said employees\u2019 motivation and commitment to work increased because they were included in the planning of the experiment, and played a key role in designing how the four-day week would be managed so as not to negatively impact productivity. \u201cEmployees designed a number of innovations and initiatives to work in a more productive and efficient manner, from automating manual processes to reducing or eliminating non-work-related internet usage,\u201d said Delaney. Andrew Barnes said he would take the results of the trial to the board to open up a discussion on how a four-day work week could be implemented long-term in his company. \u201cIf you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing?\u201d asked Barnes, who believes the new work model has the potential to profoundly impact society for the better. \u201cAre you likely to get fewer mental health issues when you have more time to take care of yourself and your personal interests? Probably ... if you have fewer people in the office at any one time, can we make smaller offices?\u201d New Zealand\u2019s workplace relations minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, said the results of the trial were \u201cvery interesting\u201d and he was keen to encourage businesses to trial new and improved work models. \u201cI\u2019m really keen to work with any businesses that are looking at how they can be more flexible for their staff and how they can look to improve productivity whilst working alongside their staff and protecting terms and conditions,\u201d Less-Galloway said. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 July 2018. An earlier version said that there was a 24% increase in the percentage of employees who felt they were able to successfully manage their work-life balance. The increase was from 54% to 78%, which is an increase of 24 percentage points, not 24%. This has been corrected.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Organ donation: we can break taboos among British BAME communities", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/18/organ-donation-we-can-break-taboos-among-british-bame-communities", "date": "2018-07-18", "transcript": "\u201cYou need to start looking for a kidney donor right away. Start with social media and go all out.\u201d The tone and urgency of her doctor\u2019s advice had left Ashley De La Mode somewhat perplexed. With just 5% kidney function remaining, the 38-year old makeup artist and single parent from London knew she needed an organ transplant sooner rather than later. \u201cBut it was not until I was added to the transplant waiting list this year that I fully realised what my doctor had really meant,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a black person I am facing at least a four-year wait for a new kidney. Very few black people in the UK donate organs after death. And with a rare blood group, I could end up waiting far longer.\u201d De La Mode is one of hundreds of patients from the UK\u2019s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities who are forced to wait longer than the majority of white patients due to a paucity of suitable organs from the same ethnic and racial pool. A new report from NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) reveals that 21% of people who died on the waiting list last year were from a BAME background, compared with 15% a decade ago. The percentage of donors from BAME backgrounds did increase last year, but is still at just 7%. The scarcity is attributable to unfavourable religious and cultural beliefs among BAME communities that discourage organ donation after death. About half as many BAME families support organ donation compared with white families, the NHSBT report found. But for many ethnic minority patients the delay in finding better-matching organs can often mean poor quality of life and even premature death. At 66%, the UK already has one of the lowest organ donation rates in the developed world, comparing poorly with countries like Spain, Croatia and the US. According to the NHSBT, three people die every day waiting for an organ. \u201cKirit Mistry, co-chair of National BAME Transplant Alliance, says more than 30% of people on kidney waiting lists are from minority communities and that organ donation rates have barely improved since 2008. So is it possible to influence ethnic minorities to change their unfavourable attitudes towards organ donation at all? A new report that I wrote for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust suggests it is. The data and case studies from four other countries - the US, Israel, India and Qatar - show that attempts to counter cultural and religious barriers to organ donation are having some impact. Once known for their deep mistrust of the medical establishment and lowest consent rates, black Americans are now the largest minority organ donor group in the US, ranking above Caucasians, Hispanics and Asians. From eight donors per million in the 1980s African Americans today account for 37 donors per million, mainly due to a sustained and culturally sensitive peer-to-peer education approach. \u201cDeep fear of racism, distrust of doctors and adverse religious beliefs are common to black communities not just in the US but in Britain and other European countries too,\u201d says Dr Clive Callender, a Howard University transplant surgeon and founder of Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program. \u201cAddressing them required working closely with the people, especially youth, and trusting them to come up with their own community engagement approaches. We also focused on behaviour change and healthier lifestyles rather than only creating awareness about organ donation.\u201d Faith-based public education campaigns and donor recognition initiatives have played a vital role in improving organ donation rates in India and Qatar. With multi-ethnic foreign workers making 88% of its population and a growing problem of transplant tourism Qatar did not even have a national organ donation program up until 2010. \u201cToday we\u2019ve not only curbed transplant tourism by 70%, but quite unexpectedly we also have more living kidney donors, especially Arabs, than deceased donors in the country as a result of our targeted culturally-sensitive public awareness programs,\u201d says Dr Riadh Fadhil, director of Qatar Organ Donation Centre. The most radical example of transformation in religious and cultural views towards organ donation, however, comes from Israel. At 44% the country had one of the lowest consent rates in the developed world, with Israelis accounting for the highest number of transplant tourists globally and often seeking organs from executed prisoners in China. \u201cThe free-riding behaviour, where you take organs but never give and is found in almost every society, stemmed from orthodox Jewish views on organ donation. Religious views not only didn\u2019t recognise brain death as death they also branded doctors like me as murderers. I couldn\u2019t take the hypocrisy,\u201d says Dr Jacob Lavee, a prominent cardiothoracic surgeon and the pioneer of the reciprocity model of organ donation. Reciprocity systems give some degree of priority to registered donors who require an organ transplant. Israel passed new laws in 2008 to curb transplant tourism and introduce a point-based priority system that allowed registered donors and their families to receive priority over non-donors in transplants. Since implementing the laws in 2012 Israel has seen a sharp rise in organ donation rates with an unexpected surge in altruistic living kidney donations. \u201cOur model is proof that it\u2019s possible to change negative attitudes while also making the system fairer for everyone in the society,\u201d he adds.

But since 2016, a group in western Canada has been designing a prototype vehicle aimed at offering those who live on the streets a better alternative to shopping carts when it comes to transporting their worldly goods. \u201cPart of the reality of being homeless is that you need somewhere to put your goods,\u201d said Devon Siebenga of Metro Community, the church in Kelowna behind the initiative. \u201cA lot of our people spend most of their days worrying about, or trying to take care of, or tracking down their stuff.\u201d For many, shopping carts have become a tool to meet this need \u2013 but one that is far from ideal. \u201cThe problem is that the shopping cart is obviously not their own property and so there\u2019s a huge amount of anxiety that floats over them as they go through their days,\u201d said Siebenga. The shopping carts can be seized by police at any point, forcing some to decide between paying hefty fines to retrieve their belongings or simply forsaking them. \u201cIt\u2019s this constant wonder, am I going to be walking down the street with all my stuff and all of a sudden it gets taken?\u201d So around two years ago, the church began asking if there might be a better option. Their quest took them to the Kelowna campus of the University of British Columbia, where engineering staff and students eagerly signed on to the challenge. Representatives from the city and police soon also joined in. Input on the design came from those with experience of living on the streets; they wanted something they could own and use legally, that would protect their belongings come rain or shine and which could travel long distances easily. The cart also had to be light enough to manoeuvre through city streets. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be able to go 4x4ing, but it should be able to go through snow, go over curves and gravel and some mushy terrain,\u201d said Siebenga. The first prototype was delivered in May. Made of plywood and specially designed composites, the cart is equipped with handbrakes, shelving and locks, meaning users can park the carts without worry when they head inside for appointments or a meal. The design has already been through several iterations and will likely go through many more, said engineer Bryn Crawford. \u201cEven this first model is significantly different and a bit heavier than the next few we\u2019ve got on the go.\u201d Four more prototypes are expected to be delivered in the coming weeks. Each will be handed over to those living on the streets with the goal of collecting feedback to refine the cart into a product that could potentially one day be commercialised. \u201cThis isn\u2019t simply a Kelowna problem,\u201d said Siebenga. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s a global opportunity.\u201d He was careful to stress the limits of the initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to replace housing or keep people off the streets.\u201d Instead the hope is that the carts will allow people to fret less over the security of their belongings, giving them space to focus on recovery, safety and housing, he said. \u201cThis provides a dignified alternative while they seek to get their lives back on track.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

At this, the rapt audience of young women gathered at her workshop shrieks and bursts into chatter. \u201cWhy are we still afraid to say the word \u2018vagina\u2019?\u201d the doctor asks finally. Talking about vaginas \u2013 not to mention sex education \u2013 is taboo in Myanmar. But it became the focus of discussion two months ago when The Vagina Monologues \u2013 a play of 18 stories about women\u2019s experiences and their vaginas, exploring issues of menstruation, gender roles, relationships and gender-based violence \u2013 was performed for the first time in Yangon. Su Htwe usually keeps a low profile, but for one weekend, as she was invited to speak at the performances, her sexuality and reproductive health classes came to the fore. She warned that if people cannot even bring themselves to talk about vaginas then women\u2019s rights will not improve. In Myanmar, sexual and reproductive education technically exists on the curriculum in state schools \u2013 but a combination of teacher ignorance and embarrassment means that little is actually taught. \u201cParents and teachers think that if you teach sexual education you will encourage kids to become sexually active, so there is a big education gap,\u201d Su Htwe says. She founded her organisation, Strong Flowers, which provides reproductive and sexual health education services and resources, in 2016. Su Htwe teaches in schools and community centres, and across religions. \u201cAt first I was worried that people might say \u2018this Muslim lady is talking about sex\u2019; no I\u2019m not talking about sex, I am teaching about sexuality, our bodies, consent \u2026 I was worried people would be confused and think I am doing something that is not good for the society, or for religions.\u201d Women\u2019s rights are also slow to progress in Myanmar. Despite five years of debate, a law that criminalises violence against women still has not been submitted to parliament. Participants attend Su Htwe\u2019s classes for a variety of reasons. Aye Aye Tint, 33, was interested to learn more about health: \u201cI learned more than just the dos and don\u2019ts about my health, like if a husband has a sore on his private part, he should openly tell his wife to prevent the disease.\u201d \u201cI also learned about how couples should behave, not just personal hygiene,\u201d she said. After the workshop she said she shared the training with her single and married friends, \u201cthey told me they should have attended the training too, because they need it and don\u2019t even know things like the different parts of the uterus\u201d. Twenty-four-year-old La Min Ko from Myeik, in southern Myanmar, who attended one of the classes led by Su Htwe, said: \u201cBefore the training, to be honest, I didn\u2019t think the subjects were so important for us. But I learned so much about gender equality, human rights, emotional intelligence and sexuality.\u201d Su Htwe learned that it was different for girls at a young age. After puberty, her mother forbade her from running out in the streets with her friends. \u201cI was told I can\u2019t wash my hair or eat spicy food like lapet tho (tealeaf salad), or else it would cease my menstruation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen boys and girls enter puberty, the space is narrower for girls and wider for boys. Boys are told they have to get ready to lead the family and study hard, and for girls going outside is dangerous, we are told anything could happen to you at any time \u2013 violence, rape or sexual harassment on the streets.\u201d After finishing school she became a doctor and volunteered at the Muslim free hospital. Again she realised the relationship between cultural gender expectations and treatment of women. When she was preparing to get married, another tipping point occurred. She was passionate about working as a medical doctor and did not want to give up her profession, despite the cultural expectation in Myanmar that a woman should give up her job and dedicate herself to family life. After raising the topic with her husband, she was surprised to hear that he was supportive of her choice. This confirmed her belief that it was her responsibility to educate people about women\u2019s rights, challenging cultural expectations, and she believed the best way she could do this was through education. Su Htwe\u2019s first class was not in any of the big cities, but rather in a small village outside Yangon. She divided the group into two classes, one for women and one for men, for anyone aged 16 and upwards. \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t sure whether to call it just reproductive health, as to use the word sexuality might scare people or make them reluctant to come.\u201d After a friend told her to believe in herself and be bold, she explained all aspects of her class to the local community leaders, and they welcomed it. Her first supporter was an older male farmer harvesting chillies at the time of the class. \u201cHe said he could only give two days for the class, but because he thought it was important to talk about our bodies he would encourage his wife and daughter to come to the classes too.\u201d To illustrate how poor knowledge is, she reveals how many women have been using the emergency contraceptive pill for regular use. \u201cI kept on being asked about where they can buy the three-day pill, but I said I didn\u2019t know what they meant, then they described that you can take one pill and have sex for three days without getting pregnant,\u201d she said. Su Htwe believes education is the first step to building respect for each other\u2019s bodies, learning about the similarities and differences, leading to respect for women\u2019s rights: \u201cWe need to educate women, what are your rights? And raise awareness, not only among women but nationwide, and among men.\u201d She hopes training for teachers in teaching life skills, sexual health and respectful relationships, will improve. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this with just one talk, we also all need to work together.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Kabanle, a 45-year-old former dressmaker turned musician, is playing traditional Somali music at the luxury Mogadishu Beach View hotel at the city\u2019s Lido to a smartly dressed audience in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous cities. \u201cThis is Mogadishu. We laugh and sing. We play music. Music is for peace so we no longer live in fear,\u201d Kabanle says, sipping a cappuccino. There are few cities with contrasts as stark as those of Mogadishu. Swollen by hundreds of thousands of people displaced by famine, drought and conflict in rural areas, its outlying districts resemble a vast refugee camp. Authorities are incompetent, corrupt or simply absent. It is seven years since the Islamic militants of al-Shabaab withdrew but many streets bear the scars of more than two decades of incessant warfare. Mogadishu\u2019s inhabitants have long been known for their resilience, but a new wave of activists, entrepreneurs and artists are now trying to improve their city. Two years ago, Kabanle survived an al-Shabaab gun attack and suicide car bombing close to where he now performs every evening. The attack left at least 10 dead, including three of Aweys\u2019s friends. The oud player was forced to jump over the wall of the hotel where he was playing to escape. \u201cFor several months following, there was no show,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople were unwilling to come back but I was committed to come here again. I started the first night by myself alone playing music and resumed hosting the show. Thanks be to God, people got confidence and now they are coming back for my show.\u201d Despite the ongoing violence in the Somali capital, the economy is growing, hundreds of expatriates are returning from the west or African nations, scores of colleges are opening to cater for the young population and there is growing investment from the diaspora. Estate agents thrive: a two-storey house can cost nearly \u00a3100,000. Mogadishu has hosted a TEDx conference. Ahmed Hassan Sheikh decided to return to Mogadishu from Kenya a year and a half ago. He started his own arts company inside the fortified Mogadishu airport complex, where thousands of diplomats, United Nations staff and regional troops from the African Union stabilisation force are based. There is no shortage of demand for Sheikh\u2019s paintings. \u201cI do not need to fight with a gun. I have a powerful pen with which I draw my feelings. I believe through it I can bring change. I can make Mogadishu peaceful,\u201d the 48-year-old artist says. His paintings call for young people to take up pens and books instead of arms, to warn against illegal migration and its devastating effects on Somali families. Other drawings recall life in old Mogadishu before the civil war, a time when the city was known as the most beautiful city in Africa. \u201cWhen people see my artworks of former Mogadishu and how it used to be like, they appreciate how peaceful and prosperous Mogadishu was,\u201d Ahmed says. Then there is Ubaxa Caasimadda (Flowers of the City), a group of students who, 18 months ago, set out to smarten scruffy city streets and mark roads to increase public safety. They started with the safest roads such as those near the presidential palace, because some had already received death threats from al-Shabaab. \u201cWhen we started, we did not even know what will come out. It was just, go and do and then see. We knew the dangers we were facing but we took that risk,\u201d says Amira Mahad Abdulle, a 24-year-old university student. Abdulle wears a burqa to conceal her identity and does not respond to phone calls from unknown people for her safety. \u201cThere are a lot of threats coming in but I try to stay safe. I do not fear. I want to serve Mogadishu,\u201d she says. The group decided to act \u201cbecause nobody else was willing to do it\u201d and the government in Mogadishu is focused on fighting al-Shabaab. \u201cWe could not sit behind and wait for someone else to do this for the people of Mogadishu. We are the youth of this country and we decided to stand up for it,\u201d Abdulle says. So far the group has painted dozens of zebra crossings and have planted flowers on pavements. \u201cWe are committed. We were born in Mogadishu and we want to help our city become developed, beautiful and safe like other cities in the world,\u201d Isse Hassan Ibrahim, a 23-year-old typographic graduate, says. Though his best friend, a government employee, was assassinated by al-Shabaab last year, Ibrahim never stopped working as a volunteer in Mogadishu. \u201cWhen my friend was killed, I got scared but I decided not to quit. I want to help my people and my capital city,\u201d Ibrahim says. \u201cWe now have new youth groups joining us from other cities.\u201d In the last 18 months, US and Somali forces have intensified the battle against al-Shabab, though without achieving decisive success. Last week US officials said a new airstrike killed 14 militants. Though the increased military activity has weakened the extremists, it also led to more civilian casualties. Kabanle believes his country will soon be at peace. \u201cSomalia is no longer a war zone. It is a love zone,\u201d he says, pointing to a group of young men and women sitting on the warm white sand of Mogadishu\u2019s beach.

But that is not the reason why the chemistry professor has a soft spot for the much-maligned material. \u201cPlastic isn\u2019t the problem,\u201d the venerable scientist says in his office in the southern Indian city of Madurai. \u201cWe are. Plastic wouldn\u2019t clog our oceans or our landfills if we didn\u2019t throw it there in the first place. And there is so much we can do with it instead.\u201d He should know. In January this year, Dr Vasudevan was honoured with one of India\u2019s highest civilian awards, the Padma Shri, for his groundbreaking research on re-using waste plastic \u2013 in a very unusual way. The idea emerged from his workshop at the Thiagarajar College of Engineering in Madurai as far back as 2001. Disturbed by calls to ban plastic, which he believed was important to poor people, he wanted to find a solution to the growing environmental challenges it raised. \u201cBan plastic and it can severely affect the quality of life for a low-income family,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you burn it or bury it, it\u2019s bound to affect the environment.\u201d And so, he began a series of experiments in his workshop to discover effective disposal techniques. In a molten condition, he found that plastic had the property of an excellent binder. Acting on the principle that like attracts like, Dr Vasudevan looked at another chemical of similar nature: bitumen, a black tarry substance that was being combined with gravel to lay roads. \u201cBitumen, a highly heterogeneous mixture of hydrocarbons is in effect, composed of polymerssimilar to plastic,\u201d he says. When molten plastic was added to stone and bitumen mix, Dr Vasudevan found that, true to its nature, plastic stuck fast and bound both materials together. The bitumen-modified plastic improved the tensile strength of the road by making it more durable and flexible. Plastic also prevented pothole formation. When the layer of molten plastic filled the space between the gravel and bitumen it thwarted rain water from seeping in and causing structural defects. When late Dr Abdul Kalam, India\u2019s former president and scientist visited Thiagarajar College, he encouraged Dr Vasudevan to lay the first plastic paved road within the campus. \u201cHe asked me to make the roads grey, since black roads absorb and trap heat,\u201d says Dr Vasudevan. In 2002, he paved a 60-ft road within the campus with plastic-modified bitumen. The road is still intact today. He received a patent for the process in 2006. Since then, almost 10,000km of Indian roads have been paved using his technique. At Dr Vasudevan\u2019s workshop, shredded plastic in big bins shines like bright confetti . These are the remains of the plastic material that we use (and throw away) in our everyday lives. Plastic from water bottles, notebook liners, single-use bags with a thickness of less than 50 microns; all kinds of plastic waste is fed into his shredder and reduced to strips. An assistant demonstrates \u2013 on a much smaller scale \u2013 how the plastic road-laying process works. Asphalt is heated to a temperature of 170C (338F). Shredded plastic below 70 microns (including the multi-layer plastic shreds) is then sprinkled over it. The bits of plastic seemingly disappear, melting into the red heat. Heated bitumen is added next. The molten plastic then moulds with the bitumen and stone and results in a shiny tar surface. \u201cWhen using plastic as a binder, we\u2019re reducing the quantity of bitumen that is normally utilized for road laying by 6-8%,\u201d says Dr Vasudevan. A regular road requires 10 tonnes of bitumen for each kilometre. A plastic road however, requires only nine tonnes of bitumen and one tonne of waste plastic for coating. So, for every km, the plastic roads save as much as one tonne of bitumen. \u201cOur planet is drowning in snack-food packaging that is non-recyclable,\u201d says Almitra Patel, a member of India\u2019s supreme court committee for solid waste management. \u201cIf (this technology is) seriously adopted in all cities for all multi-film laminates, it has the potential to achieve near-zero landfill, leaving almost nothing for final disposal.\u201d The real challenge lies, she says, in collecting all of the voluminous post-consumer packaging. To environmentalists who believe that the technology could be harmful because of toxic fumes from plastic residue, Dr Vasudevan points out that the plastic used is softened at 170C. \u201cPlastic decomposes to release toxic fumes only if it is heated at temperatures above 270C (518F). So there is no question of toxic gases being released,\u201d he says. Since plastic coats the stone and interacts with the hot bitumen, it\u2019s properties change and it doesn\u2019t break down when exposed to light and heat. Dr Noreen Thomas, a polymer science expert at Loughborough University, said the process appeared to be an imaginative solution, but cautioned that plastic waste is often a complex mix of materials not all of which would work well with Dr Vasudevan\u2019s operations. Some might burn up in the heat, and others, she said, might prove unsatisfactorily soft as a road surface. \u201cThere is always a risk when heating or burning mixed plastic waste in an open environment when the composition of the plastic waste is unknown,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to find more applications for mixed plastic waste but even more important to ensure that more environmental pollution is not created in doing so.\u201d Nonetheless, at least 16,000km of road have subsequently been paved in the state of Tamil Nadu. The national government has since approved the idea and sanctioned at least 13,000km across the country to be paved in the material as well. Of this, 8,600km have already been completed, says Dr IK Pateriya of the rural development ministry in Delhi. Using the same process to merge waste plastic and stone with materials like limestone, ceramic waste and granite, Dr Vasudevan has created another eco-friendly building material that consumes up to 40% more waste plastic than that used in the road laying process. He calls this material \u201cplastone\u201d and says that it is lasting, durable and cheap. Each plastone block consumes nearly 300 plastic bags and between four and six plastic bottles. A stone tile measuring one square metre has a manufacturing cost of Rs 100, approximately \u00a31.. 60 plates would be sufficient to construct an eco-friendly bathroom, says Dr Vasudevan.The material could also be used to pave sidewalks, replacing cement, he says. Today, self-help groups from various states across India, local citizens and schools are engaged in helping Dr Vasdevan collect waste plastic. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stop seeing plastic as the enemy and turn it into our biggest resource,\u201d says Dr Vasudevan.

Move aside, the sun \u2013 could the moon be the solution to our clean energy crisis? The power of our ocean tides, the only renewable source derived from the moon, might be able to provide huge amounts of clean, renewable electricity. Damian Carrington reports from France on the extraordinary inventions that could help to harness it. In the meantime, the sun\u2019s not doing a bad job: a heatwave in the UK helped break solar power-generation records, with solar briefly eclipsing gas power stations as the top source of electricity. Rising temperatures and dry spells in the US midwest are wreaking havoc with crop yields, as new pests and diseases emerge due to hot and arid conditions.

What we liked This New Yorker examination of universal basic income and this Wired tale of the French boat that\u2019s circling the planet powered by renewables. What we heard All these tidal sources are important and may contribute, but the main and cheapest contribution comes from efficient use. In other words: it is not sustainable to fly to remote destinations to board a ship that is supposedly cruising to important places that we must see. It is not sustainable to board a jet plane to watch a football match. And it is not sustainable to fly in food from faraway places out of season by airplane just for the kick of strawberries in winter or lamb from down under.

Hot-desking twentysomethings type code into laptops covered with stickers. Retro Pac-Man graffiti and motivational slogans like \u201cDO EPIC THINGS\u201d adorn the walls. Bookshelves are filled with the tech classics: The Facebook Effect and The Founder\u2019s Dilemmas. Wifi routers hang overhead, as do Edison bulbs, emitting more style than actual light. But this is not the San Francisco Bay Area. No electric cars quietly whirr by. Instead, this is Gaza, with its cracked streets and checkpoints manned by militants. On the perimeter of this impoverished coastal enclave are Israel and Egypt, countries that have blockaded this tiny slice of land for years. Tight restrictions on the movement of goods and, vitally, people, have been the death of much industry here. But Gaza\u2019s first coding academy hopes its hi-tech business model \u2014 which operates in the virtual rather than real world \u2014 will be somewhat immune to physical barriers to trade. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we started this. It ignores boundaries,\u201d says 31-year-old Ghada Ibrahim, who was in the first class of coders, which started a year ago. \u201cThe blockade is a huge factor. It\u2019s a reason why we have a lot of people who have come to sign up.\u201d With funding from international charities such as Mercy Corps and significant tech world players such as Google, the academy provides two basic requirements its students need for a freelance career developing websites and apps: internet and electricity. In Gaza, that means paying for a generator to supply 10 hours of laptop juice a day. \u201cWe do something that no one can cut off,\u201d Ibrahim says, then stops herself mid-sentence and pauses for a few seconds. She adds, smiling: \u201cAlthough maybe they can.\u201d Israel provides Gaza\u2019s internet, and as yet has never cut it off. Sixteen students (half female as a rule) enrolled in the first class, which had international support from Founders &amp; Coders, a UK-based nonprofit providing free coding lessons. Ibrahim recalls a slightly haphazard programme: eight hours a day where students were expected to self-learn coding and present a weekly project. Of the original 16, only nine graduated. \u201cWe had a lot of problems,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was supposed to be one month. It went on for six months.\u201d She says the students, several of whom had degrees in information technology, struggled to adapt to self-taught techniques following a lifetime of parrot-fashion schooling: they continually looked to the teacher when stuck. \u201cWe all grew up to be taught by someone. It\u2019s never self-learning,\u201d she says. To combat this, the class implemented what Ibrahim calls the 20/20/20 rule. When encountering an issue, students spend 20 minutes trying to figure it out online, then 20 minutes with the help of another classmate. The final 20 minutes are with the help of a mentor. It works. The class after Ibrahim\u2019s had 12 graduates, and the one after that had 14. The fourth cohort is currently ongoing with all 16, she says, looking into the classroom, \u201cbut it\u2019s only the third week.\u201d And while the first classes had support from professional coders, all the mentors are now former students. It\u2019s self-perpetuating. Moamin Salamah Abu Ewaida, 34, is the engagement and development manager at tech hub and co-working space Gaza Sky Geeks, which launched the coding academy last year. What is essential, he says, is that freelance business skills are also taught at the academy. Each student is trained how to pitch to international clients and use job-finding websites such as Upwork, a global freelancing platform. For real-world practice during the course, local businesses and charities are offered pro bono web development work. And, crucially, Gaza Sky Geeks helps its graduates get paid, in a place that many financial institutions avoid for fears of money laundering, not to mention the fact that its de facto government has been on a US \u201cforeign terrorist\u201d blacklist since 1997. Gaza Sky Geeks has partnered with banks and online payment systems that can verify its credentials. Graduates have already started developing websites for international clients in Europe. \u201cOur end goal is to use tech as a gateway. This area [Gaza], it could be the next Berlin or Dublin,\u201d says Abu Ewaida. He warns against dismissing that dream, and says the conditions are there for a thriving freelance coding community to develop: \u201cWe have the talent. And the price for us is a little bit less than others. We can deliver.\u201d And, regardless, \u201cThis place can give more than opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can give hope. It\u2019s emotional more than professional.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The challenge is huge - seas have been battering coasts and sweeping sailors to their doom for millennia - but so is the prize: huge amounts of clean, reliable and renewable electricity for an energy-hungry world. Taking on the challenge of operating in this savage, corrosive environment is not for the faint-hearted, and the costs remain worryingly high, as demonstrated by the government\u2019s rejection on Monday of a \u00a31.3bn tidal project at Swansea. \u201cThere is no doubt \u2013 shit happens during marine renewable energy projects,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Renelier at Bess\u00e9, a French insurance broker.

Although wind and solar power increased 75% between 2013 and 2016, they still only provided 10% of the world\u2019s electricity and even less of total energy demand. \u201cWe will need every kind of renewables we can get out hands on, including marine, to move us around, heat our homes and so on,\u201d says Declan Meally, at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. A coalition of 25 ocean-faring nations, called Ocean Energy Systems, estimates a global potential for wave and tidal energy of 750GW by 2050, almost twice today\u2019s global nuclear capacity. The EU projects 100GW in 2050, providing about 10% of the bloc\u2019s electricity. Many nations, from Ireland to India to Korea, are now making moves and tidal and wave energy capacity doubled in 2017, albeit from a very small base. China has invested $200m since 2010 in ocean energy, and the EU \u20ac3bn in combined public and private money in the last decade. Tidal energy is most advanced. Bladed turbines are being deployed, which harness fast tidal flows in the same way wind turbines catch the wind. The world\u2019s first large-scale tidal array, the Meygen project built by Atlantis Resources in the Pentland Firth, is now sending power to the grid. But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too. OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada\u2019s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world\u2019s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish. Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides \u2013 \u201csurvivability\u201d is the key term in this sector. \u201cThe cost of building something to withstand these extremes is the only thing that has held it back so far,\u201d says Tom Denniss of Wave Swell in Australia. His company\u2019s device works like a blowhole, with waves blasting air up a tube and out through a turbine. He compares developing wave technology to his own record-breaking feat of endurance running: \u201cI ran 622 marathons in 622 days and it was a lot easier than developing marine energy technology - at least it took less time.\u201d Other wave devices, such as Wedge Global, use buoys that bounce up and down on a pole, like a pogo stick, then duck underwater when storms rolls in. Another, Corpower, uses a hydraulic system inspired by the human heart to dampen the impact of the worst weather. \u201cThat has been the big challenge for wave energy \u2013 how to turn it on and off in big storms,\u201d says chief executive, Patrik M\u00f6ller. A strange-shaped vessel called the Penguin takes a very different approach, gyrating with waves to capture power in a spinning weight. It has proved particularly robust, says Ali Pekcan, at Wello, its Finnish makers: \u201cIt has survived many storms. It is a great achievement to keep a device in [the sea] for over a year without maintenance.\u201d Paddles are being deployed too, such as WaveRoller, which uses long seafloor flaps that are washed back and forth by swells. Another, Wave Piston, uses paddles strung along a 185m pipe to push pressurised water through a generator. The Wave Piston\u2019s biggest challenge to date was a big industrial trawler ramming into the system, despite the deployment having been cleared with the marine authorities. \u201cWe have had a lot of adventures, some good, some bad,\u201d says Martin von B\u00fclow, at the company. One technology that is not being widely pursued is tidal lagoon power. Here, large, expensive walls are constructed to trap seawater at high tide, which is released through turbines at low tide. But those constructed so far, such as in France and Korea, took advantage of sea walls being built for other purposes such providing a transport link. Which technologies make it into mass production remains to be seen, but the sector is backed at the highest levels, from Europe to China to Canada. \u201cClean renewable energy from the sea ticks all the right boxes,\u201d says Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. \u201cIt is a groundbreaking industry with plenty of potential for new jobs and economic value, and in a world facing the devastating spectre of climate change, it also helps us supply homegrown energy while drastically cutting our greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said at the International Conference on Ocean Energy in Cherbourg, France, last week. The way Denmark captured the wind turbine manufacturing market by moving early is inspiring many of the leading nations. \u201cEveryone is trying to be the next Denmark, but for another technology,\u201d says Bruce Cameron, the former director of renewable energy in Nova Scotia, which hosts the bay with the biggest tidal range in the world. However a major obstacle to ocean energy commercialisation has loomed into view: the stunning drop in cost of offshore wind power in the last year, as huge farms are rolled out. \u201cWhile offshore wind in Europe has clearly come of age, ocean energy is still learning how to take the first steps,\u201d says EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella. This has led some governments, such as the UK, directing their subsidy support to marine windfarms. This has left wave and tidal energy developers stranded between successful testing and the full-scale production that would then start driving costs down. \u201cThey call it the valley of death - we\u2019re there,\u201d says Marcelle Askew, at Swedish wave energy firm Seabased. However, some nations are still offering support: Canada has a feed-in-tariff and France, despite concerns at the finance ministry over costs, is expected to offer a major tender within months. Ocean energy supporters say it is essential in addition to offshore wind to drive progress towards a zero-carbon world. Tidal energy in particular has the advantage of being precisely predictable, years ahead. \u201cAs long as the moon circles around the Earth, you will always have tidal energy. But you can have no wind for days and days,\u201d says Laurent Schneider-Maunoury, CEO of Naval Energies, the makers of OpenHydro. His company is also exploring another ocean energy technology which provides power 24/7, by exploiting the temperature difference between surface and deep waters to generate electricity. Like other ocean energy technologies, this may well already be competitive with the expensive diesel generators used in many small or isolated communities. The seasonal timing of the biggest waves can be good too, says Arnie Roblan, a senator from Oregon in the US, which is strongly backing ocean energy. \u201cThe winter storms bring a lot more power than in the summer, which exactly matches [heating] energy use,\u201d he says. Cost is not the only challenge to be overcome, such as ensuring coastal communities themselves benefit from projects and ensuring marine life is not endangered, though dolphins, seals and fish all appear to avoid the devices deployed so far. The big question remains undecided: will ocean energy will provide a major new wave of renewables in the years to come? Some have doubts, like Prof AbuBakr Bahaj, at Southampton University in the UK, and who has analysed the sector for 25 years. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he says. Others, like Drew Blaxland, from developers Atlantis, says with many technologies now proven to work, it is simply time to scale up production and drive down the costs. His message is blunt: \u201cWake the hell up, grab it by the nuts and get on with it.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

They were glued to their chairs.\u201d It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. \u201cBut I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming \u2013 I could see it in their faces.\u201d There\u2019s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it\u2019s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn\u2019t make the cut. England 6 Panama 1 Cooper family, Milnrow, Rochdale, 24 June Timing is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper\u2019s house, where the family are on countdown for England\u2019s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of \u201cHalf an hour to kick-off\u201d drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George\u2019s flags. The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers \u2013 grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five \u2013 know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England. Stones\u2019 header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. \u201cI missed it!\u201d says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five \u2013 including two Harry Kane penalties \u2013 all before half-time. \u201cThis is unbelievable!\u201d Rick shouts. \u201cFootball\u2019s coming home.\u201d The noise from the boys\u2019 vuvuzelas is deafening. \u201cThe boys were too little for Brazil 2014,\u201d says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, \u201cso I\u2019m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I\u2019m mad for it now.\u201d His brother Malc says, \u201cYou always have that hope with England, and it\u2019s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona\u2019s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we\u2019re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there\u2019s a different mentality.\u201d Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, \u201cThe country couldn\u2019t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: \u2018If they play football, they\u2019ll murder \u2019em.\u2019 He\u2019d have been thrilled with this one.\u201d Brazil 1 Switzerland 1 Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 June Cristina \u201cKiki\u201d Machado\u2019s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki\u2019s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. \u201cWe drew six,\u201d says Kiki (in hat), \u201cbecause Brazil has won five times \u2013 we drew one more for luck.\u201d Kiki\u2019s living room is packed out with her \u201cnorth London family\u201d, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend\u2019s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children. \u201cMy family in Brazil said people aren\u2019t celebrating there the way we are,\u201d Kiki says. \u201cIt\u2019s natural when you\u2019re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.\u201d She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, \u201cOf course. Your teacher will understand.\u201d After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. \u201cI\u2019m in defence mode,\u201d says Jana\u00edna Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). \u201cThat game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.\u201d The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don\u2019t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that\u2019s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. \u201cWhen we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,\u201d Kiki says. \u201cThe hangover lasted a week.\u201d Senegal 2 Japan 2 Adama Kande and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 June The music and the chat don\u2019t stop at Adama Kande\u2019s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums. Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. \u201cSenegal is like Brazil,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too \u2013 I\u2019m a good player.\u201d An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Man\u00e9 sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: \u201cIt\u2019s game on. Game on.\u201d But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates. \u201cI wanted more,\u201d Adama admits at full time. \u201cThey got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.\u201d For him, the World Cup couldn\u2019t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour\u2019s TV. \u201cWhen Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.\u201d Neilum agrees: \u201cThey love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they\u2019re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric \u2013 it\u2019s just fire.\u201d Morocco 0 Iran 1 Essakhi family, Letchworth, 15 June Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He\u2019s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, \u201cbecause when there\u2019s a football match on, we want to watch it\u201d. Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school; Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed\u2019s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right). The 1-0 loss to Iran is \u201ca bit of a let-down\u201d, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: \u201cFootballers in England are so famous \u2013 it\u2019s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.\u201d \u201cI would love Morocco to win,\u201d Mohammed says, \u201cbut realistically, it\u2019s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We\u2019ve been asking for about 20 years.\u201d His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: \u201cI was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.\u201d Azza, who recently graduated, is working in Morrisons, and is delighted to wear her Morocco shirt to work when the team play Portugal a few days later. \u201cIt was to raise money for Clic Sargent [a cancer charity for young people]; we pay a pound to wear the team shirt. It was a real conversation starter. That\u2019s what I love about the World Cup: the unity. No matter what happens or what team you support, there\u2019s a conversation you can have with anybody.\u201d Japan 2 Colombia 1 Nishi family, Acton, London, 19 June Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly. Today the Nishis \u2013 Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) \u2013 are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he\u2019s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa\u2019s penalty, secured in the game\u2019s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos S\u00e1nchez: \u201cIt was kind of scary before he took it \u2013 we were very surprised that we won.\u201d His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. \u201cTo be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn\u2019t get a good result.\u201d Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages. For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. \u201cJapan didn\u2019t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.\u201d The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a \u201cvery strong\u201d Belgium. Iran 0 Spain 1 Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 June If only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: \u201cVahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team\u2019s hope).\u201d Sadly, his golden foot doesn\u2019t save the day: Iran\u2019s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0. It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. \u201cWe often get together for food and gossip and chat,\u201d says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, \u201cso you can eat with your eyes first\u201d. Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. \u201cThat is what we do when ladies get together,\u201d she says. \u201cThe group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.\u201d \u201cI think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,\u201d says Shirin, \u201cbut not attack. Even if they try to score, there\u2019s nobody there; they keep themselves to their own goal.\u201d Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.\u201d Pupak agrees: \u201cIt was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times \u2013 even though they lost, I think they did quite well.\u201d Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. \u201cMy youngest said, \u2018But Mummy, I\u2019m English.\u2019 Even though I\u2019ve spent most of my life here, I don\u2019t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.\u201d Serbia 1 Costa Rica 0 Bogdanovic family, London, 17 June On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: \u201cWe sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,\u201d says Deanna, 47 (on left). \u201cWe try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.\u201d Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion. Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago; soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. \u201cOften you question where home really is,\u201d Deanna says, \u201cbut the World Cup erases that feeling. I\u2019m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,\u201d she says of the winning goal, \u201cit was such an amazing feeling. I don\u2019t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.\u201d The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven\u2019t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. \u201cBack then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.\u201d His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: \u201cEven if we were 3-0 up, I\u2019d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.\u201d Iceland 0 Nigeria 2 Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 June Iceland\u2019s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland\u2019s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, \u201cIt\u2019s like a fairytale \u2013 we\u2019re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we\u2019re so super proud of them.\u201d But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. \u201cWhen we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,\u201d Silla says, \u201cbut Gylfi Sigurdsson didn\u2019t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.\u201d What went wrong? \u201cThey were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn\u2019t keep up with that pace.\u201d Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team\u2019s strength. \u201cThe Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.\u201d Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Th\u00f3r Halld\u00f3rsson, whom he describes as \u201ca Viking shield wall\u201d. \u201cI was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete \u2013 then that became the more important part of his career.\u201d Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters\u2019 \u201cViking clap\u201d as a lead-in. But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. \u201cPeople approach us and say, \u2018Well done.\u2019 Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.\u201d Colombia 3 Poland 0 Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 June In Colombia, football isn\u2019t watched with strangers in a bar \u2013 it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa). The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone\u2019s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations. Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009. \u201cGrowing up in Colombia,\u201d he says, \u201csport isn\u2019t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it\u2019s a little bit of home in the UK.\u201d The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode \u2013 and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. \u201cGoooooooooooal-azo,\u201d they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: \u201cChampiones, championes, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9!\u201d Erik says, \u201cFootball is an international language. I play four or five times a week \u2013 it\u2019s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club\u2019s kit and now we are all watching together.\u201d Sebastian Cano, 29, who moved to the UK in 2013, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of community. This is how it would be back home. I grew up with Carlos Valderrama [known to non-football fans for his big, blond perm] as a national legend, but in my opinion that generation was overrated. This squad is better. \u201cThe last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals; James Rodr\u00edguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.\u201d France 1 Peru 0 Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 June Studies over the years have reported that the French aren\u2019t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren\u2019t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France\u2019s victory over Peru. \u201cIt was a bit weak,\u201d Yves says, \u201cthey could have done a lot better than that. I didn\u2019t find it very exciting really.\u201d Jeremy agrees, pointing out, \u201cWe have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. \u201cWe want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it\u2019s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.\u201d Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. \u201cI remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there\u2019s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, \u2018I belong to that country.\u2019 Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I\u2019ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven\u2019t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.\u201d There\u2019s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. \u201cTo bring luck,\u201d Jeremy says, \u201cwe all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.\u201d Mexico 1 Germany 0 Hayaux-du-Tilly family, Putney, London, 17 June At the apex of a divisive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win. \u201cIt was a brilliant game,\u201d Yves says. \u201cMexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly; it wasn\u2019t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half; unfortunately we didn\u2019t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.\u201d The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. Jos\u00e9 Pablo, 19, \u201cwill probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays\u201d. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: \u201cAnd of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas \u2013 as an expat, it\u2019s a way to connect with your country.\u201d After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. \u201cI was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It\u2019s very, very powerful.\u201d Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. \u201cI love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That\u2019s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.\u201d Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. \u201cIt was a bittersweet feeling,\u201d Yves says. \u201cI was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico \u2018the fifth game\u2019,\u201d ie the quarter-finals. \u201cThat has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,\u201d he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. \u201cWe didn\u2019t care about our score,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.\u201d South Korea 1 Mexico 2 Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 June No one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung\u2019s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. \u201cI asked my friends how they thought we would do,\u201d says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, \u201cand they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.\u201d He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. \u201cI saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.\u201d Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks \u2013 an extremely popular combination the Koreans call \u201cchi-maek\u201d, from \u201cchi\u201d for chicken and \u201cmaekju\u201d, the Korean word for beer. \u201cUnfortunately we couldn\u2019t find Korean beer,\u201d Jaeyoung says, \u201cso we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.\u201d They hung up the Korean flag for luck. \u201cI don\u2019t watch football usually, just the World Cup,\u201d says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I\u2019ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I\u2019m really happy to support them.\u201d For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. \u201cIt was the best moment \u2013 a miracle.\u201d Despite today\u2019s loss, they are extremely proud of the team\u2019s forward, Son Heung-min. \u201cHe got a really incredible goal during extra time,\u201d says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. \u201cAfter the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, \u2018Don\u2019t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!\u2019\u201d He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team\u2019s World Cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that kind of score,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really impressive.\u201d The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea\u2019s Kim Young-gwon scored: \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018What the hell? This is awesome,\u2019\u201d Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn\u2019t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. \u201cWe were screaming and dancing,\u201d Jaeyoung says . \u201cI just wish I had put a bet on.\u201d Russia 3 Egypt 1 Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 June The balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova\u2019s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. \u201cHe was absent on principle,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe\u2019s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn\u2019t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.\u201d Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love; Anastasiia\u2019s husband is British, and Polina\u2019s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg. Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt\u2019s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: \u201cI don\u2019t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.\u201d \u201cOur first goal was the best moment for me,\u201d Anastasiia says. \u201cI remember thinking, we\u2019re so close to winning the game, and if we win we\u2019ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.\u201d She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: \u201cI hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren\u2019t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.\u201d Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. \u201cWe won and that was a surprise for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve only won two games so far \u2013 but for us it\u2019s like we\u2019ve won the whole thing.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 July 2018 to correct the spelling of Adama Kande\u2019s surname. \u2022 Commenting on this piece?

The 23-year-old was juggling an exhausting work schedule at her job in a kitchen at Newark airport, alongside parenting duties and a family medical crisis. She needed support. She found it in a union. Young people like Motley-Gibson are starting their work lives at a time when activism has been mostly absent from low-wage industries. In the airline workforce, unions have long represented flight attendants and other professionals. But the labour movement hasn\u2019t penetrated the precarious airport-catering sectors, staffed mostly by low-wage immigrants and people of colour. Things began to stir at the Newark airport kitchen when the service workers\u2019 union, Unite Here, recruited Motley-Gibson to help organise her colleagues to demand better working conditions. Last month she helped arrange a rally on behalf of 2,700 fellow catering workers at United Airlines kitchens around the country, calling for fair contracts and the right to form a union. The campaign has bridged social and racial divides. \u201cThis is the most that we\u2019ve all come together,\u201d said Motley-Gibson, a first-time organiser. \u201cEach department, each race, each age group \u2026 [Companies] want us to be against [each other]; now we talk to each other.\u201d Motley-Gibson isn\u2019t the only young American talking about unions for the first time. Last year, bucking a long trend of decline, union membership in the US grew by 262,000 members. Three in four new recruits were, like Motley-Gibson, under 35. That\u2019s a major upheaval considering the wilting of unions\u2019 political clout over the past two decades. From about 20% of the workforce in 1983 (the earliest year for strictly comparable data), union membership declined to just under 11% last year. On Wednesday, the supreme court dealt another major blow to unions by ruling that non-union members in the public sector no longer have to pay for union representation in collective bargaining negotiations. The hard hats and smokestacks of yesteryear are making room for tablets and tweets as the labour movement gets a millennial upgrade. One in four new hires was unionised last year, of nearly 860,000. An era of inequality, insecure work and Donald Trump has begun to galvanise frustration among a generation often dismissed as self-absorbed. Now hyper-networked millennials are rediscovering the potential of organised labour to seed economic empowerment at work. Young workers have realised that \u201ca generation of corporate-driven policy choices have decimated the rights and economic security of working people\u201d, according to Liz Schuler, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the largest federation of US labour unions. \u201cThe millennial and Gen Z generations are more civic minded and acutely in tune with the power of collective action \u2026 a union card helps them leverage their power.\u201d Even the ivory tower is embracing worker solidarity. Graduate students at Columbia University recently staged a week-long strike for official recognition of their new union of teaching and research assistants, historically not treated as regular employees. Though the administration has resisted contract negotiations, organisers are building momentum on campus, while a nationwide movement to organise student workers is growing. \u201cIncome inequality and disparities are at one of the peaks since the recession,\u201d said Ian Bradley-Perrin, a Columbia graduate worker. \u201cIt could be a moment when people are looking for solutions. And the solution [that] has been in existence for a long time, that maybe people haven\u2019t given credit to, is unionisation. Cultural perceptions of unionisation and unions have changed.\u201d Entrepreneurial and creative opportunities have expanded for some in an era of instant global communication and commerce. But millennials dreaming of careers in traditional white-collar professions such as finance and publishing are facing the hamster wheel of temp gigs and unpaid internships. Unions offer a ballast as they navigate an uncertain economy: a boost in wages, especially for women and workers of colour, as well as insurance benefits; steady schedules; and an advocacy network to challenge exploitation, sexual abuse or discrimination in a post-#MeToo era. About two-thirds of professionals responding to a recent AFL-CIO survey said they \u201cwould support a proposal for a union at their current job\u201d if they had an opportunity to join one. Despite usually having spent more time in formal education than their parents did, young workers cannot bank on the financial and social security their parents\u2019 generation enjoyed. About 11% of young US college graduates are unemployed or lacking full-time work, and gender and racial income disparities are growing for millennials. The re-energisation of labour parallels other youth-powered activism. Young community activists have bolstered worker-driven protest movements from Occupy to the Fight for $15 to #MeToo, linking issues of living wages, labour protections and social justice. And younger \u201cgig\u201d industries have spawned organising campaigns and legal battles to expand labour protections in sectors such as ridesharing apps, retail and computer programming. Some fresh blood is long overdue for a union movement grown anaemic since the 1970s, strafed by globalisation, automation and rightwing rollbacks on union protections. \u201cRight to work\u201d laws have helped deplete union coffers in many states by restricting their ability to collect fees from all workers at unionised firms, while Wednesday\u2019s supreme court ruling imposed similar barriers on public sector unions. At the media website Curbed NY, editor Amy Plitt\u2019s beat is high-class real estate. As a young journalist, Plitt had never seriously considered unionising. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like something you could do,\u201d said Plitt. But office murmurings about workplace concerns eventually crystallised into a union drive, and within months a collective bargaining committee was established representing each outlet of Curbed NY\u2019s parent network, Vox Media. In January, the management officially recognised the union as part of Writers Guild East, which represents several other digital news outfits. Last week (6 June) staff at the New Yorker joined the growing list of media workers forming unions. Now embarking on her first contract talks, Plitt said she was attracted to \u201cthe possibility of joining together with colleagues and really having a voice at the table\u201d. \u201cThe more people in this industry come together and do this, and demand certain rights and different priorities \u2026 I think it\u2019s only going to make the industry stronger,\u201d she said. And as long as the old story of bad bosses and angry workers persists in the \u201cnew economy\u201d, the union promise will age well: a fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work.

Two 15-year-olds sit reading novels, while others kick footballs or play chase. One boy does some press-ups. The hum of conversation and flurry of movement contrasts with most other French secondary schools, where playgrounds can be eerily silent as pupils stare at their mobile phones. In La Gautrais, no one looks at Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube. Here mobile phones have been banned. Few seem to miss them. \u201cI do have a phone, but I leave it at home and don\u2019t really think about it much,\u201d shrugged one 14-year-old girl in a denim jacket. \u201cI don\u2019t rush to check it after school. When I get home, first I\u2019ll have a snack, I\u2019ll chat to my mum, do some homework, then I might look at my phone. But only if I\u2019m waiting for an important message.\u201d Two of her friends don\u2019t have mobile phones at all. \u201cWe don\u2019t really need phones because we\u2019re always chatting to each other in person, we chat the whole time \u2013 too much probably \u2013 and we\u2019re really good friends,\u201d one said. La Gautrais middle school in the village of Plouasne banned the use of mobile phone on its grounds four years ago, long before the French president, Emmanuel Macron, made an election promise to outlaw children\u2019s phones in schools in an attempt to \u201cdetox\u201d teenagers increasingly addicted to screens. From September, all nursery, primary and middle schools will ban mobile phone use. More than 90% of 12- to 17-year-olds are believed to own a mobile phone in France, and children were already banned from unauthorised use in class. But , as in the UK, it was left to headteachers to decide whether to limit phones in breaktime. La Gautrais\u2019s 290 pupils between the ages of 12 and 16 come from surrounding villages in this farming area. Since the ban, staff have noticed more social interaction between children, more empathy and a readiness to learn at the start of lessons. There is less \u201cswitching-off anger\u201d at having to move from breaktime gaming on smartphones to focusing in class. \u201cNo phone use at school gives pupils a moment\u2019s peace from social networks and some children tell us they appreciate that,\u201d said the headteacher, Yves Koziel. \u201cOn social networks there\u2019s an acceleration and extreme simplification of group relationships which can create conflict, even bullying. We\u2019re freeing them from that \u2013 at least during the day. We\u2019re cutting the umbilical cord and offering some respite from it.\u201d Koziel said he was pleased to see children returning to \u201cordinary things\u201d, such as chatting, games and breaktime clubs and activities including dance and knitting. \u201cI think children are more available for social interaction when they\u2019re obliged to really speak to each other,\u201d he said. Policing the ban has not been difficult. Pupils switch off phones and leave them in schoolbags and there are fewer than 10 confiscations a year. \u201cAt my previous schools, sometimes phones were in pencil cases and pupils were checking them or writing messages on phones on their laps,\u201d Laura Floch, an English teacher, said. \u201cHere, phones aren\u2019t an issue.\u201d In March, Floch took a group of 15-year-old pupils to London for a five-day trip, visiting sights including the British Museum and the Museum of London. The teenagers were not allowed to use their phones during the day or during excursions, except when asking to take photographs of sights, but they could use them in evening free time. She said: \u201cThey knew it was fair and they accepted it. But I could see other groups of children from France on similar trips at the same museums just sitting on benches and staring at their phones during the whole museum visit instead of taking part.\u201d Sitting with his friends at breaktime, Anatole Desriac, who recently got his first mobile phone at the age of 15, said he approved of the ban. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with my friends I prefer a proper conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re all standing around with phones, you talk about what\u2019s on the screen rather than really listening to each other.\u201d He and his friends use their phones to listen to French rap on the long bus journey. At home, playing Fortnite on PlayStation was just as enticing as a phone, but all their parents limited screen use. \u201cKnowing how to use phones in moderation is just part of life for us,\u201d Christian-Steven Kitoko, 16, said. Desriac\u2019s mother, Nicole Lefeuvre, a librarian, said: \u201cChildren and parents tend to agree that it\u2019s a good thing not using phones at school. Parents of teenagers find it hard enough to be constantly negotiating screen time at home.\u201d Her rules include no phones before the age of 15, no phones in bedrooms, no screens at all on Thursdays and school-holiday reading time for novels, comics or magazines. In the playground, many under-14s said their biggest worry was breaking their phones, smashing them or dropping them in water so they were happy to leave them at home for safety\u2019s sake. One 16-year-old girl said she did not mind keeping her phone switched off on though she felt attached to it. \u201cI have to know it\u2019s there and I keep it in my jacket pocket, touching it regularly. I feel a bit lost without it.\u201d In Bourges in central France, Jean-Claude Chevalier, the headteacher at Littr\u00e9 middle school, which has 600 pupils, introduced a ban on phone use at breaktimes this year because of what the playground had become. \u201cStaff were surprised to see hundreds of children simultaneously glued to their phones during break \u2013 all sitting down staring at a screen and not talking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brought a loss of empathy, because children can use much stronger language on a screen than they would use face to face.\u201d None of the fears about banning phones had materialised. \u201cWe thought there might be more playground violence and rowdiness but that wasn\u2019t the case. Pupils talk more, the playground is livelier,\u201d Chevalier said. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d have to confiscate dozens of phones a day, in fact the number of confiscations has gone down. We thought the toilets would be monopolised by children sneaking a look at their phones, but that hasn\u2019t happened at all. \u201cWhat we have seen is that pupils seem less addicted to phones.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

But instead of being sent to the headteacher\u2019s office, he is jamming on a keyboard while a teacher adds in some drums. \u201cIt calms them down,\u201d says Nick Stillwell, the co-founder of the SupaJam school in Swanley, Kent. \u201cThey realise life\u2019s OK, and put the knife down.\u201d With its leopard-print wallpaper and vinyl records playing in the entrance hall, SupaJam is not your average educational institution. The Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt has been known to pop by to run workshops. \u201cWe try to create an environment that\u2019s a little forgiving,\u201d says Stillwell, a music industry professional who set up the music school four years ago with his business partner, David Court. \u201cThis whole thing has been established so it doesn\u2019t feel like school.\u201d Drawing on their expertise the pair created a course in the music industry for young people who who have fallen out of education \u2013 16- to 18-year-olds not in education, training or employment, as well as those aged up to 25 with special educational needs. Some students have spent time in young offenders\u2019 institutions, or have drug or alcohol problems. Some were gang members. SupaJam\u2019s success rate is remarkable \u2013 97% of those who complete the course leave with a nationally recognised business diploma, and 85% go on to further education or employment. \u201cThat\u2019s huge for these kids,\u201d says Stillwell, \u201cbecause everyone\u2019s been telling them how rubbish they are. We give them things to brag about.\u201d Stillwell and Court self-funded the school for its first two years, before winning a contract with the Department for Education. As well as traditional classrooms it has a recording studio, editing suite and enough instruments to start an orchestra. Industry professionals drop in to offer lessons and work experience; the US singer-songwriter Sonia Leigh performed here last year. This summer the students have been given their own stage to curate at the Black Deer music festival near Tunbridge Wells. \u201cDid you know Albert Einstein played the violin?\u201d asks second-year student Katie, 17. \u201cA teacher told his parents they should take him out of school, he wasn\u2019t smart enough. And then they bought him a violin and he sailed through.\u201d Katie has also experienced the power of music. Bullying and family problems shattered her GCSE year, and with only a scattering of Cs and Ds she felt she had nowhere to turn. At SupaJam she has become a star pupil, even creating her own blog about music and mental health. \u201cIn formal education they don\u2019t take into account anything you might struggle with. You might be having a bad day but that isn\u2019t the person you are,\u201d she says. \u201cNick and David actually give you a chance.\u201d SupaJam\u2019s co-founders can identify with their pupils. They met at 15, both kicked out of school without qualifications. \u201cWe were the naughty boys, but we were lucky because we had nice families. We weren\u2019t abandoned by the adult world, like some of these kids,\u201d says Stillwell. After setting up their own company they offered an internship scheme, but when it attracted only middle-class children they decided to try something different. The initial idea was to help six local teenagers \u2013 they now have 70 pupils and 31 staff, including welcomers to meet students as they arrive; safeguarding specialists in every class; and one-to-one maths and English tutors. Getting the young people into work is the primary objective. \u201cThey will often be the only person in education or employment in their family,\u201d says Court. \u201cSometimes we have to battle with the parents because the kids can earn more money if they\u2019re out on the streets dealing than in school.\u201d While the special requirements of the students vary \u2013 from learning difficulties to physical disabilities \u2013 they are not taught separately, although all staff are trained in dealing with disabled students. \u201cWe decided to mix them all up and they naturally started to self-support each other,\u201d says Court. \u201cThey don\u2019t label one another, they just get along. It puts all of us to shame. These kids are inspirational.\u201d Ahead of the Black Deer festival, the students have been working with professionals on every aspect of production, from choosing and booking the acts to running the sound and lighting. Gill Tee, the festival\u2019s co-founder, says she could have found herself in a similar position to the students when she was young. Growing up on a council estate, her teenage brother was murdered when she was 12. \u201cI used to nick my mum\u2019s tranquillisers,\u201d says Tee. \u201cI wanted to escape the pain at home, seeing my beautiful mum shattered.\u201d But she stayed out of trouble, and began her music career making tea at Capital Radio. \u201cIt shows these kids that they can do the same.\u201d Last year the first three SupaJam graduates were accepted into university, a proud moment for the school. But taking up those places proved intimidating for the students. Stillwell and Court responded by setting up a charity that will run a mentorship programme and send tutors along with the students for the first six weeks of their studies. Their dreams for SupaJam are even bigger: plans to open a second base in Ramsgate, and then to expand nationwide. \u201cThese kids are too young to abandon,\u201d says Stillwell. \u201cThis is our society and we have to fight for them.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Why Dutch teenagers are among the happiest in the world", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/why-dutch-bring-up-worlds-happiest-teenagers", "date": "2018-06-17", "transcript": "In a biology class at a secondary school near Rotterdam, Gerrit the skeleton is not the only one with a permanent grin. The Groen van Prinstererlyceum, which first trialled happiness lessons a decade ago, teaches some of the least troubled teens in the world. In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people. It contrasts starkly with the picture in countries like Britain, where depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, and the US, where the number of young people taking their own lives has risen sharply. So why is this flat, damp country of 17 million people with its history of Calvinism and colonialism so good at giving young people an optimistic outlook? Dr Simone de Roos, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), says life satisfaction among teenagers has not dropped since 2013. \u201cI think Dutch children have generally positive interactions in all their social surroundings,\u201d says De Roos. \u201cThey have a supportive environment at home, with friends and also at school. Dutch parents give a lot of support and have mild control. There\u2019s an egalitarian climate, teachers are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and pupils trust teachers.\u201d The last Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, comparing children of 11, 13 and 15, showed a happy Dutch youth. When asked where they would be on \u201cCantril\u2019s ladder\u201d \u2013 with the worst possible life for them on 0 and their best at 10, about 94% of Dutch boys said six or above. Dutch girls were slightly lower, ranging from 84% to 92%. According to that report, young people in the Netherlands were also in the top five for eating breakfast on weekdays, watching more than two hours of weekday television, having kind and helpful classmates \u2013 and in the bottom five for being overweight, having sex before 15, and feeling pressure from schoolwork. They were less likely than average to experience bullying and generally found it easy to talk to parents. The results chime with a 2016 Dutch Statistics Office study of 4,000 people from 12 to 25, who ranked their happiness at 8.4 out of 10, and a PISA report in 2015 noting that the country \u2013 alongside Finland and Switzerland \u2013 seemed \u201cable to combine good learning outcomes with highly satisfied students\u201d. Of course, the general state of the nation helps. There is little unemployment in the Netherlands, relatively low inequality and a healthy economy. Five months ago the SCP compared the Netherlands favourably with 25 years ago, while another study showed people were more optimistic than last year. \u201cAt some point there\u2019s a critical mass of optimistic voices, and then it gets its own dynamic,\u201d says Prof Paul Dekker, the SCP programme leader in values and meaning. The director of the World Database of Happiness, Prof Ruut Veenhoven, also believes young people are less burdened by an expectation to \u201cbe good\u201d. \u201cIf you look across Europe, the Dutch and the Danes are the most lenient and focus more on developing autonomy than giving priority to obedience \u2013 and that fits the society,\u201d he says. \u201cChildren are more free to do what they want, and in doing what they want, develop an idea of what they really like and social skills. A happy boy may be sometimes not a very good boy.\u201d In Dutch, there is no phrase that means literally \u201cyou are a good boy\u201d or \u201cgood girl\u201d, says 14-year-old Tjalling Appelhof, from Amsterdam. \u201cYou say \u2018bravo, lad\u2019 or \u2018well done\u2019 or \u2018thank you\u2019,\u201d he says. Like most Dutch teenagers, he cycles to school and feels he has a good level of self-determination. \u201cI can say how late I come home \u2013 not at 3am, I mean, but some time before bedtime!\u201d he says. \u201cI think I have enough freedom.\u201d Despite the country\u2019s reputation for cannabis smoking, the Trimbos Institute reports a downward trend for using alcohol and drugs and smoking in Dutch children aged 12 to 16. Such activities are described by HBSC experts as \u201crisk behaviours\u201d that impact happiness. Other negatives are bullying and fighting. At Groen van Prinstererlyceum, Dani Karremans, a 16-year-old majoring in sciences, believes such pressures are not extreme in the Netherlands. \u201cIf I compare things with other countries and especially other schools, you hear that people are bullied, often seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t really see that. If people try to bully me, I just ignore it. I\u2019ve got my own friends who I get on with. I don\u2019t have a social \u2018image\u2019 or think that everyone has to like me \u2013 it\u2019s not realistic.\u201d Dani, whose mother is Indonesian and Polish and whose father is Moroccan, says his father spends more time on Facebook than he does. Saffron Jones, also 16, and majoring in social sciences, is half-English and half-Dutch. She says that from when her parents split up 11 years ago, her friendship group has always been supportive. \u201cI could always stay with my friends at primary school. Now, if I\u2019m stressed about school, mostly one of my friends is good in that subject, so I\u2019ll call them and they help. It calms me down.\u201d The HBSC data supports this: 86% of Dutch teenagers say their classmates are kind and helpful, putting the country top of the tables at 13 and 15. Sex education starts at four, and Saffron says her boyfriend is accepted by her friends and parents. Meanwhile a poster on her school\u2019s wall encouraging people of all sexualities to \u201ccome out\u201d reaffirms that openness is OK. The rate of teenage pregnancies in the Netherlands is also the lowest in the EU. The Dutch school system \u2013 almost entirely publicly funded \u2013 incorporates major exams at about the age of 12 and three levels of secondary education from practical to the most academic. But it is possible to progress from one to the other or repeat a year and, despite concerns about dropping standards and increasing segregation, such flexibility could make for less stress. Yara Agterhof, 17, from Vlaardingen, has just changed her subject focus. \u201cI was a year ahead, [taking] physics, chemistry and biology,\u201d she says. \u201cI figured it was too hard for me and made a decision to go back. Now I have a different profile with the things I do actually enjoy. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve lost a year and I think my parents feel: \u2018As long as you\u2019re happy, we\u2019re happy.\u2019\u201d There are social problems such as differences between minority ethnic and native Dutch achievement, while one in nine children grows up in poverty. But Jacqueline Boerefijn, a biology teacher at the Groen van Prinstererlyceum, says even if a school wants to expel a child, it must find another school for them, so there are incentives to deal with issues. But Boerefijn, who developed happiness classes at the school a decade ago, and also gives positive psychology lessons to educators, is worried that Dutch children are under threat from new pressures around educational achievement. \u201cPlease stop putting the bar higher, because we have happy children,\u201d she says. \u201cWe already have so many highly educated people, and at the moment there are not enough people to do the plumbing and carpentry jobs.\u201d For Tjalling, it is pretty simple. \u201cIn the Netherlands we are rich, most things around children are well organised, like school and healthcare, and if people are poor, we try to help them. That\u2019s maybe why children are happy. \u201cIt rains a lot. But you get used to it.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

He took advantage of a Quebec social policy unheard of anywhere else in North America: a programme of extended non-transferable paternity leave at 70-75% pay offered by the government. \u201cMost of my [male] colleagues at work are somewhere between 28 and 40, and I don\u2019t know of a single one in the department who\u2019s had a kid who has not taken those weeks of paternity leave,\u201d says Goldsmith. \u201cIf something generous like this is being offered, you don\u2019t say no.\u201d In the family of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories, Quebec has long been the noisy, rebellious child. In 2006, it divorced itself from the country\u2019s complex and lacklustre parental leave programme. The province created its own system, the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), a model influenced by Scandinavian countries and with the aim of improving gender equality. Along with Quebec\u2019s highly subsidised daycare system \u2013 the envy of parents across the rest of Canada, with rates as low as C$7.55 (\u00a34.35) per day per child \u2013 QPIP was seeded in the 1990s by the controversial separatist leader Pauline Marois, then Quebec\u2019s minister of families. \u201cMarois is a feminist and fiercely determined,\u201d says Sophie Mathieu, a post-doctoral fellow at Brock University who researches the Quebec parental leave system. \u201cAs a province, Quebec went from being the laggard in gender equality \u2013 Quebec was the last Canadian province to give women the vote \u2013 to being the leader.\u201d QPIP gave parents higher replacement rates \u2013 70-75% of one\u2019s income, over a maximum 52 weeks \u2013 than other Canadian provinces, while offering more flexibility in terms of shared leave. But the most innovative aspect of QPIP is its \u201cdaddy quota\u201d \u2014 the five weeks of \u201cuse-it-or-lose-it\u201d benefits, for fathers and non-biological mothers in lesbian couples. \u201cThere is so much working against fathers when it comes to leave,\u201d says Andrea Doucet, the Canada Research Chair in Gender, Work &amp; Care. \u201cFathers go into work and say they want to take leave, and their bosses say: \u2018Well isn\u2019t your wife taking leave?\u2019 Fathers were being penalised for taking leave, all the stuff that women have been going through for so long. \u201cWhat they found in places like Sweden is that if you give fathers their own leave, something families will lose if they don\u2019t take, taking the leave becomes expected.\u201d Among fathers in Quebec, the effect was close to immediate, with take-up rates among eligible dads jumping 250%. \u201cOver 80% of Quebec fathers take their paternity leave,\u201d says Doucet. And 86% of Quebec parents will also in some way share the rest of their parental leave. Compare that with the 15% of fathers who take parental benefits in the rest of Canada, and the estimated 2% of parents who use the shared parental leave programme in the UK, and the results of what some policy experts have called \u201cthe Quebec experiment\u201d begin to seem quite stunning. Globally the picture is even starker. Almost two-thirds of the world\u2019s children under a year old \u2013 nearly 90 million infants \u2013 live in countries where fathers are not legally entitled to a single day of paid paternity leave, according to new research by Unicef. Ankita Patnaik, an economist at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington DC, authored one of the first papers studying QPIP. She says the programme quickly showed results with regards to time use between couples. \u201cI found that the mothers having babies in Quebec under QPIP were spending more time in paid work one to three years after having their children,\u201d she says. What\u2019s more, Patnaik found that fathers who made use of QPIP were engaging in more childcare and domestic work one to three years later than fathers who did not \u2013 37 minutes more per day, on average. Doucet, who has studied fatherhood for two decades, says that the true worth of Quebec fathers spending more time with their babies is still difficult to reflect in numbers. \u201cThe real question is: later on when the child is sick, who is going to care for the kid? We\u2019ve seen \u2026 that when fathers build their confidence, competence, love and the feeling that they are an equal parent, then when things go wrong, it\u2019s not always the mother [who takes responsibility].\u201d While five weeks of leave is a good step in this direction, \u201cit\u2019s just one step\u201d, she adds. Goldsmith, who also used shared parental benefits to take months-long leaves for both his young sons, believes that men caring for their babies in the early weeks of their life has a significant and continuing benefit for family life. \u201cIt\u2019s different for dads. Mums have an automatic bond but dads have to earn it. And then when you start getting reactions from your babies, it makes you want to be more involved,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to care for my kids, not because of some abstract theoretical notion of sharing 50/50. My son smiles when I smile, he smiles when he sees me. So I do things for love. Love becomes the reason.\u201d In Canada, that love is spreading. \u201cIn the 2018 budget, we have introduced an additional parental sharing benefit of five weeks,\u201d says the families minister, Jean-Yves Duclos. \u201cThis is directly related to this very successful experiment in the province of Quebec. \u201cWe know it\u2019s policies like this that will help us achieve a more equal and inclusive society. These are the kind of policies we want. Not the kind that build walls. Here in Canada, we prefer bridges.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Their roommate had brought a male friend home the night before. When she left for work, he stayed. Hours later, Naranzaya called her elder sister. \u201cShe was crying and asking: \u2018Who was that man? He raped me and then he left.\u2019\u201d That man, they would soon learn, was a ruling party MP, Gantulga Dorjdugar, who is now under investigation. He says he has been wrongly accused and the two \u201cmutually consented\u201d to having sex. It is one of the most high-profile political scandals in Mongolia in years, and highlights both the progress and the challenges in a nascent but growing women\u2019s rights movement. Saranzaya, 32, is one of a small but increasingly bold group of women calling on their country to tackle pervasive sexual violence. For some, this is the beginning of Mongolia\u2019s #MeToo movement, though weak laws and a culture of victim-blaming mean it has a long way to go. \u201cSome people ask why don\u2019t we stop and why are we fighting for this,\u201d Saranzaya said. \u201cWe want to make a path for other women. If this can win in court and they can bring justice to victims, we can prove the system is just and that will help other victims.\u201d According to Mongolia\u2019s first nation-wide survey on gender-based violence, released on Thursday by the national statistics office and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), 31% of women say they have been subjected to sexual or physical violence by their partner. One in seven women (14%) say they have been subjected to sexual violence by someone who was not their partner \u2013 a figure twice as high as the estimated world average and higher than almost anywhere else in Asia, according to Henriette Jansen, a UNFPA adviser. \u201cIn Mongolia there is huge variation in proportions of women experiencing non-partner sexual violence throughout the country. It is everywhere and sexual abuse against women is quite alarming compared with the rest of the region,\u201d said Jansen. But a backlash is building. In March a group of women knitted hundreds of red pussyhats and wore them to a protest against violence in the capital on International Women\u2019s Day. In May a women\u2019s group held a performance of the Vagina Monologues, translated into Mongolian. In 2016, after years of lobbying by activists and female lawmakers, the country made domestic violence a crime for the first time. Now a consortium of NGOs is pushing for sexual harassment in the workplace to be included in the country\u2019s labour laws. Sexual assault or abuse below the level of rape is handled by the country\u2019s human rights commission, which can only make recommendations. Justice delayed While awareness is increasing, justice is still rare. Naranzaya\u2019s case stalled at first when two doctors who first examined her took a leave of absence and then were replaced. The case was reopened in August after Naranzaya\u2019s family provided items \u2013 underwear and a duvet \u2013 found to have traces of Gantulga\u2019s semen. Gantulga, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, has repeated his client\u2019s assertion of innocence. The national survey found that only 10% of women who said they had experienced \u201csevere sexual violence\u201d, including rape, from someone who was not their partner, said they reported their case to the police. A separate survey of 300 rape victims by the Gender Equality Centre found that about 65% of reported assaults went to trial. Just 9.5% of victims polled said they had received compensation. Police data shows victims get on average 804,854 tugrik \u2013 about \u00a3250. Women who speak out are often blamed. Late last year Bolor Zaankhuu, 33, published her own #MeToo account. Fifteen years ago, while taking an elevator up to her fourth-floor apartment, a man grabbed her from behind and groped her, she wrote in a blog. She struggled until the elevator doors opened and she ran out and down the stairs to the ground floor. When she went to the police with her father, she recalled, she was reprimanded for wearing a tank top. It was the middle of summer. \u201cImmediately I was blamed,\u201d she said. Bolor later identified her attacker, who spent one night at the police station before being let go. Now, she said, she waits to take elevators until no men are around and she doesn\u2019t allow her 10-year-old daughter to go anywhere alone. A woman who lives and works in Ulaanbaatar said that on one occasion four years ago she woke up in a hotel to find a man raping her. Later when she filed a police report alleging she had been drugged and assaulted, the investigator said she was not likely to get compensation and encouraged her to drop the case. Eventually she did. \u201cI don\u2019t feel bad about it any more. At least, I want to shake that mindset. Women feel guilty. Because they got drunk or because they went to that party, they blame themselves \u2026 that if I hadn\u2019t been wearing this or that, then this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d she told the Guardian, asking that her name not be published. Women have contacted Saranzaya to say they too have been victims of sexual assault, but no one has joined her campaign. The sisters have been called prostitutes and liars. Others say Saranzaya is using her sister to try to extort money from the MP. Even women\u2019s rights groups have stayed away after critics accused Saranzaya of being politically motivated. Hospital shelter Researchers and advocates are worried not just about the extent of sexual violence in Mongolia but the severity of it. The survey found 72% of women who said they had been injured by their partners reported \u201csevere\u201d harm such as broken bones, cuts to the head and in some cases miscarriages. Researchers found forms of abuse particular to Mongolia: hundreds of women reported being chased by their partners in cars, on motorcycles or horses, or being lashed with whips. The number of people reporting abuse is growing, a statistic that could mean more people are willing to do so, or abuse is on the rise, or some combination of the two. At the One Stop Service Centre, a small office and room with bunkbeds at Ulaanbaatar\u2019s main trauma hospital, abused women can shelter with their children for up to 72 hours and seek medical help, therapy and legal advice. Deedentsetseg Chuluunbayar, a social worker at the centre, said that in 2008, the first year it was open, it received around 300 women. Last year the number was 960, despite the centre closing for a month, and now it gets at least eight women a day. On payday and public holidays, more women come to the hospital with injuries. On 18 March, Soldier\u2019s Day in Mongolia, 15 women came to the centre. Deedentsetseg said Mongolia\u2019s new domestic violence law could lead to fewer women reporting abusive partners. In the past, women reported their husbands to the police to scare them, and then they would drop the case. Under the new law, domestic violence cases have to go forward to trial. \u201cIt\u2019s really a difficult situation because most of the women who come here don\u2019t want to disrupt the family and are dependent on their husbands,\u201d Deedentsetseg said. \u2018Reverse gender gap\u2019 It is unclear why sexual violence is apparently so prevalent in Mongolia, a middle-income country that prides itself on its peaceful transition from a former Soviet satellite to a democracy in 1990. Some blame a macho culture, while others point to a \u201creverse gender gap\u201d. For years after the transition, families invested more of their resources in sending their daughters to school and kept their sons home to herd. Mongolian women now outpace men in education, health and work. Men have higher rates of unemployment and alcoholism, and their average lifespan is 10 years shorter than that of women. \u201cMen\u2019s reputation has fallen. These things can be a reason why more men are angry with women, which leads to violence,\u201d said Boldbaatar Tumur, head of the Men\u2019s Association in Gobisumber province, which works on raising awareness of men\u2019s issues. Others say Mongolia\u2019s close-knit rural communities encourage a culture of silence. \u201cVery few people can say \u2018me too\u2019,\u201d said Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a former MP who pushed for the law criminalising domestic violence. \u201cIn the countryside there is no anonymity, and because of that no one wants to speak out.\u201d Gerelee Odonchimed, vice-director for education and advocacy at Women for Change, a women\u2019s empowerment group, said Mongolia\u2019s women rights movement needed more patience. \u201cIt can be slow but, yes, time is up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about changing the colours of the walls. We are talking about changing people\u2019s minds.\u201d Saranzaya and Naranzaya are also taking things slowly. They have moved into a new apartment and Naranzaya, 26, is back at school, studying to become a teacher. \u201cShe\u2019s starting to feel OK again,\u201d Saranzaya said of her sister. This week Gantulga, the accused MP, resigned from parliament. Saranzaya has noticed that when the case is in the news again, her sister slips back into a depression. She has wondered whether they ought to drop the case and move on with their lives. \u201cI said if it\u2019s too difficult we can stop, but she says no, we will fight together.\u201d Additional reporting by Munkhchimeg Davaasharav \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

It spells out what has been achieved in this rural Indian village: \u201cWe no longer die in childbirth.\u201d For the women of Purabgaon, in the Amethi district of Uttar Pradesh, expectations had always been clear. Get married young, then have back-to-back pregnancies. Those babies would be delivered in unsanitary conditions at home by a dai, a village midwife with no training and many superstitions. \u201cEven if a woman was taken to hospital for the birth, half an hour later she would be bundled home to do the chores, feed the cattle and cook,\u201d said Gulab Yadav, a project manager in Amethi for Save a Mother. The maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Amethi has been one of the highest in the world \u2013 451 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to a 2008 government survey. Anaemia is one key problem: around 55% of Indian women are anaemic, and rural women\u2019s diets are often poor. Save a Mother aims to educate rural women about pregnancy, nutrition, immunisation, delivery and care of the child. \u201cWe told them to delay having the first baby and leave a three-year gap between pregnancies to keep mother and child safe and healthy. And they understand that delivery in hospital is safest because complications such as heavy bleeding can be treated,\u201d said Gita Gupta, a Save a Mother team leader. Gupta leads a group of 20 female \u201cchange agents\u201d in Purabgaon. Each of the 360 villages in Amethi covered by the scheme has a team of 20 agents \u2013 local women trained to educate other women. Gupta sometimes changes the lyrics of romantic folk songs to refer to iron supplements, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and breastfeeding. \u201cThey find it easier to remember what I\u2019ve told them if they sing it,\u201d she said. Beginning with 20 villages in Amethi 10 years ago, Save a Mother has expanded to 1,100 villages in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. The maternal mortality rate for those villages has been reduced by 90% and infant mortality is down by 60%. Last year in Purabgaon, not a single mother died in childbirth. Nationwide there are five maternal deaths in childbirth every hour, but the mortality rate has been falling steadily, from 280 per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 174 in 2015 and 130 in 2016. Shiban Ganju, a Chicago-based doctor, founded Save a Mother after a visit to rural Uttar Pradesh. \u201cAs a physician I knew [the high mortality rate] could be solved by a dedicated group working with the community,\u201d he said. Ten years on, he said he had learned two key things. Firstly, that changing social behaviour is the most effective and least expensive way to reduce the impact of disease. And secondly, that the Indian government should increase its public health spending from the current 1.1% of GDP \u2013 one of the lowest proportions in the world \u2013 to 2.5%. Some of the older women in Purabgaon talked candidly about the relentless pressure they were put under to give birth. \u201cI had five children in quick succession, my mother-in-law kept saying she wanted a grandson. Then I married off my eldest daughter at 15. That was wrong,\u201d said Urmila Devi. \u201cI know better now. My youngest girl won\u2019t get married before 20 and I will tell her to control her pregnancies.\u201d The village remains highly conservative, but the project has had an impact: many women can now leave the house and attend meetings without needing the permission of their husband or mother-in-law. Moreover, empowered by the information they have absorbed about pregnancy and childbirth, they have some leverage in family discussions. \u201cThey tell their husbands that if they want a healthy baby \u2026 the mother has to eat well. If they aren\u2019t given fish or meat, they drink two glasses of milk instead. And they insist on a hospital delivery,\u201d said Gupta. In the past, tradition has dictated that women wait for a priest to announce an auspicious moment to start breast-feeding the newborn. While waiting, often for up to three days, they fed goat or cow milk to the baby, causing diarrhoea. \u201cNow we breastfeed at once. We don\u2019t wait for the priest,\u201d said one of the mothers, Kanti Devi. Seema Agrahari\u2019s three children, now six, three and one, were all delivered in hospital. \u201cI had an IUD for my family planning. It\u2019s the best thing I did. I felt well during each pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I could have been one of those who died in childbirth.

The tattoos on his arms had cost him jobs before, tell-tale signs of his past life in the notoriously brutal Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m very ashamed,\u201d says Argueta, 39, who joined the gang when he was 12. \u201cI know that we corrupted many hearts and minds. But if God has his arms open for people like us, then why can\u2019t society give us a job opportunity?\u201d Between 30,000 and 60,000 active gang members in El Salvador, in a population of 6.3 million. It was one of the most dangerous countries in the world last year; in 2015 it recorded one murder every hour, after a truce between the MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs fell apart and a bloody turf war resumed. The interviewer spotted that Argueta was attempting to hide his past. He gave him the job anyway. Argueta has worked for nine years at League Central America, a clothing factory that produces apparel for US universities including Harvard and Princeton. It\u2019s one of a growing number of firms, at least 10 so far, in El Salvador hiring reformed gang members. Those include energy firm AES Corporation and a tuna packing company, according to the Trabajemos por la Paz (Working for Peace) group, which has found jobs for more than 700 reformed gang members since 2008. Unsurprisingly, research suggests that those who can find regular employment are more likely to escape the cycle of gang violence that has tormented the country. League Central America has employed at least 100 former gangsters since 2009. The company pairs with local churches and community groups to provide job training and facilitate the delicate process of cutting ties, which involves careful negotiation with leaders who view defectors with suspicion. In fact, members are never considered to have truly left, only to have become calmado, or inactive. According to the head of League Central America, Rodr\u00edgo Bola\u00f1os, none of those who joined his firm have returned to active status. This process of rehabilitation stands in stark contrast to the politically popular mano dura, or iron fist, approach to dealing with the country\u2019s gang violence, which has seen lethal extrajudicial violence meted out by security forces. \u201cWe have stopped a tremendous problem by embracing the community, giving them a true opportunity in life. We\u2019re resolving the problem instead of killing them,\u201d says Bola\u00f1os. \u201cIt sends the message that we have to embrace the community if we want to have a healthy country.\u201d Manuel Oswaldo Henr\u00edquez, a 31-year-old employee at League Central America, joined the Barrio 18 gang at 14. \u201cAfter ninth grade, I didn\u2019t want to study anymore,\u201d Henr\u00edquez says. \u201cThere was no future for me in this country because I had already tattooed my body.\u201d His teachers were afraid of him, awarding passing grades out of fear. His life consisted of shootouts in rival neighbourhoods, followed by the inevitable retaliation on his own turf. \u201cIt\u2019s hard being in the gang. It\u2019s not like your mom telling you to do something. If you don\u2019t follow the orders, there are punishments, beatings. That\u2019s life in the gang.\u201d Now, Henr\u00edquez has a respectable job that allows him to provide for his wife and six-year-old son. Not everyone is convinced of the merits of offering jobs to people such as Argueta and Henr\u00edquez who have perpetrated terrible crimes. Many Salvadorans bear the scars of years of gang violence. Some firms still refuse to partner with Trabajemos por la Paz, while others are only comfortable offering food for programmes and events. Those that do open their doors also face the task of winning over the existing employees. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to convince not just the business owners, but all the people working at a company,\u201d said Nelson Morales, the executive director of the group. \u201cBut through the years, we\u2019ve realised that people are opening up. Part of our work is making sure that society and business owners understand the [gang] phenomenon.\u201d For Morales there\u2019s a simple logic to the approach. \u201cAny social reintegration programme is incomplete if it can\u2019t provide people with a way of making a living that is respectable and socially accepted,\u201d he says. Henr\u00edquez has faced resistance in his new life. \u201cThere are many people who don\u2019t believe that gang members can change,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they can, I\u2019ve seen it in myself and I\u2019ve seen it in other people as well. If there are opportunities, I know that a gang member can change and be different.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

In Minnesota, fish and green vegetables are farmed in a former brewery by Urban Organics; in New York, Brooklyn Grange grows produce on the roof of its office. In Dallas, Texas, in an area designated as a food desert, meaning access to fresh fruit and vegetables is difficult, Big Tex urban farms have donated 85,000 servings of fruit and vegetables to the community since 2016. Developed for and funded by the annual State fair of Texas, the project consists of mobile beds in car parks and a hydroponic greenhouse which allow plants to grow without soil. \u201cThe majority of the population in this area relies on small corner stores that do not provide access to quality produce or healthy foods,\u201d said Jason Hays, the fair\u2019s creative director. \u201cAccess to modern grocery stores can be inhibited due to pricing, transportation and education. The city tried to lure a large grocer with financial incentives but had no luck. \u201cAccess to fresh food options can have a profound effect on the health and wellbeing of individuals, which can transform communities. I believe everyone should have equal access to healthy options as well as education to improve eating habits.\u201d One recipient, Glenda Cunningham, of the Baylor Scott and White health and wellness centre, praised the project\u2019s work. \u201cThe community looks forward to the Big Tex urban farm delivery each week. The food is fresh, free and beautiful,\u201d she said. Learning about life through gardening In Orange, Connecticut, the food production company Watson\u2019s fellowship garden has been running for four years. The company grows produce for food banks and had extra space available, so it decided to expand and has opened its garden to a centre helping children with autism spectrum issues. Christina Cole, 47, a graphic designer at Watson, said: \u201cThe plot for Milestones Behavioural Services, which includes a pumpkin and melon patch, gives kids with autism and developmental disabilities the chance to not only have fun and be outside, but also learn life skills and take home what they grow and learn to cook with their families. With the garden season kicking in, we\u2019re getting ready to put in a corn maze.\u201d According to the Connecticut food bank, one in eight people in the state struggle with hunger. \u201cWe feel no one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from,\u201d Cole said. The company provides 4,800 plants each year, and those not used are donated to the food bank for use in its gardens. Watson hopes the garden will not only help children but also address food insecurity facing older generations. \u201cThose who are elderly and on a low income used to get vouchers from the state to access fresh fruit and vegetables, but the programme has been cut due to a lack of funding. With our garden we hope to work with the community and help with such issues. Everyone should have access to food, much less something fresh,\u201d Cole said. She said shops were willing to donate food in West Haven but did not have the resources to do so. \u201cI\u2019m in the process of trying to organise the logistics of starting runners to help businesses get food to those who need it most. We\u2019re hoping it will help reduce food waste in the area.\u201d Rose Majestic, the executive director of Wheat, which provides food to people in crisis, said: \u201cThe people who comes to us can\u2019t afford fresh produce so Watson\u2019s weekly deliveries go a long way in helping them. We hope other businesses that have yards that can be dug up and used for feeding the hungry in our community start to do the same.\u201d Watson is hosting an event in June to try to get local businesses to start their own community food-growing projects. \u201cIn light of the world nowadays, we should all get back to learning to grow our own food. It is the essential basis for survival. It can only further us all to know how to feed ourselves healthily and it\u2019s a great help to have an alternative food source for our neighbours.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

When the machine ran out of water, he asked passing boys to fetch a bucket. When he had to give directions to workers in the building across the lane, he shouted. Every few minutes, he took a long swig from his water bottle and spat the contents on to the ground without swallowing. \u201cRamadan,\u201d he explained. Northern India, like neighbouring Pakistan, is in the grip of a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 47C. A blanket of hot air has settled on Delhi clearing pavements across the usually busy capital. India is particularly vulnerable to temperature increases associated with climate change. Since 1992, about 25,000 Indians are estimated to have died because of heatwaves. Yet the country is quietly optimistic that it can prevent at least some of those deaths. In the past two years, the numbers dying from heat-related illnesses has fallen sharply, from 2,040 in 2015 \u2013 when roads melted in the searing heat \u2013 to half that the following year and to a little over 200 in 2017, according to government data. Public health advocates say this has been a triumph of common sense. A combination of public awareness campaigns, training for medical staff and simple policy changes \u2013 such as unlocking the gates of public gardens during the day \u2013have averted thousands of deaths for little cost. The catalyst was a heatwave in May 2010 in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western state of Gujarat, that killed more than 1,100 people, and prompted authorities to seek help. \u201cThe first thing was making people aware that heat can kill,\u201d said Parthasarathi Ganguly, a professor of public health and former World Health Organisation official. \u201cIndia is a tropical country, so people are used to heat: they take it as a natural phenomenon. They say, it will be hot \u2013 what\u2019s new?\u201d Under Ahmedabad\u2019s action plan \u2013 first implemented in 2013, when temperatures rose so high it risked triggering organ failure \u2013 school days were reduced, government work programmes ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas. White reflective paint was applied to roofs in slum communities, cutting temperatures in homes by up to five degrees. In hospitals, staff were trained to identify early signs of heat stroke, including dizziness or severe diarrhoea. Instead of waiting in stifling wards, patients were rushed to dedicated cool rooms equipped with fans, ice packs and, electricity supply permitting, air conditioning. \u201cDoctors don\u2019t go on vacation any more when it\u2019s hot,\u201d said Anjali Jaiswal, of the US-based National Resource Defense Council, which advised on the plan. \u201cThey watch the temperature and make sure the hospital is staffed.\u201d Ahmedabad already had plenty of charities willing to distribute water. \u201cThey see it as an act of god,\u201d Ganguly said. The city government simply allocated each charity a zone, to ensure the whole city was covered. The gates of city gardens, usually closed in the daytime, were opened so that hawkers, traffic police and rickshaw pullers could seek shade. \u201cThe council didn\u2019t spend a rupee,\u201d Ganguly said. The first test of the new system was in May 2014 when, he says, temperatures again reached the levels that had killed so many. \u201cAccording to our initial estimates, 800 fewer people died,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of cost per lives saved, it is one of the most effective interventions in public health until now.\u201d Since then, 11 more cities have adopted similar heat action plans, and one is currently in the works for Delhi. India\u2019s national disaster management authority is aiming to reduce the death toll from excessive heat to zero. So far this year, government officials say, the heat has killed 11 people. Temperatures will drop across India at the end of this month with the arrival of the monsoon rains.

It\u2019s been forsaken by people and gifted to the rare and vulnerable birds of New Zealand to forage undisturbed. Kiwi stepping carefully up the beach at midnight. Kokako waking no one with their shrill calls. And hihi flitting freely through the dense native bush. With no predators allowed, the birds are confident and thriving. \u201cNew Zealanders are a shy and reclusive bunch, the kiwi is a bird we identify with,\u201d says Paul O\u2019Shea, an administrator for Kiwis for Kiwi, a conservation group set up to save the bird from extinction. \u201cIt\u2019s as vital to protect the kiwi in New Zealand as it is to protect the orangutan in Borneo, the sumatran tiger in Indonesia, and the panda in China. Losing these species from the planet might not affect your day-to-day life, but it is a loss to the human experience.\u201d There are 68,000 kiwi left in the country, and they are declining at the rate of 2% per year . A century ago, there were millions. Outside the predator-free zones, kiwi chicks and adults are killed and eaten by dogs and cats, attacked by possums, stoats and rats, and hit by cars at night. These ancient, flightless and nocturnal animals are a wonder to conservationists the world over. They are descended from a \u201cproto-kiwi\u201d that lived about 50 million years ago, they hatch eggs so large they take days to exit their bodies, and are related to the extinct moa, the tetchy cassowary and the emu in Australia (known as the ratite family). On Kapiti, just 40 minutes by car and ferry from downtown Wellington, Emma Neill, state conservation worker, wanders awestruck through the bush. The birdsong is cacophonous and musical, the way mainland New Zealand used to sound. Predator-free islands and sanctuaries are the highest conservation ranking for protected land in New Zealand, Neill explains. They are patrolled by rangers who live and work alone on the island, poised to tackle any threats: stoats which manage to \u201craft\u201d over (on driftwood or debris after a storm), rats that stow away on boats, or Argentinian ants in picnic baskets that breach the natural moat, and can swarm on chicks in the nest. If an invader is detected on the island, they are tracked by trained dogs, trapped and then baited using the controversial 1080 poison. \u201cHaving done conservation projects for so many years, humans tend to react only when there\u2019s a crisis, and the crisis point is often too late to save anything,\u201d says the wildlife presenter Michaela Strachan, wearing a set of kiwi earrings cut from paua shells. Strachan has teamed up with cider company Old Mout to help save the kiwi, a project she was drawn to because of the bird\u2019s unusual charm. \u201cBut this reaction seems to be happening before we\u2019ve reached a crisis point, so I think it will make a difference. There is something about them that is just so full of character. I think because they\u2019re flightless and vulnerable, human beings warm to things that are vulnerable.\u201d In 2016, the government committed to making New Zealand pest-free by 2050. Every rat, stoat and possum is to be wiped out. Sceptics abound: Strachan calls the goal \u201cunbelievable\u201d, O\u2019Shea from Kiwis for Kiwi says it\u2019s \u201cambitious\u201d, while Neill hopes she\u2019s still alive to see the dream come true. This month, the new Labour-coalition government announced the most significant funding increase for the Department of Conservation in 10 years, with NZ$80m (\u00a341.9m) flagged for pest-eradication efforts. Brent Beavan, programme director for Predator Free 2050, says the biggest hurdle to saving the kiwi is domestic cats and dogs. But that\u2019s a touchy subject in New Zealand, which has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. To achieve the 2050 goal, a range of new technologies will have to be deployed in addition to pest-trapping and baiting, says Beaven. Drones, bio-chemical agents and genetic modifiers are all being considered. \u201cIt feels a bit like Everest at the moment, but I think we can have a really good whack at it. Momentum and enthusiasm is really building,\u201d says Neill. \u201cNew Zealanders have grasped it, and have started to act in their everyday lives.\u201d Across the country, volunteer groups that set and check pest traps in conservation areas are growing in number, and traps are increasingly appeating in backyards. In Northland, people offer to take their dogs to kiwi aversion training: an electric shock is administered to dissuade them from stalking kiwi. More people are locking their cats indoors at night. Neill reckons the Maori worldview is becoming part of the New Zealand identity: we aren\u2019t here to dominate mother nature, we\u2019re here to protect it. \u201cWe have something special here in New Zealand, we need to be careful to protect what we have,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t just want our kids to have to look at our native birds on a chart in a school classroom \u2013 of what New Zealand once had.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The 2,000kg (315st) bull starts to stagger and sinks slowly to its knees as the drugs take effect. Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels. After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off. Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn \u2013 for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols \u2013 drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world. Worldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa\u2019s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000. These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers\u2019 prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced. The strategy has produced dramatic results in several reserves. Chris Galliers, chairman of the Game Rangers Association of Africa, analysed 2010-15 poaching statistics from the south-eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal and found that nearly a quarter of rhino deaths were on private reserves. But over the past two and half years, coinciding with the intensive dehorning efforts, that has dropped to 5%. Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. \u201cThis is not something we want to do. It\u2019s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,\u201d says Galliers, noting that it costs about \u00a3580 to safely dehorn a rhino. The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally. Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull. The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood \u2013 and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly. Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers. For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.

The largest land-living animal in Europe was last seen in the Netherlands centuries ago, and was wiped out on the continent by 1927. Despite successful efforts to breed the species again in the wilds of Poland in the 1950s, and renewed efforts in the last decade in western Europe, the European bison remains as endangered as the black rhino. The 7,000 bison, or bison bonasus, that exist in Europe today are often given supplementary feed by rangers to get through the winter months. Yet a study of a herd of 22 bison living in Kraansvlak, 330 hectares of dunes and natural ponds making up part of the Zuid-Kennemerland national park in north Holland, is now offering a more optimistic assessment of the bison\u2019s chances of survival. A series of research papers from the Dutch study further questions the belief that European bison are forest-dwelling creatures, a development that opens up their reintroduction to a whole host of new European environments. Nature organisations in Sweden, Switzerland and the UK are looking on with interest, and knowledge is being shared with established projects in Spain, France and Germany. \u201cPeople thought, \u2018Bison on dunes? The crazy Dutch\u2019,\u201d said Yvonne Kemp, the bison project leader in the Zuid-Kennemerland park, and the co-author of the latest published research. \u201cBut it is working, you can see the herd, they are having calves and doing well. \u201cThe general view for decades was that European bison were a forest animal. But we were not so sure. We believed that they are not so suited to forests because today, still in winter time, in lots of areas, they feed the bison. They come to the hay, which is not super natural.\u201d Three bison were first introduced into the Kraansvlak, in the municipality of Bloemendaal, in April 2007, and a further three in 2008, at the start of a 10-year attempt to fight back against encroaching grasses and shrubbery stamping out the area\u2019s biodiversity. Managed by the water company, PWN, which exploits the natural filtration system of the dunes to supply north Holland, there was a pressing need for grazers to eat back the vegetation. And the appetite of bison is legendary. \u201cThe bison is the largest terrestrial animal in Europe and it needs a lot of food and it needs not only grasses, but quite a lot of intake year round of weed species,\u201d Kemp explained. \u201cThe thinking was that, combined with roe and fallow deer, cattle and rabbits, they could stop the encroachment [of the vegetation].\u201d The chief finding of the study was that European bison can survive without supplementary feeding, even in relatively small nature reserves, by grazing on grasses, herbs and woody plants. And, as their success in Europe\u2019s most densely populated country shows, they can also live close to humans. \u201cThose are wild animals and this is a very urban area so at first we didn\u2019t know what it would take [to reintroduce the herd],\u201d said Kemp. \u201cWe had fences of 2.2 metres like a military zone. They are really big, they can jump, they are very powerful ... so we thought we would need really high electric fences. But we have learned what it takes; we have a fence now of 1.2 metres. \u201cAt first we would come into the area in cars, but now we have a bison trail for the public to follow. There is a general rule not to go within 50 metres of them, and that\u2019s sensible. But it is safe, and the bison are not stressed.\u201d The bison\u2019s work is evident on the undulating dunes, which are situated between the Zandvoort racing track, whose stand is visible from the highest points, and the city of Haarlem to the east. The animals are impervious to the scratchy hawthorns that would cut up other grazers, and with an average weight of 610kg (96 stone), debarked trees are felled with ease as the bison roam, opening up areas of dense growth for other species. They leave a calling card in the shape of tufts of their winter coat on stumps and bushes. \u201cIt is also exciting to see how nature adapts here,\u201d Kemp said. In sub-Saharan Africa the oxpecker has a symbiotic relationship with the buffalo, picking off the parasites in their coats. \u201cHere we have seen magpies doing that job, standing on the bison.\u201d East of Amsterdam, a re-wilding project on the Oostvaardersplassen, where red deer, horses and cattle roam free on low-lying marsh, has been criticised for allowing the grazers to reproduce to such a degree that food became scarce and animals shot to avoid starvation. The Kraansvlak keeps a tight control on numbers, and rotates the bulls, of which they currently have two, with other projects internationally. \u201cThese are wild animals, we never forget that, and we are learning all the time,\u201d Kemp said.

She\u2019s not a bartender or a bouncer \u2013 she\u2019s there to help patrons navigate the sometimes murky world of flirting, dating and hooking up in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Geib was hired by the Victoria Event Centre last month as a \u201cconsent captain\u201d \u2013 a position believed to be the first of its kind in the country. The job joins a raft of other initiatives around the world aimed at fighting back against sexual harassment and assault \u2013 but also guiding those who are struggling to move forward. \u201cSince the #MeToo movement, we now know what sexual assault is, and we\u2019re like, \u2018OK, we really don\u2019t want to do that any more,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut then there\u2019s this whole grey cloud area around what acting in consent and consensual relationships are.\u201d Geib \u2013 who has worked as a sex health educator across North America \u2013 came up with the position after attending a few dance parties held by a local collective at the centre. After hearing a raft of \u201cicky\u201d stories , she put her skills to work, creating a position where someone would be on the floor to address the issues as they happened. Then the Victoria Event Centre, which hosts everything from live concerts to burlesque shows, made contact. \u201cThey started noticing that our dances were better, more safe and more inclusive and accessible to folks,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they approached me, saying: \u2018Hey, would you want to come and do this for all of our events? What would that look like?\u2019\u201d The collaboration has transformed the space, which is now adorned with posters on consent and signs that spell out the house policy on the issue. Towards the beginning of the night, Geib often hovers by the door, introducing herself to people as they enter and letting them know that she\u2019s there to chat or answer any questions about consent. Anyone who experiences behaviour that makes them uncomfortable is encouraged to speak with her. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a stare or a physical touch or dancing too close, they can come to me,\u201d she said. As the night continues, she checks on those who seem heavily intoxicated, making sure they\u2019re safe and offering to get them a glass of water or help them into a taxi if needed. In the few short weeks that she\u2019s been on the job, she\u2019s fielded complaints ranging from inappropriate comments to more explicit harassment. Her response depends on those who report the issues; Geib always asks whether they want her to speak to the people carrying out the offending behaviour. If they do, she launches into action. Often she starts by asking how their night is going and whether they need any support. \u201cDepending on how those two questions go, I introduce myself, \u2018I\u2019m Tanille and I\u2019ve just gotten some feedback about your behaviour. You\u2019re making someone uncomfortable, do you want to have a conversation with that?\u2019\u201d Some have simply thanked her, saying they didn\u2019t realise how their behaviour was coming across. Others have turned hostile, refusing to listen to her and forcing her to turn to her security team for backup. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to kick out a couple of people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I always try and give them my card, and be like: \u2018Hey, if you want to chat again, please do so and we would welcome you back into this space.\u2019\u201d Geib stressed that she\u2019s not there to police people\u2019s behaviour. \u201cI\u2019m not here to check in and make sure everyone has full consent. That\u2019s not fun and I would not want that job.\u201d So far the position seems to be having an impact, she said. \u201cThe biggest change that we\u2019ve seen is more conversation around consent culture and how to have those conversations normally \u2013 without shame and guilt.\u201d The idea has also faced some backlash: a male caller in a recent radio show suggested that she\u2019s taking all of the fun out of a night out. Geib was quick to correct this view. \u201cPeople are just scared, they\u2019re thinking that all these rules mean no fun,\u201d she said. \u201cBut actually the whole point is that I want people to have more pleasure and connection in their lives.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

In the first week, some upper-caste boys took him aside and asked him about his caste. He told them he was Dalit, considered the lowest caste in Indian society. When he left school for the day, the boys were waiting outside, and flogged him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they did it,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I know is the upper caste likes to torture us. I wanted to give up school \u2013 somehow I didn\u2019t.\u201d Now 22, Chand divides his time between classes in college, working, and teaching English and maths to the Dalit children of his village. He is a volunteer for Bhim Pathshala, a network of free after-school coaching classes for Dalit children run by Bhim Army, an organisation that works for the education and rights of Dalits. Every day, Chand teaches about 20 children between the ages of four and 15 in the courtyard of a temple in Sona village, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, an area that was in the news last year for violent caste riots. When he signed up to be a teacher for Bhim Pathshala two years ago, Chand had to read up on Dalit icons and the history of oppression of his people. The temple where the after-school classes are held is dedicated to Guru Ravidass, a 14th-century poet and saint revered by Dalits; when Chand arrives, the children call out \u201cJai Bhim\u201d, a greeting used by Ambedkarites, followers of Dalit icon and social reformer Bhimrao Ambedkar. He asks the older children about Jyotirao Phule, the 19th-century anti-caste social reformer, and Deepak, 12, replies with easy confidence, \u201cHe fought against the caste system.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m doing this for my community. We have to help each other and knowledge is our only weapon,\u201d says Chand\u2019s friend Siddharth Rajesh Kumar, a college student who also teaches on the project. Bhim Army, which has emerged as a dominant voice in Dalit politics, burst upon the scene in 2015 in Saharanpur in western Uttar Pradesh. The rise of Bhim Army has coincided with the ascent of a new, aggressive form of Dalit politics in India steered by young and dynamic leaders. Bhim Army is led by Chandrashekhar Azad, a young, charismatic Dalit man who achieved notoriety when he put up a signboard outside his village that said \u201cThe Great Chamar\u201d \u2013 Chamar is used as a pejorative term for \u201cuntouchables\u201d \u2013 incensing members of the upper caste. In the last two years, there have been increasing instances of large nationwide protests staged by Dalits. At the same time, cases of violence against the community have increased. As Bhim Army has grabbed national headlines, its education project for children, which involves an estimated 400 pathshalas (schools) running after-school classes across Uttar Pradesh, has been steadily working to bring change. Local community members contribute to the costs of running the after-school classes, and the children are provided with stationery and textbooks. \u201cThey were set up to support Dalit children, most of whom cannot access good education and come from families where parents are illiterate and cannot afford private tuition,\u201d says Vinay Ratan Singh, president of Bhim Army. Bhim Army admits that it is inspired by the right-wing nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which trains its cadre from a young age through a network of schools. Bhim Army hopes the students in these classes will go on to become leaders in their communities and change the situation for Dalits. The pathshalas also tap into the need for mentoring that Dalit children rarely find. Discrimination begins in the classroom, with studies showing Dalit children are segregated and excluded, forcing them to drop out of school. \u201cThe very idea of going to the countryside and telling Dalit families to focus on educating their children is revolutionary,\u201d says Chandra Bhan Prasad, a Dalit writer and entrepreneur who created a temple to the \u201cDalit Goddess of English\u201d, to inspire his community to use education as a form of resistance. Lalita lives in Sona village. Her daughter Ritika never misses a class in the pathshala andsince starting there is doing better in her normal school classes as well. Ritika says that while she feels scared of asking questions to the teachers in school, it is easier to ask Chand, whom she calls bhaiya (older brother). \u201cWe are labourers, but we want her to study and have a different life,\u201d says Lalita.

It was September 1942 in Nazi-occupied Belgium. The young man looked afraid. He did not say a word to her. \u201cHe was sitting at the table like this,\u201d she recalls, hiding her head in her arms. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand anything.\u201d This was her first encounter with Jefkae Harbant, then an 18-year old with a learning disability and no place to call home. He was born in the French-speaking part of Belgium and did not speak a word of Dutch. Neither Maria nor her parents knew any French. Despite the language barrier, Maria\u2019s parents, who were cattle farmers in the Flemish lowlands, had decided to take the young man in. This was not only an act of wartime charity, but came from a centuries-old tradition of stretching out a hand to people on the margins of society. For hundreds of years, residents in the Belgian town of Geel have been giving a home to strangers with severe mental health problems or learning disabilities. This is not a bed for a night or a few weeks. Many boarders stay with the same family for years, often decades. Somehow a tradition from the age of Chaucer has survived and evolved into part of Flanders\u2019 state healthcare system. In 2018, 205 people are Geel boarders, although home care is now only for those with mental health problems, not learning disabilities. In an age that is more aware of the crushing toll of mental illness, the homecare system has made this small town near Antwerp a curiosity. One in four people will experience mental health problems in their lives, according to the well-known World Health Organisation estimate, while a majority say their pain is deepened by stigma. Geel\u2019s model of acceptance and \u201cradical kindness\u201d \u2013 to cite one medical journal \u2013 has stirred interest around the world. Academics and journalists have flocked to the small Flemish town searching for inspiration from an \u201cinnovation\u201d that is 700 years old. Geel traces its boarding tradition to the 13th century, when people with all kinds of illnesses made a pilgrimage to the local Saint Dymphna\u2019s church. According to the brutal legend, Dymphna was an Irish saint who was murdered in the town. Pilgrims travelled many miles to her church in Geel, searching for miracle cures. When there was no more room in the church sick bay, locals gave them a place to stay. The Geel homecare tradition was incorporated into the state in the 19th century, eventually ending under the umbrella of the Psychiatric Care Centre (OPZ). Most boarders have severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or personality disorder. \u201cThey have a long history of disease and referrals. They are not capable of living alone,\u201d says Mieke Celen, a psychiatrist at OPZ, who oversees the matchmaking process between foster families and patients. Foster families are never told the patient\u2019s diagnosis, although they do get warning about behaviour that they might expect: can they live with someone who smokes or walks around the house during the night? Dr Celen says few relationships break down. One study of 17 foster relationships over five years, by the Belgian academics Eugeen Roosens and Lieve Van de Walle, found that only two families dropped out of the programme during the period. Geel\u2019s medical professionals say the system makes a lot of sense. Boarders have better outcomes than patients in hospital: they take less medication and have fewer acute episodes, says Celen. Success means \u201chaving a life as normal as possible\u201d, says Wilfried Bogaerts, an OPZ psychologist. \u201cThe programme is about life. It is not a miracle cure, it is not a magic system, but it is about finding this person the right place to live at the right time. \u201cVery often there is a severe chronic problem that cannot be cured completely, so we try to make the best of it. We accept the limitations but then try to make the life of a boarder as good as possible.\u201d For advocates, Geel\u2019s forte is seeing the person, not a bundle of stigmatised labels straight from a medical textbook. Boarders are given responsibilities in the household, says Bogaerts: \u201cThey take care of the dog, go to the shop, do the dishes \u2026 so patients are needed and wanted.\u201d For some observers, there is not enough evidence that the scheme really works. \u201cThere has been very little evaluation about the impact of this,\u201d says Professor Sir Graham Thornicroft at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIn terms of outcomes for individuals, we don\u2019t know about readmission rates, or satisfaction rates, or quality of life, or things we would normally want to assess for people with long-term needs.\u201d Jefkae Harbant is exceptional, even by the standards of Geel family care. When the Guardian visits, his 94th birthday is only a few days away. A cake has been ordered. Friends invited. There will be a family party. He still remembers the day he arrived on the family farm nearly 76 years ago. \u201cHe was not afraid, but it was difficult for an 18-year-old boy who came to an unknown environment,\u201d recounts his care worker, Michelle Lambrechts, who acts as an interpreter. Maria is now 82 and has lived with Jefkae nearly all her life. When her father died in 1982, she became his foster \u201cmother\u201d, even though she is younger. After decades under the same roof, legal formalities have melted away. He is really a brother, she says, speaking through an interpreter, sitting in the house she has lived in all her life. There was was never a question that he would leave the family. Harbant\u2019s foster father is Maria\u2019s husband, Jules Teunkens, a retired glass-factory worker, now 86. Maria and Jules married in 1957. A 60th wedding anniversary mug bearing their black and white younger selves is sitting on a shelf crowded with bric-a-brac. While her husband worked at the factory, Maria Lenaerts brought up their three children and worked on the family farm. And Jefkae helped, milking the cows and tending vegetables. The family are rarely apart. Although social services offer respite care for holidays, Harbants does not like to stay at the hospital, recounts Lambrechts. \u201cWhen Jefkae went to the ward, he cried a lot. He cries and he cries for hours because he doesn\u2019t want to sit on the ward \u2013 he wants to be at home.\u201d The number of families who take in boarders is in sharp decline, as Geel\u2019s rural, churchgoing traditions fade into the past. More women are working. Fewer people farm the land. The traditional foster family is disappearing. Demand from patients is also falling. People with severe mental health problems no longer face the stark choice of hospital or boarding; many are opting for other kinds of residential care. Geel reached its peak on the eve of the second world war, when 3,736 borders lived in the town. The numbers have been falling ever since and the decline has accelerated in the last two decades: in 2006 there were 46o borders, today 205. Younger families are proving hard to attract. The OPZ thinks the Geel model can survive, but would like the state to increase payments to families from the current maximum of \u20ac600 (\u00a3535) a month. \u201cThe openness of the community is pretty high,\u201d Bogaerts says. \u201cWe should compensate families more so it is more attractive.\u201d Maria Lenaerts would recommend taking in boarders, yet she doubts that the system fits with how people live now. \u201cIt won\u2019t last,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople have a lot of activities and recreation \u2013 they don\u2019t have time.\u201d None of her children or grandchildren have taken in any boarders.

Everyone is welcome. Inside, in a study bathed by the afternoon sunshine, Wael Hussein, a 24-year-old gay man, is chatting with Naya, a transgender woman, ahead of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOTB) on Thursday. Behind the two is a bookcase filled with donated titles, including Les Amantes by French lesbian writer Jocelyne Fran\u00e7ois. \u201cThis is my other home, I consider people here as my family,\u201d says Wael. \u201cMany come to find friends \u2013 outside, they find it difficult to be accepted.\u201d Compared with other countries in the Middle East, such as Iran where homosexuality is punishable by death, Lebanon has a relatively thriving LGBT community. During a recent dinner at Em Nazih, a trendy cafe in Beirut\u2019s Gemmayze district, stereos blared the indie rock band Mashrou\u2019 Leila, whose frontman is Muslim and openly gay. But life is not without its hazards. On Wednesday Hadi Damien, the organiser of Beirut Pride, the only event of its kind in the Arab world, announced the festival had been suspended after authorities interrogated him and threatened him with prosecution. A roster of events that would have featured poetry readings, a storytelling night and a talk on sexual health had been cancelled, he said. For those still facing discrimination, obstruction, and even violence, Helem is a lifeline. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for a year now. I\u2019m alone and I come here to talk to people,\u201d says Suzy, a 41-year-old trans woman with a bruised left eye sitting on the organisation\u2019s balcony. \u201cTwo weeks ago, I was in the disco. Two people riding on a motorbike stopped and punched me in the eye, stole my bag, money and my phone.\u201d Wael joined Helem (which means \u201cdream\u201d in Arabic) two and half years ago as a volunteer before becoming one of only three paid staff seven months ago. He is a case worker, dealing mainly with those who have fallen foul of Lebanon\u2019s infamous article 534, which criminalises \u201cunnatural sexual acts\u201d. In his bag he now carries a mobile phone that serves as a 24-hour emergency hotline. But the work is not all about crises. Wael also runs makeup workshops. \u201cSome people have just found out about their gender identity, and they are intrigued to use makeup to intensify it, like trans women,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes me smile. When they see themselves in the mirror, their eyes start shining and what they can see in the mirror, they feel this person looks much more like the way they see themselves.\u201d Helem was set up as an underground movement nearly 20 years ago and, despite never having received official registration by the authorities, has clung to life. The authorities neither rejected nor approved the request, said Genwa Samhat, Helem\u2019s executive director, in a sign that meant \u201c\u2018we won\u2019t reject you but we will make your work really hard that you\u2019d eventually stop\u2019. But on the contrary we just kept on working.\u201d Since then Helem\u2019s reputation has spread beyond Lebanon throughout the Arab world and several similar organisations have been set up, including the NGO Shams in Tunisia, fighting for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Afsaneh Rigot of British human rights group Article 19 said Helem was \u201can important and necessary LGBTQ oasis in the Middle East and North Africa region\u201d and \u201ca refuge for some of the most marginalised people in Lebanon\u201d. But progress has not been straightforward. When Samhat, 31, joined four years ago, the organisation was almost moribund. Her arrival coincided with a Lebanese security forces raid on a local bathhouse, the Hammam al-Agha, which resulted in the arrests of 36 people. \u201cWhen I joined, it was a trial to see if things would work again or not. Helem had lost its community centre, its offices, all of its funds. It had zero dollars in its bank account,\u201d says Samhat. \u201cIt felt impossible at one point to get this going again, but with the Hammam Agha raid it was my first incident with such an arrest file \u2026 and it was a major push to try to do something about it.\u201d Most of the people rounded up in the raid were sent to the Hbeish detention centre, and Helem\u2019s ensuing work highlighted torture there. Such physical mistreatment appears now to have stopped. Today, at least 17 people are detained in Hbeish, mostly transgender people. \u201cTrans people face the most discrimination \u2013 they\u2019re visible,\u201d Samhat said. \u201cThey were mostly arresting trans women who never ever got the opportunity to find a job, who were kicked out of their family houses, they were homeless for a long period of time, who actually dropped out of school because they were bullied at some point. We believe in personal freedoms and if people choose to be sex workers, it\u2019s their right and we will defend them, but we do have to realise a lot of people do it out of survival reasons.\u201d Naya, 21, heads Helem\u2019s seven-member trans committee and says it is serving as an umbrella that makes people like her \u201cfeel stronger and let us make things we couldn\u2019t do before \u2013 like offering hormones\u201d. The organisation also provides more essential help. Aside from the study, there are places to sleep, a bathroom and a kitchen with basic appliances \u2013 a fridge, a gas stove and a washing machine. Its sister organisation, the sexual health clinic Marsa, provides free HIV tests, and charges $100 (\u00a374) for comprehensive screening including for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Nearly 260 people visit Marsa each month \u2013 of whom two or three on average test positive for HIV. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t seek medical assistance, because they can\u2019t tell doctors [about their sexual orientation]. If they look effeminate, they\u2019d get humiliated, kicked out of hospital,\u201d says Diana Abou Abbas, 36, who runs Marsa. \u201cMarsa is a safe place, free of judgment and discrimination, people can talk about their practices without worrying that they would be judged.\u201d Back at Helem, Joseph Aoun, 33, is busy working on Helem\u2019s campaigning week before IDAHOTB. He used to be the manager of Bardo, Beirut\u2019s most famous gay bar, before joining Helem, an experience he says has opened his eyes to the discrimination faced by those from deprived social backgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant struggle against the odds,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a lot of frustration but when you look back you see you\u2019re impacting people\u2019s lives and this is beautiful.\u201d This year, IDAHOTB coincides with Ramadan, and Dana Darwish, a transgender lesbian, plans to go to Helem for iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily fast during the holy month. \u201cIslam is the religion of peace,\u201d said the 31-year-old. \u201cHelem makes iftar every week and it\u2019s a wonderful feeling that this year Ramadan falls on the same day as IDAHOTB.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Sun terraces and lawns: Dutch residents transform parking spaces", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/sun-terraces-and-lawns-dutch-residents-transform-parking-spaces", "date": "2018-05-17", "transcript": "It seems a straightforward offer: swap your resident\u2019s parking permit for a bit of greenery in the freed-up space, a lawn, a sun terrace or somewhere for the children to play. However, if any further proof was needed of the west\u2019s destructive love affair with the car, the furious reaction to a pilot project in one of the Netherlands\u2019 biggest cities has been all too telling. Streets have been divided, angry complaints made and Walter Dresscher, the organiser of the council-backed scheme in The Hague, given what he admits was a verbal going-over during a fiery public meeting. However, Dresscher\u2019s determination remains undimmed: \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. This has been a great success already because people are thinking.\u201d The drama was sparked by the Dutch municipality\u2019s proposal to residents in six streets in Segbroek, a suburb in the west of the city, to voluntarily swap their parking permit for six months and replace it with something green and pleasant on their street. Their vehicles would be stored in a car park for free, and those participating could choose between themselves how to use the vacant space. The long-term aim, beyond greening the city, is to encourage people to use car-sharing schemes, if they really need a vehicle, or switch to public transport and bicycles. Globally, most cars are said to be parked 95% of the time. Dresscher, an architect by training, said opposition from many residents in the selected areas illustrated how deeply people were attached to their cars, even in the Netherlands, which is often a pioneer in terms of green transportation. The idea of a parking space being lost from a street was too much for some to bear. \u201cI was a bit like a boxing guy, I took everything,\u201d he said of the public meeting attended by 200 residents. \u201cIf I was to respond, like I would in a personal conversation, the meeting would not have finished very well ... Everybody took \u2013 and this in the Netherlands is more rare than in other countries \u2013 very opposite positions. Normally, we are a country where we have a dialogue, we talk to each other. \u201cThe idea was to get people together but it didn\u2019t. Why? If there is one that is very angry and starts mobilising the whole street then you have a problem. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to participate, don\u2019t participate. But physically a car is getting out of the street. Nobody is losing anything.\u201d Dresscher insisted the initial hostility has abated but, as yet, only six householders have signed up to the scheme, with their cars due to be removed in June. Two residents have, however, pre-empted the scheme by putting flower-filled tow-carts in front of their homes, much to the irritation of some. Drivers have been known to shout abuse as they drive by. Dresscher, who has \u20ac60,000 of funding from the council and charities, is still confident that more people will come round to his thinking, and is glad that a debate has been started. Rembrant Frerichs, 40, and, Wolfert Brederode, 44, both pianists, and neighbours on Newtonstreet, said they believed it was an important first step in changing the nature of their road, but were yet to decide how to use the space in front of their homes. Brederode said: \u201cI just don\u2019t think I need the car outside my house all the time and I\u2019m going to see if we need it at all. I don\u2019t think there is any reason. \u201cPeople have this belief that they have a right to have a car, a right to have a parking space. A car is like a second home to people but it isn\u2019t rational.\u201d Dresscher said the project had been inspired by the experience of being forced to push his baby\u2019s pram on the road when living in Amsterdam because cars were blocking the pavement. \u201cI looked at these cars and there were actually plants growing under them. They hadn\u2019t moved for three or four weeks. I started thinking: does anyone know how many cars are used or not?\u201d Dresscher\u2019s response from the Amsterdam municipality suggested that 25% of those cars used by residents were only driven once a week on average. Around 60% used their cars less due to fears that they would lose their parking place. \u201cThis is a completely ridiculous situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to get rid of unused cars. The municipalities of Netherlands cannot keep going like this. One day they will come and take away that right, I am sure about that. But this is chance for people to change their behaviour themselves.\u201d A spokesman for The Hague municipality said: \u201cPeople get the opportunity to choose themselves what they want to do with the public space. They can park their cars in the street or start sharing cars and fill up the free parking spots for other purposes like green, bicycle parking or picnic tables. \u201cWe want to see the effect of this approach. Will this bottom-up approach work, where people get a direct effect of their choice to get rid of their car, or is it still necessary to make top-down policy to manage the amount of parked cars in public spaces? It\u2019s a project that, when it succeeds, can easily be scaled up to other streets and neighbourhoods. We think that\u2019s why this pilot is worth funding.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

But the teenager had a secret dream, which he confided to a teacher. One day he would tell his story, challenging those who saw his family only as refugees, defined by the war they had survived. Eight months later, he became a published author. His book, Homes: A Refugee Story, is set to be officially released on Saturday 12 May by a Calgary book publisher, after being self-published last year. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, to be honest,\u201d says Abu Bakr, 17. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d The book captures his experience of growing up in the Middle East. He was nine when his family moved from Iraq to Syria to escape escalating tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims. A year later civil war broke out in Syria, punctuating memories of being surrounded by family and playing video games with the horror of car bombings, attacks on schools and late-night explosions. \u201cI really want people to know about what\u2019s happening back home,\u201d says Abu Bakr. \u201cNot just about the war, we also had some good times with family and friends. Even in the hard times we had some good memories.\u201d He wrote the book with Winnie Yeung, the schoolteacher with whom he first shared his dream. Initially they planned a short presentation for his peers. \u201cI could tell he was feeling quite alienated,\u201d says Yeung. \u201cHe was saying that his fellow classmates really had no idea where Syria is, or what\u2019s going on in the Middle East. They were asking him: \u2018Do you have chairs in classrooms there?\u2019\u201d With permission from his parents, the pair got to work. Using the few English words he knew at the time, he began sharing all he could remember of his childhood. Yeung soon realised that their project was bigger than a class presentation. \u201cI wanted to write it out as a story, so that I could put it in his hands and say: \u2018This is your life, you can move on from this,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThis is part of a really important past and you should be proud for living this life and living it so well.\u201d During lunch hours and after lessons, Yeung would frantically scribble notes as Abu Bakr recounted his childhood. Struggling to navigate the language barrier between them, they got creative. \u201cThere was a lot of charades and pantomiming,\u201d says Yeung. \u201cI got a lot of things wrong, we misunderstood each other quite a bit. It took so long to get the stories right.\u201d Google Translate became their go-to app. They looked up events on YouTube and news websites, transporting Abu Bakr back to the streets of Homs through Google Earth\u2019s street view. The two spent hours browsing through mobile phone photos, selfies and online images, trying to identify key details. \u201cEspecially with the weaponry, Abu Bakr didn\u2019t know the English words, or even the Arabic,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we would look at a bunch of different images online and then he would go: \u2018This one.\u2019 And I would learn what it\u2019s called.\u201d Yeung, who learned \u201cthe most basic\u201d Arabic, also spent hours interviewing his family in order to contextualise his experience. Born and raised in Edmonton, the project became a crash course for her in conflict. \u201cI barely even watch war movies,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of my late-night internet research would be: OK, how do soldiers carry the AK-47? What are the parts of that weapon? I found myself reading army field manuals.\u201d At times the stories pouring out of Abu Bakr, a young man with an easy smile and warm laugh, left her in shock. The horrors of war were woven into the fabric of his childhood memories: flying homemade kites amid the rubble of destroyed buildings, playing with bullet casings he found on the street. \u201cIt was so matter of fact for him, so normal.\u201d His story, she realised, was not just one of living through a war, but also of the deep bonds that sustained his family through their turbulent journey. For Abu Bakr, the book became an anchor as he worked to find his place in his new home, helping him improve his English and meet residents from across the city. He hopes the book will help keep attention on the crisis unfolding in the Middle East, offering a glimpse into the personal experience of one refugee at a time when the number of people fleeing war and persecution around the globe has reached record highs. \u201cI really hope people will read my story and enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope they will get the main idea of it \u2013 how hard it is leaving home and how hard it is to live in a civil war.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

As global temperatures continue to rise, people around the globe will have to figure out how to manage with less water. This week we looked at how one city united to tackle its water crisis, and found other tales of people coming together and turning around bleak situations. When Cape Town announced it was rapidly approaching \u201cDay Zero\u201d, the moment it would turn off the water supply to a million homes due to drought, the news made headlines around the world. Four months on and the taps are still on \u2013 for now. Krista Mahr visited South Africa\u2019s second city to find out how they did it, and what lessons can be learned by cities facing up to similar emergencies. There\u2019s certainly no shortage of rain in the north of England, but austerity has taken a toll on community spirit there and villages and towns have fallen into disrepair. In Todmorden, residents got their hands dirty and found a solution. Naomi Larsson visited the tiny Yorkshire town from which a global movement has grown. In nearby Sheffield, Kate Lyons met some people tackling the taboo of adults with few friend when you\u2019re an adult.

What we liked: Two great pieces in the New York Times caught our eye, the first on the rocks in Oman that could help save the planet, and the second on news that humpback whales near Antartica are having a baby boom. What we heard: My local community got permission to turn disused land surrounded by houses into a community garden. It started off very basic, with just some raised planting beds growing some veg. We\u2019ve now got a poly tunnel, a brick pizza oven and barbecue and another bit of land just around the corner which we\u2019ve planted as an apple and pear orchard. We get the local primary schools involved, and the local care home too. We grow far more food than we can eat ourselves so we hold public open days and donate excess to the local community centre, who distribute it to those who need it. Commenter Cade writing below the line on our piece about guerilla gardening It\u2019s fantastic that they averted this, but surely one of the takeaways is that people are capable of living with less and moderating their habits if they understand the consequences \u2013 or if the consequences are severe enough. From golf courses in the middle of the desert in Phoenix to people watering their lawns at noon in Los Angeles to growing water-thirsty crops like alfalfa \u2013 why do we need to wait to start behaving more sensibly?

Only the birdsong and a few daffodils give the sign of spring. This doesn\u2019t seem to bother a group of 20 volunteers from the Yorkshire town who have gathered together armed with spades, trowels and litter pickers. Instructions of which patch to attack are distributed, while children as young as three are given high-vis jackets with the name Incredible Edible printed on the back. These are Todmorden\u2019s radical gardeners, a group of food freedom fighters who\u2019ve been planting in this town for a decade. It\u2019s a simple idea: take over unused or unattractive bits of public land to plant food to feed the community. What is not so simple is where they\u2019re doing it. Todmorden is an old mill town in Yorkshire\u2019s Calderdale valley. It rains a lot, there\u2019s not a lot of sun, and it has experienced major flooding in recent years. But still, the town\u2019s residents continue to grow fruit and vegetables as best they can for locals to pick and eat. \u201cWe do say that if you can grow it in Todmorden, you can grow it anywhere,\u201d says Estelle Brown, one of the founding members of Incredible Edible Todmorden (IET). This motto has turned out to be true beyond just growing food. Since a group of a dozen residents began gardening in March 2008, hundreds of people from around the UK and abroad have travelled here to see how the \u201cToddies\u201d do it. The word spread through media coverage and IET committee members touring to give talks. They\u2019ve had calls and visitors from New Zealand and Japan, to France and Germany, and there are now as many as 500 community food growing groups across the world using the Incredible Edible name. No one is trying to clone what Todmorden does but the model is adapted to suit different needs. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing it for your community it\u2019s got to be for your community,\u201d says Brown. In Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the group supports farmers and street children, helping them get documentation and educating them about food. \u201cFood autonomy and eating organically, that\u2019s what inspired us,\u201d Addico Charly of Incredible Edible Kinshasa writes by email. In France, the movement has taken root as Les Incroyables Comestibles, with 300 groups around the country. There are sister groups in Israel, Palestine, Colombia and Brazil \u2013 all growing food to share with others. The Toddies didn\u2019t set out to start a food-growing revolution, they wanted to bring their small town together at a difficult time for communities throughout the UK. \u201cTen years ago it was the beginning of the worldwide economic decline, there was a lot of worry about climate change, but nothing was really happening,\u201d says Mary Clear, chair of IET. \u201cAnd in this town we were starting to see the squeeze on public services \u2013 there was more litter \u2013 and we thought, how can we do something that will create stronger communities?\u201d Growing food was their answer. Clear, now 63 and retired, who previously worked in child protection, lowered one of the walls in her front garden, removing rose bushes to make a bed with herbs and signs saying \u201chelp yourself\u201d. The group then turned their minds to the grass verges which seemed to only attract dog poo, and turned them into herb gardens too. IET now has approximately 70 sites around the town, from vegetable patches outside the police station to herb planters at the train station. Every first and third Sunday of the month, in rain, shine or snow, IET volunteers (of which there are an estimated 300 in the town of 16,000) get together for a morning of \u201cguerilla gardening\u201d as it has been dubbed. We walk down the canal, following children carrying litter pickers. Every so often they pause to pick up cigarette butts or chocolate wrappers. Incredible Edible is driven by the attitude that it\u2019s easier to ask forgiveness than permission. Any IET signs nailed to walls around town were done without permission from the council, benches emblazoned with their logo were installed without asking. Even the beds outside the police station were put together and maintained without formal permission. \u201cYou can do nothing and obey the rules, or you can say \u2018I\u2019m going to make a difference regardless\u2019. And, you know, the prisons are full. They\u2019ve got enough on without getting a load of grannies for cleaning up,\u201d says Clear. The Incredible Edibles say they\u2019re inspired by Todmorden\u2019s own history of activism. It was home to John Fielden who campaigned for the protection of child workers leading to the Ten Hour Act of 1847, reducing the hours for factory workers. \u201cTodmorden is a unique place,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWe call it \u2018Odmorden\u2019 as we\u2019re all a bit odd.\u201d Todmorden is still scarred by the memory of its declining industrial past. Buildings lie abandoned and decayed, almost 20% of residents are income deprived, and an estimated 28% of children in the town live in poverty. IET aims to be inclusive for people of all backgrounds. IET has brought an influx of people to the town. It\u2019s perhaps the only place known for vegetable tourism. But local businesses are doing better as a result: a 2017 survey of residents found more than half of respondents (54%) buy local food at least once a week, compared with 41% of consumers across the UK. A 2013 study also found 57% had begun to grow their own food due to IET. But not everyone is happy with the work they have done. Talk in the local pub suggested it\u2019s seen as a sign of outsiders coming in and changing something that isn\u2019t theirs. In a survey of residents last year, some expressed concerns about gentrification and IET increasing the desirability of Todmorden. Volunteer John Rice, 53, has only been living in Todmorden for a few months. \u201cThere\u2019s a few people here today who\u2019ve got no money whatsoever, and they get stuff out of it. They enjoy it. I didn\u2019t know poverty like that existed but it does, and it\u2019s good for them, they feel like they belong to something. As I do, you belong to this movement.\u201d Three volunteers with learning disabilities are sweeping up \u2013 they say they come to every gardening Sunday no matter what the weather. \u201cIt gets me out the house,\u201d Stephen tells me. \u201cThey are nice people, and I like gardening.\u201d Gardening done for the morning, we meet back at the church before lunch is served \u2013 locally sourced and free for anyone to eat. \u201cThings have changed hugely in the past decade,\u201d says Clear, her fingers still dirtied with soil. \u201cBut the real culture change is about kindness. There\u2019s no need to be a victim in this trumped up shitty time. People doing stuff for each other, for their town, bringing a tiny bit of joy \u2013 that\u2019s important. With each person contributing a tiny bit, you can do huge things.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The ultimate goal for these players isn\u2019t a trophy, however, but getting off the streets. The girls who will play in Moscow are doing this as a step towards changing their lives, which have been marked so far by school exclusion, deprivation and in some cases homelessness. The tournament, which starts on Fridaywill involve more than 230 homeless and street-connected youth from 20 countries. \u201cWhich team do I most want to meet? For me, it\u2019s the Russians, because it\u2019s their country and I want to see what it\u2019s like,\u201d says Kate, 16, who will play in midfield for the team, organised by homelessness charity Centrepoint. Like most of her teammates, Kate is a few weeks into Centrepoint Street Football Team England, a six-month programme to help socially excluded young people. She has not experienced homelessness herself, but was drifting without direction after being excluded five times from school. \u201cIt has really helped me, to focus on the football,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want them to meet young people from around the world and get some knowledge of others\u2019 situations, but we also want them to think about themselves: how did I get here, what have I overcome to be here? And to come home with some skills and inspiration from taking part in an international event,\u201d says Jack Badu, sports operations and engagement officer at Centrepoint, who will take the girls to the tournament, called the Street Child World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s about aspiration.\u201d Centrepoint partners with professional football clubs to support marginalised young people in its England squad and give them the chance to compete in international tournaments across the globe. The Street Child World Cup, held ahead of the FIFA World Cup, is one of four such tournaments; another is this year\u2019s Homeless World Cup in Mexico. The girls will be competing against teams from countries including Brazil, India, Mauritius, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Zimbabwe. None of the squad of 42 have been been chosen solely due to their skills on the pitch, but because all of them have been participating in social inclusion programmes and proved their willingness to change their lives. Like Kate, Verona, 17, had been excluded from school several times before joining a college run by Arsenal FC that partners with Centrepoint. \u201cI didn\u2019t get along with my teachers and was always having arguments,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s only when I started going to Arsenal college that everything started to go uphill. This is an opportunity I couldn\u2019t have imagined taking two or three years ago. At school all the teachers see you as just another person to tell off. Here, you\u2019re an individual. \u201cI have always played football, ever since I was nine or 10. I prefer to go to the Arsenal college and come here to train than just sit at home doing homework.\u201d She hopes to be a physiotherapist when she is older. Over the six-month training period, the girls willtrain regularly at St George\u2019s Park, home of the Football Association. At their most recent session, they were given the shirts they will wear in Russia. It was a proud moment, says Kate, who follows the England national women\u2019s team and wants to work in the sport. They have also trained with Afghan footballer Khalida Popal, who fled the Taliban \u201cbecause they told her it was a man\u2019s sport and she couldn\u2019t play, but she played for her country,\u201d says Kate. In addition to helping develop their resilience, the girls\u2019 Russian adventure has another dimension, says Badu: \u201cWe hope they will think about the issues that other young people face \u2026 that they\u2019ll tell young people in Africa and elsewhere there are young people in the UK who care about them. From feeling that \u2018no one supports me\u2019, they\u2019ll go to feeling they are part of a large community of young people from all over the world supporting each other.\u201d The girls will return to London with \u00a310,000 from the Vitol Foundation to effect social change in their communities. The team think they may spend it on a project to tackle knife violence or spaces for excluded young people to play sport amid cuts to youth services and rising youth homelessness. After the six-month development programme ends, Centrepoint will work to find them further opportunities such as coaching and mentoring. All the girls can take part in a player progression programme that involves mentoring next year\u2019s England squad. Given British-Russian tensions in recent weeks, aren\u2019t they a bit nervous? \u201cWe\u2019ll take it all in our stride,\u201d says Badu. \u201cThere is a lot of scaremongering but I think it\u2019s great that the Russians want to support this tournament for street children.\u201d \u201cI am excited and nervous,\u201d says Verona, \u201cbut nervous in a good way.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Or at least she has no friends in Sheffield, where she moved nine months ago. She had spent the previous decade teaching in Cambridge but last July she and her husband moved north. And while Sheffield has provided a great job and an affordable home, one thing the notoriously friendly city has not provided is mates. \u201cNo one talks about the process of making friends at our age,\u201d she says. Olivia has tried. She bonded with someone in her Zumba class, but weeks later the woman got a job in another city. Her job has not helped. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people in my stage of life at work, and anyway, as a teacher you spend the whole day in a classroom full of teenagers.\u201d And so Olivia is taking a proactive step \u2013 she is going speed mating. Billed as \u201cTinder for friends, but in real life\u201d the initiative is the brainchild of Megan Griffith, co-founder of the arts collective Girl Gang. The Sheffield event is held at the Leadmill nightclub. About 40 people turn up, almost all of them women (men are welcome, says Griffith, but need to know they will be in the minority). They range in age from early 20s to mid 40s. On arrival everyone is given a sheet with spaces for names, email addresses and phone numbers. Olivia\u2019s original goal for the evening was to get one person\u2019s number. \u201cBut then I thought, maybe that\u2019s unrealistic so I\u2019ve lowered my expectations. I\u2019ve just got to see it as having a fun evening, and even if it goes badly, at least it\u2019ll make a good story in the staff room.\u201d The \u201cSpeed Mate-ing\u201d event begins with \u201cperson bingo\u201d, then people pair up and ask quick-fire questions for five minutes. Next they pair up with someone else to ask \u201cwould you rather?\u201d questions, and a third person for \u201csnog, marry avoid\u201d. Kerry Chase and Aim\u00e9e White are paired up and quickly move on from talking about the suggested questions to chatting about White\u2019s time living in Serbia. A newcomer to Sheffield, White bemoans how tricky it is to make friends as an adult. \u201cIt\u2019s not like when you\u2019re a kid,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say: \u2018Let\u2019s go play\u2019. It\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m not being creepy, but I just want a friend.\u2019 Yeah, that\u2019s creepy.\u201d For several hours people chat, debate current affairs in small groups, make outfits out of newspaper and participate in various \u201corganised fun\u201d activities, all the time sussing each other out as potential friend material. After the first event in Manchester in October 2016, Girl Gang has run a dozen speed mating nights across Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, and has had requests to start them up everywhere from York to Leamington Spa. However, they often sell more tickets than they have guests. Griffith says: \u201cThey\u2019ve obviously booked a ticket thinking \u2018I would really benefit from this event\u2019, but then when it comes down to it, they can\u2019t quite make themselves go.\u201d Still, she thinks the event\u2019s appeal comes from the fact that admitting to having no friends is taboo, so activities do not exist to help people build friendships. \u201cI think romantic relationships get given a lot of airtime in society and friendship less so,\u201d says Griffiths. \u201cThere are structures in place to meet somebody [romantically] ... which don\u2019t seem to exist so much for friends.\u201d A 2013 analysis of 277 peer-reviewed studies on social relationships found that the size of people\u2019s friendship networks increased until young adulthood and then decreased steadily from that point, suggesting that making friends becomes, if not more difficult, then at least less common. This could be for many reasons, such as family, jobs and time, according to Rachel Boyd of the mental health charity Mind. \u201cFriendship groups can become more established, so it can feel even harder to meet new people if they already have their own groups of friends.\u201d Moving home can represents a particular challenge. \u201cCertainly it can be really difficult if you\u2019re in unfamiliar territory to know how to meet people,\u201d Boyd says. The Jo Cox commission on loneliness found that 9 million Britons always or often feel lonely, largely due to the weakening of traditional community spaces, such as churches, trade unions, pubs and workplaces. \u201cIn the last few decades, loneliness has escalated from personal misfortune into a social epidemic,\u201d the Labour MP and commission chair, Rachel Reeves, said in a speech in December. \u201cMore and more of us live alone. We work at home more. We spend a greater part of our day alone than we did 10 years ago. It sometimes feels like our best friend is the smartphone.\u201d However, technology, while often being blamed for social disconnection and isolation, may also form part of the solution. Bumble, the dating app known for not allowing men to contact women first, launched Bumble BFF in 2015, allowing people to find potential friends, after users said they wanted to use the origninal app for that purpose. \u201cWithin six months [of launching Bumble], women in relationships or even people who had met someone on Bumble came to us and said: \u2018I am moving across state or going to university and I don\u2019t know anyone in that city. I don\u2019t know anyone in that area ... you guys should think about launching something,\u2019\u201d says Louise Troen, international brand director for Bumble. But using an app or going to an event like speed mating to find friends is not without its stigma. Olivia is a pseudonym because she knows that if she used her real name and her students read this article \u201cbasically they would take the mick out of me\u201d. When she told people she was going to a speed mating event, reactions were mixed. \u201cI made a real effort to be vulnerable, so I told a few people I was doing this. Some people thought it was a bit weird, some people thought it was a great idea, others thought it was sad that I didn\u2019t have friends, but then they offered to be friends with me,\u201d she says, laughing. After the event, Olivia says she is exhausted: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so full-on.\u201d \u201cI felt like there were two groups \u2013 people who had gone with someone and were maybe approaching it as a fun chance to meet people, and people who I thought were in a similar position to me. \u201cIt\u2019s also just reassuring to know I\u2019m not the only person to feel like this. It\u2019s not sad and it\u2019s not pathetic, being 29 and not having friends in a new city.\u201d Olivia has exceeded her goal for the evening, collecting three people\u2019s numbers. The next day, she says she has been exchanging banter-filled texts and organised to go for a drink with one woman she met. A week later, she has had an offer to go to a comedy gig with a group, and a drink with someone else. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely been a success,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other thing I\u2019ve found is I\u2019m more confident approaching people and suggesting meeting up. I think it\u2019s given me a bit of a boost.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "How Cape Town was saved from running out of water", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/04/back-from-the-brink-how-cape-town-cracked-its-water-crisis", "date": "2018-05-04", "transcript": "Late last year, as the South African government faced the prospect of its largest city running out of water, they took an unprecedented gamble. The government announced \u201cday zero\u201d \u2013 a moment when dam levels would be so low that they would turn off the taps in Cape Town and send people to communal water collection points. This apocalyptic notion prompted water stockpiling and panic, caused a drop in tourism bookings, and raised the spectre of civil unrest. It also worked. After years of trying to convince residents to conserve, the aggressive campaign jolted people into action. Water use was (and still is) restricted to 50 litres per person per day. (In 2016, average daily per capita use in California was 321 litres.) Households that exceed the limit face hefty fines, or having a meter installed in their home that shuts off their water once they go over. Capetonians started showering standing over buckets to catch and re-use that water, recycling washing machine water, and limiting loo flushes to once a day. \u201cIt was the most talked about thing in Cape Town for months when it needed to be,\u201d says Priya Reddy, the city\u2019s communication director. \u201cIt was not a pretty solution, but it was not a pretty problem.\u201d Cape Town\u2019s water use dropped from 600m litres per day in mid 2017 to 507m litres per day at the end of April. That\u2019s still short of the 450m the city should be using, but Reddy says it couldn\u2019t have been achieved otherwise. \u201cWe really did need to make it alarming enough, otherwise day zero would have happened.\u201d \u201cThe day zero campaign made us all think twice about water,\u201d says Sue Fox, after collecting several litres of drinking water for her household from a natural spring in Newlands, an upmarket Cape Town enclave. \u201cWe\u2019ll never, ever, ever take water for granted again.\u201d As global temperatures continue to rise, cities around the world will have to figure out how to do more with less water. The Western Cape\u2019s multi-pronged response to its water crisis \u2013 from farming innovations to reducing urban water use to diversifying water supply sources \u2013 could serve as a blueprint for cities that find themselves, like Cape Town, looking at near-empty dams. \u201cWe have pushed the limits far more than most other cities,\u201d says Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson, who is in charge of the city\u2019s water crisis response. \u201cMillions of people have responded \u2013 literally millions.\u201d But it\u2019s not all positive stories of innovation, responsibility and altruism. Farmers in the drought-affected area have had to abandon as much as a quarter of their crops, by some estimates, and tens of thousands of agricultural jobs have been lost in the fray. \u201cThis is the one that makes me the most depressed,\u201d says Derick van Zyl pointing to a long row of parched trees in his apple orchard. These trees on the Esperanto Farm produce Pink Lady apples, a coveted variety exported thousands of miles to the UK and Europe. They haven\u2019t been watered in months. Esperanto is one of hundreds of fruit farms in South Africa\u2019s Western Cape province that has had to get creative to cope with the drought. Despite Esperanto\u2019s dams being at 28% capacity as of last October, most of its orchards have been luckier than these bedraggled Pink Ladys, thanks to water-saving hacks like night-time irrigation, mulching and concentrating water around the trees\u2019 roots systems. Production is down, but not as much as it could be. Finding ways to farm with less water is the new normal, Van Zyl says. Even if the Western Cape\u2019s drought ends with the upcoming rainy season \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if \u2013 climate change means warmer temperatures are on the way, he says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be more water. We\u2019ll have to make do with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d The combination of measures appears to have averted water armageddon - for now. The City has pushed back the day zero date to 2019. The move met with a heady mix of relief and exasperation. People wondered whether it had been a hoax, or an attempt for the city to make money off higher water fines. The city has also faced criticism that it allowed political turmoil within City Hall \u2013 Mayor Patricia De Lille has been under fire for months \u2013 to slow down its response to the water crisis. Neilson, the deputy mayor, says the decision to call off day zero came down to transparency. \u201cIt was about being honest with the public,\u201d Neilson says. \u201cPeople would quickly call us out if we didn\u2019t tell the truth. Our credibility would be lost.\u201d Now the city is charged with the onerous task of making sure residents don\u2019t slip back into their old habits. Though day zero is out of the immediate picture, the major dams that supply water to the Western Cape are still only about 20% full. If the rains don\u2019t show up during the South African winter, day zero could still happen. By then, however, the city hopes to boost the city\u2019s water supply through methods that don\u2019t rely on rainfall, like repairing water delivery infrastructure, drilling boreholes to access groundwater, desalination, and water re-use. A lot of ideas about how to bring more water to Cape Town have come past Neilson\u2019s desk, including cloud seeding, harvesting water from the air and even towing a 100-million-tonne iceberg from Antarctica. \u201cWhen somebody first tells you about it, you think it\u2019s a crazy idea,\u201d says Nick Sloane, a ship salvager who has been pitching the idea of the iceberg plan. \u201cBut the more you learn about it, it\u2019s like, \u2018Why not?\u201d Just telling an entire city no one can ever take a bath again, Sloane says, is the \u201cwrong answer.\u201d Others would like to see the city look for long-term solutions closer to home. Christine Colvin, a water expert with the World Wildlife Fund, has been pushing the government to eliminate thirsty invasive species like pine, eucalyptus and wattle, which deplete dam reserves. By clearing non-native plants that are sucking up 38 million cubic metres of precious water each year, Colvin says Cape Town could be getting 7% more water annually. WWF has been saying this for awhile, but when the dams were full, nobody was listening. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a case for it,\u201d Colvin says. \u201cNow, our dams are running dry.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

But for one group working towards building a vast, open, global register of who owns what, it was just the beginning. Open Ownership was created in late 2016 by seven anti-corruption organisations. Although it is small and not-for-profit, it has large ambitions: it wants to open up the murky world of offshore havens to scrutiny, so that individuals can no longer hide ill-gotten wealth behind inscrutable facades of clandestine jurisdictions. \u201cEvery jurisdiction that commits to openly publishing beneficial ownership information brings us closer to our goal of creating a truly global, open register,\u201d said Zosia Sztykowski, Open Ownership\u2019s project lead. \u201cThe more data we can link, the fewer places there are left for money launderers to hide.\u201d There can be legitimate reasons to use offshore jurisdictions. But kleptocracy \u2013 egregious and globalised grand corruption \u2013 is enabled by anonymous companies, which strip the fingerprints off stolen money and, having done so, hide it under the cover of supposedly respectable corporations. Once all traces of the money\u2019s origin have been removed, the thieves can spend it on New York property, European passports or western politicians, and they do it in vast quantities. Global Financial Integrity estimates illicit financial flows were well over $1.1tn in 2013, and the total is growing fast. Many of these companies came from the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla and the other pink dots left on the map of the world, which is why Tuesday\u2019s vote in parliament was so celebrated. But in order for openness to become truly useful, Sztykowski says, data needs to be pooled so that investigators \u2013 police, journalists, anti-fraud teams \u2013 can literally follow the money across borders. If an individual has hidden his ownership of an asset behind a chain of companies, each registered in a different country, then officers require cooperation from counterparts all over the world just to discover who owns something. Often this takes so long that the criminal has escaped before the task can be completed; other times, the information can\u2019t be obtained at all. \u201cOur intention is not just to open up the data, to make it accessible, but also to make it usable and used,\u201d said Sztykowski. Her team (which is funded by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development) has created a standardised format for registries to follow so that when they do publish ownership data they will be consistent with each other, and their data can be automatically compared with information that is already public. So far only a handful of countries are properly on board. The UK, Denmark, Slovakia and Ukraine have already implemented beneficial ownership, though Denmark is not yet integrated with the Open Ownership system. In addition, members of the European Union, as well as a handful of countries elsewhere, have promised to join up. The hope is that British overseas territories will be forced to follow suit by 2020. By having one central database, Open Ownership hopes the data will be searchable, creating something greater than the sum of the parts. \u201cI am always hesitant to talk about a magic bullet for a problem as huge as kleptocracy and corruption, but we know that shell companies are used en masse in grand corruption cases,\u201d said Nienke Palstra, a researcher from Global Witness who specialises in cracking open anonymous companies. \u201cNo doubt as they become more transparent there will be new innovative ways that kleptocrats and others find to launder their money, but it would be a huge step towards addressing that problem. \u201cHaving a global beneficial ownership registry where all countries make public the beneficial ownership of companies in their jurisdiction, that would be a massive improvement and a big step towards solving the problem of shell companies and money laundering.\u201d Data about Danish companies will be added to the Open Ownership database next, followed by the ownership information for companies that have bid for high-value World Bank contracts, and information from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a group of countries committed to improving governance in the resources sector. Sztykowski said she was in talks with authorities in Nigeria, Kyrgyzstan and other countries, which is all very well, but still means that \u2013 Britain apart - the registry lacked any of the really important global databases. This is why parliament\u2019s decision to force Britain\u2019s remaining colonies to adopt corporate transparency is so significant. Companies from the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Anguilla, Gibraltar and Bermuda have been involved in some of the most egregious corporate profit shifting, tax-dodging and money-laundering schemes ever discovered, and now those companies\u2019 owners will be visible to everyone. With these registries added to those of the UK and the other European countries, we will begin to approach a time when, if real-life McMafia villains slip their billions from country to country to evade detection, we will be able to follow them. The addition of the 400,000 companies from the British Virgin Islands alone could be a revelation of greater consequence than even the Panama Papers, to which can be added the secrets of Gibraltar, Cayman, Anguilla and elsewhere. Of course, dozens of jurisdictions will still sell secrecy \u2013 Delaware, Panama, Nevis, the Seychelles, etc \u2013 but the more that do join Open Ownership\u2019s database, the more abnormal the holdouts will appear. \u201cWe want to see a world where anonymous company ownership just doesn\u2019t exist anymore, where it\u2019s completely normal for anyone to be able to access ownership information, that this information is expected by potential business partners, banks, procurement agencies and so on, and entities that don\u2019t reveal their beneficial owners are subject to intense scrutiny, denied access to finance, public procurement and other business opportunities,\u201d said Sztykowski.

The circus \u2013 and your favourite radio show \u2013 is about to start,\u201d says a French-Canadian veteran journalist in French. He turns to his co-host, a Syrian storyteller, who repeats the words into her microphone, this time in Arabic. In the tiny downtown studio of a student radio station in Montreal, Bernard Derome and Marya Zarif are recording a radio show for Syrian refugee children. Launched in 2017 with the support of the Canadian Commission for Unesco, Radio-Dodo, or Sleepytime-Radio, has already broadcast 37 episodes online and through Radio-Rozana, a Syrian radio station based in Paris. The weekly bilingual show mixes stories, songs and segments about everything from tying your shoelaces to why your milk teeth fall out. The aim is to help Syrian refugee children around the world forget about their worries and fall asleep at night. The woman behind the show is Brigitte Alepin, a French-Canadian tax expert whose Syrian grandfather immigrated to Canada in the early 20th century. When the Syrian war erupted in 2011, Alepin said she felt shocked and helpless; only a few years earlier, she had visited her grandfather\u2019s hometown of Aleppo with her young son. Throughout the trip he had played with local children; now, she couldn\u2019t help wondering about them. \u201cI asked myself, how is it that life makes it possible for my boy \u2013 who had been in Aleppo \u2013 now to be safe at home in Quebec?\u201d she said. \u201cI told myself I would never be able to feel good about myself again if I didn\u2019t find a way to help.\u201d For a while, Alepin wondered how she could help Syrian refugees half a world away, but as she discussed the problem with a friend, an idea formed: radio waves could cross borders and reach an audience anywhere around the world. \u201cWe were talking and a little while later, I had an intuition: I would try to make a radio show for children,\u201d said Alepin. She gathered a small team of Syrian, Algerian and Canadian volunteers to help her organize the show, find content and sign up storytellers. Prominent Canadian writers including Kim Thuy and Wajdi Mouawad, and former Canadian Olympic athlete Marie-\u00c8ve Marleau have appeared on the show to read stories or discuss their jobs. Most of the audience is in Turkey and Quebec. One regular listener is Rahaf, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee from Damascus who came to Montreal in 2016 with her two brothers and their parents. Rahaf uses her brother\u2019s laptop to listen to the show as she falls asleep; her favourite story so far was about a dog taking the bus by himself. \u201cI just listen on my bed and I sing along,\u201d she said in French, her new language. Rahaf\u2019s mother, Basma \u2013 who asked for the family\u2019s surname to be withheld \u2013 said that her husband and sons escaped to Jordan first. But when Basma and Rahaf attempted to follow, they were arrested and jailed for 18 months. After being released, she and her siblings lived in a refugee camp in Jordan for three years; conditions were harsh, and there was no chance for the children to go to school. Now Rahaf is getting used to her new life, going to school during the day and playing at home. \u201cI like telling myself stories and when I have a new book, I read it to myself,\u201d she said. Alepin says she wants to continue spreading love and joy to refugee children and plans to further expand her project. She has recently found a partner radio station in Mali to broadcast her show to children in the French-speaking country, and hopes that eventually Radio-Dodo can become a global radio show for child refugees around the world.

There are four \u201cco-workers\u201d with me \u2013 a woman, Rachel, and three guys \u2013 talking about an upcoming conference in Las Vegas. The conversation takes a locker room turn, with the men joking about afterparties, vodka and Jacuzzis. Rachel tries to bring the conversation back to her presentation. Suddenly the boss grabs her arm and says: \u201cRachel, one very important note. Remember it\u2019s a party, pack something \u2026 fitting.\u201d Rachel snatches her arm back and is noticeably uncomfortable. Suddenly, I receive a text message from my co-worker Chris on a virtual cellphone I\u2019m holding (actually the VR controller). He\u2019s noticed Rachel\u2019s discomfort and asks: \u201cSo that just happened. Should we say something?\u201d This scenario is part of a corporate sexual harassment training program called Vantage Point, created by the entrepreneur Morgan Mercer, a two-time survivor of sexual violence. It uses the immersive properties of VR to place people directly into scenes that illustrate the subtleties of grooming, harassment and discrimination in a visceral and interactive way. At a time of #MeToo, Mercer is hoping human resources departments will stop seeing sexual harassment training as a box-ticking exercise and start seeking real results. Research indicates that people who go through virtual reality training \u2013 as opposed to videos, PowerPoint or in-person seminars \u2013 retain significantly more information. \u201cWe want to make it as immersive as possible \u2013 because the closer you can get to actual embodiment of the character, the more likely your response will reflect what you would do in a real-life situation,\u201d Mercer said. In the case of the aforementioned \u201cshould we say something?\u201d question, there were four possible responses to choose from. The answers are ranked from best to worst, with the best answer being \u201cWe should ask how she\u2019d like to handle it\u201d, followed by \u201cWe should report this to HR\u201d. Depending on how you respond to the multiple-choice questions sent via text, the narrative branches in different directions \u2013 either escalating or de-escalating. Repeated wrong answers are met with \u201cempathy training\u201d in the form of a phone call where Mercer explains where you slipped up. The training program \u2013 designed for both men and women \u2013 covers three \u201cmodules\u201d: bystander intervention (which I did), identification of sexual harassment and learning to respond to harassment when it happens to you. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to teach communal accountability. It\u2019s not enough to say: \u2018I didn\u2019t sexually harass anyone; my hands are clean,\u2019\u201d Mercer said. \u201cIf you see it, speak out. Either to the person doing it or the receiver of inappropriate attention.\u201d Mercer wants Vantage Point\u2019s VR training to become the gold standard for companies and is drawing on scientific research to develop best practice guidelines. There are no existing standards \u2013 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sets regulations, but only three states in the US require any sexual harassment training. Vantage Point is currently carrying out pilot research with the first \u201cbystander\u201d module with the fintech startup Tala and the payroll platform Justworks, with plans to roll out the service by the end of the year. In Chicago, gaming is used to start conversations with young people In the hopes of changing attitudes and behaviors that allow sexual misconduct to happen in wider society, others, from health professionals to indie game designers, are turning to another immersive technology \u2013 video games. \u201cWhen we first started talking about games and sexual assault, it just doesn\u2019t sound right on the ear, but having this interactive space where you can explore an issue that\u2019s slightly outside of yourself is really helpful,\u201d said Melissa Gilliam, an adolescent obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Chicago. Gilliam has found video games can be a much-needed catalyst for conversations about these tough issues through work with her team at the Center for Interdisciplinary Inquiry and Innovation in Sexual and Reproductive Health (Ci3), which she founded to study sexual and reproductive health problems, especially in underrepresented communities. The center\u2019s Game Changer Chicago Design Lab (GCC) is currently researching the efficacy of Bystander, a comic book-style game in which teenage players encounter four episodes of harassment and assault, including teachers making inappropriate comments and feeling pressured to have sex with your partner. Throughout the game, rape myths \u2013 such as: \u201cI\u2019m not the type of person this happens to\u201d \u2013 are presented, and players must decide how to respond. There is no penalty for players who make the wrong choice in a given situation. They are simply retaught earlier lessons. The episode outlines were developed through discussions with youth advisers, who also ensured the adult game designers accurately captured teen language. \u201cWe saw where young people took it and they often were telling stories and events from their lives, and they said you finally gave us the space that enabled us to have these conversations,\u201d said Gilliam. \u201cIt was almost as if the young people drove us to yes, you can deal with these issues in this context in this medium.\u201d The game was first implemented in two 12th-grade classrooms in November 2016. Of the 46 students who participated in the study, 97.6% found the game presented valuable information, which 60% said was personally relevant, according to the pilot study. Researchers are analyzing data from the most recent implementation round, which brought the game to 1,000 students aged 14 to 18. Efforts to teach sexual assault and harassment prevention through games have largely been aimed at university students or as therapeutic tools for victims. The University of Chicago team said its early research showed these interventions should be starting at an earlier age. \u201cWhen we talk about intervening at the college age, we have to seriously consider that we\u2019re perhaps four years or more too late,\u201d said Jennifer Rowley, who oversaw implementation of Bystander at four Chicago high schools in the summer of 2017. While students were initially skeptical about Bystander, Rowley said it quickly provided an opportunity for the teenagers to discuss sensitive issues for the first time, such as how they define consent. Rowley said it was also clear these things had been on their minds before. \u201cWe saw 14-year-olds who had very formed opinions about sexual violence and harassment and what was appropriate and what wasn\u2019t and who is to blame and who wasn\u2019t,\u201d Rowley said. The four-day curriculum began with lessons by violence prevention educators and counselors from the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association of Metropolitan Chicago (YWCA), who were also available to students who disclosed incidents of sexual harassment or assault. These educators complimented lessons taught in the game, which is named after the bystander approach, a method of sexual harassment and assault prevention which gives the community, not just the victims, a role in preventing this behavior. \u201cSexual harassment is a large enough cultural problem that we need a broad suite of interventions to tackle it in the coming years,\u201d said Patrick Jagoda, who co-founded GCC with Gilliam and is a professor at the university\u2019s English and cinema schools. \u201cSo for me, something like the bystander approach is a piece of a larger cultural puzzle. We\u2019re not claiming the four episodes in the game are covering every topic in sexual violence and sexual harassment.\u201d The extensive research and development of the GCC stands in contrast to a smaller scale effort to capture sexual assault in a game by Nina Freeman, an indie game designer based in Seattle. Freeman was a graduate student when in March 2015 she published a semi-autobiographical game about sexual assault, Freshman Year. \u201cThis is my story and I hope it can inspire people to tell their stories if that\u2019s empowering for them,\u201d Freeman told the Guardian. The game\u2019s format is typical of her work \u2013 artistic vignettes loosely depicting personal experiences. The game takes only a few minutes to play, but in that short time, the eerie music and lush colors transport the player past their computer screen into the shoes of a college student whose fun conversation with a friend turns dark. With the help of two collaborators, Freeman evokes an atmosphere that is surreal yet anchored by concrete details. The most concrete being that no matter what decision the player makes in the game, which is still available to play online, the result is the same. Freeman said she received almost universal positive feedback to Freshman Year, but emphasized she was trying to capture a personal experience and does not intend for the game to be a grand statement about sexual assault. \u201cI know every woman\u2019s experience is different depending on race and class and everything, and this is very specific to me,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be an everywoman story.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Can we stop the Arctic meltdown?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/is-the-worlds-toughest-plastic-bag-ban-working", "date": "2018-04-27", "transcript": "This week, The Upside has been focused on hopeful news about the environment, which will be a welcome reprieve for anyone who read Mayer Hillman\u2019s interview in the Guardian in which he concluded that climate change meant \u201cwe\u2019re doomed\u201d.

Steven Desch, lead physicist Last week it was announced that the British government would consider a ban on cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics, following the success of the 5p plastic bag charge. But compared to the plastic bag ban introduced in Kenya last year \u2013 which threatens up to four years\u2019 imprisonment and fines of up to $40,000 (\u00a331,000) for anyone producing, selling or even carrying a plastic bag \u2013 Britain\u2019s actions look like child\u2019s play. Jonathan Watts has been in Nairobi and writes about the impact of the Kenyan ban eight months after it was introduced. Winners of the Goldman environmental prize were announced this week, celebrating six remarkable success stories \u2013 five of them driven by women \u2013 of individuals or groups who have taken on powerful vested interests. Among the winners were Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid, who took on Jacob Zuma and Vladmir Putin in a legal challenge over nuclear power and won, and Claire Nouvian, a journalist turned activist who, inspired by the vampire squid, is fighting for less destructive fishing practices. What we liked This article in the Christian Science Monitor about teenage girls in rural India who got sick of waiting for the adults to fix things and took over their town. Among their successes so far: getting a library and bus stop in their community. What we heard One of the side effects of the introduction of the plastic bag is that it killed off centuries-old crafts all over the world. When I was growing up in Somaliland, every mother (or servant, for the rich) took these beautiful baskets made of wicker-like material to markets every morning. The baskets were reusable and handwoven exclusively by women who made a decent living from their craft. And then one-time-use plastic came. The art of basket-weaving died off. I don\u2019t think there is a single skilled basket-weaver left in Somaliland today. SomlanderBrit, commenting below the line on our Kenyan plastic bag story Where was the upside?

A year after Kenya announced the world\u2019s toughest ban on plastic bags, and eight months after it was introduced, the authorities are claiming victory \u2013 so much so that other east African nations Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and South Sudan are considering following suit. But it is equally clear that there have been significant knock-on effects on businesses, consumers and even jobs as a result of removing a once-ubiquitous feature of Kenyan life. \u201cOur streets are generally cleaner which has brought with it a general \u2018feel-good\u2019 factor,\u201d said David Ong\u2019are, the enforcement director of the National Environment Management Authority. \u201cYou no longer see carrier bags flying around when its windy. Waterways are less obstructed. Fishermen on the coast and Lake Victoria are seeing few bags entangled in their nets.\u201d Ong\u2019are said abattoirs used to find plastic in the guts of roughly three out of every 10 animals taken to slaughter. This has gone down to one. The government is now conducting a proper analysis to measure the overall effect of the measure. The draconian ban came in on 28 August 2017, threatening up to four years\u2019 imprisonment or fines of $40,000 (\u00a331,000) for anyone producing, selling \u2013 or even just carrying \u2013 a plastic bag. In Nairobi\u2019s shanty towns, one immediate impact was on the practice of defecating in a plastic bag, tying it up and then throwing it on to the tin roofs, a convenience known as \u201cflying toilets\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know when the flying toilets started, but they are not good,\u201d says Johnson Kaunange, a wheelchair user. \u201cYou never know where they are going to land or where they will fall when it rains. My wheelchair often rolls over the bags and splits them, and then the stink on the wheels is disgusting.\u201d In the Mathare community, this is good news. Since the ban was introduced, many more people are using a communal toilet, which charges 5 Kenyan shillings (4p) for single use or 100 shillings for a month-long family pass. The facility is on the bustling thoroughfare leading down into Mathare valley. One of the administrators Caleb Omondi said he has already noticed a difference now that flying toilets are effectively prohibited. \u201cThe number of users is now much higher. We used to get about 300 people a day. Now it\u2019s over 400,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m overjoyed. This is making the community cleaner and we get more income.\u201d In broader society, the ban appears to be working, albeit imperfectly. Among the hundreds of people who walk the street, there are only two who are carrying or selling plastic bags. Elijia, who preferred not to give his family name, is a young man who says he has to use a plastic bag to carry his beloved khat because it keeps the moisture far more effectively than a paper bag. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the police, of course, but I\u2019m not a bad person,\u201d he says. The other is Esther, a stallholder who sells fried chips for 20 shillings (15p) a bag. She sighs when the subject is mentioned. A clutch of red, orange and green biodegradable fibre bags pinned to the wall behind her show her efforts to meet the conditions of the ban, but it is clearly eating into already slim margins. The new bags are six times more expensive than plastic. Customers refuse to pay extra and there are no subsidies from the government so she has to swallow the extra cost. \u201cMy business is badly affected,\u201d she complained. \u201cI\u2019m not against a plastic ban, but there should be a cheap alternative.\u201d Of course, any indiction has to come with enforcement, and this has not always been pretty. In the eight months since the ban was introduced, local media have charted the crackdown on \u201cplastic bag dealers.\u201d In February, more than 50 people were arrested in raids in Mombasa, Kisii, Keroka and Bomet. Authorities also shut down Nairobi\u2019s Burma market for widespread noncompliance. In Mathare, a group of slums home to half a million people, one local trader, nicknamed Onya, was arrested after police caught him using plastic bags to sell chicken heads. The judge fined him 15,000 shillings (\u00a3110), much lower than the maximum penalty but equivalent to six weeks\u2019 work. \u201cThat seems harsh for a new law,\u201d said one of his customers. Other stallholders are asking their customers to bring plastic bowls or traditional bags made from sisal fibre. This has led to complaints. The bowls spill easily. The sisal bags are expensive because the plants, which were once common, have been replaced by cash crops. There has been push-back. On 1 March, the manufacturer, Hi-Plast filed a lawsuit against the government for compensation and argued the ban has been selectively implemented. In Kenya as a whole, the prohibition on plastic bags has caused headaches for retailers and manufacturers. \u201cThe ban has shaken the economy. In several areas, business is at a standstill,\u201d said Samuel Matonda of the Kenyan manufacturers association, who complains that the policy should have been introduced gradually. He estimates 80% of member companies are affected and close to 100,000 people have been laid off because the outlawing of flat plastic bags has been very broadly interpreted to include almost all packaging, which hurts exporters of food and flower products to Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour, as well as producers of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Matonda is now part of a panel that is working with the government to create more exemptions and put a greater emphasis on improving waste management. \u201cIt\u2019s a stimulus,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ban has undoubtedly aroused more public awareness of the need for a clean environment. We have achieved more in six months than in the previous five years.\u201d The environment ministry says the attitude of manufacturers has changed. \u201cThe companies are now coming by themselves to offer solutions,\u201d said Ong\u2019are. With PET bottles next in the government\u2019s sights, companies are proposing a self-management scheme to organise collection and recycling. There is still a long way to go. The ban could add to problems not just for rich manufacturers but for poor communities unless there are policies to provide cheap alternatives. But at Mathare, a football ground once covered in six feet of plastic waste is testimony to the benefits that can flow from an improved environment. As in other countries with similar bans, the policy is still being refined, but it has support. \u201cIt should definitely encourage other countries around the world, and not just in Africa, to ban plastic bags and other single-use plastics,\u201d said Dr Arnold Kreilhuber, head of international environmental law at UN Environment. \u201cIt is however important to engage in as much public consultation as possible to ensure a smooth transition through the ban to implementation. Banning plastic bags is a big win, but it\u2019s just the beginning. We need more investment in waste management to guarantee Kenyans a clean and healthy environment.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Graphene has been incorporated into traditional concrete production by scientists at the University of Exeter, developing a composite material which is more than twice as strong and four times more water-resistant than existing concretes. Unlike previous attempts to use nanotechnology in concrete, which have focused on modifying the existing components of cement, the new technique allows a layer of graphene to be suspended in water. The method produces a high yield of concrete without defects, which can be used in conjunction with modern manufacturing techniques and could be scaled up, the researchers believe, at a relatively low cost. The composite could be used directly on building sites, enabling the construction of strong and durable buildings using less concrete and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using graphene meant the researchers were able to roughly halve the amount of materials used to make concrete. Its water resistance makes it suitable for construction in areas that are hard to reach for maintenance, while the strength of the composite will make buildings more resilient to future shocks and strains, researchers say. In addition, the technique could be copied in incorporating other nanomaterials into concrete construction in the future, which could pave the way to further innovations in the industry. Monica Craciun, professor of nanoscience at the University of Exeter\u2019s engineering department, said: \u201cOur cities face a growing pressure from global challenges on pollution, sustainable urbanisation and resilience to catastrophic natural events. This new composite material is an absolute game-changer in terms of reinforcing traditional concrete to meet these needs.\u201d Graphene is a form of carbon first reliably produced at the University of Manchester by researchers in 2004, work which led to two Nobel prizes. It is made up of a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice. Its structure gives it important physical qualities, including efficient conductance of heat and electricity and unusual strength. Concrete has been used as a building material since the Romans, some of whose concrete structures still stand today. It is the commonest building material, along with steel, but greenhouse gas emissions from concrete and cement-making remain stubbornly high, in part because of the energy used in their creation but also because the chemical processes required involve the break-up of limestone and release of carbon dioxide. Cement-making accounts for 6% of global carbon emissions, and manufacturers must make sharp reductions if the Paris climate goals are to be met, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project, in a recent study. The University of Exeter research, in a paper entitled Ultrahigh Performance nanoengineered Graphene-Concrete Composites for Multifunctional Applications, is published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, and was funded by the UK\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The samples of the composite tested so far all come up to British and European standards, so getting the composite material into use should be possible. Dimitar Dimov, lead author of the study, said: \u201cFinding greener ways to build is a crucial step forward in reducing carbon emissions around the world. This is a crucial step in the right direction to make a more sustainable construction industry.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Could sprinkling sand save the Arctic's shrinking sea ice?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/sprinkling-sand-save-arctic-shrinking-sea-ice", "date": "2018-04-23", "transcript": "As a test location for a project that aims to ensure the livability of Earth, a frozen lake near the northern tip of Alaska could seem rather inauspicious. While the North Meadow Lake near Utqia\u0121vik, formerly known as Barrow, may be relatively nondescript, it will be the staging ground this month for an ambitious attempt to safeguard the Arctic\u2019s rapidly diminishing sea ice and stave off the most punishing effects of global warming. Tiny spheres of reflective sand will be sprinkled upon the lake to see if this can prevent the lake ice from melting or slow the process down. Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice \u2013 equivalent to the size of Costa Rica \u2013 with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change. \u201cThe ice in the Arctic isn\u2019t going to come back by itself,\u201d said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d Field, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore\u2019s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. \u201cIt hit me like a train,\u201d she said. \u201cThe importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me. \u201cI looked at it and thought: \u2018What if this is a materials problem?\u2019 You go through the list of things that aren\u2019t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it\u2019s a fairly short list. I\u2019ve been through a few options and this one has legs.\u201d For the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota. Testing is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqia\u0121vik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra \u2013 there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer. \u201cLeslie is kind of a one-off,\u201d said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpea\u0121vik I\u00f1upiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. \u201cI think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that\u2019s realistic and is going to save the world, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Field is attempting to resurrect the reflectivity lost by the Arctic as sea ice has receded due to a warming atmosphere and ocean. Sea ice is being lost at a rate not seen in at least 1,500 years, with Nasa calculating it is disappearing by about 13% a decade. In March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles \u2013 the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s. As sea ice is lost, it locks the Arctic into a downward spiral. Less stark white reflective surface, or albedo, means more dark ocean, which absorbs sunlight rather than repels it, thus speeding up the warming process and spurring further melting. Older multi-year ice, 10ft thick in places, accounted for just 1% of the winter ice pack last year, meaning the sea ice that remains is now largely composed of newer, thinner and less reflective ice. Field claims that her solution could save what\u2019s left. Tiny balls of silica, measuring less than the breadth of a human hair, should reflect 90% of the sun\u2019s heat. This \u201cemergency first aid\u201d is framed as a chance for the world to be afforded more time to slash greenhouse gas emissions. The cost and logistics are daunting, however. It\u2019s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft. Field isn\u2019t targeting the whole Arctic region \u2013 instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard \u2013 but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour. The continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn\u2019t certain as yet, despite a \u201clarge-scale launch\u201d of ice covering earmarked for 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s not chump change, but compared to other options it\u2019s cost effective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.\u201d Ice911 isn\u2019t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic. A team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic\u2019s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze. \u201cOur only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,\u201d lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic\u2019s sea ice from disappearing.\u201d In the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won\u2019t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed. No such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option \u201csoft\u201d or \u201ceco\u201d geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough. There is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun\u2019s heat away from Earth; or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to \u201cbrighten\u201d them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia\u2019s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin \u201csun shield\u201d to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching. A separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the \u201cStratoCruiser\u201d \u2013 a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard\u2019s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources. These and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive. J\u00e1nos P\u00e1sztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored. In a speech to Arizona State University, P\u00e1sztor singled out Keith\u2019s experiment. \u201cSome time within the next year, we may see the world\u2019s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society\u2019s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.\u201d Some scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas. \u201cI think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,\u201d said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.\u201d Bitz said she was \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d about Ice911\u2019s plan as it creates \u201cvery small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems\u201d, despite Field\u2019s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. The silica material will average 60 micrometers, which is \u201cwell out of the range of danger\u201d caused by particulates that are typically smaller, at 10 micrometers or less, according to Roman Decca, who works on strategy and engineering at Ice911. \u201cYou could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,\u201d said Bitz. \u201cThe idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it\u2019s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive. We need to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, first and foremost.\u201d Even if the silica proves benign to the Arctic environment, keeping a lid on warming in the region could backfire anyway, according to Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. \u201cWeather patterns and ocean currents bring excess heat to the poles to balance out the planet, so you might invigorate those warming systems,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might all be a bit futile.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

More than a decade before Blue Planet, Claire Nouvian was researching this rare creature \u2013 a living fossil that is found 4,000m below the surface of Monterey Bay \u2013 for a French television company, when she first realised the extraordinary variety of life and colour on the deep ocean floor. The joy of that discovery was quickly followed by horror when she realised how quickly this landscape \u2013 formed over centuries \u2013 was being turned into a desert as a result of industrial fishing. Deep-sea bottom trawlers drag heavy nets with steel doors and roller gear across the ocean floor, decimating ancient coral, mussel colonies, sponges, sea worms and many species that live long and breed too slowly to replenish their numbers. The technique has been compared to the clear-cutting of forests because the heavy doors \u2013 some of which weigh several tonnes and are marketed as canyonbusters \u2013 scrape the tops off of seamounts and rugged terrain. Determined to challenge this, Nouvian switched from journalism to activism, founded the Bloom Association in 2005, and began a campaign that recently resulted in a major policy shift by the European Union. She describes her strategy as an application of investigative journalism. She first identified the problem, honed in on the causes, interviewed the major players and then sieved through reams of data to expose the ecological and economic flaws of the business. \u201cDeep-sea bottom trawling applies the most destructive fishing to the most fragile ecosystem,\u201d Nouvian told the Guardian in an interview ahead of the Goldman award ceremony. \u201cThe seafloor has intricate features that form over years, like cities. Bottom trawling wipes it out.\u201d Nouvian initially focused attention on a fishing fleet owned by Intermarch\u00e9, a French supermarket chain. Her association sifted through years of corporate accounts and discovered that the fleet was chronically unprofitable even with public subsidies. In partnership with other NGOs, they also canvassed former fishing communities in France and the UK to see how fishing port communities were being ruined by industrial trawling. This was followed by a petition calling on the government to ban a practice that was environmentally destructive and economically unviable. With the help of a viral cartoon on the subject by acclaimed French illustrator P\u00e9n\u00e9lope Bagieu, more than 900,000 people signed up, forcing first Intermarch\u00e9, then the French and UK governments, then the European parliament and council to agree on restrictions. From June 2016, European fleets have been banned from bottom trawling at depths of more than 800m. Nouvian is now targeting pulse fishing, which uses electric currents to stun fish or induce spasms that force sole and plaice from the sediment. The European commission banned this practice \u2013 along with fishing with poison and explosives \u2013 in 1998, but eight years later accepted a Dutch proposal for an exemption for 5% of trawlers to conduct \u201cscientific research\u201d into whether this form of fishing is less destructive than other types of trawling. Nouvian says 84 Dutch ships have been fitted with electrodes, which is more than 30% of the fleet, and they only started collecting data after Bloom challenged them in 2016. \u201cThis is terrifying. If we electrocute fish, we also electrocute eggs and everything else. All life in a certain space is wiped out. It sounds like science fiction, but it is real.\u201d Under pressure from Bloom, other NGOs and small-scale fishermen\u2019s groups, the European parliament voted to prohibit pulse fishing inside EU waters earlier this year. But she says it continues on a wide scale because the European commission is failing to enforce regulations while the EU institutions make a final ruling on whether pulse fishing should be prohibited. Nouvian has called on supermarkets to refuse to stock electric-caught fish but so far in the UK only Waitrose, Co-op and Morrisons have agreed, while Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Marks and Spencers have not replied. French retailers \u2013 who have learned not to cross this formidable campaigner \u2013 have been more responsive. The prize-winner \u2013 who complains there is only 20 hours to work in a day \u2013 is also working to ban shark-finning in Asia and lobbying the World Trade Organisation and governments around the world to end subsidies for destructive industrial fishing and to give more support to small-scale fishing communities. \u201cThere are way too many big fishing vessels and they are kept afloat with public subsidies. But there are fewer fish so they have to go further, enter deeper waters and take more types of fish,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the means to wipe out other species and us with it, but just because we can it does not mean we have to.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Goldman prize awarded to South African women who stopped an international nuclear deal", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/goldman-prize-awarded-to-south-african-women-who-stopped-an-international-nuclear-deal", "date": "2018-04-23", "transcript": "Two grassroots women activists \u2013 one black, one white \u2013 stand together against two of the world\u2019s most powerful men \u2013 one black, one white \u2013 over a secret, undemocratic, multibillion dollar nuclear deal. If this was the plot of a Netflix series, it might be dismissed as too neat, too perfectly symbolic and symmetrical. But this is the true story of the two South African winners of this year\u2019s Goldman environment prize who tapped their roots in the anti-apartheid struggle to take on and beat an agreement by their nation\u2019s recently deposed leader Jacob Zuma and Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid were the sole signatories of a successful legal challenge against the plan for South Africa to buy up to 10 nuclear power stations from Russia at an estimated cost of 1tn rand ($76bn). After a five-year legal battle, a high court outlawed the deal last April and accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that it had been arranged without proper consultation with parliament. Aside from the immense geopolitical ramifications, the ruling was a vindication for the civil society movement that aims to expand public participation, especially by woman, in energy decision-making. There were risks in confronting the president, the electricity utility and the interests of a foreign power. The two women were warned they could face violence and attacks on their reputation, but they signed the legal papers regardless. \u201cIt is important that this campaign is led by women,\u201d Lekalakala said in an interview in Cape Town. \u201cWe are getting this [Goldman] prize because we really sacrificed ourselves by putting our names on the line. Others were shit-scared. But we\u2019ve been through so much that we were willing to take the risk.\u201d McDaid, who works for the Southern African Faith Communities\u2019 Environment Institute, said the campaign was a recognition that grassroots action can work. \u201cGovernments everywhere like to give the impression that citizens have no power. That\u2019s not true. We have checks and balances and we need to use them.\u201d Both cut their activist teeth in the anti-apartheid struggle of the 1980s. McDaid, then a teacher, was caught up in the Trojan Horse massacre in Athlone, Cape Town. She hid students sought by police in her house and used her car to block troops chasing students. Lekalakala grew up in Soweto, the heartland of the black consciousness movement. She served as a shop steward in a department store when she was 19 years old. She also witnessed some of the worst of the violence, both from the white authorities and black-on-black factional conflict. In the late eighties, an era when alleged apartheid collaborators were being punished with \u201cnecklaces\u201d of burning tyres, she was woken by screams in the middle of the night and ffound bodies on the floor in the morning. \u201cThat was the hardest time of my life,\u201d she recalls. This background has made the two women relatively fearless. They have both been threatened and suffered break-ins in which alarm systems were expertly dismantled and only their laptops (rather than valuables like jewellery or cameras) were stolen, suggesting the intruders were after information rather than money. \u201cIt\u2019s harassment,\u201d said Lekalakala. \u201cBut I\u2019m very forceful. I\u2019m used to threats.\u201d The two began working together in 2009 when they joined Earthlife, a group designed to encourage women to become more involved in energy and climate policy-making. For Lekalakala, it was an eye-opening experience. \u201cWhen I started at Earthlife I was one of the only black women. I thought that was wrong. It is poor black women who are most affected but it is rich white men making all the decisions.\u201d They have proved influential, providing input into the National Energy Act and the climate energy policy. They challenged the long-held view that energy is a technical, engineering matter for specialists rather than ordinary people. \u201cWe broke that barrier and we are continuously breaking barriers,\u201d said Lekalakala, who has also campaigned against plans for a coal mine at Thabametsi. They were tipped off about the nuclear deal by the Russian group EcoDefence. Although the South African government had not told the public about the plan, its business partner, state-owned Rosatom initially posted an announcement on its website. This was quickly taken down but not before Earthlife made a copy that they used to rally opposition from environmentalists, faith groups, lawyers, and, the media. Their court victory was a major setback for Putin\u2019s plans to increase Russia\u2019s income and influence, and may have contributed to the fall of Zuma after nine years in power. The president had reportedly fired two finance ministers in part because they were unwilling to approve the $76bn cost of the project. It was also a focus of corruption claims by political enemies and rivals in the ANC, given reports that Zuma\u2019s son was a director of the sole mine that supplied uranium. The new government has signalled a shift in direction. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Davos this year that the plan to add 9.6 gigawatts of nuclear energy was off the table. More recently, energy minister Jeff Radebe has signed deals that will promote wind and solar power. \u201cThe political signs are good that nuclear is not going ahead any time soon,\u201d said McDaid. \u201cBut I think this is just a step on the path to a nuclear-free South Africa. There is a long way to go. Success would be for our one existing plant to be decomissioned and for the government to make a nuclear-free declaration.\u201d Lekalakala agrees on the need to stay vigilant because coal - along with nuclear - remains a concern and the government will revisit its energy policy in five years. \u201cCivil society can claim some credit for ensuring the government didn\u2019t run along a nuclear path that would have bankrupted the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the Goldman award to further our struggle and build a new generation of activists.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "From flat-pack coffins to water cremation: how to have an eco-friendly death", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/from-flat-pack-coffins-to-water-cremation-how-to-have-an-eco-friendly-death", "date": "2018-04-20", "transcript": "The grass may be greener on the other side \u2013 but is death? Growing numbers of people who spend their lives recycling their plastics and watching their air miles are wondering about the most environmentally sound way to deal with their mortal remains. Now, help is at hand from a funeral industry increasingly tuned in to the varied and exotic last wishes of the \u201cconsumer\u201d. At a packed funeral expo in a church in Amsterdam last weekend, exhibitors included a flat-pack coffin that you construct and decorate yourself which has just won the first Dutch \u201cfinal footprint award\u201d with its designs for a \u201cCO2-neutral\u201d casket. \u201cEnvironmental awareness needs to extend to everything we do,\u201d says Cor Geijtenbeek, co-owner of the design firm Coffin in a Box Company. \u201cWe separate our plastics. We think about the car we drive. We also need to think about the choice of our last journey.\u201d Death is a growth business. More than 100 people die every minute on \u2013 56 million in 2015 according to the World Health Organization, which predicts a 25% increase to 70 million in 2030. Geijtenbeek reckons burial is better for the environment than cremation. But in the UK, even though three-quarters of people choose cremation, space in graveyards is running out, with almost half of local authorities expecting their cemeteries to be full by 2033. The Dutch answer has been to allow graves to be reused, with old bones buried much deeper when a new coffin arrives for interment. This presents a problem: many modern coffins are not so biodegradable. \u201cIn the past, people used wooden coffins made only of wood, sometimes containing cloth, but now it\u2019s only chemically treated wood products, with synthetic glues in the casket and often paint and varnish for a high-shine effect,\u201d says Geijtenbeek. \u201cIn no way are these coffins biodegradable and they are often made in China or eastern Europe and transported.\u201d He added that sometimes when a grave is cleared and the bones buried deeper to make space for the next occupant, these synthetic coffins are completely intact while the bodies have decomposed. \u201cCremation isn\u2019t necessarily better for the environment as it uses a lot of energy and raises the carbon footprint,\u201d he adds. \u201cSimple burial with biodegradable products is better for the environment.\u201d And so his firm, which already produces the low-carbon flat-pack poplar coffin, is now working in conjunction with the company Ecor on a model with sides made from recycled cellulose fibres. He has sold a couple of hundred of his initial poplar wood model, sent through the post and costing \u20ac289 (\u00a3250) or \u00a3299 to people in Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland \u2013 estimating that the CO2 footprint of each is 4kg, compared with 25-30kg for a standard coffin. He wasn\u2019t alone at the Dutch fair. As well as a controversial \u201cSarco\u201d euthanasia coffin, FAIR coffins was also offering eco-friendly shrouds, partly recycled and biodegradable coffins, made by people with disabilities \u2013 while across the world you can find coffins made from Hainsworth\u2019s wool, willow and cardboard. These kinds of biodegradable coffin are preferred by \u201cgreen cemeteries\u201d and Prof Douglas Davies, director of Durham University\u2019s Centre for Death and Life Studies and author of dozens of books and studies, points out that more and more people are interested in a \u201cwet\u201d forest burial over a \u201cdusty\u201d graveyard. \u201cThere are as many natural burial sites in the UK as crematoria,\u201d he said. \u201cA woodland burial is somewhere dynamic, associated with life, activity, and hope.\u201d He adds that eco-friendliness has taken on the same kind of positive associations as the pioneering \u201chygienic\u201d cremations first proposed in late 19th century: now, the UK has 281 crematoria, according to the Cremation Society of Great Britain, and more than 270 natural burial sites. In Davies\u2019s view, the proliferation of small ventures offering alternatives from banana-leaf caskets to having your ashes scattered in space, and word-of-mouth recommendations via social media are completely changing our funerals. At the Dutch funeral conference, a greener coffin was definitely appealing to Mieke van der Ploeg, 66, an undertaker from Den Dolder. \u201cMore and more people want eco-friendly coffins; my husband manages a natural cemetery with about 150 spaces and he wants only eco-friendly caskets,\u201d she said. For the consumer, the very Ikea-style process of building and decorating a coffin has emotional benefits, according to Paula Kemper, who used one to cremate her 95-year-old mother. \u201cWe ordered this coffin, put it together with my husband, and we made a very nice painting of the tree of life. My mother had seven children and more than 30 grandchildren and great grandchildren, so the children all made a flower for a branch. It helps you in your grief to do something.\u201d Kate Dyer and Kate Tym, celebrants who run funeral services, have held two Coffin Clubs for people to decorate their own Earth to Heaven cardboard coffins. They have enjoyed trying to build the Coffin in a Box and believe this kind of innovation is vital to give people more control over funeral processes. \u201cThere\u2019s no thinking out of the box,\u201d said Kate Tym. \u201cWe have got completely stuck in the Victorian era with men dressed as characters out of Dickens and I think the next generation isn\u2019t going to want that.\u201d Cremation is ever more popular, but even Geijtenbeek concedes that the latest process, resomation or \u201cwater cremation\u201d\u2013 a process used in the US and Canada where the flesh is broken down by an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide and then the skeleton pulverised \u2013 has been shown to have an even lower carbon footprint. But for religions such as Islam and Judaism, burial is the only option, and Britain is yet to hold its first water cremation, thanks to fears over what happens to the liquid byproduct. If Shakespeare\u2019s gravedigger in Hamlet was pretty casual about chucking poor Yorick\u2019s skull around, we are apparently more sensitive about death nowadays. And we\u2019re probably busier. Linda Drenth, 39, from Veendam in Groningen, who is studying to be a funeral director and was one of the throng at the Amsterdam conference, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a negative if you have to make your coffin yourself, when you are already busy organising a funeral.\u201d The British furniture maker William Warren, though, is all for building DIY, green coffins in good time. He has sent out more than 1,000 open-source designs \u2013 for all weights and sizes \u2013 for his Shelves of Life, a bookcase that becomes a coffin, and his future tombstone is currently weighting a grandfather clock. \u201cIt\u2019s comforting, like writing a will,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all going to rot down or burn up and be added back into the great cauldron. \u201cAlthough,\u201d he adds, as an afterthought, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m living the kind of lifestyle to be particularly good compost.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Yet this densely populated area is seeing a mini-boom in a new type of agriculture where farmers sell direct to consumers. The movement, known as community-supported agriculture, is the antithesis of the sprawling global distribution chains of modern industrial food production. CSA farming means no supermarkets, no fertilisers and no monoculture. Advocates say the most important feature is the direct link to consumers, who pay upfront and often pick the produce from the fields. This model of farming \u2013 sometimes referred to as farm-to-fork \u2013 originated in the United States and the Netherlands, but has quickly taken off in the Belgian region of Flanders. More people are eating CSA-grown food in Belgium than in the more populous UK, according to a 2016 report by Urgenci, the international CSA network. Since the first Flemish CSA farmer struck his spade into the soil in 2007, at least 45 similar businesses have sprung up in the region. Koen Tierens, a plant biologist, is one of the newest on the scene. Tierens swapped his desk job as an agrarian expert for the 5.30am harvests that come with running his own vegetable farm. He has a 1.2-hectare (2.96-acre) plot in the village of Kampenhout just outside Brussels, where the rich, loamy soil is ideal for growing. Tierens\u2019 father, a retired farmer, was sceptical when he outlined his plans; a small holding, no fertilisers and a few old-fashioned, second-hand tools: \u201cMy father told me, \u2018Koen what are you doing? You studied at university, you have a PhD! Are you going to be an ancient Belgian farmer doing how they did it in the middle ages?\u2019\u201d Tierens says there is nothing primitive about his business, and stresses he is not against conventional farming or fertilisers. \u201cThe market is evolving in this [CSA] way,\u201d he says, describing the combination of care for the environment and close connection to the customer, allied to marketing and a website that allows consumers to choose their vegetable boxes. Now in his second growing season, Tierens has 72 households paying him to grow their vegetables and hopes to increase this to 90. His father is now convinced, he says. He grows 200 varieties of vegetable in a year \u2013 a much wider range than typical farmers. As well as the more common peas, carrots and potatoes, he grows less familiar varieties \u2013 purple cauliflowers, green zebra tomatoes, black radish, salsify and cardoon. But Tierens does not grow Belgian endive, the most emblematic vegetable in the national cuisine. Although he farms in a region that is famed for the bitter white lettuce, he decided it would be arrogant to grow his fellow farmers\u2019 best-known crop. Another big difference with conventional farming is the limited use of subsidies, although he received EU funds to start his business and cover the costs of gaining organic certification. Other things are constant \u2013 the unpredictability of the weather and early starts. Tierens works in his field every day, wearing a head torch on dark winter mornings. During the peak growing season from May to October, he works 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week. His customers share the risk of a storm or a bad harvest. \u201cIt would be a disaster for them as well, but the chance of that happening is not that big because I grow 200 types of vegetables,\u201d he says. Unlike most CSA farms in Flanders, Tierens\u2019 customers do not pick their own vegetables. In the UK, a quarter of such farms are pick-your-own, but in Flanders, 85% fall into this category. Belgium is an enthusiastic latecomer to CSA farming, which traces its roots to the biodynamic movement launched in the US in the 1980s. But there were other inspirations. The first known CSA farm in Europe was Les Jardins de Cocagne, an organic vegetable cooperative near Geneva founded in 1978. Japanese farmers were experimenting with similar models at around the same time. \u201cIt is not only about the food, it is also about the community and being outside,\u201d says Nele Lauwers, a policy adviser at the Flemish farming union Boerenbond. She belongs to a CSA cooperative near Ghent and describes harvesting days as \u201ca weekly outdoor trip\u201d for her children. Demand for pick-your-own vegetables is growing among medium to high earners, she says. But price may limit its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a different market. You have to pay in advance and it is not possible for everybody, although some CSA groups may offer social prices.\u201d CSA farming is therefore likely to remain marginal to food production \u2013 0.1% of the population of Flanders are paying customers. Land is also limited. Pepijn de Snijder, an independent expert, says would-be CSA farmers face competition from nature reserves, traditional farming, horse paddocks or city sprawl. \u201cIf we don\u2019t change anything by 2050, 50% of the area of Flanders would be paved concrete,\u201d he says. The Flemish government has agreed a ban on new urban development from 2040 unless an equivalent area of land is returned to nature. Another feature of CSA produce is that it takes longer to prepare. Vegetables arrive in customers\u2019 kitchens with earth clinging to roots and leaves, rather than shiny and neat in plastic packaging. \u201cNot everyone likes to bring soil into their kitchen,\u201d says Tierens. \u201cWith me you need to invest a little bit more time, but you can taste the difference.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Fast-forward four months and she is sporting a full set of golden red feathers and happily laying eggs for her new family in Devon. The remarkable transformation has been made possible by a rehoming project that saves factory-kept chickens from being slaughtered and gives them a new life with families across the country. The British Hen Welfare Trust has rehomed 629,289 chickens so far \u2013 roughly 50,000 hens a year. It\u2019s part of a movement driven by increasing concern about animal welfare and also \u201cpeople wanting a slice of the good life\u201d, says Francesca Taffs, a spokeswoman for the charity. Many of the chickens come from farms where they share cages with up to 90 other birds. They never see daylight or green grass, and at 18 months, when their egg-laying drops off, they are deemed useless to suppliers and sent to slaughter. The charity works with farms and factories to rescue chickens in batches of around 200 and match them with new families. One of the key motivations behind rehoming chickens is to raise awareness about animal welfare. The BHWT says increasing numbers of consumers \u201cnow want high-welfare as well as high-quality\u201d chicken and celebrates the fact that more than half of British eggs are now free-range, a figure higher than anywhere in Europe. However, an estimated 16m chickens a year still live out their lives in small cages to satisfy consumer demand for cheap eggs. While the 2012 ban on battery cages was celebrated as a step forward in bird welfare, the charity would like to see all laying hens be given access to the outdoors and living in small, free-range flocks. Testimonies from those who have adopted the rescue chickens suggest they get more out of it than just fresh eggs. \u201cMy hens filled my empty nest with joy when my children left,\u201d said one owner. Another went fully vegetarian after the birds arrived. Multiple people said they helped with depression or bereavement. One said their hens were providing support for their autistic son, who \u201ccuddles them when overwhelmed\u201d. The BHWT also has a scheme placing chickens in schools and has found them homes in prisons and care homes.

Drumsticks clatter staccato beats against the rim of a snare drum. An accordion\u2019s bellows contract and swell. Dry ice fills the packed theatre. The performers, a five-piece puppet cabaret group, chant at the gathered crowd: \u201cFear. Death. Cold. My dear.\u201d At the Dakh theatre in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, young creatives gather daily to telegraph anxieties, hopes and frustrations. In a country facing toxic post-Soviet problems \u2013 war in the east, corruption, poverty and an economic perma-crisis \u2013 Dakh provides artists with the space to question the world around them and their place in it. And four years after the start of the war between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces, there is much to question. In recent weeks, the venue has hosted a Russian spoken word performance, a Polish-directed production exploring language and identity, and the five-piece puppet cabaret group, TseSho. Often playful, but also mournful and even foreboding, TseSho explore issues such as social media overload, alcoholism, love, social alienation and war. \u201cOur performances are like a mirror of things that are happening,\u201d says Marusia Ionova, the group\u2019s cellist. Each member, dressed in a colourful beanie and orange overalls, has a puppet in their likeness, conveying a child-like quality. Much of their music is cyclical, relying on repetition and drone. \u201cIt is eclectic music,\u201d says Dakh\u2019s founder and creative director, Vladislav Troitskyi. \u201cIt is a very strange story because I don\u2019t know notes. We sit and we begin to create. We discuss what we want to say and then we compose together.\u201d In a recent performance informed by the war in Ukraine\u2019s east, the lights fade to pitch black. A red glow begins to emanate from the stage as discordant melodies and the group\u2019s screams fill the theatre. Europe\u2019s largest country by area, Ukraine has teetered on the east-west faultline since it gained independence in 1991. The conflict that began in 2014 is not its only problem. Ukraine ranks 130th in the global Corruption Perceptions Index; health indicators from longevity to HIV are woeful; the currency has plunged against the dollar, prices have surged, and the economy has stuttered following the loss of the industry-rich Donbass region. \u201cWe have realised that we all lived in a different Ukraine,\u201d says Kateryna Petrashova, TseSho\u2019s saxophonist. Some of the group\u2019s members grew up in the west and centre of the country, another in the sprawling Soviet-style city of Zaporizhia. The government has banned books and popular Russian social media sites, attempted to force schools beyond primary level to teach exclusively in Ukrainian \u2013 angering Hungary, Poland and Romania \u2013 and pursued a policy of \u201cdecommunisation\u201d, part of a push to chart an independent national course that also carries hints of revisionism. \u201cPeople are thinking about their identities,\u201d says accordionist Marichka Shtyrbulova. \u201cWho are we in both the global and national contexts? It is something we have to understand.\u201d Fascist elements are visible in Ukraine, particularly in the country\u2019s west, but do not appear to have broad public support. \u201cAcross Europe we see rightwing forces becoming more popular. Younger people have forgotten the story of world war two and that is a very dangerous story,\u201d says Troitskyi. \u201cBut I believe the Ukrainian mind is practical \u2013 people are afraid of a radicalised society.\u201d The Dakh theatre was founded 25 years ago, after the communist collapse, and is best known as the place where the popular Ukrainian folk group DakhaBrakha was founded. Framed photographs of various performances decorate the foyer, as do ghoulish papier-mache masks. Antiquated brass instruments \u2013 trombones, tubas and trumpets \u2013 hang from the ceiling. A tiny bar serves wine and whisky. \u201cThere is a lot of creative energy here, but it hasn\u2019t crystallised,\u201d says Troitskyi. \u201cIt is really sad, but we have two forces in Ukraine,\u201d says Shtyrbulova, speaking of one that tries to \u201cchange things for the better\u201d and another that \u201cdrags you down\u201d. Certainly, endemic corruption is dragging the country down. The murder of the lawyer Iryna Nozdrovska \u2013 found beside a river in Kiev in January with stab wounds to her neck after working to prosecute the nephew of an influential judge \u2013 has proven a potent symbol of the government\u2019s failure to seriously address corruption. \u201cIt is every day,\u201d says Nadiia Golubtsova, TseSho\u2019s double bass player. \u201cIf you go to the hospital, you know that you will have to pay to get attention.\u201d A video teaser for TseSho\u2019s performances features Golubtsova with the top of her head sawn off.

I also remember my own journey. The dark sea and the steep Greek mountains.\u201d Back in Damascus, Aloker, 46, designed girls\u2019 clothing. Now, he sews together laptop sleeves and tote bags in a workshop on the outskirts of Amsterdam. The bright orange and black bags are made from lifejackets worn by refugees as they crossed the Mediterranean sea. More than 850,000 people arrived in Greece by sea in 2015 alone, with more than 500,000 of these arriving on the island of Lesbos. As well as dealing with large numbers of refugee arrivals, islanders were also faced with an unusual problem: hundreds of thousands of life vests that were left on Greek shores. When the people behind the Dutch social enterprise Makers Unite heard about the problem, they decided to bring 5,000 lifejackets to Amsterdam. Over the past year, as part of a six-week coaching programme to help refugees establish careers in the Netherlands, 71 refugees have been involved in making and selling the bags, including 13 who have joined a team of tailors to create the upcycled products. \u201cWe give both the newcomers and this waste material a second chance,\u201d says Thami Schweichler, the director and co-founder of Makers Unite. He also believes the material will spark a much-needed discussion. \u201cWe hope our products will create awareness about refugees and at the same time help them build a future.\u201d The tailors receive \u20ac150 (\u00a3131) a month for their eight hours of weekly volunteer work, in addition to unemployment benefits. Among the tailors are Eman Haj Omar and her husband, Ammar, who made the sea voyage together in 2015. Back in Aleppo, Ammar used to work with an electronic embroidery machine in her father\u2019s company. When a bomb was dropped on their children\u2019s school, it was time to leave. They paid a smuggler \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,623) for the crossing from Bodrum to the island Kos in a small rubber boat; the journey took four hours. \u201cWe were terrified it would sink,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was dark. Our children were crying.\u201d In the beginning, working with the life vests was a painful reminder of their trip. \u201cIt made me think of the children who have drowned,\u201d says Ammar. \u201cThat boy on the beach we saw on TV in Greece, the one with the red T-shirt.\u201d His wife tells him the boy\u2019s name is Alan Kurdi \u2013 the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a Turkish beach, pictures of whom caused outrage around the world. The couple are used to working with the orange fabric now, and say the workshop is a great place to get to know locals and to practise Dutch. So far, Makers Unite has found paid jobs for about 10% of the participants in their programme. Others have found internships and education or have started their own businesses. Ramzi Aloker, who dreams of starting a girls\u2019 clothing brand, will soon be starting a two-month training programme prior to taking a job as a tailor at the Dutch clothing brand Suitsupply. Makers Unite sells about 100-200 products every month, mostly through its website. Orders come primarily from the Netherlands, the UK and the US. The products will also be available in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from 7 May. \u201cCustomers like that we\u2019ve created something positive out of such a difficult situation,\u201d says Schweichler. \u201cI think many buy our products as a statement against their governments\u2019 anti-immigration policies.\u201d \u201cThese bags can tell people about the tragedy taking place between Damascus and Europe,\u201d says Aloker. \u201cIt might get people thinking about the dangers we faced and why we are here.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Sweden\u2019s target of achieving independence from fossil fuel by 2030 requires a 70% reduction in the transport sector. The technology behind the electrification of the road linking Stockholm Arlanda airport to a logistics site outside the capital city aims to solve the thorny problems of keeping electric vehicles charged, and the manufacture of their batteries affordable. Energy is transferred from two tracks of rail in the road via a movable arm attached to the bottom of a vehicle. The design is not dissimilar to that of a Scalextric track, although should the vehicle overtake, the arm is automatically disconnected. The electrified road is divided into 50m sections, with an individual section powered only when a vehicle is above it. When a vehicle stops, the current is disconnected. The system is able to calculate the vehicle\u2019s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user. The \u201cdynamic charging\u201d \u2013 as opposed to the use of roadside charging posts \u2013 means the vehicle\u2019s batteries can be smaller, along with their manufacturing costs. A former diesel-fuelled truck owned by the logistics firm, PostNord, is the first to use the road. Hans S\u00e4ll, chief executive of the eRoadArlanda consortium behind the project, said both current vehicles and roadways could be adapted to take advantage of the technology. In Sweden there are roughly half a million kilometres of roadway, of which 20,000km are highways, S\u00e4ll said. \u201cIf we electrify 20,000km of highways that will definitely be be enough,\u201d he added. \u201cThe distance between two highways is never more than 45km and electric cars can already travel that distance without needing to be recharged. Some believe it would be enough to electrify 5,000km.\u201d At a cost of \u20ac1m per kilometre, the cost of electrification is said to be 50 times lower than that required to construct an urban tram line. S\u00e4ll said: \u201cThere is no electricity on the surface. There are two tracks, just like an outlet in the wall. Five or six centimetres down is where the electricity is. But if you flood the road with salt water then we have found that the electricity level at the surface is just one volt. You could walk on it barefoot.\u201d National grids are increasingly moving away from coal and oil and battery storage is seen as crucial to a changing the source of the energy used in transportation. The Swedish government, represented by a minister at the formal inauguration of the electrified road on Wednesday, is in talks with Berlin about a future network. In 2016, a 2km stretch of motorway in Sweden was adapted with similar technology but through overhead power lines at lorry level, making it unusable for electric cars. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

She stores them by the front door of her one-story home, which sits on the litter-strewn banks of the Tejipi\u00f3 river in north-east Brazil. When she has enough she will take them to the local storage skip, where a litter collector will pay her two reals for 50 plastic bottles \u2013 about 40 pence. She\u2019s not just doing it for the money. She\u2019s doing it to stop the tide of plastic drowning this community. Every day Maria and other residents of Coqueiral, a poor neighbourhood in the city of Recife, feel the impact of the world\u2019s plastic binge. It is visible in the waters of the river that once flowed freely through the area. Fifty years ago when Rildo Wandray was a boy, he would jump into the Tejipi\u00f3 and swim, while his friends fished beside him. Today the river is stagnant, obstructed at every tributary by a tide of plastic waste; Coca-Cola and Fanta bottles, water containers, crisp packets and wrappers. Globally, some 2 billion people live in communities with no rubbish collections. While international attention has focused recently on the marine plastic litter crisis, the devastating impact of plastic waste on the world\u2019s poorest is no less destructive, causing flooding, disease, and hundreds of thousands of premature deaths from toxic fumes caused by the burning of waste. In Recife the plastic waste is exacerbating already devastating flooding from rising sea levels caused by climate change. And those living around the Tejipi\u00f3 have grown tired of waiting for the government to act. For das Gracas, the tipping point came when flooding took the life of one of her neighbours. \u201cI was trapped inside my home with my son,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was nothing we could do, the water came up and we could not get out. I looked out and saw a body float past. She was face down, I could see the hair. That night the flood nearly took me too. Ever since then I have collected my bottles, I wanted to try and do something to reduce the waste going into the river.\u201d Organised and supported by the local baptist church through its project Instituto Solidare, local communities are mobilising: street protests, public meetings, awareness campaigns. They are also trying to build a network of entrepreneurs who can make a living out of collecting the waste, and turning it into products they can sell. The Recife campaign is supported by Tearfund, the international NGO which is lobbying for global development funding for waste projects to be increased from 0.3% to 3%; a move which would push waste higher up the international agenda, reduce global plastic littering, help cut marine litter and improve the environment and the lives of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable. On Thursday \u2013 in advance of the Commonwealth Summit in London next week \u2013 international development secretary Penny Mordaunt is expected to address the need to increase UK funding globally to tackle plastic pollution, after lobbying from Tearfund and other bodies. In Recife, Evandro Alves, who leads Instituto Solidare, says the world\u2019s poorest are suffering the most from the plastic waste crisis. \u201cThe situation here in this community, where life is already incredibly hard, has been getting worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are are seeing more and more plastic being used and thrown away, and it stops here in their community. So we decided to mobilise.\u201d The movement in Coqueiral, Alves believes, could be replicated across the developing world; taking the idea of a circular economy and localising it to empower the people to press for government action, but also to take advantage of the opportunities waste creates. \u201cThe waste is a problem but it is also an opportunity for people to earn a living, to create a circular economy for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could be transformative and improve the quality of life for people in the poorest areas of the biggest cities. This is a battle for everyone and everyone needs to be part of it. We understand this is not a short fix, this is a long fight.\u201d At public meetings, and marches through the streets residents hold placards aloft, demanding \u201cClean River, Healthy City,\u201d and \u201cSalve Orio Tejipi\u00f3 e suas communidades.\u201d (Save the River Tejipi\u00f3 and our communities) Young people in Recife are at the forefront of the campaign, eliciting support and mobilising on social media. In one direct action, pupils whose school is on the riverside, removed some of the waste from the Tejipi\u00f3; a sofa, plastic bottles, a TV, tables, plastic chairs and built a house on the banks which they called Casa Lixo \u2013 House of Trash. Another post saw children holding a fashion show from clothes created out of plastic bags and cups. Some women are involved in an enterprise making handbags, jewellery and toys out of the plastic and other waste collected from their communities. It provides them with employment and a small income \u2013 and in a small way builds the kind of circular economy which a 2010 Brazilian law promised but failed to create. Olga Gomes, one of the women who works in the group Seleta, said: \u201cWe are putting a lot of work into researching the market and looking at trends and trying to make sure we can make a business out of what we are doing. For me it is empowering \u2013 it has given me work and given me a social life.\u201d Her optimism is shared by all the women, some of whom have been helped to flee violent relationships through the work provided and the social support of the Seleta project. For Gomes, the task for the future is clear. \u201cI want to see my grandchildren swim in the river like I did and I want this work to take me across the ocean.\u201d The movement is being adopted by some of the poorest communities across the world. In Jos in Nigeria and Maputo in Mozambique, other groups have formed. They are driven, as in Recife, by young people, who use their knowledge of digital media to spread the fight against waste across the globe. Naomi Foxwood, senior campaigner for Tearfund, said: \u201cThis crisis is growing as disposable items \u2013 plastic bottles, disposable nappies, single-use polystyrene containers \u2013 are increasingly being used in quickly urbanising low- and middle-income countries. \u201cYoung people, in particular, are at the forefront of this. They have energy, organising power, and a great sense of justice. For them it is a justice issue because often municipal waste is just dumped in the poorest communities, whereas it is collected from the more wealthy areas.\u201d For those in Recife, there have been small victories. Last year the state government responded to the pressure and dug out the river upstream of Coqueiral to improve the river flow. The result is fewer floods so far this year. But the residents know the battle will be a long one. Carol Santos who lives on the banks of the river with her three children understands the need to take personal responsibility for the waste she creates. But she also believes her community has been abandoned by the state and that large multinationals like Coca-Cola \u2013 whose plastic bottles are clearly visible in the mass of waste blocking the Tejipi\u00f3, could do more to clear up the pollution their products create. \u201cThe company could help to collect the waste and support the community to recycle it, but it doesn\u2019t. We don\u2019t see them,\u201d she said. Her home is flooded several times a year. \u201cWhen the rains come the flood destroys everything. It is a desperate situation \u2013 at least nine times a year I lose everything, my children get sick from diarrhoea when it floods, its awful for them. We live here because we have nowhere else to go.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Good news at last: the world isn\u2019t as horrific as you think | Hans Rosling", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/good-news-at-last-the-world-isnt-as-horrific-as-you-think", "date": "2018-04-11", "transcript": "Things are bad, and it feels like they are getting worse, right? War, violence, natural disasters, corruption. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer; and we will soon run out of resources unless something drastic is done. That\u2019s the picture most people in the west see in the media and carry around in their heads. I call it the overdramatic worldview. It\u2019s stressful and misleading. In fact, the vast majority of the world\u2019s population live somewhere in the middle of the income scale. Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated. Perhaps not on every single measure, or every single year, but step by step, year by year, the world is improving. In the past two centuries, life expectancy has more than doubled. Although the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress. The overdramatic worldview draws people to the most negative answers. It is not caused simply by out-of-date knowledge. My experience, over decades of lecturing and testing, has finally brought me to see that the overdramatic worldview comes from the very way our brains work. The brain is a product of millions of years of evolution, and we are hard-wired with instincts that helped our ancestors to survive in small groups of hunters and gatherers. We crave sugar and fat, which used to be life-saving sources of energy when food was scarce. But today these cravings make obesity one of the biggest global health problems. In the same way, we are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. This craving for drama causes misconceptions and helps create an overdramatic worldview. We still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world. If we sifted every input and analysed every decision rationally, a normal life would be impossible. Just as we should not cut out all sugar and fat, we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions. But we need to learn to control our drama intake. It is absolutely true that there are many bad things in this world. The number of conflict fatalities has been falling since the second world war, but the Syrian war has reversed this trend. Terrorism too is rising. Overfishing and the deterioration of the seas are truly worrisome. The list of endangered species is getting longer. But while it is easy to be aware of all the bad things happening in the world, it\u2019s harder to know about the good things. The silent miracle of human progress is too slow and too fragmented to ever qualify as news. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved. But in online polls, in most countries, fewer than 10% of people knew this. Our instinct to notice the bad more than the good is related to three things: the misremembering of the past; selective reporting by journalists and activists; and the feeling that as long as things are bad, it\u2019s heartless to say they are getting better. For centuries, older people have romanticised their youths and insisted that things ain\u2019t what they used to be. Well, that\u2019s true. Most things used to be worse. This tendency to misremember is compounded by the never-ending negative news from across the world. Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and affect millions of people. And thanks to increasing press freedom and improving technology, we hear about more disasters than ever before. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite. At the same time, activists and lobbyists manage to make every dip in an improving trend appear to be the end of the world, scaring us with alarmist exaggerations and prophecies. In the United States, the violent crime rate has been falling since 1990. But each time something horrific or shocking happened \u2013 pretty much every year \u2013 a crisis was reported. The majority of people believe that violent crime is getting worse. My guess is you feel that me saying that the world is getting better is like me telling you that everything is fine, and that feels ridiculous. I agree. Everything is not fine. We should still be very concerned. As long as there are plane crashes, preventable child deaths, endangered species, climate change sceptics, male chauvinists, crazy dictators, toxic waste, journalists in prison, and girls not getting an education, we cannot relax. But it is just as ridiculous to look away from the progress that has been made. The consequent loss of hope can be devastating. When people wrongly believe that nothing is improving, they may lose confidence in measures that actually work. How can we help our brains to realise that things are getting better? Think of the world as a very sick premature baby in an incubator. After a week, she is improving, but she has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant\u2019s situation is improving? Yes. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying \u201cthings are improving\u201d imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it\u2019s both bad and better. That is how we must think about the current state of the world. Take girls\u2019 education. When women are educated, the workforce becomes diversified and able to make better decisions. Educated mothers have fewer children, and more survive. More energy is invested in each child\u2019s education: a virtuous cycle of change. Ninety per cent of girls of primary school age attend school; for boys, it\u2019s 92%. There are still gender differences when it comes to education in the poorest countries, especially in secondary and higher education, but that\u2019s no reason to deny the progress that has been made. Remember that the media and activists rely on drama to grab your attention; that negative stories are more dramatic than positive ones; and how simple it is to construct a story of crisis from a temporary dip pulled out of its context of a long-term improvement. When you hear about something terrible, calm yourself by asking: if there had been a positive improvement, would I have heard about that? Even if there had been hundreds of larger improvements, would I have heard? This is \u201cfactfulness\u201d: understanding as a source of mental peace. Like a healthy diet and regular exercise, it can and should become part of people\u2019s daily lives. Start to practise it, and you will make better decisions, stay alert to real dangers and possibilities, and avoid being constantly stressed about the wrong things. \u2022 Hans Rosling was a Swedish physician, academic and statistician, who died in 2017. This is an edited excerpt from his posthumously published book Factfulness: Ten Reasons We\u2019re Wrong about the World \u2013 and Why Things Are Better Than You Think (Sceptre), written with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling R\u00f6nnlund", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'It's been my compass': helping the homeless failed by the government | Rachel Obordo", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/its-been-my-compass-helping-the-homeless-failed-by-the-government", "date": "2018-04-03", "transcript": "From Tuesday rough sleepers and people at risk of homelessness in England will have a legal right to help from their local council. The Homelessness Reduction Act has been described as the \u201cmost significant legislation\u201d to tackle the issue for 40 years. It is hoped it will mean more early intervention and a reduction in rough sleeping, where numbers have risen 169% in England since 2010. It\u2019s good news for those who would otherwise be refused help by their local authorities but for some it\u2019s too little, too late from the government. Where official bodies have failed to help, communities have been supporting those who have experienced all forms of homelessness. Just off Silicon Roundabout in east London, named so because of the large number of tech businesses near Old Street, I meet members of Beam, a crowdfunding platform which allows those who have been homeless to seek donations towards the training and qualifications they need to work. Tarquin, who now works while training to be a gas safety engineer, raised just under \u00a34,000. His parents were drug users and he started at 14. He points outside and says: \u201cI grew up down the road with Tony (another member of the group) and heard how Beam helped him out. His story inspired me.\u201d Tarquin was in hostels and on the streets for more than half his life but has been drugs and alcohol free for nearly four years. \u201cWe get these cards from anonymous donors with words of encouragement like: \u2018My husband was a gas engineer, we live a good life and we want to help out.\u2019 It builds your esteem up,\u201d he says. Founded by Alex Stephany in September 2017, Beam has funded 20 campaigns and raised over \u00a343,000 for a range of industry-recognised qualifications. Defined as a social impact business, Stephany not only wanted to address the homelessness crisis but also \u201cuse technology to solve big real world problems\u201d. \u201cIn short, a social impact business makes money by doing good - and in a way that can be measured,\u201d he says. Working with charities, Beam helps individuals who have been referred by preparing a fundraising campaign, breaking down the costs and helping them crowdfund online. Supporters are kept up to date with a member\u2019s progress and often, when in stable employment, members choose to pay back the money raised and help fund other members\u2019 campaigns. One member, Jordan, tells me he wants to become an electrician. After leaving the armed forces he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cStructure is important for me,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout Beam I would be stressing about how my addiction would take hold of me again.\u201d Hana, a refugee from East Africa, has recently trained as a beautician. She says it was difficult when she was homeless. \u201cBeam has been my compass.\u201d Tony was one of the first people to benefit from the scheme and is dubbed its \u201cposter boy\u201d by Tarquin. Over the last 10 years he has sofa surfed, lived in hostels and slept in cars. \u201cI was a bit apprehensive and thought it might not work but it\u2019s more positive change than I was expecting. There used to be no light at the end for me, but the Beam\u2019s shining bright now.\u201d In Cambridge, those who are homeless \u2013 and not averse to cycling \u2013 can return to work with the help of Overstream Clean. It was developed in 2014 by Rachel Newell, 40, social enterprise manager for the charity Wintercomfort. People receive training then are given work in cleaning and gardening. \u201cOne of the problems for those living on the streets is that most people don\u2019t have the documentation needed to work,\u201d says Newell. \u201cWe help pay for birth certificates but for a bank account you need an address. It can sometimes be tricky to break the cycle.\u201d Overstream Clean, which only employs homeless people, uses bikes to get around the city. At the moment, 10 people work in cleaning with one person offering gardening services. An average of 20 to 30 people get involved annually with 60% of those who move into work afterwards remaining in employment. \u201cWe don\u2019t market ourselves as a social enterprise but as a professional cleaning company and it\u2019s great to see people feeling an affinity with what we do,\u201d says Newell. She says the scheme has attracted a lot of interest and they\u2019re hoping to grow and scale up operations. \u201cThere are a lot of people who want to work. Our gardener used to live under a bridge when he started volunteering with us. Now he works full time and has bought a motorcycle which he takes on holiday. People are just trying to make a go of things and we want to help where we can.\u201d Salisbury made headlines in March with the nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. A month on and there are signs of recovery but Austin Cohen says businesses are still being affected. \u201cIt\u2019s a small city,\u201d he says, \u201cand everyone knows each other, and after the recent news we wanted to do something positive.\u201d In 2017, the rate of those sleeping rough in Wiltshire was 72% higher than the previous year, with 2015 seeing the worst crisis in the last eight years with a 156% change compared to the year before. Cohen, 33, left his job as an accountant manager to set up a charity working with the homeless, vulnerable and elderly. \u201cI lost my parents when I was nine and I received a lot of kindness from people because of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been brought up in a way where it\u2019s natural to give back and help others.\u201d With freezing temperatures brought by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d in February, Cohen wanted to help those who were street homeless. In March he came up with the idea of offering hot drinks in mugs but with free refills at local cafes and churches. \u201cWe found that a lot of homeless people weren\u2019t really welcome in establishments,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cWe wanted to change that \u2026 It\u2019s not just about offering a warm cup of tea or coffee but feeling like a part of society.\u201d The mugs have been donated by Mole Country Stores and several commercial and church cafes offer free refills seven days a week. So far 23 mugs have been handed out and Cohen hopes to launch similar schemes in Southampton, Birmingham and Bristol. \u201cWe managed to deliver this project by just getting people to work together and I don\u2019t think it will need any funding. It started off as a community project and I hope it stays that way. \u201cI once gave a mug to a girl at church and she was so thankful. She said: \u2018Sometimes all I want is just someone to look at me, acknowledge me and see me.\u2019 That stayed with me. It\u2019s not much to say hello to a homeless person. Sometimes people just want someone to talk to.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'Being cash-free puts us at risk of attack': Swedes turn against cashlessness", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/being-cash-free-puts-us-at-risk-of-attack-swedes-turn-against-cashlessness", "date": "2018-04-03", "transcript": "It is hard to argue that you cannot trust the government when the government isn\u2019t really all that bad. This is the problem facing the small but growing number of Swedes anxious about their country\u2019s rush to embrace a cash-free society. Most consumers already say they manage without cash altogether, while shops and cafes increasingly refuse to accept notes and coins because of the costs and risk involved. Until recently, however, it has been hard for critics to find a hearing. \u201cThe Swedish government is a rather nice one, we have been lucky enough to have mostly nice ones for the past 100 years,\u201d says Christian Engstr\u00f6m, a former MEP for the Pirate Party and an early opponent of the cashless economy. \u201cIn other countries there is much more awareness that you cannot trust the government all the time. In Sweden it is hard to get people mobilised.\u201d There are signs this might be changing. In February, the head of Sweden\u2019s central bank warned that Sweden could soon face a situation where all payments were controlled by private sector banks. The Riksbank governor, Stefan Ingves, called for new legislation to secure public control over the payments system, arguing that being able to make and receive payments is a \u201ccollective good\u201d like defence, the courts, or public statistics. \u201cMost citizens would feel uncomfortable to surrender these social functions to private companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be obvious that Sweden\u2019s preparedness would be weakened if, in a serious crisis or war, we had not decided in advance how households and companies would pay for fuel, supplies and other necessities.\u201d The central bank governor\u2019s remarks are helping to bring other concerns about a cash-free society into the mainstream, says Bj\u00f6rn Eriksson, 72, a former national police commissioner and the leader of a group called the Cash Rebellion, or Kontantupproret. Until now, Kontantupproret has been dismissed as the voice of the elderly and the technologically backward, Eriksson says. \u201cWhen you have a fully digital system you have no weapon to defend yourself if someone turns it off,\u201d he says. \u201cIf Putin invades Gotland [Sweden\u2019s largest island] it will be enough for him to turn off the payments system. No other country would even think about taking these sorts of risks, they would demand some sort of analogue system.\u201d In this sense, Sweden is far from its famous concept of lagom \u2013 \u201cjust the right amount\u201d \u2013 but instead is \u201c100% extreme\u201d, Eriksson says, by investing so much faith in the banks. \u201cThis is a political question. We are leaving these decisions to four major banks who form a monopoly in Sweden.\u201d No system based on technology is invulnerable to glitches and fraud, says Mattias Skarec, 29, a digital security consultant. Yet Sweden is divided into two camps: the first says \u201cwe love the new technology\u201d, while the other just can\u2019t be bothered, Skarec says. \u201cWe are naive to think we can abandon cash completely and rely on technology instead.\u201d Skarec points to problems with card payments experienced by two Swedish banks just during the past year, and by Bank ID, the digital authorisation system that allows people to identify themselves for payment purposes using their phones. Fraudsters have already learned to exploit the system\u2019s idiosyncrasies to trick people out of large sums of money, even their pensions. The best case scenario is that we are not as secure as we think, Skarec says \u2013 the worst is that IT infrastructure is systemically vulnerable. \u201cWe are lucky that the people who know how to hack into them are on the good side, for now,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know how things will progress. It\u2019s not that easy to attack devices today, but maybe it will become easier to do so in the future.\u201d The banks recognise that digital payments can be vulnerable, just like cash. \u201cOf course there are people trying to abuse them, but they are no more vulnerable than any other method of payment,\u201d says Per Ekwall, a spokesperson for Swish, the immensely popular mobile payments system owned by Sweden\u2019s banks. \u201cFrom a macro perspective Swish has made it safer, and cheaper,\u201d he says. There is little point in fighting a trend that customers themselves are driving, the banks argue. But an opinion poll this month revealed unease among Swedes, with almost seven out of 10 saying they wanted to keep the option to use cash, while just 25% wanted a completely cashless society. MPs from left and right expressed concerns at a recent parliamentary hearing. Parliament is conducting a cross-party review of central bank legislation that will also investigate the issues surrounding cash. The Pirate Party \u2013 which made its name in Sweden for its opposition to state and private sector surveillance \u2013 welcomes a higher political profile for these issues. Look at Ireland, Christian Engstr\u00f6m says, where abortion is illegal. It is much easier for authorities to identify Irish women who have had an abortion if the state can track all digital financial transactions, he says. And while Sweden\u2019s government might be relatively benign, a quick look at Europe suggests there is no guarantee how things might develop in the future. \u201cIf you have control of the servers belonging to Visa or MasterCard, you have control of Sweden,\u201d Engstr\u00f6m says. \u201cIn the meantime, we will have to keep giving our money to the banks, and hope they don\u2019t go bankrupt \u2013 or bananas.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

At least 80 Olive Ridley turtles have made their way into the Arabian Sea from nests on the southern end of Versova beach in the past week, protected from wild dogs and birds of prey by volunteers who slept overnight in the sand to watch over them. Versova has undergone what the United Nations has called the \u201cworld\u2019s largest beach cleanup project\u201d over the past two years, transformed from a shin-deep dump yard for plastics and rubbish to a virtually pristine piece of coastline. The man who leads the ongoing cleanup operation, the lawyer Afroz Shah, said he started anticipating the turtle hatchings two months ago when farmers on the southern end of the two-mile (3km) beach reported seeing turtles in the sand. \u201cThe moment we got that news I knew something big was going to happen,\u201d he told the Guardian. Last Thursday, some of his volunteers called to say they had spotted dozens of baby Olive Ridley turtles emerging from their nests. He called the forest department and then went down to the beach with about 25 others, guarding the area while the tiny creatures hobbled across the sand, \u201cmaking sure not one hatchling suffered a death\u201d, he said. The Olive Ridley species, thought to be named for the olive-green hue of its upper shell, is the smallest and most abundant sea turtle in the ocean, but is still classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Mothers of the species lay eggs in an enormous mass-nesting process known as arribada. Last month on the coast of the eastern Indian state of Odisha, a record 428,083 Olive Ridley turtles nested simultaneously at the Rushikulya rookery. Though they nest elsewhere in Mumbai, none had been sighted on Versova beach in decades, due to the acute pollution problem there, Shah said. \u201cI had tears in my eyes when I saw them walking towards the ocean.\u201d Sumedha Korgaonkar, who is completing a PhD on Olive Ridley turtles with the Wildlife Institute of India, said it was possible small numbers of the turtles had been nesting on the beach in past years. \u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure since regular patrolling for turtles nests is not done in Mumbai,\u201d she said. \u201cBeach cleanups definitely have a positive effect on nesting turtles. Many beaches which are major nesting sites are cleaned prior and during the nesting season by villagers, which increases the chances of getting nests [there].\u201d For more than two years, Shah has been leading volunteers in manually picking up rubbish from Versova beach and teaching sustainable waste practices to villagers and people living in slums along the coastline and the creeks leading into it. About 55,000 people live along the beach and the waterways that feed it in the crowded megacity. Shah said he taught them by example, offering to clean communal toilets and pick up rubbish himself before he ever sought their help. \u201cFor the first six to eight weeks, nobody joined,\u201d he said. \u201cThen two men approached me and said, very politely, \u2018Please sir, can we wear your gloves?\u2019 Both of them just came and joined me. That\u2019s when I knew it was going to be a success.\u201d He said the team had cleaned 13m kg of debris from the beach in the past two years and are still going, though their campaign was briefly abandoned in November because of \u201cadministrative lethargy\u201d and harassment of volunteers. India has some of the most polluted waterways and beaches in the world due to rapid, unplanned urbanisation, overpopulation and neglectful attitudes, including to public littering. \u201cThere has been a loss of a sense of belonging,\u201d Shah said. \u201cYou can have laws, policies, regulations in place, but if the community doesn\u2019t have a sense of belonging, you can see what happens.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Like a housework hurricane, she got through mounds of clothes-washing, weeded the garden, cleaned the windows and mowed the lawn. It had been lovely to spend extra time with her 21-month-old son, but by the end of the third day off she was shattered. \u201cI actually found that day really hard. I ran myself ragged,\u201d laughs Taylor, who is a solo mother. \u201cI hadn\u2019t yet programmed that routine into my life. I thought: I don\u2019t know when the next one of these is coming, I better get everything done. I don\u2019t think I did it well, but heck it was a productive day!\u201d Taylor is one of 200 employees at New Zealand trustee company Perpetual Guardian, which is halfway through a six-week long trial which could have profound implications for the future of labour. Staff are working four days a week but getting paid for five. The experiment began in early March and will conclude in mid-April, after which productivity data will be collated and analysed. Employees will find out if the new routine will be adopted full-time in July. New Zealanders work an average of 1,752 hours a year, making them close to average compared with their OECD peers. Germans spend the least amount of time working annually, closely followed by Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, while Mexicans, Koreans and Costa Ricans clock the most. Luxembourg is the most productive country in the world, despite its workers toiling away for an average of only 29 hours per week. Last year the Autonomy Institute made renewed calls for the implementation of a four-day week, saying it would help even out the unhealthy distribution of work and shift the focus to producing better work in a shorter time. Christine Brotherton, head of people and capability for Perpetual Guardian, said many employees brought a similar level of focus to making the most of the extra day off as they would apply to their work. \u201cPeople have been thinking quite hard about that third day off and how best to use it so it can change their life. Some people come back to work and are incredibly energised,\u201d says Brotherton. \u201cPeople have been training for marathons, going to the dentist, getting their car serviced, or doing the shopping for their elderly parents. All the stuff that has been put on the back burner, but either helps themselves or their family. Life administration. \u201cBut some people haven\u2019t quite realised that if we have three days off, the four at the office have to be very productive, and we need to address that,\u201d she adds. For the last two years a Swedish care home trialled a six-hour work day, with mixed results. Benefits included a 10% drop in sick leave and higher job satisfaction, but overall increased costs by 20%. Amazon is also reportedly piloting a 30-hour work week for some employees. Whilst workers on the 30-hour work week receive the same benefits as full-time employees, they earn 75% of the salary \u2013 and results aren\u2019t in yet on the pilot\u2019s outcomes. KPMG and Deloitte offer four-day work weeks to some employees (with certain conditions attached), while Google allows some employees full control over 20% of their working week, hoping that the creative freedom will lead to new ideas and innovations. Perpetual Guardian\u2019s CEO, Andrew Barnes, a Briton, says the experiment is generating interesting data, which will be analysed by academics at two leading New Zealand universities before a decision on extending the trial is made. According to Barnes, some employees have found the reduced time to complete their work stressful. \u201cPeople were really positive going in, then a bit negative, then positive again,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cIn general terms, people are more positive because they are suddenly able to do things that they otherwise couldn\u2019t do.\u201d Supporters of reduced working hours have been cheering on the trial. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the pressure for it to succeed, but I think my staff do. People are telling me: we have to make this work for New Zealand,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cFrom my point of view, it\u2019s very difficult as an owner of a business to see any way that this is not positive for me at the moment.\u201d But he expressed disappointment at the lack of interest in the trial shown by the New Zealand government, despite its potential implications for addressing issues from work/life balance and the gender pay gap to the health and mental wellbeing of working New Zealanders. Having survived her day of housework, Kirsten Taylor has now settled into the new routine. She loves spending more time with her son, saving money on childcare and getting through her to-do list. Her personality and \u201chead down, bum up\u201d work style suit the arrangement perfectly, she says. While her colleagues still socialise during the work day, the office space is quieter and more concentrated, and \u201cwater-cooler chats\u201d are briefer. \u201cI am feeling significantly better equipped when I begin the work week now,\u201d she says. \u201c[The trial] was definitely more pressurised than I would ever have expected. But now I am nervous about when it ends. I don\u2019t know anyone who wants to return to the old routine.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

You wander down a road where most of the shops are boarded up. The bookmakers is open, but reeks of desperation, with gamblers hunched over fixed-odds machines. Next door, the payday loans place looks quiet, as does the pawnbroker. Moving on swiftly through a rising tide of discarded takeaway food containers, you reach the only entertainment in town: the tanning parlour. You start running now. Even the charity shops have closed down. The pound shop has a sale. You wake in a mucksweat, praying that this is not a vision of the future for the British high street. The figures, however, suggest these dystopian scenes are uncomfortably close to reality. According to the Centre for Retail Research, more than 11,000 major high street outlets have gone bust since 2008, affecting almost 140,000 employees. And, although the years 2008 and 2012 were the worst, the last 12 months have been traumatic, too. Agent Provocateur, Jaeger and Store Twenty One have gone under, and it\u2019s not only clothing retailers: photo studios, ice-cream parlours, pet-grooming centres, toyshops and bike shops have all buckled. Even the sex-toy industry is feeling the pinch: the Warrington-based chain Nice \u2019n\u2019 Naughty briefly went into administration in January 2018. The latest victims, not unexpectedly in business circles, have been Toys R Us and Maplin. Mothercare is restructuring its finances, Debenhams is considering closures, Claire\u2019s has declared bankruptcy and Jones Bootmaker has closed branches and been rescued for the second time in a year. The one consolatory note of recent times has been that cafes and restaurants were doing well. No more. Earlier this year, it was reported that Jamie\u2019s Italian and Byron Burgers are losing a third of their roster, more than 30 outlets. That news was quickly followed by the announcement that Jamie Oliver\u2019s Barbecoa had gone into administration, as has Square Pie. Prezzo is closing 94 restaurants. The accountancy firm Moore Stephens reports more than 1,500 restaurant insolvencies in the UK in 2017, and says that almost 15,000 others are under threat. One group not going out of business appears to be the experts commissioned to report on the decline. The average British high street would sink under the weight of all the pie charts and sage advice. A typical comment goes: \u201cHigher spending can be generated by a diverse town centre which can satisfy customers\u2019 needs for immediate purchase of the goods they want.\u201d In other words: if it\u2019s in stock, people might buy it. Among all the reports on high streets, the one that stands out for its clarity and intelligence comes from the retail guru Mary Portas. In 2011 she laid out the problems \u2013 supermarket sprawl, out-of-town shopping, the internet, and poor communication between councils, traders and landlords. She concluded, in a typically forthright manner: \u201cWe have sacrificed communities for convenience.\u201d What is certain is that the traditional high street of the last 50 years, founded on chain stores and well-known brands, is undergoing a brutal transformation. There are also, however, signs of what might emerge from this period of revolutionary change. In York\u2019s Bishopthorpe Road \u2013 Bishy Road to the local community \u2013 I settle down in the window of a high-street cafe-restaurant-bakery. Beppe Lombardo\u2019s Sicilian food outlet, Trinacria, is full of people having a mid-morning coffee; some are sampling the impressive range of homemade pastries and cakes, while a clutch of small children linger near the ice-cream display. \u201cWhen I came to York in 2001, there was no good ice-cream,\u201d says Lombardo, his expression hinting at the profound shock he had felt. \u201cNot like proper Sicilian ice-cream.\u201d He waves to a friend outside on the pavement. Lombardo waves a lot. He not only brought Sicilian ice-cream to York, he also brought a high standard of sociability and friendliness. He is involved in plans to stage a street Olympics and a dog show, and to use street art to engage with visitors. Does he worry about the economic downturn? \u201cWe are doing OK here. I don\u2019t think we need any more cafes and restaurants, but things are OK.\u201d Bishopthorpe Road is one of a few high streets around the country that have bucked the downward trend, managing to revive and reinvent itself during one of the harshest retailing recessions ever. That is in stark contrast to York\u2019s premier shopping strip, Coney Street, where 20% of units lie empty. What really hurts is that some of these outlets are the most beautiful storefronts in England: when Jones Bootmaker closed nearby, it shuttered the windows on the magnificent, gabled birthplace of explorer Thomas Herbert, a man who witnessed another brutal revolution in his time, standing behind Charles I on the scaffold in 1649. Less than a mile away, a stroll down Bishopthorpe Road reveals many of the elements that are on everyone\u2019s wishlist for a decent local high street: a handful of excellent cafes and restaurants, hardware shop, chemist, baker, two greengrocers, a brace of small supermarkets, pub, bike shop, deli and butcher. Most are independent, and many have won awards. The street was voted Britain\u2019s best high street in 2015. \u201cBishy Road fully deserves the title,\u201d said Marcus Jones, minister for high streets at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sharing Bishy\u2019s top tips with other high streets across the country to make sure others learn from their success.\u201d What is really fascinating about this success is that it is not a glamorous location, a street laden with tourist attractions or backed by upmarket housing; it is a socially mixed area and, at first glance, a very ordinary British shopping street. How did it pull off such a trick? I go to see Johnny Hayes, local councillor and co-owner of Frankie and Johnny\u2019s kitchenware shop, and Andy Shrimpton from the Cycle Heaven bike shop. Both have lived and worked in the area for more than 30 years and were instrumental in turning Bishopthorpe Road around. \u201cIt was quite depressed back in the late 70s,\u201d says Hayes. \u201cThe council had a plan to bulldoze a dual-carriageway ring road through the area \u2013 you know, the car was the undisputed king in those days. The plan was never implemented, but it created uncertainty.\u201d By 2008 a fifth of shops were empty, several others were hanging on, and even the bargain booze shop was struggling. \u201cWhen the post office closed, I really thought we were in trouble,\u201d says Hayes. \u201cIn fact it was the start of the upswing. Two things happened. We got the Pig and Pastry cafe opening \u2013 local owners who knew everyone and worked damn hard to make a brilliant little place to eat \u2013 and then in 2010 Andy came to me with an idea.\u201d \u201cI was inspired by cycling trips to Copenhagen,\u201d says Shrimpton. \u201cThere was a sense of neighbourhood and community \u2026 I thought, why can\u2019t all cities be like this?\u201d It was a simple plan. Gather all the shops together under one banner, or more precisely one website, and launch it with a street party. \u201cIt was a eureka moment,\u201d says Hayes. \u201cAt 6pm we closed the road to traffic. There was hardly a soul about. We put up some bunting and set out a few stalls. By 6.20 there were 3,000 people out there. The butcher gave away burgers, there were bands, people were dancing. I could not believe it. I realised there was so much goodwill. I thought, \u2018We are going to be all right.\u2019\u201d What Hayes was witnessing, on a grand scale, was the creation of what urban planners call \u201ca sticky street\u201d. The phrase was popularised by the Canadian planner Brent Toderian, who has helped redesign cities all around the world. \u201cOur conversations about streets were always about movement for cars, or movement for people,\u201d Toderian says. \u201cThe measurements for success from engineers were about how many cars or people we could move through a space as quickly as possible. But there was very little conversation about how people actually use, enjoy and love streets, and how lingering should actually be a measurable definition of success for a great street.\u201d Toderian has a refreshing, real-world practicality. He cites the visionary Danish architect and designer Jan Gehl, who in the early 1960s synthesised psychology and architecture to reboot the planners\u2019 approach to city living. Gehl railed against \u201cbird shit\u201d architecture and towers dropped in from the heavens by globe-trotting architects, and championed the pedestrian and the cyclist. A couple of years ago, back on Bishopthorpe Road, the cafe owners had spotted a bit of potential \u201cstickiness\u201d for themselves. The Victorian architects who had raised the terraced houses here back in the 1860s had given each property a forecourt garden. The houses had soon become shops and the gardens were lost to the pavement. Now the cafes claimed it back, putting in chairs and tables to create an opportunity for visitors to stick around. Something about this reminded me of old Calcutta. Amid the exuberant vitality of that city, cars and people certainly move slowly, but the space is often creative, sociable and hugely enjoyable. In comparison, I recently sailed down the Thames through London, noting the sterile apartment towers thrown up by speculative builders. At the foot of each was an empty space \u2013 clean, manicured and without any human presence. Dr Johnson needs rephrasing: when London is tired of man, London is tired of life. Of course, nostalgia for a supposed golden age of the high street could be misleading. But, I wondered, was there ever a heyday for the high street? Local York historian Sue Major is cautious about suggesting Bishopthorpe Road street life was better in Victorian times. But, she says, \u201cIt might be argued that with heavier traffic along the street in the last 50 years, people have been less likely to spend time there for leisure.\u201d Looking through the pages of the York Herald newspaper, there are plenty of suggestions that street life was more colourful and boisterous than today. In the narrow streets behind Bishy Road you could find a brewery, a dye works, a shipbuilding yard, a steam-powered chocolate factory, a candied-peel maker, and a wooden type manufacturer. There were regular galas, parades and occasional trips over the river to witness a hanging. At Martinmas, every November, Wombwell\u2019s menagerie would come, the wagons full of wild beasts hauled by elephants. Some of the lion collection had been born in York\u2019s Parliament Street in 1856. The whole panoply of Dickensian street life was present, including the threat of \u201cpocket pickers\u201d and the possibility of destitution. One local musician, Joseph Sherwood, kept a diary that shows how, struggling to make ends meet during the 1880s, he turned his Bishopthorpe Road house into a newsagents, which is now the Pig and Pastry cafe. High streets may have been livelier back then, but they were a school of hard knocks for business. The photo record for Bishopthorpe Road shows how shops were founded, thrived and foundered in an endless bout of retail creation and destruction. The piano-dealer and beer-seller became an estate agent, then a florist; the Dainty cafe became a baker, then a hairdresser. Others have stood the test of time: the fish and chip shop, for example, is Victorian vintage. Pete Kilbane, manager of the Angel on the Green bar and restaurant, is a stalwart of the social-ownership movement, having started a community garden, cinema and nightclub, as well as the Golden Ball pub (which has over 180 local shareholders). He thinks social ownership has a part to play. \u201cIt takes away some financial pressure and means we can have events that are beneficial, but not money-making.\u201d The bar at the Golden Ball tells its own story, selling eggs, bread and pies from local suppliers as well as real ales. Some locals have been coming to the folk music sessions for over 45 years. Kilbane knows the importance of preserving an area\u2019s informal spaces. \u201cWe\u2019re slow to get to know one another, aren\u2019t we? So people need places where they have a valid reason to be. Working together on the community garden, doing the composting \u2013 that created the relationships that went on to buy the pub.\u201d Having spent years creating venues for interaction, he is now eyeing up the newly available empty shop across the road from the Angel \u2013 a rare occurrence on Bishopthorpe Road. \u201cI want it to be another bar,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThen we\u2019ve got a scene, haven\u2019t we?\u201d In the past people went to the high street for shopping and work, just like today, but they also went for entertainment and leisure. That state of affairs may be returning. York\u2019s smaller shopping streets, once shabby and depressed compared with the centre, are now in better shape than ever. With support from the council on road closures, historic streets like Micklegate and Fossgate are holding events that attract crowds. The independent movement has spawned a city map and website. The strength of smaller high streets has not gone unnoticed. Figures from business research analysts LDC show that the number of independent outlets has risen all over England in every region during the past year, while chain stores have declined. When Portas wrote her report in 2011 she highlighted the lamentable case of Ely, a Cambridgeshire town that seemed to be deliberately strangling its own high street, building out-of-town shopping with a free bus service. But since then independent shops have moved in, accounting for 89% of retail growth, and making Ely high street a success story akin to York\u2019s Bishopthorpe Road. Gehl\u2019s influence is apparent in healthy cities all around the world. After his redesign of Melbourne, the number of street cafes rose 12-fold. \u201cA good city,\u201d he says, \u201cis like a good party \u2013 people stay longer than really necessary.\u201d On a smaller scale, applying that motto to British high streets appears to be bearing fruit. Portas came to similar conclusions. \u201cWe need,\u201d she declared, \u201cto put the heart back into the centre of our high streets, reimagined as destinations for socialising, culture, health, wellbeing, creativity and learning.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

After a career in biology, Edward O Wilson was convinced that Earth was being stripped of its variety of life. Scientists hadn\u2019t even counted all the species sharing the planet, yet they were already disappearing fast. In a paper soon to become seminal, he set out the looming catastrophe. The chopping down of tropical rainforests meant that, within a century, about 12% of all bird species in the Amazon basin would be lost for ever. This was a mass extinction \u2013 \u201cthe most extreme for 65 million years\u201d. Titled The Biological Diversity Crisis, his essay helped give birth to a shorthand: biodiversity. This new discipline began from the premise that all species matter \u2013 indeed, that when one dies out they all suffer. An expert on the unphotogenic ant, Wilson wryly acknowledged \u201cthe natural human affection for big organisms\u201d, for sleek dolphins and cute chimps. But he also knew that even a mouse \u201cis richer in information than a Caravaggio painting, Bach fugue, or any other great work of art\u201d. Although an environmentalist, his warning applies to post-industrial Britain too. Because our economy has become more and more unbalanced, with our fortunes hitched to a few industries in one corner of the country, while we let other sectors, such as manufacturing, slide. That last sentence is not mine, but taken word for word from David Cameron\u2019s very first speech upon moving into No 10 in 2010. And he was right: the UK\u2019s lack of economic diversity led it to be utterly flattened by the banking crash. Shamefully, despite identifying the problem, he did almost nothing about it. A decade after the crash, finance grips London more tightly than ever. No longer penned into the Square Mile and Canary Wharf, it now gropes its way along the South Bank and has turned Mayfair into a shadow-banking quarter. The rest of the city centre provides butler services to the super-rich: luxury developers and estate agents, fad restaurateurs, tax-loophole spotters, reputation launderers in PR. For Cameron\u2019s Conservative colleagues, this is success, to be celebrated. In 2014, the capital\u2019s then-mayor, Boris Johnson, rejoiced: \u201cLondon is to billionaires what the jungles of Sumatra are to the orangutan. It is their natural habitat.\u201d Groovy for the great apes, not so fun for us worker ants. Economic diversity in the heart of the capital now hides out in some unlikely places. Go to Bermondsey, just a tube stop away from London Bridge. Follow the signs to the old further education college, whose students and teachers have long gone. Upstairs is a former home economics kitchen, the kind in which you tried and failed to cook an apple crumble. Except now it\u2019s a farm. Over by the windows, mealworms are breeding. Running along the walls are tanks of fish. In the middle is a mini-greenhouse with huge water tanks where tomatoes and squash will sprout. Any free space is crammed with leafy green plants. And just wait till you hear the plans for a trout farm. Here, slap-bang in the middle of the capital, lies agriculture. Nestling in this abandoned college are a whole bunch of companies. And the laser cutters and 3D printers make it a manufacturing site too. Most of all, it\u2019s a challenge to Britain\u2019s crocked model of how to shape a city, how to a run an economy, and how to affix value. As challenges go, it\u2019s rough and ready, and a tad dog-eared \u2013 but it demands attention. This deserted campus was spotted by a not-for-profit company called 3Space, which convinced the landlord to give it the keys until demolition day. Since then it has made it a base for an army of eager startups, who pay a modest rent. This income then subsidises other rooms that go free to non-profits. And one day in 2016, 3Space boss Andrew Cribb rang up a guy he\u2019d met a while back. \u201cHey, Ande. Remember your crazy green idea?\u201d he said. \u201cFancy doing it?\u201d Cribb was wrong: Ande Gregson didn\u2019t have one crazy idea \u2013 he had a couple. The green one came from reading about food. He\u2019d see numbers, like the UN forecast that, by 2050, 9.8 billion people would share the planet, and he\u2019d worry: how are we going to feed all of them? Then he\u2019d read how 1.3bn tonnes of food are wasted every year, and he\u2019d think: I\u2019m going to help fix this. Him. Without government backing or a multinational\u2019s budget. Him. With no background in food or environment. When he was nine, Gregson wanted to be a marine biologist \u2013 but as a child of the 1980s he was given a Commodore computer, and from that point it was technology all the way. His CV was peppered with names such as Apple, BT and Sky. What did he know about public sanitation? That was a big obstacle, which he hurdled with yet more unusual thinking. He opened a laboratory \u2013 called Green Lab \u2013 which others could use to invent solutions to the looming crisis in food and waste. He wouldn\u2019t employ any of them, but they\u2019d share the space and the hi-tech equipment, and make their own ideas fly. Green Lab is a makerspace, and Britain has more than 150 of them. But You can find thousands of others from Barcelona to Shenzhen. Gregson\u2019s approach is the makerspace ethos in action. Rather than rely on big institutions to solve the food crisis, he just dived in, displaying the same bloody-mindedness that led him to compete in the Marathon des Sables (the \u201ctoughest footrace in the world\u201d) not once but three times. Instead of snaring himself some qualifications, he brought in a pool of expertise. And when things got mucky, he got his hands dirty \u2013 clearing the kitchen of years of debris and turning old timber into benches and tables. Makerspaces are full of such stories \u2013 of begging and borrowing, of just doing it, of fools rushing in where angel investors fear to tread. \u201cAnimal spirits\u201d is how John Maynard Keynes referred to it, the bullishness that gets businesses investing and consumers spending. In his canonical The Maker Movement Manifesto, Mark Hatch writes: \u201cMake. Just make. This is the key. The world is a better place as a participatory sport. Being creative, the act of creating and making, is actually fundamental to what it means to be human.\u201d Britons get their furniture from Ikea, their lunch in Pret and their love lives off Tinder. We buy, break and junk \u2013 and to hell with the environmental consequences. Instead of that pre-digested individualism, Gregson and other makerspacers want to improvise, recycle and collaborate. Gregson calls Green Lab a \u201cWilly Wonka factory\u201d: a crew of enthusiasts pursuing their own outlandish projects, all to do with making the most of our food supply and reducing waste. Fish skins are turned into leather; tiny green vegetables are grown in repurposed airducts. At Entocycle, black soldier flies are bred on spent grain from local breweries to turn them into a high-protein meal for salmon \u2013 a possible replacement for the far more land-intensive soya beans. This work has social value, yet most of the people here wouldn\u2019t get space to do it elsewhere in the capital. The fish tanner, Anoushka Cole, is going through the same London hell as most other 28-year-olds: the only way she can afford her small flatshare on the city\u2019s outskirts is by cramming three people into two bedrooms. A former cycle courier, Jon Katona spent half a decade carting around heavy, urgent deliveries on a precarious contract with no sick pay or holidays \u2013 a work-history that leaves him with little cash to get his sustainable drinks business off the ground. Gregson has a solution: outfits such as Entocycle, which has gained funding, can use Green Lab but \u201csilver will cross my palm before you walk through the door\u201d. Others such as Katona pay nothing, but are expected to help out with the composting system. Politicians in Westminster and London\u2019s City Hall have essentially created a business model for the capital in which young people are expected to live and work in intolerable conditions; that in turn starves the city of the new ideas and energy on which it relies. Makerspaces are usually found in rundown buildings, with rudimentary toilets and equipment straining under all that shared use. They are small-scale factories, run not by a big company but by communities of the idiosyncratic and inventive. They are also oases of cheapness in a city that extorts money from its residents \u2013 and the great urban theorist Jane Jacobs knew the value of cheap. \u201cFor really new ideas of any kind \u2013 no matter how ultimately profitable or otherwise successful some of them might prove to be \u2013 there is no leeway for such chancy trial, error and experimentation in the high-overhead economy of new construction,\u201d she wrote in The Death and Life of Great American Cities in 1961. \u201cOld ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.\u201d Green Lab bears that out to the letter: it\u2019s a home for the genuinely speculative in an economy that thrives on financial speculation. Politicians love makerspaces \u2013 for all the wrong reasons. They coo over their digital technology and are wowed by their occupants\u2019 relative youth. Yet they overlook how makerspaces\u2019 tolerance for the uneconomic makes them so important \u2013 and so fragile in a city with galloping rents. Green Lab runs on borrowed things \u2013 most of all, borrowed time. By the end of this year, it will be booted out of that college, which will itself be bulldozed to make way for new flats and shops \u2013 and London will have lost a bit more of its economic diversity. In just the seven years to 2013, the capital saw almost 604 hectares \u2013 about 750 football pitches-worth \u2013 of industrial land disappear to make way for housing. The simple-minded assertion that London needs more houses, so often chanted by politicians and pundits alike, takes little account of how affordable they should be and where their occupants are meant to work if the space for employment has been magicked into concierge towers. Gregson is \u201cbuilding a piggybank\u201d to move elsewhere, but is resigned to being edged out of the centre. This is happening to makerspaces across the city. Some die natural deaths: their animal spirits only carrying them so far. But others suffer the lethal blow of runaway rents. Machines Room is about to lose its east London home because its rent has doubled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to people for ages about possible new sites,\u201d says Nat Hunter of Machines Room. \u201cJust. Not. Happening.\u201d David Cameron promised Britain that \u201cthe new jobs, the new products, the new ideas that will lift us up will be born in the factories\u201d. Although they will never create thousands of jobs, makerspaces do fit the \u201cnew ideas\u201d bit. Britain now does proportionately less research and development than Slovenia, but a place such as Green Lab is full of experiment and innovation. If politicians really do want to do more with makerspaces than use them for photo-ops, they could do so cheaply and relatively easily. Local councils could identify empty sites for makerspaces to set up, and could collect registers of residents and other businesses who are willing to help with accounts and marketing and old kit. Most of all, they could lean on Ikea, DFS and other retailers to tell their shoppers about these nearby scrappy little places (who pose no threat to such giants), where kitchens and furniture can be customised by young artisans who are inventive, and a damn sight more interesting to talk to than a self-service checkout. None of that requires money \u2013 just some of the effort and inventiveness shown by the makerspaces themselves. The reward would be young people getting a start in their careers, and a city retaining a bit of economic diversity. \u2022 We\u2019d like to hear about your experiences of makerspaces, or similar.

Once a low-security prison, it is in a depressing state of disrepair. The private company running the government facility plans improvements, but the flood of desperate \u201cresidents\u201d has pushed these firmly on to the back burner. Residents are not prisoners, but a perceived scarcity of social resources means public opinion towards them is volatile; in response, the government has set an extremely small immigration quota. Residents undergo rigorous assessment in order to have their immigration applications even considered. The border is with Wales. The refugees are from England, Scotland, Ireland and parts of Europe whose economic status has crashed post-Brexit. The setting is the near future, and this is a game. Live action role play, or larp, is a combination of re-enactment, storytelling and gaming \u2013 players are given a role and act out their character\u2019s actions within an overarching story. These interactive games can last a few hours or spin out over months and years, with players adopting familiar characters time and time again. If you\u2019ve come across larping before, you might associate it with orcs, elves and swordplay \u2013 a dynamic offshoot of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons. But although mythical creatures can be involved, a growing number of larp games explore situations, stories and characters as a form of activism. The creators of a new experience, The Quota, decided to use larp to tackle one of the most fraught issues facing the world today: the refugee crisis. Halat Hisar, a Palestinian-Finnish larp, explores life under occupation. Other larps include the seminal Just a Little Lovin\u2019, set in a fictionalised New York in the early years of the Aids crisis. Even a recent Jane Austen-inspired larp had lessons to teach on social inequality \u2013 alongside dancing and witty conversation, of course. One worry is that these larps involve people of comparative privilege \u201cplaying\u201d at being refugees or people with Aids. Helly Dabill, one of The Quota\u2019s creators, understands the concern. \u201cWe acknowledge that people who are not familiar with larping, or whose idea of it remains firmly entrenched in fantasy games with orcs and goblins, are often shocked at the topics that larp is willing to explore.\u201d But, she adds, people also write novels about difficult subjects, or plays, or make feature films. \u201cAll of these things can be harrowing, powerful and informative. They make people think. Most importantly, they start a dialogue about difficult subjects.\u201d The Quota\u2019s charitable partner, the Refugee Council, agrees. \u201cThousands of people, including children, are deprived of their liberty and detained arbitrarily in the UK every year,\u201d says the council\u2019s chief executive, Maurice Wren. \u201cThe Refugee Council is hugely supportive of events and productions which, like the Quota, aim to raise awareness of this terrible wrong in an original and creative way.\u201d Larp creation often begins with personal experience. Dabill has worked in Israel with displaced Palestinians, as well as with child refugees. Halat Hisar is run by a creative team that includes four Palestinians living on the West Bank, while Just a Little Lovin\u2019s designers, Tor Kjetil Edland and Hanne Grasmo, are HIV and Aids activists. The impetus for all these creators is to educate through empathy. \u201cLarp is a medium of personal, direct experience. The things that happen in a larp happen specifically to you. It feels different to actually walk through a checkpoint rather than just read about it,\u201d says Kaisa Kangas, one of the people behind Halat Hisar. Grasmo agrees: \u201cWe want [participants] to build stronger communities, to understand how it was and is to be queer, whether they are themselves or not. I personally hope that when having experienced how easy it can be to express and accept your desires, the black emotions of fear of death, the hard dilemmas over what to do with their fictional lives and friendships, they will think about what is important in their own life.\u201d But can larps really be transformative? Andreas Lieberoth, associate professor of education at Aarhus University in Denmark, believes so. He says: \u201cThe more I study larp and the learning sciences together, the more I become convinced that larps can hold immense educational potential.\u201d. And learning though role play is not a modern phenomenon, he stresses. \u201cSince the 1930s, social psychologists have been aware that we are more open to new ideas, and willing to give ideas that may seem irrelevant or even contrary to our own beliefs fair consideration, if we are asked to take on the role of a person holding such beliefs.\u201d Larp is even used in some schools, including one in Denmark where all teaching is achieved through immersive \u201clearning games\u201d. The Quota is recruiting its final players before the game takes place in May. Dabill says she hopes the experience will change its participants. \u201cYou will deepen your understanding of the ties that bind people together and their ability to withstand the forces of dehumanisation and alienation \u2013 and, above all, the costs to everyone when these bonds break.\u201d That detention centre on the Welsh border may not be real, but it\u2019s clear the stakes are high.

This year, the WWF, which manages the initiative, hopes to build on its growing success and says millions of actions will be taken in at least 180 countries and territories. A record 187 countries took part in the event\u2019s record breaking 10th year. An hour is not going to save the world \u2013 but a key message in publicising the event is that every action counts and that energised individuals can make genuine change to the way we think about human impact on the planet. The WWF says highlights of its pushes for new legislation include the banning of all plastics in the Galapagos in 2014, planting 17 million trees in Kazakhstan and pushing new laws for the protection of seas and forests in Russia. Here, readers tell us how they are going further than the hour (you should switch off the lights from 8:30-9:30pm local time) with gestures such as refusing plastic, leaving the car at home and hosting events to inspire others in 2018. \u2018It is wrong to think we as individuals can\u2019t achieve something meaningful\u2019 \u2013 Jen Gale, 40, Wiltshire I\u2019m making my own promise for the planet and refusing plastic cutlery when eating out, and I\u2019m asking all the members of my 15k-strong Facebook community to join in, make their own pledges on 24 March and spread the word. When faced with huge issues like plastic pollution and climate change, it can feel overwhelming, as if we as individuals could never hope to achieve anything meaningful, but this is so wrong! Earth Hour is a brilliant event to raise awareness of the plight of the planet and allows people to show that they care. If everybody who makes a promise carries through with it, and the changes continue beyond Earth Hour, it really will make a difference in reducing the amount of plastic and carbon overloading the planet. \u2018We will need to look at every part our lifestyles\u2019 \u2013 Tim Eggins, 50, Chard, Somerset I am part of a local community group called Sustainable Chard. We have organised a day of events called Earth Hour Chard, including events aimed at the younger members of our town where they can learn about upcycling, renewable energy, planting and growing. During the afternoon there will be eco talks and workshops where people can learn how to reduce their impact on the planet with topics on travel, food, the home and carbon footprints and in the evening we have assembled live bands, musicians, poets, green traders and therapists for an Earth Hour extravaganza. We aim to engage as many people as possible, showing that the event is more than just switching off the lights: if we are to make any impact on climate change we will need to look at every part our lifestyles. \u2018I\u2019ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car\u2019 \u2013 Tehya, 18, Zurich I am not just going to turn the lights off for an hour, I want to try to live in as environmentally friendly way as possible for the day. I will tell as many people as possible at school and locally to convince them to contribute to the effort. At home, I\u2019ll unplug all electrical devices and lights during Earth Hour. I\u2019ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car and to use public transport instead. I will not buy any plastic (food in plastic wrappings, bottles etc) or meat (which I don\u2019t do anyway, as I am a vegetarian). In the evening when it\u2019s dark I will try to not turn on any lights and use candles for light instead. \u2018We hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation\u2019 \u2013 Eric Engle, 32, West Virginia Our voluntary organisation Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action has convinced Parkersburg city government, the county government and the federal buildings to turn off all the lights that they can. We\u2019ll have a candlelit event with acoustic music at a park in the midst of dimmed downtown on the night. We hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation and energy efficiency and to educate on anthropogenic global climate change while encouraging environmental and climate activism and continued coalition-building. \u2018Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility\u2019 \u2013 Jo Harper, Leamington Spa At the school where I teach, we all wrote promises for the planet and hung them on our \u201cpromise tree\u201d. I made 120 vegan flapjacks so that we could have a plastic-free breaktime and the children brought wild cuddly toys to school to raise money to sponsor four endangered animals. At home I am holding a candlelit Earth Hour dinner for 12 people, for which none of the ingredients can have been packed in plastic or use unsustainable palm oil. It\u2019s quite a challenge! Earth Hour is largely symbolic, but it gets people thinking about the environment and what they can do personally. My message is that if we all do something, together we can make a big difference. By making promises about what we can do ourselves, it forces us to consider our own impact on the environment and our own responsibility. Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility. By holding the dinner party and asking some of my guests to make a plastic-free pudding, we have all become more aware of how plastic surrounds almost everything we buy. I now look at my shopping in a different way and I hope that other people will do so too. \u2018Our Guides are spending a whole evening without electricity \u2013 Amy Billington, 23, Bangor I run a Guide unit in Groomsport, County Down, and we are participating in this year\u2019s Earth Hour by running the entire evening in the dark, with no electricity. We are doing an environmental scavenger hunt around the local area as we meet beside the sea, gathering items such as plastics and litter to clean up our village a little bit, toasting marshmallows under tealights and trying to draw pictures in the dark. We hope to raise awareness of both Earth Hour itself and the WWF aims and values locally within our community. We want to do our bit in helping save the planet and show the Guides that you do not need to use so much electricity. We hope this event will inspire other local Guide, Brownie and Rainbow units to do the same and make this an annual event. \u2018We\u2019re hosting a community evening, cooking rescued surplus food from local farms\u2019 \u2013 Charmaine Jacobs, Kent I run a social enterprise called the Gastro Hub in Folkestone aiming to connect people through sustainable food, cooking, conversation and communal dining experiences. Our overall mission is to reduce avoidable food waste and carbon emissions by preventing surplus food from going to landfill, through a community-led infrastructure to divert and transform this food into delicious and nutritious meals. For Earth Hour we are hosting a community candlelit supper serving warming soup made with surplus vegetables rescued from farms by the Gleaning Network in Kent. We are hoping to spread awareness of the individual and collective power we have to affect change on our environment. By bringing local people together in a way that demonstrates simple actions we can all take to reduce our carbon footprint, we hope that it will inspire a positive behaviour shift-change in others.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "The rebel bank, printing its own notes and buying back people's debts", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/hoe-street-central-bank-walthamstow-london-debt", "date": "2018-03-23", "transcript": "First there were the banks. Sending credit cards through the post, offering easy loans. They overstretched, teetered. Then came the billion-dollar bailouts, recession, austerity, poverty and payday loans. Then, slowly, came the movement: a piecemeal, sporadic effort to buy back the debt of ordinary people. Now in north-east London, an enterprise that is part art installation, part stunt and part charitable endeavour, has brought all the threads together: a bank that prints its own money, sells it for real tender and uses the proceeds to buy back the debt. Hilary Powell and Dan Edelstyn have taken over an old Co-op bank on a high street in Walthamstow and are printing money featuring the faces of people behind four local services \u2013 a primary school, a foodbank, a youth project and a soup kitchen. As well as raising money for those projects, Hoe Street Central Bank aims to raise enough money to buy out \u00a31m of debt owned by people within the E17 postcode, in a London borough ranked 35th most deprived in the country. \u201cWe see it as a community heist taking on the economic discourse,\u201d says Powell. One of the delightful ironies of the undertaking is that the \u2018bank\u2019 could only have to raise as little as \u00a320,000 to buy out \u00a31m of local debt, because bad loans are often written down to a fraction of their face value in the secondary market. \u201cThe system forces people into debt for basic needs,\u201d says Powell. \u201cWe are the forerunners of what we hope will be a bigger movement for debt abolition.\u201d As the bank did its unusual trade this week, schoolchildren were invited in to watch a batch of \u00a35, \u00a310 and \u00a320 notes, all designed by artists, roll off the presses. After all, it\u2019s not every day that you see your headteacher\u2019s face on a fiver. Bank notes featuring Tracy Griffiths were pegged onto string across the space to dry. The husband and wife creative partnership were influenced by the Strike Debt and Rolling Jubilee initiatives in the US, which started to buy debt and abolish it for ethical reasons. In 2014, Strike Debt bought $3.8m worth of students\u2019 loans, and spawned other ad hoc initiatives: in 2016 TV host John Oliver bought and wrote off $15m of medical debt held by 9,000 people. The Rolling Jubilee campaign has raised over $700,000 \u2013 enough to buy back over $30m debt. One of the artists who is working as a money printer at the Walthamstow \u2018bank\u2019 (paid at the London living wage) on the project was drawn to it because he\u2019s local and had personal experience of debt. \u201cMy parents lost their home during the recession,\u201d says Alistair Gentry. \u201cAnyone can get into debt. It doesn\u2019t matter how rich you are to start with... It feels really good to roll up your sleeves and literally get inky, but also metaphorically, to do something about it. Not just sit around and having a moan.\u201d The bank is open until Sunday 25 March. Artists will print money in the day and there will be a series of talks in the evenings. Edelstyn and Powell are making a film about the project, debt and the economic system called Bank Job. \u201cImagine if we could get it on every economics course at every university or every sixth form economics,\u201d says Powell. \u201cThen the reach of this goes beyond this high street to all over the country.\u201d The project has had the offshoot benefit of helping to strengthen community bonds as most of the people involved are local. \u201cWe live just down the road and that\u2019s a real attraction to it,\u201d says Edelstyn. \u201cI used to feel like I didn\u2019t have time to know anyone in the community. We\u2019re all so stressed just trying to make ends meet. The idea of political engagement with groups in your community seemed like a nice idea but slightly scary and unachievable. \u201cBut when I started to research this and get in touch with local projects, I found that everyone has a good sense of humour and they\u2019re all normal human beings. We created this conversation across the borough, and connected different people together. That\u2019s basically what this is. It\u2019s just a way of talking.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Surveyors claimed there were just five species of bird at risk from the development. \u201cWe can show that in Curbridge village there are at least 50 species,\u201d Smith counters. And he has proof: a large black photo album filled with photographs of birds, some of which are threatened species, taken by him and other villagers. He flicks through it. \u201cHere\u2019s a kestrel, buzzard, stock dove, wood pigeon, collared dove, barn owl, tawny owls, green woodpecker, greater-spotted woodpecker, jay, magpie, jackdaw, rook, blue tit, carrion crow, coal tit, song thrush, swallow, house martin, long-tailed tit, bullfinches ... \u201d Smith believes that bird life has not been factored in by developers eyeing land in Curbridge, a village of 160 homes, where 14 additional homes are currently under construction and a further 85 are proposed by another developer for the green space at the heart of the village. This is on top of huge development to the north of the village, on grassland where locals used to walk their dogs and watch deer roam, where 1,000 homes are being built as an expansion of the town of Witney. All of this is part of a plan to build 15,950 homes in the west Oxfordshire district council area by 2031. In an ecological survey commissioned by the developer for the building already underway in Curbridge, just five species of bird were identified as living in the area. But Smith\u2019s group have counted up more than 50 species and the British Trust for Ornithology confirmed they have recorded sightings of 63 different species for a 2km area that covers Curbridge. Concerns about habitat have increased after French researchers announced this week that bird populations have fallen by a third across the French countryside in the last 15 years, due to the use of pesticides which have killed off the insects on which birds feed. German scientists have also reported a stunning decline in insect numbers in nature reserves. The concern is that modern agriculture and urban development are having a catastrophic impact on species across the natural world. \u201cThe loss of that one field in Curbridge might not send shock waves through the natural world, but there are thousands upon thousands of them being lost all over the countryside and that is scary,\u201d says Roselle Chapman, the community ecologist for Wild Oxfordshire. Driven by concern for their birds, and the changing character of their village, Smith and other members of the village have spent the last six months fighting to ensure residents\u2019 voices are heard about the plans. As part of this effort, Smith has written his own ecological survey using the observations of local twitchers. This collecting of records is exactly what communities who want to protect their land should do, says Chapman. \u201cOne of the problems is that the public thinks that there are people out there who know what species and habitats are where and that this information will automatically feed into the planning system,\u201d she says. \u201cThe sad truth it that some parts are well surveyed. But the rest of it, the bits that aren\u2019t protected or farmed, which still provide habitat for many species and recreational space for people, is very poorly recorded and therefore it looks as though nothing lives there.\u201d She says her basic advice to communities when it comes to land is \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d. \u201cIf you value a green space in your parish then work with your parish council to survey it, create a management plan for it and manage it ... Don\u2019t wait for the developers to come knocking.\u201d Further east, in Buckinghamshire, the developers are knocking, but their work might actually provide a net gain for biodiversity. Aylesbury Vale district council has teamed up with the developer Barratt Homes and the RSPB to make sure Kingsbrook, a new development of 2,500 homes near Milton Keynes, had wildlife concerns at its heart from the beginning. This involved a range of measures to make the area friendly for birds and animals. Holes are cut in the bottom of fences for hedgehogs, some houses have swift and bat bricks built into them - hollow bricks which they can nest in. Additionally, lighting is bat-friendly in areas where bats are known to feed, fruit trees have been planted in front yards, ponds have been built to replace habitat for the great-crested newt, and, crucially, 60% of the development is green space. \u201cThat\u2019s how it needs to work: to have a really wildlife-friendly development these aspects need to be planned from the start,\u201d says Mike Pollard, the RSPB\u2019s project lead for the Kingsbrook project. \u201cIt is counter-intuitive, but we\u2019re looking with this project to show that new development needn\u2019t lead to a loss of nature, it can lead to a benefit if it\u2019s done in the right way.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Yet although there was no room for the dead, there was plenty of room for the living. All but a few hundred people had moved out of the town to find work in bigger cities, leaving behind empty houses. Now there was a chance to repopulate. And so, since 2014, Sutera has augmented its fast-dwindling population with dozens of asylum seekers. The school has been reborn; the butcher and grocer are happy with the growth in turnover; the birthrate has rocketed. \u201cIn the 1970s, Sutera had more than 5,000 inhabitants,\u201d the mayor of the town, Giuseppe Grizzanti, tells the Guardian. \u201cBy the 1980s we were 4,000, and 3,000 in the 90s. Every year Sutera lost 300 citizens, due to unemployment. The houses emptied, the shops closed and [we] risked becoming a ghost town.\u201d Sutera comes from the ancient Greek soter, meaning \u201csalvation\u201d. Tucked into the slopes of a remote mountain, it made an ideal refuge during times of war. Now that ancient purpose is being revived. To Italy\u2019s surging anti-immigrant right, the community represents a 21st-century catastrophe: the displacement of Italians by foreigners. But to local people, it represents an older Sicilian story: of migration and flight from war, and the commercial opportunities those movements bring. It was one of the Mediterranean\u2019s deadliest migrant tragedies that created the opportunity. On 3 October 2013, a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa, 368 people died when a fire broke out in the boat as it neared the shore. Rome asked the nearby municipalities to bury the victims in their cemeteries. Sutera was unable to help, but it had another idea. \u201cI thought that if we could not host the dead, at least we could do something for the living,\u201d says Grizzanti, who in 2014 agreed to let the Italian state settle asylum seekers in his community\u2019s vacant homes. Sutera joined a resettlement programme that funds towns to host a certain number of people. Deborah, 26, a Nigerian victim of trafficking, is one of 50 asylum seekers currently living in the town. She has been housed in a modest first-floor apartment in a quaint area of small chalk houses. \u201cI could not believe my eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my country I did not even have a bed. Here we have heating and medical care.\u201d Deborah spent six months in Libya, where she was raped by traffickers. Her daughter Sophia, born in Sutera, is now a year old. Before the arrival of the refugees, the church of Sant\u2019Agata hosted far more funerals than baptisms, but that imbalance is starting to correct itself: in 2016, seven children were born in Sutera, six of them to asylum-seeking families. As recently as 2012, authorities were considering shutting the local school, a massive complex of more than 1,000 sq metres whose entire student body numbered 10. It is thanks to children from Ethiopia, Pakistan and Nigeria that the school\u2019s pupil numbers are now sufficient for its survival. The refugees are also helping to support the businesses of the butcher, grocer and baker. Sutera has become a symbol of integration, with its model emulated by other Sicilian municipalities at risk of disappearing. The neighbouring towns of Mazzarino and Milena have followed suit, settling their own asylum seekers. Nunzio Vitellaro, the coordinator of the association that helps choose applicants to the programme, says: \u201cSutera shows how the integration process not only has an ethical purpose, but is also an opportunity for work for many young people who, without this project, would have left the island.\u201d To supporters of the far right, the town is a naive project, financed by the EU, for the \u201creplacement of the white race\u201d. But to the townspeople \u2013 including the emigrants whose homes have been given to the new arrivals \u2013 it shows what Italy\u2019s ailing countryside most needs: new life. Gaetano Nicastro, the son of Sicilian emigrants, sees a neat symmetry in the programme: \u201cHere we have been dealing with integration for 2,000 years, and if then Sutera was the \u2018salvation\u2019 for many foreigners, well, guess what? Today, the true salvation of Sutera is the refugees.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

An extra 1.5 million children will be living in poverty by 2021 as a consequence of government cuts, according to a study of the impact of tax and benefit policy by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Since 2010, more than 500 children\u2019s centres in England have closed. In the West Midlands, 33 youth clubs run by Staffordshire county council were shut in 2014 in an attempt to save \u00a32.6m. Months later, all employees of the council\u2019s youth service were made redundant or redeployed. But there is a chink of hope. Communities have stepped in to fill the gap. If the young people of Lichfield and Burntwood didn\u2019t have Fun Club, they would either be cooped up at home or out in the cold. \u201cThe council left the general public to pick up the pieces and we wanted to carry on the work we had been doing,\u201d says Liz Bacon, co-founder of the youth club for 10- to 16-year-olds. Bacon and her co-founder, Kerry McCabe-Crowley, are youth workers who have continued to run Fun Club after being made redundant by cuts. The club, supported by the county\u2019s police commissioner, is a safe space where up to 60 children can gather, twice a week. \u201cWe count ourselves as a family,\u201d says Bacon. \u201cWe get kids from different cultures and backgrounds mixing when they normally wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s great to see young people who identify as gamers and enjoy playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons socialising with the skateboarders. Here, they all come under one umbrella.\u201d Elisha Atkinson, 15, is a volunteer at the club. \u201cI have been a part of Fun Club since the very beginning and it has been very positive,\u201d she says. \u201cMy self-confidence and social skills have grown, and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without it.\u201d In June, the club is organising a community get-together as part of the Eden Project\u2019s Big Lunch and hopes to expand its work into more rural areas. \u201cWe\u2019d be open every night if we had the funding for it,\u201d says Bacon. Less than a mile away, mothers and babies are making good use of Spark Burntwood\u2019s early years provision. Esther Allen, Shevonne Hodson-Walker and Philippa Davies used the local children\u2019s centres before more than 40 of them closed; they founded Spark to maintain the two centres in Burntwood. \u201cWe ran them out of necessity because there were no other options for us,\u201d says Allen, a part-time music teacher. Spark offers a mixture of activities and groups, helping mums with postnatal depression, supporting parents who want to get back to work and running a group for dads. \u201cWe need to be responsive to the needs of the community and act on those needs quickly. But, more importantly, the community must be involved in the \u2018doing\u2019 at every level,\u201d says Allen. Linda Riddet remembers walking into a baby group at Spark for the first time; she knew no one and was ready to leave. \u201cShevonne came over to speak to me and just chatting to her about my daughter made me want to stay,\u201d says Riddet. \u201cStep one for many mums is leaving the house. Step two is often actually talking to someone. As far as I am aware, Spark is one of very few in the country where the people of a community took a stand against the cuts and said, \u2018We need these services.\u2019 I know I am not the only one who feels this way.\u201d Those involved with Spark are clearly proud of what they have achieved in the past few years, but concern remains over the current state of early years provision. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where Spark will go next, but we hope we are making a difference for local children and families,\u201d says Allen. \u201cIt is absolutely scandalous what is happening to children\u2019s centres nationally. Closing them is a short-term saving that will create lasting and expensive problems to address later in a child\u2019s life.\u201d In Cumbria, a locum veterinary surgeon and mother of two preschool children, Mhairi Helme, is creating a multi-use indoor space with her husband, John. Kendal has virtually no provision for children\u2019s indoor play. Helme hopes her charity, Outside-In, will be able to offer a role-play market town with mini versions of local businesses and services, plus a soft-play castle and a cafe. \u201cWe\u2019d like to promote the area\u2019s heritage and establish ourselves as a service to the community,\u201d she says. Initial costs were funded by South Lakeland district council and by committee members, who volunteer in between work and looking after their children. Helme is grateful to the council as well as to the local MP Tim Farron, who tabled a supporting motion in parliament in January. \u201cI know the council would love to see such a facility in town, and it has really helped with business advice and suggesting available grant opportunities,\u201d she says. Set to open in early 2019, with a target of raising \u00a3100,000 by then, Helme is confident Outside-In will be ready. \u201cWe want to ask the community to come together to make this happen for Kendal,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to create an atmosphere at the centre, by involving local businesses, charities, volunteers and families, that helps to reduce stigma around disability, age, poverty and mental health.\u201d In the south of England, Yvonne Bailey has been helping young people in east London for 20 years, working on self-confidence and overcoming stereotypes. Aimed at four- to 21-year-olds from socially deprived areas in Waltham Forest and neighbouring boroughs, Kreative Culture Klub (KCK) provides workshops and activities for young people primarily from African-Caribbean backgrounds. \u201cWe often get people coming back and sharing their success stories with the younger generation,\u201d says Bailey. The club runs an annual Young, Gifted and Black awards ceremony to celebrate achievement in academia and the arts. One previous winner, Jevanni Letford, 28, hopes to DJ at the royal wedding after giving his business card to Prince Harry when he and Meghan Markle visited Reprezent, a radio station in Brixton where Letford presents a show. \u201cAnother young man, Kwarteng Sarfo, who\u2019s studying to be a surgeon at Imperial College London, told me that in the morning when he can\u2019t get out of bed, he looks at his KCK trophy and it motivates him,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cHe said he remembers everyone applauding and how much that meant to him. He asked me how he could pay back, and I told him to come back when he\u2019s a surgeon and share his experience. If our young people can see what people like them can achieve, then anything is possible.\u201d", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Come together: how music is rebuilding bridges in divided Balkans", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/16/mostar-rock-school-bosnia-herzegovina", "date": "2018-03-16", "transcript": "Back in the days of Yugoslavia, they used to call music \u201cthe seventh republic\u201d \u2013 a great unifier in a region prone to division. Today, in a small schoolroom in Mostar, it is still bringing people together. Here, the curriculum is rock\u2019n\u2019roll, the pupils are from both sides of a still-divided city, and the professors are stars. \u201cMusic can be used as a tool to connect people, to strengthen the trust between them,\u201d said Orhan Maslo, the 39-year-old director of the Mostar Rock school. \u201cYou cannot come into a war zone with a guitar and stop the war,\u201d Maslo added. \u201cBut after the war, if there are groups that hate each other ... music can do a lot to reconstruct.\u201d Mostar, once a paragon of ethnic tolerance, suffered brutally during the 1992-95 Bosnian war and has become a place of uncomfortable coexistence. The west bank of the Neretva river is home to the Bosnian Croat population while the east is dominated by Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks. Maslo founded Mostar Rock school (MRS) in 2008 in collaboration with Dutch NGO Musicians Without Borders. There were 16 students in the first class. This year, there are 128 enrolled and 80 more on the waiting list. Students take lessons in guitar, drums, bass, keyboard or vocals and play together in bands. \u201cWe pick students of similar ability from the east and west [sides of the river] and form bands,\u201d Maslo said. They have 40 days to rehearse before MRS hosts a concert showcasing the bands to the public and providing a space for the student\u2019s families to mingle. The concerts draw a diverse crowd. \u201cYou have someone in the audience holding a three-year-old child in their arms, but also a grandpa with an old camera recording their grandchild [on stage],\u201d Maslo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about learning the music,\u201d said Semin Merzic, 24, rock school graduate, guitar instructor and guitarist for Floridus, the first band formed at MRS. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where everyone can come and they are welcome \u2026believe me, there are not very many places like this in the Balkans.\u201d The contemporary music scene in Bosnia is dominated by turbo-folk, a blend of regional folk music and electronic pop that originated in Serbia in the 1990s. It often features sexual, misogynistic and nationalistic lyrics. MRS is a refreshing antidote, part of a counterculture movement led by Bosnian musical artists protesting against the divisive atmosphere created by ruling ethnic nationalist elites. Many young MRS students are tired of being defined by their ancestry and events before they were born. \u201cWe don\u2019t think about [ethnic] backgrounds. We all hang out, play music and drink beer,\u201d said Josip Palameta, 21-year-old vocalist in jazz band Smooth Groove. \u201cThe war was 25 years ago.\u201d Music has always played a big role in Bosnia - then and now. Three weeks before war broke out in Bosnia in 1992, a Serbian rock supergroup called Rimtutituki released an anti-war song in Belgrade, Serbia\u2019s capital city, which quickly became popular in Bosnia. \u201cFor them, it said that not all the people in Serbia went mad,\u201d said Yugoslav rock critic and journalist Petar Janjatovi\u0107. During the 44-month siege of Bosnia\u2019s capital city, Sarajevo, music helped keep spirits up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have electricity, food or anything and the snipers were shooting all the time,\u201d said Samir Hodovic, Sarajevo native and vocalist of the band Velahavle. \u201cThe bands at that time put everything into the concert. You didn\u2019t have tickets because there was no money. People who could come came if they could run through the streets,\u201d he said. Musicians were among the first to cross the new borders between the former Yugoslav states and re-establish the lines of cultural communication after the war. \u201cIt helps when people are chanting songs they like from other regions,\u201d said Jovan Mati\u0107 of Del Arno Band, a Serbian reggae group. \u201cThe elite aren\u2019t doing much for reconciliation, the international community is not doing much \u2026 it\u2019s up to us small people to try and reconcile,\u201d he said.

The only way is ethics", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/what-to-do-with-those-divested-billions-the-only-way-is-ethics", "date": "2018-03-15", "transcript": "Divestment has become a trillion-dollar topic in recent years \u2013 boycotting companies considered harmful has never been more popular: Israeli exporters, arms makers, and fossil fuel producers, among others. Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. But where do investors put their money instead? Are companies that benefit thriving? In short, is ethical investing making a difference? Definitions of this sector vary, as do monikers \u2013 ethical, environmental, sustainable. But they can be broadly categorised as \u201csocially responsible investment\u201d, or SRI. Among the many estimates of the power of private investment, the most plausible is that this kind of investment jumped to 10% of private funds under management in recent years, after slumming along at long-term levels of below 4%. Institutional investors are also getting in on the act: two decades ago about \u00a3300m a year was considered \u201csocially responsible\u201d investment; today it is, by one estimate \u00a323bn. And yet this is still a drop in the ocean compared to all global funds under management, estimated at about $85tn (\u00a360tn). Green bond issues are expected to double this year, but will still be less than one percent of the global bond market. Despite being comprehensively overshadowed by conventional investment, however, there is sober but considerable optimism about the future of SRI. Proactive investors \u2013 and the wider public conscience \u2013 are pushing governments, and in turn regulators, to demand better practices from business \u2013 cleaner air, less obesity, reducing use of fossil fuels. \u201cI would not feel comfortable gaining from somebody else\u2019s misery,\u201d explains company owner and private investor Rebecca Hughes. Institutions too are heading in the same direction: nearly 80% of investors across 30 countries told last year\u2019s Schroders\u2019 Global Investor Study that sustainability had become more important to them over the last five years. \u201cWhile profitability remains the central investment consideration, interest in sustainability is increasing,\u201d said Jessica Ground, Schroders\u2019 global head of stewardship. \u201cBut investors also see sustainability and profits as intertwined.\u201d UBS\u2019s Doing well by doing good report claims more than half the UK public would pay more for goods or services with a conscience. Many more people will want better ethical standards, even if they don\u2019t want or can\u2019t afford to pay for them. \u201cIt\u2019s in my upbringing: you treat others in the way you\u2019d like to be treated,\u201d says Hughes. More active financial investors are also taking the issues seriously. Several have indices to track the value of shares in companies which are not doing \u2018bad\u2019, or actively doing \u2018good\u2019. One is Morgan Stanley, whose two environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices \u2013 also covering weapons and women\u2019s progress \u2013 were worth $62bn by last summer. UBS reckons \u201cimpact investing\u201d \u2013 where investors actively seek out companies doing good \u2013 is a \u201cforce to be reckoned with\u201d. One of the key reasons is the other big driver of the sector: shareholders no longer have to choose between their conscience and profits. Hughes\u2019s \u00a3170,000 increased in value by 26% last year \u2013 notably more than conventional investments. \u201cIt started driven by values, it\u2019s now definitely [driven] by value,\u201d says Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment Forum. While Richard Mattison, CEO of environmental data firm Trucost, says investors such as pension funds now see such investments as a \u201cno brainer\u201d. Is this sea-change having any effect on the issues that investors want to improve? Shareholders and the wider public have won many causes in recent years \u2013 reductions in unsustainable palm oil, reduced packaging, new coal plants ditched, high street shops such as Sports Direct embarrassed over treatment of workers. But some of the biggest winners on the stock markets last year were b\u00eates noires of ethical investors \u2013 tobacco, car makers and aerospace and defence companies. Energy stocks have risen by one third in the last two years. And in November 2017 scientists revealed global carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, reached a record high. However, ever-rising demand to invest in companies pioneering and popularising technologies to create carbon-free energy, reduce waste landfill sites, reduce aircraft noise and other improvements to living standards, should make a considerable difference over time. At the same time, existing companies, across the spectrum, from manufacturers to media, are being forced \u2013 by regulators, investors and public opinion \u2013 to reconsider how they will do business in 10 or 20 years\u2019 time, especially with regard to carbon emissions. \u201cThis is going to reverberate across every part of the economy,\u201d says Andy Howard, Schroders\u2019 head of sustainable research. \u201cThis is going to be painful for some [but] there are big opportunities for people who get it right.\u201d In the meantime, says Hughes: \u201cIf I\u2019m investing into a company that\u2019s helping the environment, or helping women, I\u2019m happy with that. That\u2019s all you can ask of anyone.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

All broken. It sounds like a pile of things that you\u2019d stick in boxes and take to the tip. In fact, it\u2019s a list of things mended in a single afternoon by British volunteers determined to get people to stop throwing stuff away. This is the Reading Repair Cafe, part of a burgeoning international network aimed at confronting a world of stuff, of white goods littering dumps in west Africa and trash swilling through the oceans in huge gyres. The hair clippers belong to William, who does not want to give his surname but cheerfully describes himself as \u201cmechanically incompetent\u201d. He has owned them for 25 years, but 10 years ago they stopped working and they have been sitting unused in his cupboard ever since. He sits down at the table of Colin Haycock, an IT professional who volunteers at the repair cafe, which has been running monthly for about four years and is a place where people can bring all manner of household items to be fixed for free. In less than five minutes, Haycock has unscrewed and removed the blades, cleaned out some gunk from inside the machine, oiled the blades, and screwed it all back together. The clippers purr happily. William looks sheepish; Haycock looks pleased. \u201cI wish they were all that simple,\u201d he says. Today, the repairers will divert 24kg of waste from going to landfill and save 284kg of CO2. Some items can\u2019t be fixed on the spot \u2013 notably a hunting horn split in two, which requires soldering with a blow torch \u2013 but very little needs to be thrown away. Gabrielle Stanley, who used to run a clothing alterations business, says she was drawn to volunteering at the repair cafe to combat the \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d she sees. \u201cYou go into certain stores...\u201d - she throws a dark look - \u201chow they can sell clothes for that price, when I couldn\u2019t even buy the fabric for that much? And then you hear about things that happen [in the factories] in the far east.\u201d An estimated 300,000 tonnes of clothing was sent to landfill in the UK in 2016 and a report from Wrap puts the average lifespan for a piece of clothing in the UK at 3.3 years. Globally, the amount of e-waste generated is expected to hit 50m tonnes by the end of 2018. This is partly driven by consumers\u2019 eagerness for new products, but there are also concerns about built-in obsolescence, in which manufacturers design products to break down after a certain amount of time and are often difficult or expensive to fix. In December, Apple admitted to slowing older models of phones, though it claimed it did this for operational not obsolescence reasons. Repair cafe volunteer Stuart Ward says that when fixing items is actively discouraged by manufacturers, repair becomes a political act. He is vehement about the \u201cright to repair\u201d, a movement opposed to the practices of companies like the machinery company John Deere, which, under copyright laws, doesn\u2019t allow people to fix their own equipment or take them to independent repairers. \u201cYou own your equipment, you\u2019re allowed to take a screwdriver to it and play with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something fundamental.\u201d Teaching people how to fix their own gear is at the heart of the Edinburgh Remakery, a store on the main street of Leith that is part repair shop, part secondhand store, part repair education centre. \u201cWe do the repair in front of a customer, not out in the back, not hidden,\u201d says Sotiris Katsimbas, the lead IT technician at the Remakery. To do this, Katsimbas and his team conduct one-to-one IT repair appointments for a small fee, as do their colleagues who specialise in sewing and furniture repairs. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of confidence. It\u2019s not magic. Someone put it together, someone can take it apart, you only need a Phillips screwdriver and some knowledge,\u201d says Katsimbas as he shows Daniel Turner how to open up his laptop so he can clean out the fluff and dust that is causing the machine to overheat. Since it opened in 2012, the Remakery has diverted 205 tonnes of waste that would have ended up in landfill. But the Remakery is unique in that, unlike much of the repair movement, which is volunteer-led, it is a viable business, employing 11 staff and 10 freelancers. Last year the shop had an income of \u00a3236,000 \u2013 30% from grants, 70% generated through sales of furniture and electronics, workshops and repair appointments. The financial viability of the shop makes it attractive as a model. In the last year, Sophie Unwin, the co-founder of the Remakery in Brixton and the founder of Edinburgh Remakery is setting up the Remakery network to replicate the work internationally. She has had 53 inquiries from groups interested in setting up similar enterprises in the US, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, Austria, Ireland, Germany, Australia and elsewhere in the UK. The network will provide toolkits and advice to groups who want to recreate what she has done in Edinburgh. Unwin hopes that these resources will allow other groups to do in two years what it has taken eight years of trial and error and extremely hard graft to achieve. For repairers, fixing things is a way of doing something about an obsession with consumerism that Unwin calls \u201ca kind of sickness in society\u201d. \u201cThis is our little attempt to push a little bit in this direction,\u201d says Ward. \u201cTo say, we can fix this, we can repair things, don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Shops and businesses including Costa Coffee and Leon have also signed up to the trial scheme, which will involve more than 65 outlets in five areas of London. They will be listed on a free app and website along more than 5,700 additional refill locations across the UK, and will also advertise the service with stickers in their windows. London is following cities such Bristol and Bath which have spearheaded the Refill movement. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cA free tap water scheme is long overdue in London and I welcome all of the retailers and business who have shown their strong commitment to reducing unnecessary plastic waste by joining the scheme.\u201d Last year the Guardian reported that one million bottles are sold around the world every minute. In the UK, 38.5m plastic bottles are used each day, just over half of which make it to recycling. More than 16m are put into landfill, burned, or leak into the environment and oceans. The Refill London scheme will initially operate in Greenwich town centre, Lewisham high street, the Southbank and Bankside, Regent Street and London Bridge (the More London complex). The zoological society of London will evaluate the first phase of the scheme, which will feed into plans for a wider rollout as early as the summer. The average adult in London buys more than three plastic water bottles a week, amounting to 175 bottles a year. The production of bottled water is around 500 times more carbon-intensive than tap water. Khan is keen for Londoners to adopt small changes that can have a big environmental impact. There are also plans for a new generation of public water fountains to encourage people to reuse. \u201cWe all need to try harder to cut the excessive use of single-use plastic bottles, cups and cutlery that can end up pointlessly overflowing our landfill sites, finding their way into our oceans and harming our environment,\u201d Khan said. The pilot of the Refill London scheme is run by Thames Water and City to Sea, a charity that aims to help stop ocean pollution as part of a wider national initiative backed by the water industry. The Refill campaign, which started in Bristol, aims to create a network of high street retailers, coffee shops, businesses and local authorities offering to refill water bottles in every English town and city by 2021.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Want to save your job and make more money?

In this smoothest of seductions, John Clark and Alistair Miller hadn\u2019t had to do a thing. There they were, itching to sell their business and get on with retirement. Then one day in the middle of 2015, this American firm \u2013 big-time, way out of their league \u2013 swung by the factory outside Glasgow and asked: what price do you have in mind? This was followed by an invitation back to the multinational\u2019s European headquarters in the home counties. So off popped Miller. The two sides were inching towards the dotted line when he casually inquired what the Americans would do with their new Scottish premises. This one question sent the needle screeching across the record. As soon as the managing director across the desk started talking about \u201cexploring possibilities\u201d and \u201ctransferable technologies\u201d, Miller knew what she meant. Their Scottish operation would run for another six months, a year tops. Then it would be shut \u2013 and the order book and the technology shifted down south. And when the factory disappeared, so too would the jobs and the livelihoods of 60-odd workers and their families. Selling up would hand the owners a huge cheque, and leave their staff on a tiny giro. \u201cYou\u2019d be sitting back with your piles of cash,\u201d says Clark, \u201cbut at some point you\u2019re going to bump into those guys. Some of them have been there longer than me. I know their families.\u201d \u201cThose guys\u201d helped to build this place. Since its launch in 1986, Novograf has gone from printing signs for vans to working with some of the biggest chains in Britain. It has become expert in the branding that envelops you while shopping, eating or holidaying, but which you never take in. Walk around a Co-op supermarket, and the signs guiding you to the wine and beer or fruit and veg aisles will be Novograf\u2019s. Pop into a Pizza Hut and the wood-look flooring will have been made and laid by Novograf employees. Stay at an Ibis Styles hotel and the big fat number on your room door probably comes from their East Kilbride factory. Then there\u2019s Greggs, Iceland, Tesco, Waitrose \u2026 Miller and Clark hadn\u2019t poured six decades of their combined lives into this venture only to leave a plump carcass for others to feed on. But the two sixtysomethings had run smack into one of the central problems of British capitalism: how to ensure a company\u2019s owners look after it. Pretty much any spiv with a chequebook can buy a business in the UK and ruin it as they want. Westminster will ask few questions, expect even less accountability, and never learn any lessons. That fanatical British adherence to open markets and property rights leaves the staff, the suppliers and the public counting for little. The publisher of Horny Housewives, Richard Desmond, bought the Express stable in 2000 without New Labour ministers raising an eyebrow. A once-great paper was wrecked and hundreds of journalists lost their jobs, but Desmond pocketed nearly \u00a3350m before he sold it to Trinity Mirror this year. In 2005, Manchester United football club was snapped up by the Glazer family, who paid for it by borrowing hundreds of millions that they loaded on to the club\u2019s balance sheet \u2013 before shifting its headquarters to the tax haven of the Cayman Islands, a 10,000-mile round trip from the club\u2019s Old Trafford stadium. Philip Green may strip BHS bare; Cadbury can be ravaged by Kraft; Australian investment bank Macquarie can run Thames Water into the ground then, as a reward, get the public\u2019s Green Investment Bank. Each time owners damage a business, employees and often customers get shafted, and local economies suffer \u2013 while a handful right at the top cash in. But Miller and Clark can tell you how much depends on the simple fact of ownership. It helps shape the business model, the ethos and culture of a company. However, even as they tried to secure a careful owner for their business, all the plausible options were a no-go. Sell to a rival? Their staff and values would be discarded like used wrapping paper. Cash out to private equity? A green light for a corporate ransacking. Neither man\u2019s children wanted to trudge in their dad\u2019s footsteps, and senior management were not in a position to buy them out. Just then, a postcard flopped on to the doormat. \u201cThinking of exiting your business?\u201d it asked. When the man from Scottish Enterprise, an agency of the Holyrood government, told them about worker ownership, he got blank faces. The biggest employee-owned firm in the UK, John Lewis, was a Novograf customer, yet all Clark knew about its structure was that once a year the company would be on the news for paying \u201cpartners\u201d a tax-free bonus. Which was lovely, Clark and Miller thought, but what did that have to do with them? Employee ownership is as simple as selling a company to its staff. Over 300 British firms have done it, from Arup architects to Waitrose. But it is as radical as giving the people who create a business\u2019s wealth the right to share in it. That wealth is no longer handed over to remote shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. When Clark and Miller \u201cgot off our butts\u201d and visited a few of the 95 Scottish firms now owned by their employees, \u201cwe learned that their productivity was higher, that they were more resilient in bad times, that they were more inclusive of all their staff\u201d. Giving workers control over their companies doesn\u2019t just make the firms more successful, it also makes the workers a lot better off. Last year, the California-based National Center for Employee Ownership analysed US jobs figures and found that younger workers who are worker-owners enjoy 33% higher wages and 92% higher median household wealth than those who aren\u2019t owners. The British government knows much of this, because it commissioned a report that told it so. The very first line of Graeme Nuttall\u2019s 2012 review reads: \u201cEmployee ownership is a great idea.\u201d After lobbying by Liberal Democrat ministers, two years later chancellor George Osborne scrapped capital gains tax for employers who transferred a majority share of their business to workers. This was back when Osborne and David Cameron would hymn \u201cthe John Lewis model\u201d. Just like \u201cthe march of the makers\u201d and the \u201cbig society\u201d, the fad has left little trace. Of the 2,617 full-time equivalent civil servants at the Department for Business, not one is dedicated to promoting worker ownership, as advised by the Nuttall review. The same report also recommends \u201cthe appointment of a minister responsible for promoting employee ownership across government\u201d. Yet this department confirmed to me that not even its most junior minister holds any such brief. That silence partly explains why employee ownership remains so exotic. When Clark and Miller announced their idea for selling the company to their staff, they hired a local hotel, put on fancy nibbles and gave a great presentation. \u201cThe very first question we got was, \u2018Have we still got a job?\u2019\u201d remembers Clark. \u201cNobody had a clue what it meant,\u201d recalls factory technician David Anderson. \u201cPeople assumed that everyone was going to have to get a mortgage to buy the company.\u201d Four hundred miles north of Whitehall, the far smaller Scottish Enterprise employs eight full-time staffers to promote and advise on worker ownership and other \u201cinclusive models\u201d of organising companies. The SNP government is full-square behind it, and the Herald, the Record and the Scotsman newspapers trumpet this Isle of Arran holiday resort or that Hebridean jewellers being taken over by its employees. Just two decades ago, newly devolved Holyrood paid through the nose for inward investment and prayed that the multinationals would repay their lavish subsidies with lasting jobs. They rarely did. Hewlett Packard, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and many others pulled the corporate equivalent of a one-night stand. Holyrood can still relapse \u2013 such as when it gifted Amazon \u00a32.5m of taxpayers\u2019 money and got back a distribution warehouse in Dunfermline. But Scottish Enterprise\u2019s Sarah Deas talks of fostering a Mittelstand \u2013 a German-style dense network of medium-sized businesses that think long term and honour their social obligations. Which is a reminder that British business is not some political monolith \u2013 that it can break left as well as right. White-haired Clark is appalled at \u201cthe FTSE guys\u201d, the chief executives paid 100 times the average wage of their workers. \u201cWhat are they doing to deserve that?\u201d Clark is not, he says, \u201csome paternalistic capitalist\u201d or a \u201ccrusader\u201d. He\u2019s \u201chardnosed\u201d, and with Miller got a fair price for Novograf. But they\u2019ve also taken big risks to ensure their workers could afford it. It proved impossible to raise cash upfront for the purchase price. \u201cNot one of the major banks was interested. Not even our own.\u201d So Clark and Miller turned themselves into a bank \u2013 handing over the company shares while allowing employees to pay them back over a few years, with interest. And with conditions: as long as the pair retain an interest in the firm it cannot relocate more than 200 miles away, \u201cbecause that would defeat the entire purpose of the deal\u201d. At the end of 2016, all the shares in the company were transferred from the two original owners into a trust held on behalf of all staff. Just over a year later, the all-new, same-old Novograf still feels eggshelly, as if everyone is trying to gauge what\u2019s changed. Its new managing director, Jennifer Riddell-Dillet, has to tell employees: \u201cRemember you\u2019re an owner.\u201d She both manages and works for her staff, one of whom sat on the panel that interviewed her for the job. Novografers like to tell you that this isn\u2019t \u201csome socialist paradise\u201d, that there are still bosses and workers; but the priorities have changed. Formerly a senior manager for two PLCs, Riddell-Dillet says: \u201cPublic companies are only about external shareholders. There, employees are the asset of the business \u2013 but they\u2019re a sweatable asset. Here, you think, \u2018If I just drive them into the ground it will be less fulfilling, less rewarding and it will be more ruthless.\u2019\u201d Everyone received a decent tax-free bonus last year, and also took part in the first-ever staff survey, which led to sick pay and leave entitlement becoming more generous. Anderson, a Novograf lifer, says: \u201cThe people on the factory floor definitely feel more in control than before. Anybody can now say, \u2018I don\u2019t see why things have to be done that way\u2019 \u2013 and someone\u2019s got to answer.\u201d That power requires some growing into. Production manager Michael Carr has become a director of Novograf, and has struggled to get his head around the accounts. And with no previous experience, Anderson and business development manager Margaret Nelson now make up half the trustee board. The other two trustees will be Miller and Clark, until they\u2019re finally paid off. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that they know what they\u2019re talking about and we don\u2019t,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cChallenging your old boss is an intimidating thing.\u201d But employees will challenge on their expert subject: their daily work. Just last week, an employee showed Carr a cheaper and quicker way of assembling signs. They would never have spoken up before, he says, yet that one simple thing could save \u201ca few thousand pounds in man-hours and material\u201d. In its first full year of employee ownership, Novograf\u2019s sales shot up 20% and the company took on an extra 22 people. That success followed on from a strong performance in 2016, but Riddell-Dillet reckons their direct stake in the outcome did drive employees to put in \u201cthe blood, sweat and tears\u201d. Not all the savings are strictly necessary. Not so long ago, now-chairman John Clark, while washing his hands in the gents, reached over to the soap dispenser. He remembers a thin jet of lotion flying out \u2013 \u201cWhoosh ... it hit me amidships\u201d \u2013 all over his stomach. He charged over to the man responsible for ordering in supplies and told him the new soap was far too thin. While Clark stood dripping, the man nodded. \u201cAye, that was me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve watered down the soap by half to save money.\u201d \u2022 We\u2019d like to hear about your experiences with employee ownership.

In the end she decided that the risk of jeopardising her career was too great. An IT manager who also sits on Mercedes Benz\u2019s workers\u2019 council, Simic knew too many colleagues who had taken a foot off the gas in the early stages of motherhood only to find out later that the door to full-time employment had shut behind them. Thanks to a deal struck by Germany\u2019s metalworkers\u2019 union earlier this month, employees who want to take some time out to look after their children or ailing parents may not face the same dilemma in the future. From January 2019, workers represented by IG Metall can expect not only a 4.3% pay rise, but also the option to reduce their working week to 28 hours for a total of two years \u2013 and claim the right to full-time employment afterwards. On Tuesday the union called on Germany\u2019s new government to enshrine the right to return to full-time employment in law, citing Federal Statistical Office figures which state that 1.44 million employees in the country are currently working part-time against their will. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have a bit of extra cash in your pocket, but for me the core win the union managed to gain was the new work-time model,\u201d said Simic, who is now planning to take the 28-hour option when her son starts primary school. \u201cAt last we are seeing that employers are taking into account the priorities of a new generation of worker.\u201d The idea that flexible working is not just an inconvenience imposed on employers but a right that unions should demand for their workers is beginning to spread to other sectors of the German economy. In the coming weeks, workers at the German postal service Deutsche Post will decide whether to accept a deal, brokered by the services union Ver.di, that allows them to choose between either an accumulative 5.1% rise in wages or an additional 102 hours of holiday over the next two years. \u201cThe argument that there is less work around and we need to rethink how to spread it around has been around for a good 10 years,\u201d said Ver.di\u2019s spokesperson, G\u00fcnter Isemeyer. \u201cBut IG Metall\u2019s achievements on the 28-hour working week have certainly made our employees think about it more.\u201d Before the latest round of negotiations between the services union and Deutsche Post, Ver.di for the first time commissioned a wide-ranging survey of 37,000 employees to discover their priorities in negotiations, rather than relying on representatives. Almost 80% of the workers consulted identified \u201cfree time\u201d as an important part of their union\u2019s negotiations. Ver.di, Germany\u2019s second-largest union, with about 2 million members, last year won employees at Deutsche Bank\u2019s call centres the right to reduce their working hours if they worked on Saturdays. Workers represented by the railway and transport union EVG already have the opportunity to choose between wage increases and more holidays. In 2018, more than half of employees at Deutsche Bahn will stay on vacation for six more days than in 2017. Last July, 56% of employees at the rail company voted in favour of boosting their holiday allowance; only 41% chose to increase their wage by 2.72%. To some economists, the results of recent negotiations make Germany a trailblazer in how to face the challenges of the 21st century workplace. To avert the threat of mass unemployment in the face of human workers being replaced by robots and algorithms, they argue, employers need to reduce working hours and spread them more evenly among the population. Others warn that workers\u2019 new flexibility is undermining the competitive advantages of the Europe\u2019s biggest economy, and threatens to exacerbate German industry\u2019s shortage of qualified workers. While the 28-hour working week deal has caused little outcry among employers\u2019 associations, Holger Sch\u00e4fer of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research warns against enshrining the right to return to full-time employment in national law. \u201cIf you create more flexibility for employees, then you need to also give companies more instruments to react to a more fluid and unpredictable situation,\u201d Sch\u00e4fer said, suggesting there was room to loosen constraints around working hours. German unions\u2019 new strategic priorities are also finding some critics on the left of the political spectrum. Heiner Flassbeck, an economist and former state secretary at the German finance ministry, likens IG Metall\u2019s flexible-working deal to a \u201csmokescreen\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t have any ideological objections to reducing working hours \u2013 my problem is that it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Flassbeck said. \u201cA booming economy like Germany\u2019s should make compensatory wage adjustments. And there\u2019s no evidence that you can increase wages while simultaneously reducing working hours.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Yet little more than a year later, it appears that an unlikely assemblage of housewives, students, ex-teachers, truck drivers and others has brought Ireland to the brink of radical change to its abortion laws. They met as a Citizens\u2019 Assembly at the end of 2016, a mix of pro-lifers, pro-choicers and undecideds whose views broadly reflected opinions in the wider Irish population. In all, it took five weekends. But at the end of it, they voted for change. In doing so, they did not just pave the way for an abortion referendum in May, details of which were announced today. They showed the world what democrats can do with a little imagination. In a world in which democracy desperately needs revitalisation and new ideas, innovators point to Ireland. They see the move to randomly select a jury to thrash out the issue before a public vote as a breakthrough moment. \u201cMany people were concerned this would be a can-kicking exercise; that proved not to be the case,\u201d says Colm O\u2019Gorman, the executive director of Amnesty International Ireland. A referendum was scarcely imaginable when the idea of an assembly was first mooted in 2016. Back then, few politicians dared even raise the subject of a public vote, let alone voice support for abortion rights. To do so risked electoral oblivion, or so the conventional logic went. As a result, Irish women faced the perpetuation of some of Europe\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws, under which at least 170,000 women travelled abroad for abortions in the years since 1980, mainly to England and often in secret. The citizens\u2019 assembly helped break the deadlock. \u201cI think this issue, in Ireland, could never have gotten to the point we\u2019re at today, were it not for the citizens\u2019 assembly,\u201d says Fine Gael\u2019s deputy, Kate O\u2019Connell. \u201cI think we would have been years getting there, if we ever got there.\u201d During five weekends of meetings over five months, much of it broadcast live on the internet, the jury of 99 citizens broke open taboos around sex and women\u2019s reproductive health. Passionate speeches in favour of and against liberalising abortion laws were heard, including from medical, legal and ethical experts. They also witnessed audio testimonies by women who had faced crisis pregnancies. O\u2019Connell has her own story of a crisis pregnancy. She faced the prospect of having to abort her 20-week foetus due to a potentially fatal abnormality, an illegal act in Ireland. After tests, and consulting with medics among friends and family, the pharmacist carried her pregnancy to term. Her child, a now healthy boy, will turn eight in September. Many Irish women would have struggled to find the advice she got. \u201cThere is huge value in people telling their stories,\u201d O\u2019Connell says despite the sometimes brutal responses she and others have endured by going public. A majority of assembly members ultimately recommended amending the Irish constitution to allow lawmakers to address the issue of abortion access. Almost two-thirds also recommended legalising abortion without restriction up to certain gestation limits. An all-party parliamentary committee charged with considering the work of the citizens\u2019 assembly subsequently recommended legal abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Proponents of citizens\u2019 assemblies highlight their use of random selection to create representative samples of any given society. That contrasts with narrower, more elite gatherings of elected representatives. Supporters also vaunt the deliberative process that is cultivated, with members responding to what is presented and listening to others\u2019 responses. That diversity of views, so often missing in elected parliaments, helps deepen collective understanding. Participants feel less pressure as there are no elections, and this in turn improves the quality of their decisions. In Ireland\u2019s case, voters can access all the assembly submissions and recommendations before casting their ballots next May. Assembly participants certainly seem delighted to have taken part. Of more than half a dozen consulted, chosen from those who agreed to speak to the media, all were hugely positive. \u201cI\u2019m almost sad it\u2019s coming to an end. It\u2019s been a life-changing experience for me,\u201d said Liz Connell Jones, 63, a retired teacher and mother-of-two from Wexford, southeast Ireland. She doubted she would have ever considered abortion herself but was pleased the assembly recommended reform. \u201cI look back to my mother\u2019s generation, my mother had 11 children, she never had a choice. She didn\u2019t want to have 11 children, she even said it wasn\u2019t right that women had to have children as they did.\u201d While Ireland prepares for its referendum, and likely a rancorous campaign, others look to what is already won. For Oliver Escobar, a lecturer in public policy at Edinburgh University and the co-director of What Works Scotland, Ireland\u2019s effort was singular and significant. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a milestone in the field of democratic innovations. This is the first time this has been part of everyday politics,\u201d he says. Elements of representative, deliberative and direct democracy came together via parliament, the citizens\u2019 assembly and referendum. \u201cWhen these things are combined, you have a democratic system that\u2019s more powerful.\u201d You can view a short documentary about the Irish citizens\u2019 assembly by following this link.

In Barcelona, they held up a tourist bus and slashed bike tyres. In Venice, they marched against the cruise ships and raised rents. In some Spanish cities, the writing was on the wall quite literally, as locals told travellers in the boldest fonts: \u201cTourists go home.\u201d So now, with the summer season just around the corner, tourism bosses across Europe are frantically trying to implement new measures that will keep locals happy and economies afloat. \u201cSomeone said there is no overtourism, only undermanagement,\u201d said the World Tourism Organisation secretary general, Zurab Pololikashvili, when asked how the industry could move forward. \u201cWhat we are facing is the clear need to step up the governance of tourist flows on the ground, especially if we look at growing tourist numbers in general and growing flows to urban destinations.\u201d The range of solutions floated at a tourism conference in Berlin on Wednesday included tightening up on Airbnb rentals, better management of tourism flow and widespread use of digital tools. Spanish officials have already introduced an online ticketing system for the fortified Islamic palace of Alhambra, offering its 2.7 million annual visitors pre-booked slots to balance the crowds. There are hopes in Italy\u2019s Cinque Terre that a similar system could reduce the visitor masses pounding the venerable cliff paths every year. Although not obligatory, its capped entry cards include services such as rail connections and are linked with an app giving real-time information on the numbers of visitors in each pastel-hued village \u2013 a subtle nudge to avoid bottlenecks. Venice, Amsterdam and Dubrovnik are likewise trying to nudge visitors away from hotspots, while one veteran cruise ship destination shows how technology and community engagement can gel. Gloria Guevara Manzo, World Travel &amp; Tourism Council president and CEO, points to Miami, where residents receive SMS alerts if there is the chance of congestion from visitor arrivals. \u201cMiami Beach residents can plan accordingly and not be impacted.\u201d At the ITB travel convention in Berlin \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest gathering of industry insiders \u2013 representatives from Dubrovnik, Barcelona and Amsterdam shared solutions with a packed conference hall. Amsterdam has already banned banned beer bikes, coaches, new tourist shops and cruise ships from its historic city centre. It has Airbnb paying tourist taxes and is considering flat-rate lodging levies that would discourage budget travellers. Barcelona has cracked down on illegal unlicensed apartments for rent, though its tourism director, Joan Torrella, insists that authorities have to work with digital upstarts such as Airbnb, not just confront them. Dubrovnik\u2019s mayor, Mato Frankovi\u0107, hopes 2018 will be an easier summer for visitors and local people because of a new arrangement to stagger cruise ship arrivals. \u201cIn previous years we had overcrowding in the old city, over 10,000 at the same time which we can\u2019t handle, so what we\u2019ve done for 2018 is spread that,\u201d Frankovi\u0107 said. \u201cSo actually we as a destination can handle more tourists from cruise ships than we previously had, which were before concentrated just on three days.\u201d The Greek island of Santorini is also limiting the number of cruise passengers to 8,000 per day this year, while Venice is wrangling a ban on floating resorts in its lagoon by 2021. Justin Francis, founder of the travel agency Responsible Travel, sees the \u201covertourism crisis\u201d getting worse before it gets better, and doubts that tourism management on the ground will suffice in the face of the growth. In 2017, there were 1.3 billion tourist arrivals around the world, half of them in Europe. More than two-thirds of international travellers go to just 20 countries. \u201cManaging tourism more responsibly can help, but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that,\u201d said Francis. \u201cThe world\u2019s a very big place, and the absolute numbers of tourist are manageable, but not if we all want to go to the same places at the same time.\u201d Taxation, demarketing, limiting accommodation \u2013 Francis says these ideas have been around for decades. While many destinations still need more visitors for their local economies, it\u2019s largely a question of where and when. Case in point, Iceland. Tourism was a sudden saviour for post-recession Iceland earlier this decade, helping it to revive its economy with record visitor growth, which just as quickly threatened to swamp its capital, Reykjav\u00edk, and some high-profile national wonders. In 2017 tourists outnumbered Icelanders about seven to one. But Inga Hl\u00edn P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir, director for tourism and creative industries at Promote Iceland, says such numbers have led to the misunderstanding \u201cthat the country is flooded\u201d. Iceland in 2015 began with marketing efforts to tempt visitors outside of Reykjav\u00edk and its nearby natural attractions of the Golden Circle, something she says has paid off. \u201cThere\u2019s been an increase in tourism distributed all over Iceland, and we\u2019ve had our general peak, but we think that it\u2019s going to be a slower and healthier growth,\u201d said P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir. \u201cWe have a whole-year industry in Iceland now: 60% of tourists come in the off-season.\u201d And with Icelandic tourism generating more revenue than its fishing and aluminium export industries combined, she argues that keeping this balance is vital for the economy, the environment and for locals. While it\u2019s clear that solutions for creating such balance do exist, one question remains: will they arrive in time for summer 2018?

But there was no doubt of its importance at a time when the protection of Brazil\u2019s traditional rural communities is threatened by a conservative government in league with powerful agribusiness interests. This weekend, Sim\u00e3o Jatene, the governor of Par\u00e1 state, signed a document giving land titles for more than 220,000 hectares of Amazon forest to an isolated community populated by descendants of enslaved people who escaped centuries ago. The 500 inhabitants of Cachoeira Porteira have spent 23 years trying to get legal rights to their territory. \u201cIt has a very important meaning for us,\u201d said Valterlane Souza, 34, who was born and raised in the community. \u201cEveryone was too emotional to talk.\u201d Some 950km from the state capital, Bel\u00e9m, Cachoeira Porteira is a \u201cquilombo\u201d \u2013 a rural settlement founded by descendants of enslaved people, of which there are some 6,000 in Brazil, said Denildo \u201cBiko\u201d Rodrigues, national coordinator of quilombo association Conaq. \u201cWhere there was slavery there was resistance. Some quilombos were formed by those who escaped the slave house and others by those who fought and took the plantation,\u201d he said. Brazil has struggled to come to terms with its brutal legacy of slavery. Some 4.5 million people were forcibly brought here between 1600 and 1850, when Brazil ended the traffic, though domestic slavery was only abolished in 1888. Even today, 76% of the poorest Brazilians are black, compared with 55% of the general population. Under Brazil\u2019s 1988 constitution, quilombola and indigenous people were given rights over their ancestral territories. Leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva issued a decree regulating the procedures in 2003, but so far just 170 quilombola territories have been given their full land rights, according to Conaq \u2013 62 of those in Par\u00e1 state. President Michel Temer\u2019s administration is closely allied to powerful agribusiness lobbies and has eroded protection for Amazon forest reserves. Last year, his government suspended new demarcations of quilombo territories pending a supreme court ruling on a legal action that argued that Lula\u2019s original decree was unconstitutional. But in a landmark judgment on 8 February, the supreme court voted to uphold Lula\u2019s decree. \u201cIt was a significant victory,\u201d said Rodrigues. But he cautioned that the government body charged with the regulatory process has had its budgets slashed as part of austerity measures and is barely able to operate. Anthropologist Emmanel Farias J\u00fanior participated in a project to map the limits of Cachoeira Porteira\u2019s land and said the community lives in close harmony with the forest, living by harvesting Brazil nuts, subsistence farming and fishing. Five guest houses offer eco-tourism visits. \u201cThey have this very strong relationship with the place,\u201d Farias J\u00fanior said. At Saturday\u2019s ceremony, a song written for the occasion was sung and women performed an Afro-Brazilian dance called the Maculel\u00ea, spinning fluidly and clashing pieces of wood. \u201cThe titling ceremony was wonderful, simple as it was,\u201d said another resident, Claucivaldo Souza, 44. \u201cIt was something that many people no longer believed in, but it happened.\u201d Ivanildo de Souza, 46, president of the Cachoeira Porteira association, cried as he described years of struggle to secure the title, during which the community resisted illegal loggers who attempted to buy their way into the area and plans for a hydroelectric dam project and highway were drawn up, then abandoned. He told how two centuries ago escapees from plantations would climb up the treacherous Cachoeira Porteira waterfall \u2013 \u201cWaterfall Gate\u201d \u2013 beyond which overseers sent to capture them could not pass. De Souza said the community was committed to protecting the forest that sustains them. \u201cThis is our objective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to guarantee the nature. We struggled for this.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The new inventions promising a cleaner world", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/is-there-life-after-plastic-the-new-inventions-promising-a-cleaner-world", "date": "2018-03-02", "transcript": "Barely a day goes by without a new anti-plastic initiative: the Dutch supermarket with a plastic-free aisle; the Bali inhabitants sweeping the island for jetsam, the moves to get plastic out of teabags - and even out of Lego. And that was all just this week. But can we - or should we - aim to move beyond plastics altogether? What are the alternatives to a material that has dominated packaging for 70 years? Promising new technologies are vying for attention, but plastic is so ubiquitous \u2013 and so useful \u2013 that it will not simply disappear. Rob Opsomer, systemic initiatives lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation believes that 50% of plastic packagings could be recycled if they, or after-use systems, were better designed, and 20% could be tackled by reuse schemes. However about 30% of plastics need a fundamental rethink to prevent them ending up in landfill. It\u2019s a sentiment that is gathering pace, with small businesses, laboratory scientists, corporate giants and individual innovators scrutinising every aspect of the plastic problem, from product design to sophisticated new biodegradable bioplastics. New materials Among those exploring alternatives to traditional plastics is Jeffrey Catchmark, professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Penn State University, who is plumbing the potential of naturally occurring polymers. Among the team\u2019s successes are waterproof coatings made from cellulose and chitosan \u2013 the latter a material made by treating the shells of crustaceans. Not only are these coatings compostable, and break down in the environment, but they offer other benefits since they also act as adhesives, making the recycled products even better than the virgin packaging. \u201cIn fact [the waterproof coating] is completely compatible with the processes that the recyclers use to treat the paper pulp in order to prepare that for the next product that is made,\u201d says Catchmark. Israel-based Tipa is one of the packaging companies focussing on bioplastics, and is developing their own flexible packaging. While the company admits their products are more expensive than traditional plastic, the approach could tackle one of the big problems with plastic wrappers, such the films that surround your tomatoes. \u201cThat plastic is not recyclable because it is three different plastics,\u201d said Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at University College London. Tipa claims that its material \u2013 produced from a combination of biological and synthetic materials \u2013 breaks down rapidly in a home composter, unlike most so-called compostable plastics which only properly degrade in industrial treatment facilities. \u201cJust imagine that all flexible packaging will be treated and will behave the same way as organic waste,\u201d said Daphna Nissenbaum, CEO of Tipa. \u201cWhat we offer is a packing solution that on the one hand is similar to conventional plastic, it brings us as consumers the same benefits as plastic, but on the other hand, [it is] fully compostable.\u201d However Miodownik is cautious, noting that for compostables to catch on, the starting materials have to be sustainable or otherwise make use of abundant waste materials, such as waste oil, whereas recycling means resources can be used again and again. Nonetheless, so far Tipa\u2019s flexible packaging has been embraced by businesses including snack-company Snact and fashion designer Stella McCartney. Others, meanwhile, have embraced a golden oldie: cellulose. Made from the plant polymer, cellophane is the wrapping that got us hooked on the idea of \u201cseeing what we buy\u201d but ended up being usurped by cheaper films made of plastic with a host of attractive properties. Now some, including Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Quality Street are going back, using cellulose films from UK-based firm Futamura for their wrappings. Andy Sweetman of Futamura said its NatureFlex range is made from sustainable raw materials and can be industrially or home composted. And while the toxic chemical carbon disulphide is still used in manufacturing, this is now fed back into the system, tackling environmental concerns. Packaging made from seaweed promises another alternative to sachets and wrappers. Jakarta-based Evoware say both food-grade and packaging-grade products are available, with the focus on use in the food and drink, beauty, jewellery and electronic industries. One use, they note, is to package seasonings for instant noodles, with the sachets breaking down in hot water. Seaweed-based packaging has even been deployed for water, with London-based start-up Skipping Rocks Lab developing Ooho: squidgy liquid-filled balls that last for a few days and can be eaten. Among others keen to see their packaging eaten is Peggy Tomasula of the US Department of Agriculture whose team has used proteins from milk to make films which are claimed to be better than plastic at keeping oxygen out. Improved product design From coffee cups to drinks packaging and juice cartons, solutions are proliferating. A host of companies have taken-off, selling reusable alternatives to single-use coffee cups, and many cafes now offer discounts for their use. Others are redesigning single-use products, like the Triocup \u2013 a paper coffee cup which folds over at the top, removing the need for a plastic lid. Triocup co-founder Tom Chan said the ultimate aim was to remove the plastic lining too, making the vessel compostable or recyclable. UK-based FrugalPac, is also looking to tackle drinks packaging, with easy to recycle juice cartons and a coffee cup that, it claims, \u201ccan be recycled in any UK paper mill\u201d. Rather than using paper with a tightly bonded plastic layer, the cup is made from recycled paper that easily breaks down at the mill, while the waterproof plastic lining floats free and can be scooped off, or removed by filters. \u201cWe should be making it a lot easier for consumers to be recycling these products and the way to do it is to redesign them so that they will go in existing recycling streams,\u201d said Martin Myerscough, founder of the company, adding that eventually the team want to replace the plastic lining. Back to basics New materials take time to develop, and the pressing challenge for supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles, or go plastic-free all together, means some are turning to existing alternatives. Iceland has pledged that its own-brand items will be plastic-packaging free by 2023, embracing \u201ca range of packaging comprising paper and pulp trays along with paper bags\u201d. Tesco, which has set its target at 2025, has reduced the amount of plastic in some of its packaging \u2013 including meat trays \u2013 as well as making supportive noises about the much-mooted deposit-return scheme. Plastic water bottles \u2013 possibly the epitome of single-use plastic waste \u2013 have already been replaced in venues, including London Zoo which now uses recyclable aluminium cans. Although still single-use containers, cans are recycled at higher rates than plastic bottles, and each is largely made of recycled metal. \u201cAluminium is the most infinitely recyclable material on the market \u2013 as long as you recycle your can it will come back as another can and sometimes in as little as six weeks,\u201d says CanO Water\u2019s co-founder Ariel Booker. \u201cMost plastic gets downgraded, it can\u2019t be formed into another plastic bottle.\u201d While the resealable cans make use of a plastic lid, these are separated during the recycling process, he adds. But new innovations are also afoot: M&amp;S which already has 90% recyclable packaging is among those looking to find new types of black plastic for its ready meals, since the dyes in current packaging mean it cannot be sorted using existing tech and usually ends up in landfill. Clothes While once the idea that a fleece jumper could be made out of recycled plastic was considered eco-friendly, recent revelations about the extent of microplastic pollution from synthetic fibres has resulted in a u-turn, with the majority of modern clothes guilty culprits. Traditional textiles, including wool, cotton, hemp and flax are all alternatives, however that hasn\u2019t stopped new companies springing up with fresh approaches. Among them is Ananas-Anam, which produces a natural fibre from pineapple leaves, while Bionics makes fibres from reclaimed ocean plastic and wraps them or blends them with natural fibres. There is even a new alternative to leather, made from the grape by-products of the wine industry. In summary, there is no shortage of promising technology in the pipeline. But plastic is simply too good at its job to be completely phased out any time soon. \u201cPlastics have come into being because they meet a lot of our needs as people, as humans, and I don\u2019t think we are going to row back,\u201d says Miodownik.

Not for a moment did he reckon it would become so epic in length, in scale, in consequences. He just thought his speck of a town should run its own electricity supply. A modest proposal, but in the Germany of 2003 it was highly unusual. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was still chancellor and, although a social democrat, was pushing through more privatisations of public assets than any other leader in German history. This was in a Europe that had learned from Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan to stop worrying and start loving the private sector. Now here, swimming against history\u2019s current, was one orderly, slightly anxious engineer. On R\u00fchl\u2019s side were evidence, arguments and expertise. What he lacked was his multinational opponent\u2019s money and firepower. The mismatch produced a battle that lasted years, that set off ripples around Germany and whose lessons should be pondered by anyone who wonders whether Britain could improve how it runs its electricity and gas, its water, its train services. And it kicked off in Wolfhagen, a somnolent town whose biggest previous claim to fame was that one of the Brothers Grimm had stayed in one of its half-timbered buildings. Fifteen years ago, Wolfhagen was like thousands of other German towns and cities in leasing its electrical grid for its 14,000 residents to one of the world\u2019s largest energy companies, E.ON. But two things made this place different. First, it still had a Stadtwerke, or municipally owned electricity supplier. Second, it had R\u00fchl, who\u2019d only recently become the Stadtwerke\u2019s boss. R\u00fchl spotted that E.ON\u2019s 20-year licence was approaching its expiry. Rather than just sign again on the dotted line, he thought Wolfhagen ought to reclaim the grid for itself \u2013 and pressed the case repeatedly upon the local council for months. For all the legal and financial advice he\u2019d garnered, R\u00fchl was not at all sure he\u2019d persuade the politicians. \u201cLots of people were saying something totally different.\u201d Yet, \u201cI knew it was legal and correct, and morally right.\u201d Perhaps it was his passion that enthused councillors, but \u201ceveryone said, \u2018Well if it\u2019s good for Wolfhagen, it\u2019s good for us. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d Now this small-town hick had to tell one of the giants of the energy world that the council no longer needed their services. How did E.ON take it? \u201cWell \u2026 \u201d He remembers a scrap of English understatement: \u201cThey were not amused.\u201d The Germans have a name for what R\u00fchl was about to do: Rekommunalisierung. One of those satisfyingly ungainly bits of Deutsch, it denotes a town or city reclaiming ownership of its public utilities. The term was partly spread by Wolfhagen\u2019s epic fight for control over its power supply. The British have their own word: lunacy. No matter how bad our privatised utilities get, any politician who suggests taking them back into public ownership may as well count the hairs on their palms. Rail franchises can collapse in a single afternoon. Energy giants (including E.ON) face accusations of overcharging the public. Water companies can deny the taxman his dues and the public their investment, while shovelling billions into the pockets of shareholders. For decades, Britons have paid through the nose for someone else \u2013 often based thousands of miles offshore \u2013 to rip them off. Now a clear majority of voters, even true-blue Tories, want public ownership of basic utilities. Yet to call for that very thing, as Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn does today, is to face the molten wrath of the rightwing press, the trade lobbyists and the Conservative party. To resist the ideological extreme that the private sector must always run our public services is to be denounced as an extremist ideologue. R\u00fchl faced his own denunciations from E.ON. \u201cThey said we couldn\u2019t do it. That the lights would go out. They said we were uneconomical \u2026 either the town would have to subsidise energy or residents would have to pay more.\u201d All \u201cbullshit\u201d, he says. Yet the fight brought sleepless nights and days besieged by worry that he wasn\u2019t up to the job. He realised he was attacking E.ON\u2019s business model. \u201cFor them it was like, \u2018If [Wolfhagen] want their grid back then maybe everyone does.\u2019 I was part of the breaking of the dam. So they had to give it their all.\u201d And the amount they wanted to be compensated for the grid was far higher than the town\u2019s starting bid. Approached for comment on these and other issues, E.ON said: \u201cWolfhagen was one of the first cases of remunicipalisation in Germany. Many commercial, technical and legal questions were not clarified. That\u2019s why both sides negotiated for so long.\u201d The multinational went back and forth with R\u00fchl for three years, before compromise was reached in 2006. E.ON\u2019s payoff was cobbled together by loans for local banks. His town had won control of its own grid. One epic battle had ended, but many more were to follow, across Germany. A two-hour train ride from Wolfhagen lies Frankfurt, where I met the closest thing Germany has to a professor of privatisation studies. Tim Engartner can list the family silver flogged by his country \u2013 the airline Lufthansa, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom. But, crucially, unlike their Westminster counterparts, German politicians don\u2019t privatise because they believe it will lead to better services. They mainly want the euros. \u201cSelling public assets gives them a huge windfall to spend on roads or social projects.\u201d This lack of dogmatism has two major consequences. First, it gives half a chance to any Martin R\u00fchl who can show that public control will yield even more euros for those essential works. Second, when a privatisation leads to worse services or higher prices, politicians can be pressured into reversing it. In the east German city of Potsdam, the privatisation of water pushed charges up by a third within two years \u2013 so it was cancelled. City after city has taken back bin collection in-house. And then there\u2019s energy. In 2005, Wolfhagen was into the final straight of taking its grid into public hands. Since then 284 municipalities, including the second-biggest city ofHamburg, have followed suit. Such cases don\u2019t get much of a showing in the British press. The pundits and policy wonks who equate public ownership with Red Robbo, Bakelite phones and stale British Rail sandwiches never mention that across Europe there have been 567 instances of public services being taken into public ownership since the year 2000. Everything from care homes for the elderly to bus companies is now run by continental towns and cities. In the 1870s, Birmingham was the birthplace of municipal socialism: the city\u2019s then-mayor, Joseph Chamberlain, bought the gas and waterworks and ran them for a public profit. Nearly 150 years later, Europe is pioneering a new form of municipal socialism, while Theresa May\u2019s ministers try the most motley methods to keep the failed East Coast mainline out of the public sector. Even so, Wolfhagen stands out. It\u2019s where the Japanese and South Koreans fly in just to take lessons. Visit the Stadtwerke today and R\u00fchl\u2019s successor, Alexander Rohrssen, will list its achievements. A profit every year, which has not only paid off the bank loans but funds the town\u2019s kindergartens. Generally cheaper electricity than most competitors, including E.ON. The number of staff has almost doubled and this still-small enterprise has won national prizes for its innovation on reducing energy use. But to see the real difference made by public ownership you need to head into the middle of the town, to a small cinema that opened in 1948. Kai Mellinghoff is the third generation of his family to run it. He barely remembers the battle with E.ON: \u201cIt was in the paper, but people weren\u2019t moved by it.\u201d A few months afterwards, however, R\u00fchl came to him with a proposal. He wanted to hire the cinema to screen environmental films. It was 2006, the year of Al Gore\u2019s An Inconvenient Truth. Tickets were either free or cheap, all 90 of the red plush seats were filled. This was an event. After the film, there might be a speaker on climate change or electric cars, and the audience would be invited on to Mellinghoff\u2019s terrace. He shows me its postcard view of the timber rooftops of his town and the woods beyond. Out here, the townspeople would clutch glasses of wine and discuss the film, the environment and what part they could play in preserving it. R\u00fchl wanted the now-public Stadtwerke to go 100% renewable by 2015; these evenings were his way of spreading the idea. Renewables meant a forest of solar panels, and giant wind turbines on the mountain that overlooks Wolfhagen. The prospect split the town in two: opponents of the wind farm produced mock-up posters of turbines looming out of a napalmed forest and leering down at locals. The Ancient Greeks would have known what to call Mellinghoff\u2019s terrace. It was an agora, a place for citizens to discuss politics. For all its fury, the debate turned the Stadtwerke from a company under new management to an asset in which everyone had a stake. That bond got closer after Wolfhagen had adopted the renewables pledge. To raise the millions needed to build the wind farm, the town sold a quarter of the energy firm\u2019s shares to locals in a citizens\u2019 co-op. The co-op has seats on the board of the company, giving residents a direct say over how their utility is managed. Even after all the years of fighting, I ask, would R\u00fchl recommend Britons do the same with their utilities? He ponders all the failures of British privatisation \u2013 with a special, sad mention of \u201cyour rail system\u201d. (Every German I meet uses the same regretful tone about British trains, as if discussing a child with behavioural problems.) Then he says something that sounds uncannily resonant to anyone in Brexit Britain. \u201cGermans say we can\u2019t make decisions because everything is decided in Brussels or by big companies. If you can improve your standard of living and make your own choices, that has to be good.\u201d One snowy afternoon, Iris Degenhardt-Meister walks me up the mountain to see the wind turbines up close. Over the couple of kilometres uphill, she laughs while rehearsing the charged town debates of a decade ago, as if remembering university pranks. A civil servant, she\u2019s also a co-op director. The shares give her a decent dividend, albeit capped by a Gierbremse, or greed brake. As for the turbines: \u201cWe love them!\u201d She can identify each one. That way lies eins, over there is vier. I ask a question that would be absurd in privatised Britain: does she feel they belong to her? \u201cYes!\u201d A pause to consider the size of the co-op\u2019s stake. \u201cAfter all, we own a quarter of them.\u201d Additional reporting by Josie Le Blond \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist.

This surge, which saw 100MW of capacity in 1992 rocket to more than 300GW in 2016, has been largely driven by falling costs, which plunged 86% between 2009 and 2017. China, the world leader in building and installing solar panels, added a record-breaking amount of capacity last year. The technology is even setting records in the grey UK: at one point last summer even providing more power than the nation\u2019s nuclear power stations. But with some experts asking whether the cost reduction curve of solar is drawing to an end, there are questions over whether stratospheric growth can be maintained. And while more energy from the sun hits the Earth\u2019s surface in an hour than humanity uses each year, can today\u2019s silicon-based solar meet our long-term power needs? To meet these challenges, researchers around the world are racing to explore new materials which can eke out more energy from the sun\u2019s photons and be used more flexibly than today\u2019s panels. The most abundant mineral on Earth has become the frontrunner, promising more efficient and lighter solar panels, which could even be made semi-transparent for use as windows. \u201cPerovskite currently has taken the lead among emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies,\u201d says Varun Sivaram, fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations. His upcoming book on solar says the crystal has made a meteoric ascent in academic circles, describing it as: \u201ca material that could enable manufacture of cheap, highly efficient solar coatings that could be unspooled from a printer much as newspaper is printed.\u201d One firm born in Oxford, England, is at the vanguard of the race to develop and scale up perovskite for commercial use. Founded in 2010, Oxford PV initially spent years exploring an alternative, dye-sensitive cells. But Henry Snaith, the firm\u2019s co-founder, changed tack in 2012. \u201cI discovered perovskite could be extremely efficient in PV cells. We realised this was where the real opportunity lay.\u201d The British- and German-based company\u2019s big idea is to piggyback on the success of silicon, which Chinese manufacturing scale and efficiency has made so cheap. Perovskite captures energy from a different part of sunlight\u2019s wavelength than silicon, so Oxford PV\u2019s plan is to layer it atop silicon, to maximise electricity generation. \u201cWe find ourselves in a position that we are not fighting a $35bn industry [silicon], we are enhancing it. The idea is use the existing assets. If you do something completely different it will fail. This can complement the existing cell,\u201d said Frank Averdung, the company\u2019s CEO. Working with a major but unnamed solar panel manufacturer, the firm hopes to have a product ready for market by 2019. While the price of silicon-based solar panels has fallen from more than $350 per megawatt hour for a largescale farm in 2009 to more than $50 in 2017, some in the sector think such dramatic reductions have come to an end. Artur Kupczunas, co-founder of Poland-based perovskite firm Saule Technologies, said the cost cuts had bottomed out: \u201cWe saw a very rapid fall of the prices. [But] there are technology obstacles [for it] to go down as rapidly as it did since 2013.\u201d Saule, which is in talks with Japan\u2019s space agency, is developing inkjet printing for its perovksite-based solar modules. Today it can only print them at A4 size, but the company\u2019s 25-strong team hopes to expand that to one square metre by the year\u2019s end. Kupczunas is most excited about the prospect of incorporating the solar panels in fabric of new buildings, both in the walls and - because it can be made semi-transparent - as windows. \u201cYou can use it in the whole building,\u201d he said, noting silicon was too heavy for such applications. Perovskite is what as known as a third generation solar cell. Silicon is first generation, while a group of other rivals including thin film are the second. Compared to silicon, which needs to heated at more than 1,000C during manufacture for solar cells, perovskite does not need to be processed at high temperatures. That means it is less energy-intensive and is less costly to make. A typical silicon-based solar cell converts around 21-22% of sunlight into energy, and the material\u2019s limit is 29%. Oxford PV thinks that its approach of perovskite-on-silicon can get that efficiency up to around 25%. \u201cWhat it means is out of same cell, you get 20% more power. That is significant,\u201d said Averdung. Paul Coxon, a physicist in materials science at Cambridge University, thinks that combining silicon and perovskite could be a good way to commercialise the new technology and overcome the limits of the older one. \u201cNo matter how cheap they [silicon-based cells] become that limit [of 29% efficiency] will still apply. As humanity\u2019s need for electricity grows, continuing with this single technology this limit might pose a tricky hurdle to overcome,\u201d he said. Coxon said the potential for perovskite is huge, and research is growing fast, as evidenced by nearly 4,000 scientific papers being published on it last year alone. However, he expects silicon will continue to dominate in large, utility-scale solar farms, with the new technology used in smaller, constrained spaces. \u201cI think we may see perovskite cells used in solar tiles in domestic and smaller scales and maybe even in space-based PV arrays,\u201d he said. Some might question the need for more efficient solar cells, when China has made silicon-based ones so cheap. But experts believe there are still good reasons to ramp up efficiency through materials like perovskite. Michael McGehee, professor of materials science at Stanford University, said: \u201cAs the cost of solar panels has come down over the last 10 years, the situation has arisen where a little more than half of the cost of putting in a collection of panels is the installation itself. \u201cFor that reason, it is highly desirable to improve the efficiency of the panels so that the number of panels that needs to be installed is reduced. Indirectly that lowers the installation costs. That is why continuing to improve the efficiency is still very important.\u201d Of course, there is no guarantee perovskite will succeed as solar\u2019s new wonder material. Academics and companies repeatedly emphasised to the Guardian that development is at very early stages, and Oxford PV and Saule both have technical and production challenges to overcome. Other third generation materials are competing too. \u201cAlthough perovskite is the lab leader, it does have potential drawbacks, and it isn\u2019t the only promising solar material out there. Other approaches - including organic and quantum dot solar cells - come with their own unique advantages,\u201d said Sivaram. But the biggest obstacles are likely to be financial ones, such as skittish investors who were burned by previous boom-and-bust cycles in clean technology. Sivaram said: \u201cAs long as investors and the solar industry continue to ignore academia, perovskite and other new solar technologies could well remain lab-bench novelties.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

This weekend, however, thousands of people will join in an effort to rid its coastline, rivers and jungles of rubbish and restore its natural beauty. The mass cleanup is the initiative of One Island One Voice(OIOV), an umbrella movement of organisations and individuals wanting to reduce waste and create a \u201cgreener, cleaner Bali\u201d. The movement includes groups such as Bye Bye Plastic Bags, an NGO founded by two Balinese teenage sisters, Melati and Isabel Wijsen, who want Bali to ban plastic bags. \u201cThis event is not only a cleanup action, it is a chance to raise awareness and understanding about what really happens in Bali,\u201d said Rima Agustina, one of the coordinators. She said the action was as much about changing attitudes as cleaning up beaches. \u201cAll it takes is one or two hours of picking up trash and for most people the mindset is completely transformed. They would start thinking that those single-use plastics give more harm than benefits to community.\u201d Bali\u2019s beaches have been swamped by unsightly mounds of rubbish for months, much of it plastic washed in from neighbouring Java during the annual rainy season \u2013 or what Balinese call rubbish season. The waste has become such an issue that tourists are being scared away. \u201cMany tourists have reported that they don\u2019t want to come back to Bali after seeing how bad the trash is,\u201d said Sara Craves, an OIOV spokeswoman. Indonesia is the second-largest plastic polluter in the world after China, with 200,000 tonnes of plastic flowing into its oceans via rivers and streams each year. The initiative echoes other movements around the world trying to tackle the steady burial of the earth\u2019s beauty under mounds of consumer jetsam. Volunteers in Mumbai have been waging war on detritus on the city beaches for several years. Readers of this series, The Upside, have been in touch to point to local initiatives everywhere from Devizes in England to Lodwar in Kenya. The OIOV initiative will collect tonnes of rubbish in every region in Bali and take it to village-scale and industrial sorting centres. Some will be upcycled or turned into EcoBricks. The significant quantities of waste that flow over from Indonesia\u2019s larger islands are one element of the problem in Bali. A small island ill-equipped to cope with endless hotel developments and the millions of tourists that visit each year, Bali alone produces about 5,000 cubic metres of waste a day. With five legal rubbish dumps on the island, only about 25% of its waste is collected through official channels. The rest is burned, or dumped on roadsides and mountains and in rivers and the ocean. Harriet Burrows, a British teacher from Bali\u2019s Green School, will be attending cleanups on Saturday, accompanied by kindergarten and high school students and their parents in what she says is a whole-community event. \u201cPeople can take part in three cleans in one day, which is pretty incredible,\u201d said Burrows. \u201cSo you can go from where you live to the beaches where you walk your dog, to the beaches where you surf, so it\u2019s the idea of really focusing in on places that make up this experience of living in Bali.\u201d Saturday\u2019s event even has its own theme song, Satu Pulau Satu Suara, or One island one voice, a collaboration between local and international musicians that calls for the island to be left \u201cjust the way we found her\u201d. The cleanup organisers say they do not expect to turn Bali\u2019s rubbish woes around overnight. \u201cCleanups are not the solution,\u201d said Craves. \u201cThey are just the way to raise awareness and a way to bring people together, and get them involved in the problem so we can start to find solution.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The Scottish social enterprise Social Bite, which has previously attracted celebrity support from George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, will take a minimum of 600 people out of homelessness over the next 18 months, alongside fully funded wrap-around support for clinical issues, such as mental ill-health and addiction, and more practical concerns such as finding furniture and arranging refuse collection. Following the death of a homeless man in Westminster last Wednesday, the Social Bite co-founder Joshua Littlejohn said it was inevitable that more rough sleepers would die if the status quo continued, adding that he hoped that the project might have \u201csignificant lessons for the rest of the UK\u201d. Scotland, which had almost eliminated street homelessness after pioneering legislation passed by Holyrood in 2003, has recently experienced an increase in rough sleeping as welfare cuts have tipped more people into domestic insecurity. According to Shelter Scotland, there are now an estimated 5,000 rough sleepers across the year. Rough sleeping in England has increased for seven consecutive years, with official figures showing 4,751 people slept outside overnight in 2017. Littlejohn said: \u201cThe system at the moment doesn\u2019t make sense in terms of compassion for individuals, like that man who died, in the most acute housing need. Nor does it make sense economically because the status quo is very expensive, and all the international evidence shows that we save money by getting these individuals into mainstream tenancies.\u201d From founding, in 2012, the Social Bite sandwich chain, which has formerly homeless people making up a quarter of its staff, Littlejohn has become a leading advocate for Housing First. This radical model places the most entrenched rough sleepers in permanent housing before they have dealt with their addiction, mental illness or other challenges. It works on the assumption that people make most progress when based in a stable home rather than a hostel or shared temporary accommodation. Following success in the US and Finland, the Westminster government last November pledged \u00a328m for pilots in the West Midlands, Manchester and Liverpool. A government-funded study in Liverpool concluded that Housing First could save \u00a34m, compared with current homelessness services in the area. Littlejohn credited the Scottish government with a \u201cnew sense of urgency\u201d after it announced a \u00a350m fund to tackle rough sleeping last September. Since then, he has been working to bring local councils and chief executives of the largest housing associations on board with the plan, which was welcomed by Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, on Wednesday. A combined total of 500 properties have been offered in Edinburgh by Edinburgh council and a range of housing associations, and in Glasgow and the Central Belt by the Wheatley Group. Dundee council has also pledged 100 homes with partner housing associations. The first homes will become available this spring, with around 33 properties being added each month up to September 2019. The comprehensive support package for new residents will be funded mainly through money raised by Sleep in the Park, billed as the world\u2019s largest sleep-out, which entailed more than 8,000 people braving freezing temperatures to sleep outside in Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh last December. Social Bite will invest \u00a31.5m into funding these support costs over the first year of the project, and a further \u00a31.5m over the second year alongside other funders. The intention is to collect sufficient evidence of positive outcomes \u2013 in terms of tenancy sustainment, mental health improvement, and cost savings \u2013 to convince the Scottish government and local authorities to mainstream the support funding after two years.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "'Equality won't happen by itself': how Iceland got tough on gender pay gap", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/20/iceland-equal-pay-law-gender-gap-women-jobs-equality", "date": "2018-02-20", "transcript": "On the face of it, Iceland is a good place to be a woman. For nearly a decade, it has been rated the world\u2019s most gender-equal country. It was the first to directly elect a female president, nearly half its MPs and company directors are women, and first-class daycare and parental leave help ensure almost four in five women have jobs. So it came as a shock for Fr\u00ed\u00f0a R\u00f3s Valdimarsd\u00f3ttir to learn, when she was managing a key team of 10 home carers at Reykjavik council a few years ago, that male colleagues in other departments, with far fewer responsibilities than her, were being paid a great deal more. \u201cIt has been illegal for decades, for jobs that are worth the same, to pay people differently because of gender, but still it happens \u2013 it\u2019s simply been allowed,\u201d says Valdimarsd\u00f3ttir, who is now the chair of the Icelandic Women\u2019s Rights Association, in her bright offices in the country\u2019s capital. Despite an equal pay act that dates back to 1961, Icelandic women still earn, on average, between 14% and 20% less than men. So Valdimarsd\u00f3ttir and her association were one of many campaign groups to back a plan that finally resulted, last month, in the island becoming the first country in the world to legally enforce equal pay. Within four years from January 2018, any public or private body in Iceland employing more than 25 people that has not been independently certified as paying equal wages for work of equal value will face daily fines. \u201cThe legislation will take some time to bed in, of course,\u201d Valdimarsd\u00f3ttir says. \u201cThere will be challenges. But it\u2019s possible, and we can do it. Mainly, I\u2019m just so proud we actually made it happen.\u201d R\u00f3sa Gu\u00f0r\u00fan Erlingsd\u00f3ttir, head of the equality unit at Iceland\u2019s welfare ministry, says equality \u201cwon\u2019t come about by itself, from the bottom up alone. Our experience is that you need legislative measures to move things forward. People accept that; we saw it with mandatory quotas for women on company boards. If politicians want to wait until no one opposes it, it will never happen.\u201d Some in Iceland still do oppose it, albeit cautiously. The new law requires employers to show, through certification by an accredited auditor, that their pay management system complies with a national equal pay standard modelled on the international ISO environmental management standards familiar to all companies. The standard was published in 2012 and welcomed by Iceland\u2019s trade unions and employers, who helped design it. Hannes Sigur\u00f0sson of the Business Iceland confederation says it was considered sound business sense, likely to \u201cimprove a company\u2019s image in the eyes of its customers, and make its workforce a whole lot happier\u201d. It was, however, designed to be voluntary. \u201cIt was a carrot, win-win,\u201d Sigur\u00f0sson says. \u201cThe government has turned it into a stick.\u201d The process \u2013 assessing the worth of very different jobs, classifying and ranking occupations, analysing salary structures, collating and recording data, making sure the new system meshes with collective labour agreements \u2013 is \u201cquite complex\u201d, he says. \u201cYou need to put resources into it. It\u2019s easier for big companies, with whole HR departments.\u201d As it stands, the legislation is staggered over four years. Large firms and institutions such as government ministries and the national hospital, with workforces of more than 250 people, have until the end of this year to become certified; those with fewer than 90 employees but more than 25 have until the end of 2021. The fine for those that do not comply is ISK50,000 (\u00a3350) a day. And the public shame, it is hoped, will be worse. None of Business Iceland\u2019s members have openly criticised the new law, Sigur\u00f0sson says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to come out publicly against a measure that enhances gender equality. But I think it\u2019s clear there is opposition to the method. We would have preferred the process to be bottom-up.\u201d Others, however, are delighted. \u201cThis will not eliminate the gender pay gap overnight,\u201d says Mar\u00edanna Traustad\u00f3ttir, an equality adviser at the Icelandic trade union confederation ASI. \u201cBut it is the best toolbox I have seen, and it will make a big difference. It will force employers to think differently.\u201d It will not be straightforward, she concedes. \u201cDeciding the relative value of a canteen worker and a driver, for example. Documenting and justifying everything ... But we now have clear guidelines to follow, courses to go on, specialist software, new consultants to help. It\u2019s doable. Several companies already have.\u201d Traustad\u00f3ttir cites Reykjavik Energy, the parent company of Iceland\u2019s largest power provider, which was forced to fire one-third of its workforce in the aftermath of the financial crash, but seized on its subsequent restructuring as an opportunity to become a fully gender-equal employer. Within five years, by \u201cputting the gender glasses on before taking every single decision\u201d, it had boosted the proportion of women in management positions from 29% to 49%. Over the same period, its adjusted gender pay gap shrank from 8.4% to 2.1% \u2013 and now stands at 0.2% in favour of women. The company\u2019s chief executive, Bjarni Bjarnason, says the net outcome has been \u201cmore open discussions, higher productivity, greater job satisfaction, improved decision-making, higher morale, and an all-round far better atmosphere\u201d. For many, the legislation reflects the fact that more than 40 years after 90% of Iceland\u2019s women famously went on strike for a day, the country \u201cis not quite the gender-equality paradise it\u2019s often painted\u201d, says Annad\u00eds Gr\u00e9ta R\u00fad\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir, an assistant education professor. \u201cThat WEF index is fairly crude. It doesn\u2019t reflect the pay gap, or gender-based violence. We have our fair share of toxic masculinity. #MeToo was as shocking here as anywhere.\u201d Her colleague, Berglind R\u00f3s Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir, says a broader \u201cre-engineering\u201d of society is still needed. \u201cThis won\u2019t fix the huge gap between typically male and typically female sectors,\u201d she says. \u201cBetween engineering, for example, and nursing or teaching. Anything to do with care or education is paid less.\u201d But there is confidence the legislation is a major step in the right direction. \u201cThe pay gap was hidden behind a lack of transparency,\u201d says Magnea Marin\u00f3sd\u00f3ttir of the welfare ministry\u2019s equality unit, noting that the standard could be used to justify a pay difference as much as to eliminate it. \u201cEmployers can take into account experience, qualifications \u2013 it\u2019s just that it now has to be transparent, and justified,\u201d Marin\u00f3sd\u00f3ttir adds. \u201cThe standard is simply designed to eliminate factors that are irrelevant by law \u2013 such as gender. It could equally be used to eliminate discrimination by race or disability.\u201d Legislation, she is convinced, \u201ccan impact attitudes and behaviour. We\u2019ve seen that time and again. We still live in a very gendered reality in Iceland. Even here, the patriarchal culture, a male sense of entitlement, is deep-rooted. This can be a real impetus for change.\u201d Erlingsd\u00f3ttir says the Icelandic model could also be adopted elsewhere: Portugal is exploring doing so, raising the possibility that Iceland\u2019s equal pay standard could eventually become a European one. \u201cThe information is there, and the education is there,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we need the effort.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Billie Quinlan wants to make women happier with a digital sex guru. Rajshekar Patil is devising tools to help children moderate screen time. Rachel Thomas aims to change how people think using online modules. In a speed-pitching session (like Dragon\u2019s Den on fast-forward with better coffee and fewer self-interested billionaires) these and 20 similar propositions are rattled out by teams of two or three people who met only weeks ago. Other ideas include proposals for improving maternal mental health, revamping social care and getting people active, as well as various \u201cdigital assistants\u201d to help prevent burnout, manage money or plan retirement. The proponents are an ultra-qualified class of 2018 \u2013 55 people from 19 countries, doctors, data scientists, software developers and serial entrepreneurs who have been selected for an intense six-month programme under the aegis of Zinc, a business incubator with a social mission. The aim is ambitious: to rethink the world\u2019s approach to mental health treatment. And how it needs rethinking. Mental illness has emerged as a ubiquitous, universal scourge in recent years. No country or social group is immune. Nowhere has got to grips with how to treat the millions who fall ill every year. Health systems are stretched to helplessness. Mental health is still a poor relation of physical health. Pills are a scattergun approach. Therapy is costly, woefully inaccessible, even in rich countries. In short, this is a crisis that is ripe for innovation. That\u2019s where Zinc comes in. \u201cWe believe that too many important social problems are left to governments and charities to fix, and too many of them don\u2019t get fixed,\u201d says Paul Kirby, who founded Zinc last year with venture capitalist Saul Klein and marketing strategist Ella Goldner. \u201cSolutions often rely on individuals, families, local communities, employers and other having the motivation, opportunities and capabilities to change things for themselves,\u201d Kirby added. One thing people who suddenly succumb to mental illness often complain about is not just the lack of clinical help but the paucity of information on what is available \u2013 locally, nationally, publicly, privately. Jim Woods reckons the answer is a proper platform for services \u2013 a sort of \u201cmoneysupermarket.com for mental health\u201d as he puts it. The bewildered sufferer will get guidance on treatments, counsellors, self-help communities, apps, peer support and literature. \u201cWe want to build a whole new global system for mental health. A platform with answers for people rich and poor,\u201d says Woods, an entrepreneur and former CEO of the Yo! group. The aim is to offer prevention as well as cure, and Woods expects businesses to sign up to the platform because of the growing interest in preventing staff becoming sick. \u201cThe NHS can only do reactive, fixing illnesses,\u201d Woods says. \u201cPrevention is the cheapest way.\u201d Others are more interested in the physical manifestations of mental unease. Take IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. Gastro specialists admit there are few treatments for sufferers. Some doctors believe it is caused principally by a surfeit of stress. \u201cIBS is all about stress, and with technology we can deliver tools that can alleviate symptoms,\u201d says Jossy Onwade, a 27-year-old Nigerian doctor, who left his home and family and came to London for the first time to take on the challenge. Indeed, many of the participants have left homes, jobs, spouses, children behind to pursue their ambitions. Aziz Lalljee left his wife in America for six months to try to realise his plan for \u201ca new model of domiciliary social care that dignifies the carer and delights the receiver\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m here for as long as it takes for this to succeed,\u201d he promises. Of course, not all the ideas will get off the ground. Some do not seem terribly original: you wonder, for example, whether a world that already has a proliferation of mental health apps such as headspace and woebot needs any more or whether shattered minds in need of rest really need more digital stimulus. The fact that these are businesses could also prove controversial: some will fail; some may make profits \u2013 from the mental discomfort of others. Entrepreneur and investor Tuvi Orbach is already mentoring several groups with a view to buying stakes. \u201cI will invest in a few of these companies because I believe they will be successful,\u201d he says. Zinc aims to run 15 such programmes over the next five years, hoping to create as many as 200 new businesses to tackle pressing social issues in the developed world. It is currently raising money to support its programmes. \u201cWe are relying on a lot of goodwill,\u201d says Kirby.

Phyllis Omido has been threatened by thugs, arrested by police and forced into hiding for organising opposition to a lead-smelting factory in Mombasa, which allegedly poisoned residents in the neighbouring shantytown of Owino Uhuru. But the NGO she founded, the Centre for Justice, Governance, and Environmental Action, has already forced the closure of the plant and is now pushing the courts to secure compensation for the victims and a clean-up of the community. They have gathered thousands of local residents in a class action against the government and two companies \u2013 Metal Refinery EPZ Ltd and Penguin Paper and Book Company (no connection with the global publishing company) for 1.6bn Kenyan shillings (\u00a311.5m) compensation and a clean-up of contaminated land. Two years after the suit was launched, the plaintiffs will be called as witness for the first time on 19 March in the environment and land court. \u201cThis is the biggest step since we started,\u201d Omido told the Guardian. \u201cThe victims will finally get to tell their story in court. That\u2019s crucial in making people realise what happened. We hope our case will be something that every environmental defender in the world can refer to when they raise issues of accountability.\u201d Progress has been perilous. Following assaults and intimidation, the United Nations has called on the Kenyan government to protect Omido and her fellow activists. A special rapporteur, John Knox, said in a statement last year that two homes had been burned, death sentences had been issued and a 12-year-old son of one activist was kidnapped for three days. The plant has been closed. Former director Hezron Awiti Bollo declined to respond to the allegations. \u201cI cannot comment. This is a matter that is in the courts,\u201d he told the Guardian by phone. Sometimes referred to as the \u201ceast African Erin Brockovich\u201d, Omido was a co-winner of the Goldman environmental prize in 2015 along with Berta C\u00e1ceres, the Honduran activist who was murdered a year later. Omido also lives under constant threat. She has had to go into hiding several times and carries a panic button that can alert international supporters and trace her whereabouts if she is abducted. \u201cI face threats to my life because of this case,\u201d she told the Guardian. Before its closure, the EPZ refinery recycled car batteries, using chemicals to extract the lead. Former workers said they were given only a flimsy face mask as protection. Neighbours said noxious smoke billowed out from the factory chimney, blackening and corroding the tin roofs of the shanty town; toxic waste leaked into a stream that ran through the village. \u201cPeople used it for cooking and washing,\u201d said the local pastor, Anastasia Nambo. \u201cWe sometimes drank it even though it smelt rotten because we don\u2019t have any alternative. We had no idea it was dangerous. \u201cNobody told us for several years. We want compensation for those we know are affected and tests for those who do not yet know their status.\u201d Omido \u2013 who worked in the company office \u2013 was the first to make a connection between the factory and health problems. She started to grow concerned in 2010 when her baby son fell ill. Blood tests showed the amount of lead in his blood was 35 times above the the World Health Organisation\u2019s level of concern, she said. Assuming this had been passed on when she nursed him, she then arranged for three more children to be tested, all of whom proved to have been contaminated. Locals also complained of unusually high numbers of miscarriages and respiratory disease. After the factory refused to relocate and the environment ministry ignored her warnings, Omido organised demonstrations by thousands of residents, who blocked the main road between Mombasa and Nairobi with burning tyres. Many were arrested by police or beaten by factory security guards. Since then the group\u2019s tactics have grown increasingly sophisticated as they built networks of support across the continent and the globe. The East Africa Society provided pro bono legal advice. Foreign NGOs including Frontline Defenders and Human Rights Watch provided advice and media support. When the Kenyan authorities refused to close the plant, Omido went over their heads by appealing to the East Africa Community. This regional body banned lead from Kenya, forcing the closure of more than a dozen smelters, including the one at Owino Uhuru. In 2013, the Kenyan authorities approved tests for 50 residents. All came back positive, with the highest reading 420 micrograms per deciliter of blood - more than 80 times the point considered a health concern. The community is still dealing with the aftermath. One mother, Janeth Jardine says she used the stream that runs through the village to wash her children and clean food. Now she blames it for the flaking rash that covers the hands and legs of her two-year-old daughter, Josephine. \u201cThey never heal. I\u2019ve taken her to hospital six times. They give cream, but it makes no difference,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is common in this village.\u201d Many of those who developed rashes later died or suffered repeated bouts of illness. One man blames the death of two of his children on the contaminated soil they used to play in. Others remember Linet Baraza, who died with lead levels of 238 micrograms per deciliter of blood. They are also warned that their children may suffer lower IQs unless they can get the expensive treatment needed to purge the lead from their blood. The UN Commission on Human Rights is helping to fund the legal claim for compensation. And UN Environment has raised their appeal for treatment, remediation and justice at international forums. \u201cPhyllis has shown what can be achieved when victims of pollution get access to even basic information,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the executive director of UN Environment. \u201cNow it is up to the courts to show that the law is on the side of environmental defenders.\u201d Omido hopes it will just be the start. \u201cThere are 17 other communities fighting for compensation for lead poisoning. We want to set a precedent for them,\u201d she says. \u2018We want to show environmental defenders can use litigation as a tool and we want the UN to build up the capacity to enforce environmental law in courts around the world. Defenders are often treated as criminals or people who are hostile to development. That is not the case.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world\u2019s biggest problems. What else should we cover?

People take notice. They read to the end. They share it with their friends. They create rare pools of wellbeing on social media. They write to thank you. Eighteen months ago, the Guardian launched a pilot project to see how readers would respond if we deliberately sought out the good things happening in the world. More than 150 pieces of journalism later \u2013 in which we have examined the relative merits of everything from dog turds to ketamine, the blockchain to microhouses, and gardening to exoskeletons \u2013 we have proof of concept. Reader numbers for this kind of journalism have proven remarkably robust throughout the project, with almost one in 10 readers on average sharing stories on social media. News doesn\u2019t have to be bad. The planet is complex. Away from the horror and conflict, the shouting and the skulduggery, away from the tragedy, disaster and zero-sum misanthropy, there is a wide world of answers and improvements, of win-win and mutual support, of selflessness and curiosity, of movements and innovations. And when you write about it, people tend to respond positively. They do so because while audiences have always been riveted by bad news (it serves as both an early warning system and a reassurance about the comfort of their own lives), they are tired of the avalanche of awfulness. They are switching off. That is a bad thing. If people just shrug at news because they feel there is little they can do, nothing will change. Journalists in the US, Europe and the UK are waking up to this by publishing what is variously described as constructive journalism, solutions journalism or, somewhat misleadingly, positive news. Now the Guardian is deepening its commitment to this type of work. Our new series, The Upside, launched this week with support from the Skoll foundation and a sprightly determination to show readers all of humanity, not just the bad bits. This does not mean we will reduce our efforts to uncover wrongdoing, to hold the powerful to account. It does mean that, in addition, we will be looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might, innovations whose time might have come. As our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, promised in a speech on the future of the Guardian recently, \u201cwe will develop ideas that help improve the world, not just critique it. Despair is just another form of denial. People long to feel hopeful again \u2013 and young people, especially, yearn to feel the hope that previous generations once had.\u201d It is something our readers and members consistently ask for. Our request this week for ideas from readers resulted in more than 1,000 responses and suggestions from more than two dozen countries. \u201cYou are on the right track - we need more articles like this,\u201d said Marti Mahoney of Albuquerque, in response to Jon Henley\u2019s article on why Finland always seems to have answers to modern social problems. \u201cMore about kindness, discoveries and innovations that are improving society, please,\u201d wrote Lorraine Simpson, from Edinburgh. \u201cSome positive reflections on data trends too; for example I read yesterday that war and violence have decreased across the globe over the past century, which was a pleasant surprise.\u201d Nick Marchant, from Dublin, wrote in: \u201cI really support your intention to publish positive stories, I\u2019ve been looking for it for a long time. I find a lot of news coverage very negative, and it makes me switch off various issues.\u201d \u201cRecently I have been thinking about the psychological aspect of being bombarded by negative news stories and although they are important I feel that without optimistic news stories to contrast them you leave readers feeling punch-drunk and depressed about the world,\u201d Simon Taylor wrote. \u201cI understand there are some positive news stories on the Guardian site but it would be brilliant to have a dedicated section for moments of \u2018oh god show me something to be happy about!\u2019\u201d Perhaps curious is a better word than happy. Not everything we cover will necessarily change the world for the better, but it will offer the promise of doing so. There are some ground rules. We won\u2019t jump at every piece of puff and PR that comes our way. We will set a high bar, looking for things that appear replicable, robust and confront the big challenges of our times \u2013 the environment, health (particularly mental), atomised communities, flagging democracy, gender discrimination and technology. We will attempt to find the communities trying to solve some of these problems and, ideally, this will take us to places we rarely visit, broadening our reach and our understanding. And we are encouraging readers to take part. Let us know what you want to see from this series, where you see the hope.

The contents has changed over time (it now includes a duvet, quilted suit, bonnet, socks and gloves) but it remains hugely popular: 95% of mothers choose it over a cash alternative. Child day care Since the 1980s, Finnish parents of children under three have been able to choose between local authority daycare and a parental \u201chome care allowance\u201d of about \u20ac330 a month for the first child (plus a means-tested extra of up to \u20ac180). Half as many Finnish toddlers are in daycare as in other Nordic countries. Xylitol Finland began researching the natural sweetener Xylitol and its capacity to dramatically reduce dental plaque in the early 1970s and developed and launched a Xylitol chewing gum \u2013 arguably the world\u2019s first health-improving food product \u2013 in 1975. Paternity leave Paternity leave was introduced in Finland in 1978. A parental allowance is now paid for 263 working days, with the first 105 paid to the mother and the remaining 158 to either the father or mother. Fathers are also entitled to a \u201cfather\u2019s month\u201d off under certain conditions; around 35% take it. National suicide prevention project Finland has halved its suicide rate from 30.3 per 100,000 in 1990 to 14.2 last year after introducing the world\u2019s first national anti-suicide strategy in the late 1980s. Exhaustive research to understand the causes of hundreds of cases produced a nationwide preventive programme. Integrated health centres Finland\u2019s unique all-inclusive, integrated, municipal healthcare centres, introduced in 1972, offer community preventative, diagnostic and curative care; a dental service; GP-level (non-surgical) hospital care; home nursing services; mental health care; rehabilitation and occupational healthcare and ambulance services. Principle of transparency Finland has had a freedom of information act, stating that everyone has a right not just to access government documents but to copy them, since 1766. Documents are public unless ruled otherwise. Restrictions to the general rule must be legislated by parliament, and refusal to make documents public can be challenged in the courts. Committee for the future A long history of coalitions has encouraged stable government with an eye for the long term and the collective interest. But the Finnish parliament is also unusual in having, for the past quarter century, a permanent committee for the future in which MPs study and report on major social challenges for the coming decades. Finnish free comprehensive education Finnish law guarantees a free, high-quality, nine-year basic education (to age 15) in municipal-run schools to every child, regardless of where they live or the wealth of their parents, declaring it an essential human right. Half then go to high school or polytechnic, and half into vocational education, which is also free \u2013 as is further and university education. All school teachers have at least a university master\u2019s degree. Veikkaus The national state-owned gaming company has the exclusive right to operate all gaming and gambling in Finland (including online gambling on the country\u2019s largest webstore), and the responsibility for mitigating gambling risks. It employs 2,000 people and raises \u20ac1bn a year for health, social welfare, cultural, youth and scientific projects, distributed by the relevant ministries.", "source": "The Guardian"}, {"title": "Safe, happy and free: does Finland have all the answers?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/safe-happy-and-free-does-finland-have-all-the-answers", "date": "2018-02-12", "transcript": "Western Europe\u2019s last naturally caused famine ended 150 years ago this winter. In a poor and backward part of the Russian empire called Finland, more than a quarter of a million people \u2013 nearly 10% of the population \u2013 starved to death. Last year, on the centenary of its independence, Finland was ranked, by assorted international indices, the most stable, the safest and the best-governed country in the world. It was also the third wealthiest, the third least corrupt, the second most socially progressive and the third most socially just. Finland\u2019s judicial system is the most independent in the world, its police the most trusted, its banks the soundest, its companies the second most ethical, its elections the second freest, and its citizens enjoy the highest levels of personal freedom, choice and wellbeing. The Nordic country\u2019s 5.5 million inhabitants are also the third most gender-equal in the world and have the fifth lowest income inequality. Their babies are the least underweight, their kids feel the most secure, and their teens perform the second best at reading (only third at science, though). In a century and a half, they seem to have done rather well. And so, as the Guardian embarks on a new series investigating the things that are going right in the world, it feels natural to start in Helsinki. \u201cIf you look at where we were then and where we are now, I think, absolutely, you can talk about a Finnish miracle,\u201d said Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m, a Helsinki-born Nobel prize-winning economist not much given to exaggeration. \u201cHow and why did it happen? Now that\u2019s a question.\u201d There are limits, of course, to the usefulness of this kind of exercise: no two countries \u2013 their circumstances, their histories, their people \u2013 can be the same. Learnings may not be transferable. The magic sauce that made Finland would not produce the same results in, say, France. It is true, too, that shown the long list of social and economic measures by which their country can only be judged a success, many Finns snort: emerging slowly from a long recession, with unemployment at 8% and a populist, nationalist party garnering up to 20% of the vote, the country\u2019s not what it was, they say. Often, the response \u2013 only semi-joking \u2013 is, \u201cYou mean other countries are worse?\u201d But inquiring after the sauce\u2019s recipe of, among others, an economist, a philosopher, a sociologist and an ex-president, intriguing ingredients emerge. To begin with, the geography \u2013 and its consequence, the climate. \u201cWe live,\u201d Tarja Halonen, Finland\u2019s president from 2000 to 2012, says carefully, \u201cin a cold, harsh and remote place. Every person has to work hard for themselves. But that is not always enough. You have to help your neighbours.\u201d Bruce Oreck, who served as Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to Helsinki (he liked it so much he stayed), says this has been \u201ca profound, long-term influence. It\u2019s made Finns self-reliant, private, but also dependent on a highly cooperative society, where rules matter. It\u2019s cultural, but it\u2019s become part of the chemistry.\u201d Of all the Finnish words that are hard to translate into English, the one Finns cite most is sisu: a kind of dogged, courageous persistence regardless of consequence. It is what, in 1939-40, allowed an army of 350,000 men to twice fight off Soviet forces three times their number, and inflict losses five times heavier than those they sustained. But there is another that is, perhaps, more revealing, says Sirpa K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, an award-winning historical novelist. Talkoo means \u201cworking together, collectively, for a specific good\u201d, she says. \u201cGetting the harvest in, stocking wood, raising money. It\u2019s about cooperating. Everyone together, equally.\u201d Cooperation, but also relative equality, are recurring themes. Ruled for almost 600 years by Sweden and a further century by Russia, Finland was \u201cgenerally and democratically poor\u201d, says K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen. \u201cThere were no serfs, but no wildly wealthy aristocrats either. Society was not hierarchical.\u201d Since long before independence in 1917, says Riitta Jallinoja, a sociologist, \u201cgaps between the social classes in Finland have been smaller than usual. Even the industrial revolution here was modest: no Rothschilds, no Fords, not even a dynasty like Sweden\u2019s Wallenbergs.\u201d Even in today\u2019s clean, functional, visibly prosperous Helsinki, that still sort of holds. \u201cYou can be walking down the street next to the richest guy in town, and you really wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d says Oreck. In Finland, insists Halonen, \u201cYou don\u2019t look up at people, and you don\u2019t look down. You look level.\u201d The country\u2019s most successful current firm, games studio Supercell, creator of Clash of Clans, paid over \u20ac800m in tax, producing seven of Finland\u2019s top 10 income tax payers in 2016. Along with the rest of the country\u2019s highest 10,000 or so highest earners, the amount they pay is published in an annual list, on \u201cnational envy day\u201d. Finland is big on civic duty, but also on transparency. The success of the country\u2019s free national education system, established before independence in 1866 and regularly ranked among the world\u2019s best, also has its roots in a more egalitarian society, says Jallinoja: \u201cEducation was the key to advancement.\u201d Not only that, says the philosopher and professor emeritus Ilkka Niiniluoto, but the whole country is actually \u201ca social construction created by university professors.\u201d The academics who led the country\u2019s nationalist movement \u201ccreated Finland as a nation: its language, history, literature, music, symbols, folklore. The nationalist leader was a philosophy professor.\u201d Since independence, nearly 30% of Finland\u2019s heads of state and government have been university professors, including half its early prime ministers. \u201cThey shaped the country as we know it,\u201d says Jallinoja. \u201cBut vitally, they also created confidence in social mobility, and real belief in education. That history comes with us.\u201d If, however, Finland has been rated the world\u2019s most literate country, it may also have something to do with a 19th-century decree that a couple could not marry in the Lutheran church before both passed a reading test. \u201cQuite an incentive,\u201d observes Halonen, \u201cto learn to read.\u201d Gender equality, similarly, was baked in. In 1906, Finnish women became, if not quite the first to win the vote, the first to run for electoral office. Nearly 10% of MPs in Finland\u2019s first parliament were women (the figure is now 42%); as early as 1930, up to 30% of university students were women. \u201cWomen in Finland took their rights seriously, and men accepted it,\u201d says Halonen. Other ingredients have since added to the sauce. Finland benefited enormously from wise wartime and postwar leaders, insists Holmstr\u00f6m: \u201cThey thought about the good of the country; took big, sensible decisions. And the consensus backed them, because everyone knew we were fighting for our existence.\u201d Responsible choices were made, invariably by continuity-conscious coalition governments, on big industrial and infrastructure investments, that have paid dividends many times over. More recently, today\u2019s high-tech, startup-friendly Finland was born of record investment in research and development in the 1990s, nearing 4% of GDP. Steady growth \u2013 through war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and a deep recession in the 1990s, Finland\u2019s economy has expanded over the past century at a rate equalled only by Japan\u2019s \u2013 has bolstered trust in the nation\u2019s institutions. \u201cPeople criticise the government constantly, and often for very good reason,\u201d says K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen. \u201cBut fundamentally, they do trust it.\u201d As they do, on the whole, their welfare state \u2013 on which Finland spends 31% of its GDP, the second highest proportion in the OECD. (\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a welfare state,\u201d says Halonen, \u201cthe only real way to it is so well that there\u2019s no point having a private alternative.\u201d) But Finns also trust each other more than most, says Andr\u00e9 Chaker, a Canadian-born lawyer and public speaker who has lived in the country for 25 years. Corruption and organised crime are all but nonexistent. \u201cThat feeds into the business environment,\u201d he says. \u201cThings get done here faster, more reliably.\u201d And it is trust that breeds confidence, and a willingness to innovate: the World Economic Forum ranks Finland the most innovative country, per capita, in the world. For years dominated by monolithic mining and forestry firms, then by the once-mighty Nokia, Finland today is close behind Silicon Valley in the number of startups per head. The magic sauce, then, seems based mainly on basic virtues: self-confidence, cooperation, equality, respect for education, trust. At bottom and in practice, says Anu Partanen, a Finnish journalist who now lives in New York, it boils down to a different quality of relationship. She calls it \u2013 since it is shared to a greater or lesser extent by Sweden, Norway and Denmark \u2013 the Nordic theory of love. \u201cIn the family, it\u2019s realising that relationships can only really flourish between individuals \u2013 parents, children, spouses \u2013 who are equal and independent,\u201d Partanen says. \u201cIn a society, it means policy choices aimed at ensuring the greatest possible degree of independence, freedom and opportunity for everyone.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world\u2019s biggest problems.
