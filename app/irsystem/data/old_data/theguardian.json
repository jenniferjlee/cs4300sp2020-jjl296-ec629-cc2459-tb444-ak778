    "transcript": "A scientist who adapted his veterinary lab to test for disease among humans rather than salmon is being celebrated for helping the Faroe Islands avoid coronavirus deaths, where a larger proportion of the population has been tested than anywhere in the world. The north Atlantic archipelago currently has only one person in hospital with Covid-19 and it is one of three European countries, along with Georgia and Liechtenstein to so far not have any deaths from the virus. On Wednesday, the country’s prime minister, Bárður á Steig Nielsen, announced that as of 20 April the country’s kindergartens, nurseries and early years classes in primary schools would reopen. Pupils in the last year of secondary school will also return to class and sport will recommence without spectators. The success of the Faroese approach is said by local politicians to be largely a result of the foresight of the veterinary scientist Debes Christiansen, the head of department at the National Reference Laboratory for Fish and Animal Diseases in the capital, Tórshavn. Christiansen had warned the government of the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark as early as January of the need to prepare for the possible spread of the disease from China. His laboratory, which was primarily geared to test salmon for viral infection, was adapted and he purchased the extra ingredients required to test humans. There has been mass testing for virus among salmon farmed in Faroese waters since an outbreak of salmon anaemia virus in 2001 ravaged the species. Of the archipelago’s total export value, 90% is accounted for by fish and half of that is salmon. According to official records, 10% of the population of 61,000 people have now been tested for the coronavirus. Faroese doctors have been able to track and quarantine everyone who has had contact with the 184 people who had tested positive for the virus. Of those who have fallen ill, 131 have fully recovered. Christiansen told the Guardian that the switch to human testing had not involved “too much hocus pocus” and that his veterinarian laboratory had been able to source materials required for the tests from a wider range of suppliers than hospitals. He said: “It is very easy to adapt. The only thing I changed were some of the ingredients. In our normal work it is specific to fish virus and fish bacteria and in this case I just changed the three components specific to the coronavirus.” Christiansen said his facility could do up to 1,000 tests a day if required and the research assistants were available. He said the latest batch of test samples on Tuesday had been negative. He said: “It seems that there isn’t a high load of virus in the Faroese environment at the moment. Everyone is talking about those black figures [of patients now showing symptoms] but we have tested more than 10% of the population so I don’t think we have that have that many running around who are infected.” Kristina Háfoss, an opposition MP who was the country’s finance minister until 2019, praised Christiansen’s swift action and that of the government in setting up a drive-in testing facility at the main hospital in the capital and a quarantine at an airport hotel. She said: “If we had had to send the tests to Denmark for analysis it takes days and up to a week to get them back and it wouldn’t have been possible to control the disease the way we have done. “Tracking and tracing has been a very important part. It has been possible to trace all the people who have been tested positive and who they have been with. And they have been put in quarantine for two weeks.”",

    "transcript": "As NHS staff continue to work around the clock to tackle the coronavirus crisis, people across the country are paying tribute in increasingly creative ways. Meanwhile a 98-year-old has made an unexpected recovery and pupils at a special school came together in a virtual choir. Syrian film-maker becomes a hospital cleaner A Syrian film-maker in London, who signed up to become a hospital cleaner, made an emotional plea for people to embrace diversity as he praised NHS staff who come from all over the world. “The nurses and the ward hosts and the cleaners and the porters are the spine of the hospital,” said Hassan Akkad on Good Morning Britain, as he fought back tears. “And they are from everywhere, the Caribbean, Chad, the Philippines, Spain, Poland. “I hope if this teaches us one thing, it teaches us to be kinder to one another despite where we come from. I hope this changes us for the best.” Akkad, 23, arrived in the UK in late 2015, documenting his difficult journey for a BBC film that went on to win a Bafta. In a now viral tweet, Akkad said he was “honoured to join an army of cleaners disinfecting Covid wards [at] our local hospital after receiving training”. He added: “London has been my home since leaving Syria, and the least I can do is making sure my neighbours and the amazing NHS staff are safe and sound.” Country gets creative with NHS tributes People around the country are thinking of creative ways to pay tribute to hardworking NHS staff. A family in Chandler’s Ford near Southampton used Christmas lights to create a display showing their appreciation for the NHS. Gary Woodman and his family used white and blue lights to spell out NHS surrounded by a heart to show “a little bit of respect”. The family decided to go the extra mile after they realised a neighbour who lives opposite works for the ambulance service. Meanwhile, in Northumberland, a huge “NHS THANK YOU” message has been mowed on to the lawn outside Northumbria specialist emergency care hospital in Cramlington, while a farm in Barkisland, West Yorkshire, sprayed NHS on to a ewe and her newborn lambs instead of numbers. Haigh Farms sprayed the ewe and her newborn with the tag as the lamb was born on the evening of 2 April, the night of the second nationwide clap for carers to thank NHS staff. Pupils join together for virtual choir Elms Bank school in Bury, Greater Manchester, has created a virtual choir for pupils and staff to join together in their singing. The special educational needs school set up a #keepsinging challenge when pupils with health issues started self-isolating at home, and it has since evolved into a virtual choir. “Singing is just such a huge part of our community and we didn’t want to lose that,” said assistant headteacher Catherine Dent. “Our children love singing and it’s a good form of communication for them. We’ve got a third of our school in our school choir.” Dent recorded herself singing True Colours, with a colleague playing the musical accompaniment, before sending the video to parents to record their children singing along. They then put all the videos together to create the choir. “We were amazed by the number of videos … and not just our more able children, from our real low-ability children as well, so that was really nice,” said Dent. “It shows that everyone can achieve.” Many of the participants joined in with Signalong, an alternative type of signing. “It’s a massive part of our communication because obviously some students are non-verbal, so we encourage everyone to sign,” Dent said. “Singing and signing just goes together for us.” Woman, 98, makes makes coronavirus recovery Daphne Shah, 98, tested positive for Covid-19 at Dundee’s Ninewells hospital and spent five days there before making a full recovery and being discharged on Monday. “When she left in the ambulance, I honestly never thought I’d see her again,” her son, Wesley Shah, told the BBC. “They had never come across a person of nearly 99 who has recovered from the virus.” Wesley said his mother was relatively healthy before she contracted the virus, and he called medical assistance when she developed a cough and high temperature. After initially being prescribed antibiotics, she was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with coronavirus. “She didn’t even need to go on a ventilator and yet she was struggling for air when she left (home),” he said. “The NHS in Scotland have always been tops, but this time around they have just been unbelievable.” He is now looking forward to celebrating his mother’s 99th birthday in July, and hopes she will be able to receive her message from the Queen when she turns 100 next year. He added: “I thought it would be a shame if Covid took her life before then, because she was doing so well.” • Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

    "transcript": "Disasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible – extending workers’ rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US – have already happened. The word “crisis” means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word “emergency” comes from “emergence” or “emerge”, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word “catastrophe” comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning. We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now – especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties – is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible. A disaster (which originally meant “ill-starred”, or “under a bad star”) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of “we” might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are. As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you’re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you’re working all the time, especially when it appears you’re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world. * * * The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems – political, economic, social, ecological – in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what’s strong, what’s weak, what’s corrupt, what matters and what doesn’t. I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it’s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo – it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it’s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both. Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life – as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power – as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights – and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing). Disaster scholars use the term “elite panic” to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe “panic” and “looting” in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it’s wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it’s altruistic to gather supplies to share. Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a “shoot to kill” proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans’s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided. The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers’ levees had failed; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush’s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: “He represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn’t care less about people’s lives. They’re worried about maintaining their profitability.” (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.) The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed divine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: “please do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms &amp; your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.” The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: “The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.” (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.) Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status. The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them – this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one’s whims. “This denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,” wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times. Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US – a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions. * * * When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future. For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: “Let us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.” We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant. My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: “We are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.” When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables. Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff – medicine, medical equipment – made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all. “Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,” Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all – and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces. A dozen years ago I interviewed the Nicaraguan poet and Sandinista revolutionary Giocondo Belli for my book on disaster, A Paradise Built in Hell. What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua – that, despite the dictatorship’s crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution – was unforgettable. She said: “You had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: ‘So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.’ You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It’s a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.” I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good. * * * I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe’s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible – housing the homeless, for example – have come to pass in some places. Ireland nationalised its hospitals, something “we were told would never happen and could never happen,” an Irish journalist commented. Canada came up with four months of basic income for those who lost their jobs. Germany did more than that. Portugal decided to treat immigrants and asylum seekers as full citizens during the pandemic. In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is “following guidelines” on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost half a million Kroger grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general told Amazon to expand its paid sick leave. These specifics make clear how possible it is to change the financial arrangements of all our societies. But often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011’s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible. We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There’s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land. * * * There’s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it’s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells – for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It’s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid – full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change. But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one’s own interior life and the suffering around us – and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed – well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory. Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: “Provide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.” It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless. Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

    "transcript": "One of the dive instructors points out two blacktip reef sharks circling a docile green turtle busy grazing on algae. Stingrays of various sizes, colours and shapes pass beneath us. Suddenly, a pod of dolphins appears, swimming over the hard corals. The dive takes place on what appears to be healthy and pristine coral reef surrounding Lady Elliot Island, at the very southern end of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef off Queensland. There are no visible signs of the bleaching that has plagued other parts of the reef for some years, but the government agency responsible for the reef, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has confirmed that the natural landmark has suffered a third mass coral bleaching episode in five years, describing the damage as “very widespread”. Mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 hit vast areas of the reef. As the rate at which bleaching events hit the world’s biggest reef system increases, scientists, farmers and volunteers across Queensland are trying to do their bit to lessen the impact. Gary Spotswood is a third-generation farmer at Mt Alma Organics, an organic farm a couple of hours drive from Townsville, a city on the north-eastern coast of Queensland. Spotswood has installed pumps to accumulate the run-off on his 430 acres, which then filters through aquatic plants growing in the adjacent wetlands. The project is partly funded by a grant from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, which was awarded a controversial A$444m (£217m) from the Australian government to sponsor projects on the reef. “I try to keep as much water on the land as possible,” says Spotswood, who leads courses in land use for other farmers and graziers. “Changes take time. But in five years people have changed their habits in how they use the land,” he says. At Townsville’s tropical marine research centre, scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) are looking at how so-called super corals (corals that can resist increased water temperatures) could be used to save the reefs. About 25 strains of coral are being crossbred with the same or different species. The research is being carried out in the National Sea Simulator, the world’s most advanced research aquarium, and intends to show that young coral offspring – produced from mixing corals from various parts of the reef – can survive in warmer sea temperatures. “It’s like crossbreeding corn. We do the same thing with the corals, so they can withstand higher temperatures,” says Kate Quigley, a researcher on reef restoration at Aims. The method is called “assisted gene flow”, and although at an early stage, shows encouraging results in the sea simulator, as well as on the reef – where cross-fertilised corals have been transplanted. The hybrids have one parent from the northern parts and one parent from the central reefs, and the results show that corals with at least one parent from the more heat-resistant northern reefs survive when placed in cooler environments. The research has also confirmed that the offspring inherit heat tolerance from their northern parents, and these genes may ultimately be passed on to make reefs more heat resistant. Aims also conducts research on how to decrease the numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish (cots), which prey upon corals. There are currently more than five million cots on the reefs between Cairns and Cooktown, and the invasion spreads south as the heavily spined species (which normally range from 25–35cm across, and can have up to 23 arms) devours corals and leaves nothing but traces of fine calcium carbonate. Female cots can produce up to 50 million eggs a year and each one annually ingests 10 square metres of coral. Rising sea temperatures and increased availability of nutrients due to run-off from farming practices are said to be behind the rise in cot numbers. So far divers have culled about half a million by injecting the starfish with white vinegar. Scientists at Aims are attempting to wield another – more natural weapon – to combat the mass outbreak. They breed the rare giant triton, a large marine snail that feeds on cots. The scientists aim to reintroduce the snails on reefs – from where they have disappeared. The climate crisis and evidence of another mass bleaching, however, continue to overshadow any sign of progress. Quigley says hundreds of studies point in the same direction. “They are showing that climate change is the biggest threat against the reef,” she says. “We don’t know what the future reefs look like. But we need to mitigate the effects that climate change has on the corals.”",

So I will do you a deal: if you will consider putting something in the tipbox this week that roughly equates to what you feel this newsletter is worth, we will give you more Upside news than we’ve ever given you before. Here goes: • The people who recovered from Covid-19. Two-minute read. • Businesses move into ventilator overdrive. 90-second read. • The African migrants helping to feed Italy. Two-minute snack. • The great hope for our oceans. About 30 years. • How to be isolated: a guide to surviving lockdown, by the people who are good at being alone. Three-minute read. • How the crisis is reviving our utopian hopes of connection and community 90-second OpEd piece. • How to manage Covid-19 anxiety. Two minutes. • A new mini-series: hope in a time of crisis. Daily fix. And in non-coronavirus Upside news: • The best schools in Brazil Three-minute read. • How to stop flooding Three-minute read. • Our best long reads ever. An hour or two. • The antidote – most read non-Covid tales. Quick browse. • New blood test can detect 50 types of cancer. One-minute read. Finally, two of the funniest stories of the week. The first involves a man, some magnets and a pair of very sore nostrils. The second is pure internet gold. Lucky numbers Defence budgets are likely to be a secondary victim of the Covid-19 pandemic. Jane’s, a defence thinktank, reckons spending could be reduced by tens of billions of pounds around the world as a result of the virus. Andrew MacDonald, a Jane’s analyst said: “Defence spending plans in a series of the world’s largest defence markets are on course to be derailed in the near-term by the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.” What we liked This piece in the Conversation asked whether the virus might kill off the global wildlife trade. We were humbled by the sports stars who realised there is another kind of heroism, people like Jos Buttler, Marcus Rashford and the Barcelona football team. This piece in the Atlantic is beautiful: the chance to regain a less hurried life. We admired the Boston Globe’s new initiative to connect people in need with people who are able to help. And the LA Times piece on the festival hands now building Covid triage units. Given that we cannot travel at the moment and are restless for new vistas, we also liked this attempt to digitally recreate ruined castles of Europe by NeoMam Studios. And finally there were bouncy rubber pavements, which we thought might have been an early April fool, until it emerged that April Fool’s Day was largely cancelled this year. What we heard With so many of us restricted in our movements, the life-in-lockdown stories have been pouring in. Keep them coming. Lesley Freedman wrote in from lockdown in Sydney We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary last week in Sydney. It was a covid news-free day! My partner and I rediscovered our wedding photos and watched the video for the first time right through. In the evening we dressed up and connected with four of our special guests online. We wore silly hats, popped champagne on cue and offered each other olives and cheese. For the first time in days we were happy. Adam Mileusnic has also been indoors, but that hasn’t stopped him from doing miles on his bike I’m a British guy living in Madrid and have been quarantined in my flat for 15 days now. I livestreamed an eight-hour cycling challenge on my exercise bike for a group of 36 children’s charities affected by the Covid crisis (collectively called Family for Every Child) and raised over £1,000. I came up with the idea after being trapped for so long with only one way to keep moving! You too could emulate Adam’s heroics. Check out connectandride.org. Where was the Upside On balconies everywhere, which are finding a new purpose in life. These are extraordinary times, dear reader – let us know how it is for you. And if you are able, please support our journalism – Upside and Downside – with some pocket change. It’s very easy to do.",

    "transcript": "There is ponding on nearly every field in the valley where the rivers Severn and Vyrnwy meet on the English-Welsh border. Swollen rivers have been sluggishly sitting in the valley for months. Inhabitants’ attempts to protect their homes from flooding are part of a losing battle played out across the country. The UK’s flooding this year is a story of desperation – but also hope, says John Hughes, development manager at Shropshire Wildlife Trust, who works in the valley. Following widespread acceptance of the climate and ecological emergency, Hughes believes people are increasingly looking to nature for solutions. George Eustice, the environment secretary, has announced that £4bn will be spent on flood defences in the next five years and said a “big part of our focus is going to be nature-based solutions upstream”. Hughes says: “The media normally have a distinct agenda when it comes to floods which is: ‘how miserable have you been?’ This time around the interviews I heard were talking about natural solutions and I’d never heard that before. “I say thanks very much Extinction Rebellion and Greta [Thunberg] – you’ve done a great job. It’s the job we’ve been trying to do for 50 years. We need to take a holistic view – land can do many, many things.” Soils In the past, flood plains acted like sponges that soaked up water and stopped it flowing headlong into settlements downstream. Wetter habitats provided useful materials such as willow and reeds for baskets and thatched roofs. However, natural wet woodland, neutral grassland, fens and marshes were ironed out of the postwar landscape and now cover just 11% of English and Welsh flood plains. Intensive agriculture covers 70%. Crops such as maize, potatoes, asparagus and onions are harvested as late as October because of the milder UK climate. This means fields are often left bare over winter months after heavy machinery has compacted the soil. This leaves the land unable to soak up so much water. “When you drive heavy vehicles on soggy soil you make a mess,” says John Quinton, professor of soil science at Lancaster University. “You’ve then destroyed the soil structure, and because of that water can’t get into the soil very quickly. The water runs over the surface of the soil and picks up the soil and deposits it in rivers or elsewhere. If soils are in good condition, the water will go into the soil and you will have a lot of storage.” Scientists say creating grassland, giving land rest periods and avoiding the use of heavy machinery in flood-prone areas will reduce nutrient and sediment loss from fields. “Some groups of farmers are definitely moving in the right direction. When I started my career in the late 80s we weren’t talking about soil erosion or nutrient losses. Things are changing,” says Quinton. Experts are only beginning to understand the complexity of soil ecosystems. In the flood-hit village of Eaton Bishop in Herefordshire, farm conservation adviser Caroline Hanks compares two spadefuls of soil from the same field near her house – one from the middle of the field where intensively farmed maize was harvested in October, and the other from under tussocky grass by the hedge. The first sample is root-free and heavily compacted, meaning water cannot percolate more than eight inches below the surface. The second spadeful is crumbly, full of roots and moist throughout. The two samples look – and smell – different. “We’re trying to give people a visual way to assess their soil. It’s such a simple technique – you can tell so much from a spadeful of soil,” says Hanks, who specialises in advising farmers on creating flower-rich grassland. “Twenty years ago people expected us to focus on birds and hedgerows and field edges but these days getting a spade out and looking at soil is a core part of the visit.” According to Quinton’s Defra-funded research there is between three and 10 times more water run-off from compacted soils than healthy soils. “That rotten egg smell you get from compacted soils is certainly something that says to me that’s an unhealthy soil,” he says. “It shows that it’s compacted and its normal biology isn’t functioning very well. In the soil that’s aerated you’ve got fungi and bacteria which are active and sometimes after rain, you get that sweet smell of damp soil, and it’s actually a compound called geosmin.” Creating rough landscapes Many natural flood-management techniques involve reinstating features that were once common to fields such as ponds, hedges and leaky dams (either created by fallen trees or beavers). Creating buffer strips, wooded areas, drainage ditches and re-meandering rivers are all part of the toolkit. The overall effect is to give the landscape more structure and roughness to counterbalance the way industrialised farming has smoothed it out. The problem is that reducing food production is currently counterintuitive to most farmers’ business plan, says Dr Marc Stutter, a soil and water scientist at the James Hutton Institute. “The biggest thing we’re fighting against is that the farmers and their fathers and grandfathers have been very proud of the way they’ve brought the land into condition for crops and quite rightfully so. Their parents have spent a lot of effort draining the land and now there’s someone telling them they want pockets of it to be wet up again. “If we could reverse it and say they’re not just farmers of a crop but stewards of the land then we might be able to think of water quality and flood resistance as part of their overall job.” Natural flood management has other benefits – planting trees and hedges helps to create vital habitats for nature and locks away carbon. Creating buffer strips along streams and rivers helps filter out pollutants and improves water quality. However, nature-based solutions are no silver bullet, according to analysis by the University of Oxford which found they would be overwhelmed by the sort of floods seen in the UK this winter. Making the land more absorbent should be used alongside traditional “hard engineering” techniques such as flood walls, says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading. “Putting beavers in the River Thames is not going to keep people dry and a different solution is required. However, for some of the smaller communities you could implement woody debris dams and make sure the soil upstream is able to absorb the water. Not one size fits all. It must be an open discussion between farmers and Defra and the Environment Agency and scientists. It’s not an easy problem but I think we should be confident that we can solve it,” she says. Case studies In 2015 Glenridding, a village at the bottom of Helvellyn in the Lake District, was one of many communities trashed by Storm Desmond. Danny Teasdale, a mechanic from the village, decided to do something. “Flooding isn’t going to go away, we’ve got to start looking at things. There are extreme conservationists on one side and extreme farmers on the other and they keep clashing heads and nothing happens. I sit in the middle … I know the local farmers and they trust me,” he says. In the valley above the village, Teasdale created a wiggly upstream release channel that runs parallel to the river and fills up only when the river is full. He worked with the local farmer and the Environment Agency. The £6,000 project was funded by a local flood action group. Teasdale says: “We’ve just had really, really heavy rain with Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis – I think some of the heaviest since Storm Desmond – and it didn’t flood this time. So it’s looking like it’s been helping. It goes hand in hand with hard engineering in the village but if you can slow things down upstream you don’t need to build your walls so high.” Teasdale’s work was so successful he created a community interest group called Ullswater Catchment Management CIC in November 2018. He has since worked in a number of different catchments around Ullswater with the Woodland Trust, Natural England and the Environment Agency, including planting 2,000 trees in Grisedale valley at a cost of £8,000 and a project to re-wiggle the river in Matterdale that cost £14,000. “It’s peanuts compared to the money that goes into hard engineering,” explains Teasdale, who says £2m has already been spent on hard flood defences in Glenridding. Elsewhere in the Lake District, the RSPB led a similar river re-wiggling scheme in Swindale valley. The work cost £200,000 and involved letting the river meander back into its old course after being straightened by hill farmers looking to dry out land hundreds of years ago. The valley is a kilometre long and the river is now 180 metres longer. “It’s all about holding that water in the higher catchments for longer,” says Lee Schofield, a site manager at RSPB Haweswater. “Having a wiggly river means they move more slowly. We’re delaying flood peak – it’s a low-tech solution that delivers many other benefits and makes the landscape much more resilient.” Paul Quinn, a senior lecturer in catchment hydrology at Newcastle University, believes more drastic landscape measures, called catchment systems engineering (CSE), are needed to compensate for the fact that flood plains are already full of houses and roads. More than 40% of rivers have been deepened or modified so that they are no longer connected to their flood plains. “In a beautiful world that doesn’t exist, we could get our soil back into good condition and that would actually stop a lot of floods. But when the big floods come along – the kind that climate change is going to produce – soil management is not going to do it,” he says. “CSE is halfway between nature-based solutions and something that’s a bit like traditional flood management which is usually big dams, big ponds and big walls. We need to start spreading them out over the whole catchment system. It seems to me such a simple idea. It’s not rocket science, it’s about storing water – and large amounts of it – at every opportunity you can.” Quinn’s approach includes natural solutions as well as features such as the creation of large retention ponds and cascading channels. His team built 35 ponds and dams, and created 10 zones of oak, beech and willow plantations in the catchment attached to the village of Belford in Northumberland which has been badly affected by flooding. The scheme cost £200,000 and in the seven years since the work was completed the village has not flooded. “Every single catchment in the country will have to be done,” he says. What next? In terms of soils, Quinton believes people’s attitudes are already changing: “I sense a shift in the farming community with a much greater emphasis on soils and how to sustain them. I have no evidence for this, except talking to farmers and watching Twitter. I get the feeling that there is increasing recognition that protecting soils is vital for the sustainability of the farm business.” Farmers think of food production as their primary motivation because that is what they have been subsidised to do. Rather than trying to farm flood-prone areas of land that don’t yield much, farmers may be subsidised to manage them for nature. Many feel the government is making the right noises with policies laid out in the new Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) – which will be fully implemented by 2028. A Defra spokesperson told the Guardian that natural flood management would be an important part of protecting the nation from flooding. “ELMS will reward farmers for the public goods that they provide, including protecting communities from environmental hazards such as flooding. Natural England and the Environment Agency do vital work and we continue to work closely with both agencies to ensure they have the right resources to continue to do so.” Soil management has featured prominently in ELMS – with funding set to be available for measures such as no-till agriculture and maintaining water in peat soils – but conservationists are worried that the devil is in the detail. Teasdale says: “I’ve seen what the government has done to Environment Agency and Natural England and what they’ve done to their budget, and it’s criminal. They’ve slashed it. ELMS could potentially be good but it needs to be funded properly and that’s what I’m not sure about. I’d love to be wrong.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

    "transcript": "As the coronavirus crisis continues, people up and down the country – from local communities to 80s pop stars and even luxury hotels – are doing their bit to help those in need and inject some much-needed joy into life. Dancing in the street Residents on a street in Cheshire are doing something a little bit different for their daily exercise in lockdown – a socially distanced communal dance session. Fitness instructor Janet Woodcock, 54, came up with the idea after one of her neighbours said she was missing her exercise class. For eight days now the residents of Springbourne in Frodsham have stepped out of their front doors at 11am, keeping a safe distance from one another, to do 10 minutes of exercise led by Woodcock. “It’s really simple stuff, but it’s about people moving, seeing one another and just having fun really,” she said. “One woman told me it’s the highlight of her day. Some people are working from home, but a lot of retired people just tend to be reading and watching the news all day, and it can get really depressing. So it’s just nice to get people out in the fresh air.” Each session starts with the Neighbours theme tune, followed by other specially chosen songs like Dancing in the Street, Our House by Madness and Tom Jones’s It’s Not Unusual – a street favourite. “The way it’s brought us all together is just fabulous,” said Woodcock. “It feels really heartwarming to see how it’s helped people now, but hopefully we won’t forget this. “We’ve all promised a big street party when it’s over and I think everybody will feel like they know each other a bit better.” Singing at six Hundreds of people across the country have joined a singing movement set up by an NHS intensive care nurse to boost morale. Roxie Jackson set up Sing at Six last week to encourage her neighbours to sing some uplifting tunes after the 5pm news. “Everybody sits down at five to watch that update, and the mood gets a little bit upset and people get stressed out, and I thought, ‘I don’t want to send the kids to bed in that kind of atmosphere, I want to do something happy.’” In just a few days the Facebook group has skyrocketed to nearly 10,000 members, with people joining in by singing together in their gardens, by video call, or posting videos, with some even dressing up. Each day Jackson sets a theme and allows group members to vote for their favourite tune. Man! I Feel Like a Woman was chosen for the 90s night and Let it Go for the Disney theme. Somewhere Over the Rainbow was the choice for a night dedicated to the elderly, with a local care home posting a video of its residents joining in. Jackson said she had been overwhelmed by the numbers of people getting involved, particularly her mum, who dons elaborate fancy dress and likes to watch the videos during her breaks at work. “The mood in the hospital has been horrible for weeks on end and now it is scary, so when you come home, you need something nice to look forward to,” she said. “I think music is a big thing and it’s one of those things that people remember. If the kids can remember anything from this time, let’s try and make it something happy.” Meanwhile, a video of an elderly couple singing from their sofa during lockdown has gone viral on Facebook. Rex Taylor, 86, posted the video of him singing the wartime song We’ll Meet Again with his wife Selina, 83, who has Alzheimer’s. “When we are on lockdown, there is only one thing to do,” said Rex, who has become the sole carer for his wife while they are isolating. Rolling with Rick Rick Astley has announced that he will be playing a free concert for NHS and emergency workers at Manchester Arena in October. The singer, whose song Never Gonna Give You Up was a worldwide number one hit in 1987, revealed the plan on social media. In a video message he said: “It’s free to you guys because I just want to say a massive thank you and I don’t know how else to do it. You’re doing an amazing job, the whole country thanks you. “I’m going to work my butt off to give you a great night.” Frontline NHS staff, primary care workers, paramedics, firefighters and police are all eligible to apply for free tickets, which are available from 7pm on 2 April. Attendees must present a valid ID on the night. Meals on wheels A private bus company in Blackpool has transformed an idle school bus into a pop-up shop for NHS workers. Archway Travel has created the Heroes Hamper to sell essential food supplies outside Blackpool Victoria Hospital, where the staff face long queues and empty shelves when trying to buy food outside work. The shop has been going for nearly a week and sells hampers stocked with essentials including locally sourced fresh fruit and veg, fresh bread, milk and eggs, and toilet roll. “It is a bit demoralising that we need to do this when there are so many supermarkets out there,” said Sam Archer, who helps run the family business. “When [NHS staff] have been going, there’s nothing left, and they just want basic stuff.” Another company that has transformed itself to benefit NHS workers is the five-star Mayfair hotel Claridge’s, which has opened its doors to the dozens of medical staff unable to live at home during the coronavirus crisis. Up to 40 doctors, nurses and other key staff will move into the luxury hotel from Friday, staying in rooms that typically start at £650 a night. Paddy McKillen, co-owner of the Maybourne Group, which runs the 208-year-old hotel, said: “Just as it has in the past world wars, Claridge’s has a duty to step up and support the people of London. Teams from all our hotels have volunteered to help and support the dedicated NHS workers at this critical time. We are for ever in their debt.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/31/new-blood-test-can-detect-50-types-of-cancer",
    "date": "2020-03-30",
    "transcript": "A new blood test that can detect more than 50 types of cancer has been revealed by researchers in the latest study to offer hope for early detection. The test is based on DNA that is shed by tumours and found circulating in the blood. More specifically, it focuses on chemical changes to this DNA, known as methylation patterns. Researchers say the test can not only tell whether someone has cancer, but can also shed light on the type of cancer they have. Dr Geoffrey Oxnard of Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, part of Harvard Medical School, said the test was now being explored in clinical trials. “You need to use a test like this in an independent group at risk of cancer to actually show that you can find the cancers, and figure out what to do about it when you find them,” he said. Writing in the journal Annals of Oncology, the team reveal how the test was developed using a machine learning algorithm – a type of artificial intelligence. Such systems pick up on patterns within data and as a result learn to classify it. The team initially fed the system with data on methylation patterns in DNA from within blood samples taken from more than 2,800 patients, before further training it with data from 3,052 participants, 1,531 of whom had cancer and 1,521 of whom did not. Using this information, the system sorted the samples into groups based on the methylation patterns. The team then taught the system which groups reflected which type of cancer. “In pregnant women we look in their free-floating DNA for foetal abnormalities,” said Oxnard. “We know this [approach] exists, the question is how do you fine-tune and perfect the art of looking for cancer in this free-floating DNA? And that is what the machine learning did.” The team then tested the trained system on another set of samples from 1,264 individuals, about half of whom had cancer. The results reveal that less than 1% of those without cancer were wrongly identified by the system as having the disease. “It is really important you don’t tell non-cancer patients they have cancer,” said Oxnard. When it came to identifying people with cancers the team found that, across more than 50 different types of cancer, the system correctly detected that the disease was present 44% of the time – although the team stress that figure could differ if the test was used to screen a general population, rather than those known to have cancer. Detection was better the more advanced the disease was. Overall, cancer was correctly detected in 18% of those with stage I cancer, but in 93% of those with stage IV cancer. The team say the results are exciting as they offer the possibility of a new way to screen for cancers that are otherwise difficult to detect. For example, the system correctly identified 63% of those with stage I pancreatic cancer, rising to 100% in stage IV. The team further found that the system could shed light on the type of cancer. For 96% of samples deemed to show cancer, the test was able to offer a prediction for in which the tissue the cancer originated, with 93% of these predictions found to be correct. Dr David Crosby, head of early detection at Cancer Research UK, said that detecting cancers in their early stages is important as they are less aggressive and more treatable. Although this test was still at an early stage of development, the initial results were encouraging, he said. “And if the test can be fine-tuned to be more efficient at catching cancers in their earliest stages, it could become a tool for early detection.” But Crosby added there was work to do. “More research is needed to improve the test’s ability to catch early cancers and we still need to explore how it might work in a real cancer screening scenario,” he said.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-fears-rediscover-utopian-hopes-connected-world",
    "date": "2020-03-29",
    "transcript": "If this is the worst of times, it is also the best of times. In our anxiety we are drawing deep reserves of strength from others. In our isolation we are rediscovering community. In our confusion we are rethinking whom we trust. In our fragmentation we are rediscovering the value of institutions. To each their own narrative or metaphor. If this feels like the blitz spirit to you, all well and good. Others find it helps to imagine a world recast through virtual networks. But what it amounts to is this: there is such a thing as society and we are all interdependent. And if it sometimes takes a grave crisis to remind ourselves of these truths, then this moment may well be historic for the possibilities of hope as well as for all the tragedy and turmoil. Nearly 200 years ago, the French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about the power we have been re-experiencing over the past few weeks: “In democratic countries knowledge of how to combine is the mother of all other forms of knowledge; on its progress depends that of all the others.” At least three forms of combination have blossomed in the present crisis: the NHS, the BBC and the internet itself. It is difficult to see how the NHS will not emerge stronger from this pandemic, however traumatic and stressful the coming months will be. We get the service we pay for. It would take an unusually obtuse future government to be blind to the signals sent by three quarters of a million volunteers or the echoing applause of people across the nation in the past few days. The BBC is having its moment, too. Only a month ago it seemed on the ropes – the bizarre target of the obsessional figure who sits at the prime minister’s right hand. Dominic Cummings had long nursed a loathing for the corporation, with his thinktank willing its demise more than 15 years ago. The aim was to replace it with a “Fox News equivalent”, along with talk-radio shows and bloggers “to shift the centre of gravity”. Today such aspirations look like lunacy, as they did even then. Fox News has shown its true colours during the Covid-19 emergency, parroting the wildly erratic line from an increasingly dangerously deluded White House. Fox is these days less a news company than an oligarchically owned state broadcaster. The BBC, meanwhile, has been doing what it does best: providing reliable and trustworthy information to a huge audience – both broadcast and online, both young and old. On any surveys of trust it towers over other news organisations as well as other institutions in society. Again, it is difficult to imagine any sane administration wanting to diminish the national, international and local reach of the BBC for the foreseeable future – far less hand over our national spine of communication and conversation to the Murdoch family and a bunch of talk-radio hosts. Three and a half years ago we’d apparently had enough of experts. They seem to be back. More understandably, many were convinced the original dream of the world wide web was dead and buried. Maybe, today, not so much. In our self-isolation, many of us have rediscovered some of the things that inspired such cause for hope when the web first demonstrated the power of combination. How many of us have relied on it for friends, food, family, education, health, fitness, worship, ideas, culture, ideas and knowledge over the past week or more? Think of all the other utopian words that were associated with this new form of self-organisation barely a decade ago. Here are some: generosity, community, participation, sharing, openness, cooperation, sociability, learning, assembling, imagination, creativity, innovation, experimentation, fairness, equality, publicness, citizenship, mutuality, combinability, common resource, information, respect, discourse, conversation, contribution. All these things seemed within our grasp. And then a kind of darkness stole over that shared space and we gradually began to give up on what, we soon convinced ourselves, had only ever been a lovely dream. Well, maybe. And of course – unlike the NHS or the BBC – there is a genuine malign aspect to the way in which so many people have twisted the web’s capabilities into an engine of hatred, misinformation and bleakness. That will not wither away: there is a different kind of virality in play there. But, in the end, the internet simply amplifies who we are. As the New York academic Clay Shirky wrote in his 2010 book, Cognitive Surplus: “Human character is the essential component of our sociable and generous behaviours, even when coordinated with high-tech tools. Interpretations of those behaviours that focus on the technology miss the point: technology enables those behaviours, but it doesn’t cause them.” Surveys of trust since Covid-19 began to bite show people re-evaluating whom to believe. They, overwhelmingly, trust the NHS and – still – the BBC. They absolutely trust experts. They rely on mainstream news organisations while proclaiming low levels of trust in journalists as a category. They are inclined to trust their own employer – but not as much as they trust “a person like yourself”. In Shirky’s 10-year-old analysis, trust in the world today is dependent on perceptions of motive. Why is this person telling me this? Is it for money, power or some kind of personal or political advantage? Or is it out of genuine disinterest? A respect for evidence? A feeling, in Shirky’s words, that “by treating one another well (fairly, if not always nicely) we can create environments where the group can do more than the individuals could on their own”. There will be much stress and sorrow in the months ahead. But a kind of better future feels quite tangible. Love, humanity and combination may yet win. • Alan Rusbridger chairs the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism and is a senior adviser to WATATAWA communications consultancy",

But it’s only a possibility … What we liked Our friends at the Solutions Journalism Network are doing a great job aggregating Covid-19 pieces here. Have a browse. We also salute the Atlantic’s attempt to map out what the next few months might bring, and how quickly life might return to normal. What we heard Laura Hendrie wrote in from Santa Fe, US: We are holding silent Quaker worship … by Zoom! Because the majority of us are older and quite a few of us have compromised health issues, we decided the only way to meet was by internet. And better yet, it felt wonderful to see each other again and to be able to all be together for silent worship was very empowering! Roisin McGuinness, a primary school teacher, got in touch from Ireland: Thank you for your column, especially in times like these. I loved reading what others are up to during their isolation. I am treating this time at home as a chance to do all the things I complain I don’t have the time to do. Morning to lunchtime is tidying, a little exercise, a bit of work. Lunch is a short walk, and watching something I never get round to watching on telly. One episode only. The afternoon is for hobbies. I have written a list and hung it on the wall to remind myself of all the choices I have. Eg, sitting down to regular practice sessions with my piano and ukelele, sorting photographs, making a scrapbook with the boxes of tickets and postcards I’ve been collecting and hoarding. Getting the sewing machine out, with YouTube videos to hand, and mending or altering clothes. Listening to podcasts while also doing some mindfulness colouring, or Zentangle that I have newly discovered. Evening is cooking and TV with my husband like any regular evening, but maybe now we’ll play some card games to shake it up. Making sure I get up early and go to bed at a reasonable time like I would for work is really important, I am trying really hard not to fall into the bad habits of late sleeping and hours of TV like I’ve done in the past during periods of unemployment. Finding happiness in the benefits that this time at home is offering as well. Myself and my husband are very much enjoying not commuting, and I hope all your commuting readers are too. This sounds great, Roisin. I would stress regular sleep and wake times, routine and trying stuff you’ve not done before will all be important for us to get through these difficult days. In Toronto, 72-year-old brooke Lydbrooke is doing OK. I just got back from Guatemala by the skin of my teeth, before they closed their airports, so I’ve been doing my 14 days. Fortunately, as long as I have books, the Guardian Weekly, and musical instruments ( I sing, play piano and ukulele) and can connect with friends online, I’m OK. I work out every morning and do Spanish lessons on Duolingo. I practise my ukulele ( I’ve been learning blues songs), cook meals, hangout and chat with my housemates and FaceTime with my partner several times a day. I have been out for a walk (keeping my distance) and as the weather warms up I’ll do this more. Thank you Guardian for being a lifeline in this crazy world. When I read the Guardian Weekly I feel comforted by your analysis, your ethics, your compassion, your depth of reporting. In this insane world it’s an oasis of truth. Thanks brooke. Yes, Guardian Weekly is a fine thing, perfect for people who want quality once a week rather than breathless updates every minute. Sign up here for a great introductory offer. From Berlin, Rachael Dölger tells us we really have no excuse now: I would like to start a hashtag #there is no excuse now ... but my kids have reassured me that if I have no followers my hashtag wont go far. Perhaps you could help! Bleib gesund and stay healthy. Dear Rachael – I could indeed do this. There really is no excuse now not to. And finally in Mexico, Jeffrey Stewart Titcomb was pithy: With several other pieces in today’s edition, you’ve helped me feel up about feeling up and down. Thanks Jeffrey. Next week we’ll explore how we should think and feel about this crisis. Where was the Upside? With our pets, keeping us sane through the crisis. Also, with NewsWise, a news literacy project set up by the Guardian Foundation, National Literacy Trust and PSHE Association. They have created a set of activities, links, tips and advice to help families learn more about the news together. Normally they would be delivering workshops in schools around the country but instead are helping parents recreate some of that learning at home. That’s it for another week.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/astonishing-170000-people-sign-up-to-be-nhs-volunteers-in-15-hours-coronavirus",
    "date": "2020-03-25",
    "transcript": "More than 500,000 volunteers have signed up to support the NHS in helping vulnerable people who have been told not to leave their homes during the coronavirus crisis. Nearly five people per second enlisted in the government’s new volunteering scheme in the hours after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, launched a call on Tuesday for 250,000 people in England to help bolster the NHS response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Overnight the number of volunteers who had pledged support topped 170,000, and as the day went on the target was smashed. “That is already, in one day, as many people as the population of Coventry,” said Boris Johnson in the daily Downing Street press conference. The figure now stands at 504,303. The overwhelming response has prompted the NHS to extend its target to recruit 750,000 volunteers in total. Those volunteers who have already signed up will start next week. As the coronavirus death toll in the UK rose to 422 people as of 10.10am on Wednesday, the government called on fit and healthy adults to deliver vital supplies such as food and medicines to up to 1.5 million vulnerable people, drive them home after being discharged from hospital and make regular phone calls to those in self-isolation. Nearly 12,000 recently retired NHS staff came forward to rejoin the frontline following a separate call for help. The government has announced plans to set up a makeshift hospital with capacity for 4,000 beds at the ExCeL centre in east London. Announcing on Wednesday morning that the government’s volunteering scheme was two-thirds of the way to reaching its target just 15 hours after it was set in motion, NHS England’s national medical director, Stephen Powis, said he was “bowled over” by the “astonishing” response. “Yesterday we sent out a call to arms for an army of NHS volunteers, looking for a quarter of a million volunteers, and I can say that overnight we’ve already had 170,000 people sign up ... It’s an absolutely astonishing response,” he told BBC Breakfast. Asked if he had expected such support, he replied: “I think at times of crisis, people come together. And the vast majority of people in this country are doing what the government has asked us all to do. But it’s important that everyone does that as that will save lives. “I know there’s vast numbers of people looking to help neighbours, vulnerable people who live close by, so no it doesn’t surprise me at all. In times like this, as the chief medical officer has already said, we see outbreaks of altruism, people wanting to help, so it’s a wonderful response in the same way that all those doctors coming back, nurses coming back. I’m bowled over by it.” People can join the scheme in four different roles, including as a community response volunteer, which involves “collecting shopping, medication or other essential supplies for someone who is self-isolating, and delivering these supplies to their home”. Patient transport volunteers will support the NHS by driving discharged patients to their homes, and NHS transport volunteers will move equipment, supplies or medication between sites. Other volunteers will provide support calls to elderly people who are in isolation and at risk of loneliness. Volunteers, who must be over 18, fit and healthy and able to pass an enhanced DBS check, will be directed to tasks via a responder app that they can switch to say they are “on duty” when available. Robert Jenrick, the housing and communities secretary, told BBC Breakfast: “I know there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people out there who would like to support us during this time and support the NHS. “There will be lots of different opportunities available from helping deliver medicines and food to the elderly and vulnerable who we’re asking to stay at home, being volunteer drivers to get supplies to the frontline or to take people into hospital, or working in hospitals obviously in non-clinical roles.” Asked if the scheme went against advice to stay at home and how the government would keep volunteers safe, Jenrick said: “The government’s guidance is to stay at home unless you’ve got a reason to be going out. If you’re doing something absolutely essential for fighting the virus, like volunteering in this very organised way, then obviously that’s different. But we want to keep those individuals safe, they’ll receive the training, the support and the equipment that they’ll need to carry out those roles.”",

    "transcript": "As you approach the city of Sobral in north-east Brazil, the road worsens. Huge pot holes slow traffic to a crawl. The heat is suffocating, even worse when there is no cloud cover. Sobral is poor. Jobs are scarce, salaries meagre, gangs the only option for many. For children, it’s a tough start to life. Ana Farias, headteacher of an early-years school in a low-income neighbourhood controlled by a gang, knows this only too well. Some of her students wouldn’t eat if it were not for free school meals. Farias and her colleagues often hear stories of home life; some children have to accompany their mothers who sell sex at night. “It’s a challenge but it motivates me to be here every day. We want to make a difference in their lives,” she says. This is one of the last places anyone would expect would be a paragon of educational excellence. Yet, Sobral has gone through an extraordinary metamorphosis and is now the best place in Brazil to get a state education. The city comes top of 5,000 districts in Brazil’s education development index. Fifteen years ago, it was ranked 1,366th. Since 2015, literacy rates have risen from 52% to 92%, and the number of families living in extreme poverty has declined by 89%. This is a stunning turnaround in a country beset by income inequality and poor literacy rates: half of state-educated students are still illiterate by the third grade. So what has been Sobral’s secret to success? The mayor, Ivo Gomes, says: “We have reached this position because this is a 23-year-old project that has surpassed changes in mayors and secretaries of education. People think it’s magic and it’s not. It is persistence and a lot of hard work.” In 1997, the movement to improve education in Sobral began with renovating school buildings and furnishing them with computers and other resources. Public spending on education was boosted. In the past, politicians had commonly rewarded allies by handing out government jobs, including headteacher posts to people who could barely read or write. This practice was stamped out. There was a crackdown on truancy; today families are called if their children don’t turn up to school. Newly qualified teachers now undergo a preparatory internship and all teachers, regardless of experience, receive on-the-job training for a day each month. Every term there is a bonus system for teachers whose students perform well in assessments. Student welfare is a high priority; pupils receive two free school meals a day and there are plans to hire a mental health professional in each school. All this has led in part to the success of former students such as Chelton Santos, 22, and his sister Maria, 20. The siblings live with their parents and grandmother in a poor and dangerous area. The family have survived on one minimum wage (now $258 a month) for many years. “I grew up seeing gang fights,” said Chelton Santos. “I had to face poverty and violence. My parents took good care of us but we had financial difficulties, and had to take out loans.” Despite a difficult upbringing for the pair, the future is looking bright: Santos is studying law at university and his sister is working as an office clerk to save money to study medicine. They are determined to succeed. Maria says: “My dream is to be a doctor. I’m going to get there. I’ve seen my mother suffer with health problems since I was a child and now I want to help the poorest in society.” Their mother, Eliane, is hopeful about her children’s future: “I never believed that one day my son would be studying to be a lawyer at university. We did everything we could to keep [the children] in school. I wanted to give them a nicer place to live … it’s dangerous here. God willing, they’re going to move from here to a better life.” Sobral’s success is now being replicated across the country. Clodoveu Arruda, a former mayor of the city, who oversaw a large part of the transformation in the education department, has teamed up with the Lemann Foundation to spread best practice. So far they have worked in 25 municipalities across five states. Not everyone in Sobral is content with what has been achieved, however – they are hungry for further success. The mayor, Gomes, says: “Being the top in Brazil doesn’t mean much if you look at the rest of the world. Brazil is not very well positioned in the [international educational] Pisa rankings … This is what we are running after now.” The Lemann Foundation and Republica.org assisted with travel for the Guardian This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2020-03-25",
    "transcript": "Picture the scene: the curtain rises as the orchestra strikes up the opening bars of Puccini’s La Bohème or Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin. And in the 850-person auditorium of a storied Russian theatre sits just one lucky viewer, a lottery winner whose prize is the personal performance of a lifetime. Barred from hosting audiences due to the coronavirus outbreak, a theatre in Perm, a city near Russia’s Ural mountains, plans to host a unique experiment – private viewings of the theatre’s ballets and operas for the price of just a normal ticket. The project, called One on One, is the creation of Marat Gatsalov, the principle stage director of the Perm Opera and Ballet theatre. The idea, he said, predated the coronavirus pandemic that has shut theatres, museums and other cultural institutions around the world as audiences practise physical distancing and hunker down in their homes. But when the local government in Perm, an industrial city that also has a reputation as a cultural powerhouse, declared that events with large audiences should be cancelled, he realised the time for the experiment had arrived. “We’d been told that we can’t let viewers into the theatre hall,” Gatsalov said. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t let just one viewer in.” The plan for private performances has captured national media attention and personal support from local cultural officials, Gatsalov said, as a novel way to keep the theatre performing before live audiences. “I thought about how I often sit alone in the theatre and watch a play,” said Gatsalov. “I understand that it’s a fairly special feeling … it’s a really important experience for the viewer and the people on the stage.” Russia’s coronavirus outbreak has accelerated in the last week and the government has passed tougher measures to prevent its spread. One on One had been scheduled to open with Puccini at the end of March, but the theatre has said that it will begin holding shows only when the rules for the country’s theatres are clearer. “We’re going to do this project regardless of what ends up happening with coronavirus,” said Gatsalov. “Even when this story with coronavirus ends, we’re planning to perform [these shows].” The lottery will work like this: 850 people will register for each show, whether it’s an opera, ballet or concert, and a winner will be selected and invited to buy a ticket at the theatre for the normal price. Nobody else will be charged, although the theatre could use the funds. Financially, Gatsalov said, the coronavirus crisis has been “catastrophic”. Asked about how planned to keep performers safe, Gatsalov said he was trying to follow safety rules “as much as possible” and said the theatre regularly checked people’s temperatures and disinfected the premises. But it was clear that plans were in flux. “Of course the theatre can’t be operating as normal at the moment,” he said.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/20/nature-is-taking-back-venice-wildlife-returns-to-tourist-free-city",
    "date": "2020-03-20",
    "transcript": "Look down into the waters of the Venice canals today and there is a surprising sight – not just a clear view of the sandy bed, but shoals of tiny fish, scuttling crabs and multicoloured plant-life. “The water is blue and clear,” said Gloria Beggiato, who owns the celebrated Metropole Hotel a few steps from St Mark’s square and has a view over the Venice lagoon. “It is calm like a pond, because there are no more waves caused by motorised boats transporting day-tripper tourists. And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.” Under Venice’s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus – all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden – the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight. La Serenissima’s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored. The clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Cormorants have returned to dive for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. “Someone has put up a sign saying, ‘Don’t tread on the duck eggs,’’” Beggiato said. “All totally unimaginable a while ago.” As the death toll from coronavirus in Italy outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls. But locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping – except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw protests against overtourism under the No Grande Navi (“No more cruise ships”) slogan. At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance. In a queue to buy fish at his local fishmonger in Canareggio, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.” “For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.” The apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor. Matteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time. “For goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,” he said. “If there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.” It is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed. It is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way. “We Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,” said Beggiato. “If you ask me today – sunny blue skies, clear canals – then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with. “I honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.” This article was amended on 20 March 2020 because an earlier version contained a tweet which was subsequently found to contain incorrect claims. The tweet has been removed.",

    "transcript": "We asked Guardian readers and supporters what they are doing to cope with the long hours and days of isolation that stretch ahead. Some surprisingly upbeat responses came flooding in … David Poole As a sport-mad family of four (two boys), the enforced limbo of Covid-19 has left us drawing lots to avoid arguments over what film or boxset to watch … but no sport. It’s tough. So to keep teen and parental anxiety at bay, we are planning a home sporting fixtures list of our own. Two-on-two basketball, football, cricket (when the grass dries out), table tennis – it’s all happening. Team selection will be critical. Thank you to you and your team for your continued excellence in providing a daily window on the world. Rachel Chapman It’s my brother’s 50th next week and I was supposed to be hosting the entire family to celebrate it, the weekend of 4 April, including my 91-year-old dad and 80-year-old mum. They were going to get the train from Kendal to Milton Keynes to join us. That’s clearly not happening. But I have a plan. A virtual dinner between three households. We pick our video conference provider of choice, set up a VC, coordinate dinner start times, and see whether we can have a 50th birthday celebration dinner virtually across three households. Will it work? I really hope so, I can let you know if you like. Ruth Coomber I’m in social isolation as an asthmatic, so I’m still enjoying walks over the fields with our little dog and very tall son, I’ve very nearly finished my complicated knitted poncho and I’ve joined Libby, a great little app that Suffolk libraries use to give you access to the e-library. Luckily, I do usually work from home, but last week I attended my first meeting by Skype. The old hands knew to sit there motionless while I wriggled around. Who hasn’t felt a prickle of anxiety looking at the empty shelves of supermarkets? We are well stocked, luckily, and got online orders booked. Fingers crossed things will settle down soon. Stella We will trial the after-work ‘video wine’ this Thursday. A colleague suggested it and I thought it’s a great idea. Bookshelves, photographs and all in the back, us passing around the thoughts on how the first week of real corona-craziness in Germany went, more or less confined to all our homes. It might be an idea to copy for other teams all spread out to isolated kitchens and living rooms across these cities. Christine Mallaband-Brown Can I recommend joining an urban sketchers’ group and following one of the ‘drawing indoors’ challenges that are being set up? The first I knew about it was a Facebook post from Urban Sketchers in London. They had decided to do a 30-day challenge while they spend enforced time at home. After all, you only need a pen or pencil and some paper. My branch of Urban Sketchers in Stoke-on-Trent are thinking of doing the same. Peter Kent My hobby is wildlife photography, particularly insects. It never ceases to amaze me how many different insect species you can see in even a small garden if you have suitable plants and flowers. Sometimes you see dramas playing out as predator insects move to attack their prey. I have my own safari park, but instead of seeking the big five, it’s more a case of the little five. Last year’s photos started on 29 March, when in little over an hour I managed to photograph nine different species in my small garden. Ideally, you want an SLR and a macro lens, but you can get started with much simpler equipment. So on any sunny day from March to October I can keep myself entertained with a garden chair, a book, a camera and a refreshing drink. I usually try to identify any unusual-looking insect and then try to read about its life cycle, some of which are truly bizarre. Tricia Henton I’ve already received or have instigated communication with a number of friends with whom the odd call or email a couple of times a year was the norm. We’ve agreed to keep in touch a bit more closely over the next few weeks. Best of all, I got a letter today from a friend, a former work colleague, with whom I normally exchange an annual one at Christmas. He writes beautiful letters about where and what he and his wife have been doing, his reflections on events and other thoughts. They are a joy to read, and I reciprocate. Good old-fashioned paper-based letter writing will occupy time, bring joy to the recipient, and provide solace to the lonely. That’s my small suggestion for helping us all maintain our sanity! Keep up the good work. Elizabeth Copp A few evenings ago I sat in front of the TV with a tray, newspaper and scissors and made paper pots. The next day, I sowed broad beans in my greenhouse, putting one bean in each pot, but you can sow them sitting at your kitchen table as well, using the rest of the newspaper to keep the table clean. When the beans have germinated, you plant them – pot and all, for the roots grow through the newspaper – in your allotment, raised bed or garden, and when the supermarkets run out of veg you have your own supply. This method works well with peas and beetroot too. Sowing seed is mindful, as is gardening in general, and it’s absolutely the way to go in these rather concerning times. Today I sowed peas. Ninian Millar I have just spent a really interesting day sorting through papers going back some 60 years to my graduation certificates from university in the UK and covering my entire professional career until I retired in 2005. I have only actually worked in the UK for three years, and one delightful document I found was from the British pensions service seriously offering me a pension of 32p a week! Sibylle Zipperer As a teacher (and technophobe), I have had to move to remote teaching this week and decided to spice up things for my pupils (10-11 and 12-13 years old) by “reporting” via photos the adventures of Kevi the kiwi and having my friends from around the world record some lines in their respective regional dialects. Things like this could easily be adapted for adults by sending around a story to which everyone would add a sentence or two. A bit of silliness is rather important in this situation, which is why I am sending you a picture of Kevi. Hugh Busher I’m building a WhatsApp group with some friends as we can no longer meet for our weekly French conversation group. Now we can stay in touch online and still have French-language conversations. We are members of the local U3A group. My wife is doing something similar with her art group. Rachel Preston If the schools close, my plans are to go hiking with my children and meet friends and have picnics (at a distance, obvs). Get the children growing as much fruit and veg in our little garden as possible. Lots of board games, reading and seeing what we can make, using things we have lying around. Cooking and lots of rousing, feelgood movies. Richard Harman As a lifelong Guardian reader and German-speaking Englishman resident in Alto Adige/Südtirol for the last 16 years, I just wanted to say, “Thank you, you’re doing a fantastic job” and encourage you to keep on rising to the challenge; this reader greatly appreciates your efforts. I have sent this article to a very good friend in Wales who is trying to persuade acquaintances with respiratory conditions to take the coronavirus seriously and stay at home – I am sure it will help her to bring it home to them.

    "transcript": "The coronavirus crisis is giving the planet opportunities for positive change that it cannot afford to waste, according to experts involved in the eighth annual World Happiness Report, out today. The report, which ranks countries according to happiness, will throw up crucial clues to wellbeing that will help in the weeks and months of the coronavirus crisis to come, says Prof Richard Layard, co-director of the Wellbeing programme at the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance. Finland remains at number one for the third year running, while the UK has edged up the table, rising from 15th place to 13th. The report – compiled by a group of independent experts and produced by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network – uses six variables to measure the quality of life in more than 150 countries across the globe: GDP per capita; social support; healthy life expectancy; freedom; generosity and absence of corruption. Research has long shown that co-operation and social support are fundamental to happiness; Layard believes the coronavirus crisis will speed up changes that he and others have advocated for decades. “To get through this we’re going to have to develop a much higher level of social responsibility. Some people are going to have to stay in quarantine, and others are going to have to support them to do that. My hope is that it will encourage a move from an atomised society to a much more caring one.” Vanessa King, lead psychologist for Action for Happiness which is the UK partner organisation to the World Happiness Report, said: “What we know is that social factors and trust are at least as important as income and being healthy – and also they’re particularly buffering to the psychological welfare of those who are hardest hit. In this crisis, the more we can create social trust and support and connect with others, despite being isolated, the better we will be – and the rosier a future we’ll build.” So looking out for others is key, not only to their welfare but also to our own, said King. “You might think you’re doing it for others but you’re also doing it for yourself: it’s win-win.” Setting up a neighbourhood WhatsApp group to ensure isolated people get help with the shopping, looking out for others and being outward-facing were some of the most psychologically healthy ways forward. Coronavirus, according to King, brings home something essential that has never before been quite this tangible: that there is no “us” and “them” in the world, but only “us”. “This is a worldwide epidemic; it’s not us against them, it’s all of us against this virus. It’s a moment when we have to say: ‘we, as a world, are fighting this’.” Powerlessness doesn’t make people happy, but taking control – even in chaotic circumstances like a pandemic – goes a long way to help us cope. “People are finding it hard to focus and that’s entirely understandable. What I’d suggest is that you try to be really clear about your intentions. Don’t get sucked into a continual stream of news: decide at what points in the day you’re going to update yourself. Think about who you need to in touch with, who you need to support – both in your immediate family, and the community around you.” Active coping is vital. “Trying to do something rather than doing nothing is extremely important for resilience. This is a real opportunity, and we need to recognise it as such. And don’t forget that coronavirus isn’t the only thing that’s contagious: happiness is contagious too, as well as fear. If you go outside, smile at people. Be really friendly. It can and will make a huge difference.”",

    "transcript": "There is light drizzle as Vijay Aggarwal and Ajay Mittal manoeuvre their two-wheelers through the labyrinthine alleyways of Kolkata’s Tiljala road slum. Early Sunday morning, the neighbourhood is teeming with activity – women sit on their haunches washing clothes and utensils; half-soaped children scurry in and out of their baths; towel-clad men wait to brush their teeth. Every 50 metres a community pipe gushes out water – plastic bottles, jerry cans and metal buckets are lined up to fill. The duo along with their plumber, Ravi Shaw, who rides pillion, make their way to the first huddle of people and get to work. All it takes is a blow and twist of a wrench – the nozzle pops loose. Shaw fishes out an orange and white tap from his bag and fits it. While Aggarwal hurriedly plasters a Save Water Save Life sticker on to a lamppost, Mittal tells the people to close the tap once they are done and points out the helpline number on the sticker. As the three gather their tools, Aggarwal says: “It literally took two minutes to install a tap on this pipe – in return we have just saved the city gallons of water.” It was a casual moment that spurred Aggarwal into action. “In July last year, I was dropping my son off to school when at a traffic signal, I watched water gush out of a tap-less roadside pipe,” says Aggarwal, who runs a travel and tourism agency. Irked by what he saw, Aggarwal, 40, returned with his friend Mittal, 29. They bought taps at the local hardware store, hired a plumber and fixed 12 pipes on the street. The Fix for Life campaign to conserve water in Kolkata was born. In a country where safe drinking water is a development goal, Kolkata relies on its treatment plants to meet 95% of its needs. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) produces 450m gallons of filtered water every day at its three main treatment plants. Apart from domestic and commercial complexes, KMC also provides potable water to the streets and slums for a few hours every day through an estimated 17,000 roadside pipes. For the 5 million people who reside in the city and 6 million who commute daily from the suburbs for work, this freely available safe drinking water is a life force. However, a recent KMC survey conducted in six of its 144 wards estimates that 30% of the water simply runs down the drain. The survey found about 10% of the wastage was due to these roadside pipes that do not have taps. “We had installed taps earlier but they are regularly stolen or broken,” says Mainak Mukherjee, the director general of KMC’s water supply department. “A large part of our budget is dedicated to providing clean drinking water. Kolkata is also one of the few cities in India where water is tax-free.” But without taps most of these efforts go to waste. Since July, every weekend members of Aggarwal’s civic society group, Active Citizens Together for Sustainability (ACTS), conduct “water drives” to fix taps. “In these last eight months we have conducted over 70 drives in several pockets of the city,” says Mittal. “On our most productive day we fix about 30 to 35 taps.” The target is to have fixed 1,500 by Sunday, which is World Water Day. But finding these pipes is a challenge. “There is no official data on the exact location of these pipes. This costs us precious time,” says Mittal. Here, other concerned citizens, community clubs and even police stations have reached out over social media to help accelerate their efforts. “People send us photos of pipes in their neighbourhood and we plan our drives along that route,” says Aggarwal, showing a WhatsApp text on his smartphone with photos of open pipes. “We will fix these this weekend. Our helpline is flooded with such messages.” ACTS has been helped by citizens such as Ashfaq Alam, a shopkeeper in the Tiljala slum, who earlier used his own money to install taps on the pipe that is being fixed. “It did get stolen but we installed it again. Sometimes you have to take matters in your own hands,” he says. A few years ago, the Lutheran World Service India Trust also ran a similar campaign in Kolkata to tap the pipes in surrounding streets. Some are unimpressed by the efforts. “Don’t bother,” says Bindu Das as the team fixes the pipe on his street. “The children in the neighbourhood will break it in a few days.” The solution to this is to use plastic taps. Mittal says: They last but they don’t have much resale value. We also go back and replace stolen or leaking taps if you reach out on our helpline.” Mukherjee concedes that this colossal wastage is mainly due to a lack of civic awareness. As Mittal points out, citizen-led initiatives can only complement the government. “There are just a few of us and it takes a lot of time to bring up our tally count. If only the government could do this in all the wards in the city, we could solve this problem in a week.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "What is it about animals? As the bad news about the coronavirus continues, “send me dogs and cats” has become a regular cry on social media, an easy-to-grasp shorthand for “I feel terrible, cheer me up”. The response is always the same: a torrent of pictures of animals doing daft things – but somehow it has a magical, calming effect. The therapeutic value of our relationship with our pets, particularly dogs, is increasingly recognised by researchers. Cats can be wonderful too – but dogs have been domesticated by humans for much longer, and, as even the most devoted cat lover will admit, dogs are far easier to train for companionship. Most cats, as we know, are admirable for entirely different reasons. Marion Janner, a mental health campaigner and all-round animal lover, says that dogs teach us a whole range of lessons. “Dogs love us unconditionally. They’re the ultimate in equal opportunities – entirely indifferent to race, gender, star sign, CV, clothes size or ability to throw cool moves on the dance floor. The simplicity and depth of this love is a continuous joy, along with the health benefits of daily walks and the social delights of chats with other dog walkers. They teach kids to be responsible, altruistic and compassionate and, valuably but sadly, how to cope when someone you love dies.” Robert Doward* felt this odd effect when his health suddenly took a downward turn. “I’d been working incredibly hard, long hours, too many days. One day I started crying and just couldn’t stop. I couldn’t put sentences together properly. I’d been pushing everything so hard for so long, and I just couldn’t do it any more.” It took a long time to put himself back together: plus some therapy, another job and changes to his family life. But the key factor, he says only half-jokingly, was a small Greek rescue dog called Maria. “Taking her out for walks, getting out into fresh air, just putting one foot in front of the other, that lifts your spirits. And then there’s nothing like having a dog curled up beside you, even when you feel absolutely miserable. She’ll check my face anxiously, as if she knows something is wrong. And that makes me smile – and that somehow makes you feel better. There is just something magic about dogs. Honestly, she got me through.” But why? What is responsible for these therapeutic effects? One key aspect appears to be social recognition – the process of identifying another being as someone important and significant to you. The bond that forms between owner and pet is, it seems, similar to the bond that a mother forms with her baby. The importance of social recognition is increasingly acknowledged for the role it plays in helping us form networks. We now understand that healthy social bonds can play a key role in mental health; without them, we become lonely, depressed and physically unwell. And pets, it seems, can fulfil that role. Academic and psychologist June McNicholas points out that pets can be a lifeline for socially isolated people. “Pet care and self-care are linked. When you take a dog out for a walk, people talk to you and that may be the only social contact an isolated person has the whole day. If you have a cat, you can have a conversation standing in the cat food aisle in the supermarket, deciding which brand to buy. When pet owners leave the house to buy pet food, they’re more likely to buy food for themselves and when they feed their pet, they’ll sit down to eat too. People with disabilities often find that able-bodied people are socially awkward with them; if they have a dog it breaks down barriers and allows a more comfortable and natural interaction.” Social recognition is something humans share with a few (though not all) mammals, including sheep and prairie voles. We are primed to look after those we have made social bonds with; we don’t breastfeed just any old baby and we don’t take random dogs home from the park. Author and researcher Meg Daley Olmert explains “When we call our dog, ‘our baby’ it is because we recognise it on a neural level as such. And this recognition triggers the same maternal bonding brain networks that allow a mother to look at her red, slimy newborn and say, ‘mine!’” A small study of functional MRI brain scans in 18 women showed similar responses in regions involved in reward, emotion and affiliation when the women looked at images of their child and pet dog.There were important differences though; dogs caused activity in the fusiform gyrus (involved in facial recognition) and babies in the tegmentum (centres of reward and affiliation). We love our pets, but in a fire we’re primed to save the baby. Although scientists have some understanding of social recognition and where it takes place in the brain, we still don’t entirely understand how it happens. The missing link could be oxytocin, the so-called “hug”, “love” or “cuddle” hormone. Oxytocin has a key role in both childbirth, lactation and sperm movement, but it also has an increasingly recognised role in our social behaviour, acting as a chemical messenger in pathways that control sexual arousal, recognition, trust, mother-infant and human-pet bonding. Oxytocin works in tandem with another brain hormone, vasopressin, to help to modulate our response to stress and deal with social situations. Unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of interest in a possible role for oxytocin in addiction, brain injury, anorexia, depression, autism and severe anxiety. And there are other reasons that pets and therapy animals are increasingly recognised as being good for our mental health. In addition to helping to alleviate stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness, there are all the benefits that come from having to exercise a dog. Daily walks outdoors boost physical and emotional wellbeing. Chucking sticks, picking up balls – even scooping up dog poo – can provide an all-round workout. Increasingly that knowledge is being turned to practical use, with some lovely effects. When the Centre for Mental Health ran an evaluation on therapy dogs in prisons, for example, the feedback was off the scale. “I don’t know what it is, but even when I am running around with [the dog] I just feel better inside, calmer, more peaceful,” said one prisoner. Another told the interviewer: “Dogs have a magic effect on you, you can feel their love and that just makes you feel better inside you.” The good feelings persist even after the dogs have left, the reviewers found, with one subject saying: “I just walk around for the rest of the day on cloud nine.” Some of the UK’s most dangerous and violent mental health patients are cared for in one of four high-security psychiatric hospitals. Most are diagnosed with schizophrenia and stay an average of seven years. The State hospital in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of these facilities and runs an animal therapy centre which gives patients the chance to pet and care for a range of animals including chipmunks, rabbits, hens, geese, pygmy goats and pigs. Staff say that animal therapy helps to develop problem-solving skills, empathy, attention to the needs of others, a sense of responsibility and a way of channelling aggressive thoughts among individuals who have proved hard to reach with conventional psychiatric drugs and talking therapies. But what if you don’t have a pet? Is there any shortcut to reproducing the beneficial effects? One candidate is sildenafil (Viagra). Having sex causes an oxytocin surge in the brain and taking Viagra may reproduce that surge without the faff of mating. A more practical idea might be an oxytocin spray or tablet. But biologist Sue Carter says that translating naturally occurring oxytocin into a commercially available product is challenging. Oxytocin has unique chemical properties and can shift form, making it hard to work with and measure. Importantly, “the effects of oxytocin are context dependent, sexually dimorphic (different in men and women), and altered by experience.” Honestly? Gazing into your dog’s eyes may produce a more reliable sense of wellbeing than any commercially available synthetic product. * Some names and details have been changed.",

    "transcript": "Last Tuesday morning at Middlebury College in Vermont, rumors swirled. Across North America, colleges and universities were suspending in-person classes and shuttering campuses in response to the coronavirus outbreak. An associate professor had sent an email to students in two of his classes, indicating that Middlebury classes would end that Friday, 13 March, and screenshots of the email began to spread through an increasingly anxious student body of more than 2,500 undergraduates. “Everyone was like, ‘Is this real? What do I do? How do I prepare?’” said Leif Taranta, a Middlebury student. “Do we need to leave this place that’s been our home?” About an hour later, Middlebury’s president, Laurie Patton, confirmed that students would have to leave campus by Friday for an extended two-week spring break. Remote classes would begin on 30 March, and students would be “expected to remain at home and not return to campus until further notice”. Immediately, concerns abounded. How quickly could they find storage space for all their belongings, or arrange travel plans to go home? A number of students could afford to purchase plane tickets home with only a few days’ notice, but many could not. The announcement stipulated a process for students to request permission to remain on campus, especially if they were international students, but how exactly would that work? Would anyone end up homeless? In the midst of this panic, Taranta and a number of other students created a publicly editable Google spreadsheet. “Please list anything you can offer the community under the offers sections, and any requests you have in the requests column,” they wrote. The Middlebury Mutual Aid Spreadsheet circulated through social media, and within 24 hours, it was filled with responses from students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members from the surrounding town of Middlebury. They offered each other rides to the airport in Burlington, or the Amtrak station in Port Henry. They arranged carpools to Boston, New York City, Philadelphia. Mike Roy, the dean of library and information services, volunteered his barn for storage space. They listed their spare rooms, air mattresses, couches and futons. They offered up food, healthcare supplies and emotional support. “I have a car and as of now am staying on campus, so if you need help transporting things to storage or a ride to the airport let me know!” wrote one student. “My wife, Pat, and I are healthy seventysomethings living in Middlebury,” wrote a local resident. “We have two bedrooms available in our home and are able to provide transportation support as necessary.” “Is it your birthday while stuck on campus?” wrote Stacie Marshall, a staff member. “I will bake you a (mini) cake!” Middlebury College itself eventually began to offer more resources, like financial assistance for low-income students’ travel arrangements. “Institutions can’t move fast enough to respond right away,” said Taranta. “They’re large and slow and bureaucratic. In the first couple of days, it was just student organizers and community relationships that stepped up.” As schools continue to close, some have followed the same model of mutual aid, including Wesleyan College and Tufts University. By now, most students have returned to their homes. For Taranta and others, however, the mutual aid effort has only just begun. “Students have been vulnerable as they face these surprise evictions,” said Taranta. “But there’s also this reality that we are the least at-risk in terms of the actual virus, unless we’re immunocompromised. So having received all this amazing support, there’s this desire to give back to the communities that helped us. What can young people do that might be dangerous for older people to do?” As the coronavirus continues to spread, policymakers and medical professionals have exhorted the public to practice social distancing – remove themselves as potential vectors for Covid-19 by limiting their interactions with others. This is the premise: for the sake of protecting those vulnerable, the elderly and the immunocompromised, everyone must sacrifice. Cancel your dates and your dinner parties, your weddings and your funerals. Remain indoors, mitigate the pandemic. But many people are ready to contribute even more. Walela Nehanda is a community organizer and poet based in South Los Angeles. Nehanda has advanced stage leukemia, and regularly uses a particular Lysol spray to disinfect surfaces. When panic-buying emptied store shelves, Nehanda’s partner spent days searching for the spray. “It was sold out everywhere in Los Angeles,” said Nehanda. Nehanda, who uses they/them pronouns, has been using social media to find a match for a bone marrow transplant. When they feared they wouldn’t be able to find disinfectant spray, they turned to Twitter. “Within 10 minutes,” they said, two people volunteered to send them Lysol. “Even after I said my needs were met, people were still offering to help me.” Realizing that others might be in similar situations, Nehanda started a Twitter thread where immunocompromised people listed what they needed, and people with access to disinfectant products volunteered to send them out. “The response has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Nehanda, who eventually created a Google document to organize it all. Nearly 200 people from across the US and Canada signed up to mail out soap, face masks and hand sanitizer. Even more offered to make local food deliveries and run errands. “I’m really proud of how self-motivated some people are to really ensure everyone is OK, and be committed to practicing mutual aid in real life in their own communities,” said Nehanda. Mutual aid is a concept in organization theory, based on the late-19th-century anarchist writings of Russian economist and sociologist Peter Kropotkin. It describes people providing each other support, whether through resources or services, for the sake of mutual benefit. The hallmark of mutual aid is that aid flows horizontally – between peers, colleagues, community members – rather than from the top-down, as it would from a government, major charity or other institutional program to those in need. It is fitting that mutual aid is rooted in anarchist theory: typically, in times of crisis, war, or natural disaster, when institutions begin to fail, human altruism comes to the forefront. After the 2017 Mexico City earthquake, civilians organized brigades to move broken pieces of rubble, and volunteers directed traffic. In 2011, in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, a group of 200 Japanese elderly volunteered themselves to work to stabilize the nuclear plant, citing their likelihood to die of other causes before cancer from radiation exposure. Even in the US, a nation characterized by individualism, disasters have had a tendency to beget altruism. John Abruzzo, a quadriplegic accountant, was working in the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks. His co-workers took turns carrying him to safety down 69 flights of stairs. For some populations, of course, the disaster is constant. For many marginalized and vulnerable demographics, crisis only exacerbates already-dire circumstances. As the threat of Covid-19 looms, many sex workers have seen drastic decreases in business. “Any time the demand for services is really low, and people are pushed into a place of financial desperation, some clients will take advantage of that,” said Molly Simmons, a sex worker and activist based in Brooklyn. “They’ll ask people to cross boundaries they’re not comfortable with, perform services in unsafe areas, lower their prices. So people find themselves taking more risks because work is scarce.” To compound the problem, sex workers are often unable to access social services. Sex work is largely a cash industry, and workers often struggle to open bank accounts or obtain health insurance. Some have criminal records. Some are migrant workers without documentation. They generally do not have paid sick leave. “I don’t have a paystub to show anyone,” said Fera Lorde, another Brooklyn-based sex worker and activist. “I can’t prove to a bureaucracy that I’m poor.” Simmons and Lorde are representatives at the Brooklyn chapter of the Sex Worker Outreach Project, a social justice network dedicated to the rights of sex workers. To support their community, they started a GoFundMe to raise an emergency relief fund for sex workers in New York. Many of the donors are other sex workers. “We’re always spreading the wealth around,” said Lorde. “Whenever we’re flush, we help each other out.” For Taranta, mutual aid is the path forward – not just for this crisis, but for the next one. “We’re about to face all these collapses,” said Taranta. “With the economy, and with climate change. We need to have these systems ready.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/how-helsinki-and-oslo-cut-pedestrian-deaths-to-zero",
    "date": "2020-03-16",
    "transcript": "They cut speed limits, changed street design, removed space for cars and generally made life harder for motorists. Now it appears the work is paying off. Two of Europe’s smaller capital cities – Oslo and Helsinki – are reaping the rewards of committed action on making their roads safer, reducing pedestrian fatalities to zero last year. Helsinki recorded no deaths for the first time since records began in 1960, down from an average of 20-30 a year in the 1990s. In Oslo, there were also no pedestrian or cyclist deaths in the city, which has a population of 680,000, and no children under 16 died in traffic crashes in the entire country. In comparison, 57 pedestrians died in London in 2018; 2019 figures have yet to be released. The Nordic achievements beg the question: what did they do to achieve such dramatic improvements? Christoffer Solstad Steen from Trygg Trafikk, a road safety organisation in Norway, said: “[Politicians in Oslo] have chosen to make it more difficult to use a car – it takes more time to drive from one part of the city to another now and you have to pay money to use the road much more than you used to.” In 2017 there was a 70% increase in tolls across the city, in plans spearheaded by the Labour and Green parties, which led to a 6% decrease in traffic. Car parking charges were also increased – by 50% in downtown Oslo and 20% elsewhere – although thousands of spaces have now been wiped out to make room for 35 miles of new cycle lanes. The city has reduced speed to a maximum of 30km/h outside schools and started trialling “heart zones”, where driving is banned in areas around schools. Officials in Oslo hope to create 100 of these zones over the next four years. There has been some opposition to the changes, admits Arild Hermstad, Oslo’s vice mayor for environment and transport – particularly when it comes to banning cars from certain areas of the city. However, he thinks when people become accustomed to the new set-up, they see the benefits: “When it actually starts happening and people see that it’s working, then no one wants to reintroduce the cars into these roads. So I think more and more people are seeing that this is actually good for the city,” he said. “We want to reduce the overall car traffic in Oslo by 30% by 2030. It’s a hard goal, but we think it will be good for the city as well.” Similar traffic reduction tactics have been employed in Helsinki, where speed limits have been tightening for decades and were reduced again last year. Now the speed limit is 30km/h on most residential streets and the city centre, 50km/h on main streets in suburban areas and 40km/h on those in the inner city. “Of course, it’s not only a question of speed limits, although I think all our specialists do say that is the most important single thing affecting traffic safety,” said Anni Sinnemäki, the deputy mayor of urban environment in Helsinki. “In the last few years, we have also focused on how we build the street environment. Streets are being better divided between pedestrians, cycle lanes and cars – the car lane is not the widest possible.” Along with narrower driving lanes, Helsinki has also built dozens of roundabouts and installed speed bumps since the 1990s to reduce speed. The wider picture across Europe shows a sharp difference in road safety. From 2015 to 2017, the average number of road deaths on urban roads per million urban inhabitants was 10.9 in the UK. In Norway it was just 5.3, the lowest in Europe, while in Finland it was 16.9. The countries with the highest rates of urban road deaths were Romania with 105.2, Croatia with 87.9 and Serbia with 73.8. Norway and Finland have implemented Vision Zero, a set of principles and policies aimed at eliminating serious injuries and fatalities involving road traffic. The project shifts responsibility for crashes from road users to the designers of the road system – if one occurs, it is up to authorities to ensure that it does not happen again. The initiative has been taken up across the world with varying levels of success. Sadiq Khan signed London up in 2018, but Norway has been working towards it since the 1990s. The goal hasn’t been achieved yet, however. Although both cities recorded zero pedestrian fatalities in 2019, in Helsinki three drivers died in traffic crashes last year, while in Oslo one driver died. A pedestrian has also been killed in the city this year. In Norway, there has also been a renewed focus on road safety education in schools and maintaining a tough driving test. Hermstad said: “For many years, the driver education system has focused a lot on road safety. And also strict regulations and road rules that prioritise safety, maybe more here than in many other countries.” Steen added: “It’s easy to build yourself out of problems but it is more difficult to get people to understand that this is important and make them act in a more secure way. “I’m not saying that we have managed to achieve that goal, but it’s one of the things we have been focusing on for many years in Norway and probably one of the reasons why things are getting better.”",

    "date": "2020-03-14",
    "transcript": "As coronavirus engulfs the world, with increasing numbers putting themselves in self-isolation as a response to the growing pandemic, it is easy to become swept up in the doom and gloom. But some kind-hearted people are shrugging off the sense of apocalypse by offering to lend a helping hand to those in need, notifying them by dropping leaflets through their letterboxes as dozens of “mutual aid” groups spring up across the UK. Eighty-seven groups have been formed across the country to offer practical support for those in self-isolation, as well as phone calls. Volunteers are organising WhatsApp and Facebook groups, and are holding meetings online alongside distributing flyers in the street. Anna Vickerstaff, one of the coordinators of the national Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK network, said: “No matter what we look like, where we live, or how much money we have, getting sick reminds us that at our core we’re all just human. “And in every country it’s the old, the sick and those already struggling who will be affected worse. That’s why we set this network up – because we want to make sure that no one in our communities is being left to face this crisis alone, and because we want to try and redress some of the serious inequalities this outbreak will expose.” The groups follow a #viralkindness campaign where postcards bearing the message “Hello! If you are self-isolating, I can help” are being dropped at doorsteps across the UK with the idea already spreading as far as Australia. The cards, which are available to download online so people can print them at home, include boxes for neighbours to write their name, address, phone number and state whether volunteers can help with picking up shopping, urgent supplies, posting mail or even just “a friendly phone call”. It comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK reached over 1,000 on Saturday, with the government advising anyone showing symptoms – including a cough or high temperature – to self-isolate at home for seven days. People with mild symptoms are not being tested. The postcard idea was conceived by Becky Wass, a lecturer in Cornwall who said she felt helpless by the pandemic and was compelled to do something to combat it. Wass, an associate lecturer in creative advertising at Falmouth University, told Cornwall Live: “I was talking to my husband John about how the news was quite hard-hitting and there wasn’t much we could actually do to make a positive difference.” Wass, 32, added: “If just one person feels less lonely or isolated when faced with this pandemic, then I’ll feel better about it. Coronavirus is scary. Let’s make kindness go viral.” She wrote on her Facebook page on Thursday evening: “I’ve been feeling pretty helpless watching the news. Maybe you have too? I wanted to do something about it, so I’ve made a postcard that I’ll be posting to my older neighbours as this progresses (after washing my hands!). “If just one person feels less lonely or isolated when faced with this pandemic, then I’ll feel better about it (I hope!) Coronavirus is scary. Let’s make kindness go viral. Feel free to share/print/use.” Polly Cox, who runs a post office store in Wiltshire, is also posting leaflets to neighbours in order to “reach out to the vulnerable people in our community” who are self-isolating or cautious about going outside. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re buddying up people so those who already know elderly people or people who are at more higher risk, if they already know them then we’re pairing them up. And we’re making sure that people have regular contact and just reach out to people really and reassure them that we’re all in it together. “Already we’ve had a brilliant reaction. We’ve got a neighbourhood watch WhatsApp group and a village WhatsApp group so people have already been messaging me saying they know so-and-so or they’ll check in on this household and so already we’re building up a good list of names of people who can help. Other people have offered to drive if they need to.” Meanwhile, in Brighton the community spirit is also thriving as locals rally round to help the vulnerable. A Covid-19 mutual aid group on Facebook is connecting people who need help with food shopping, picking up prescriptions or even dog-walking. Within 24 hours of it being set up on Friday, the group swelled to more than 600 members who have already set about distributing flyers offering help. Sussex University lecturer Dr Andrea Brock, 33, who came up with the idea with her friend, said: “It can be incredibly isolating to be in your house for weeks. We are used to this idea that asking for help is a bad thing and that is not something we are encouraged to do. “So we are setting up this group so people can ask for help and they can ask for support. The fact that this works shows that people want to help each other.”",

    "transcript": "Few of us, I suspect, will forget the strange days of March 2020. There is something in the air, a sense of the slow-motion shutdown of public life in dozens of countries. Quiet streets, empty buses, vacant offices. If that feels scary, then there is another way of looking at things. It’s very possible that you and I might have a little more time on our hands in coming weeks, as public events dwindle, holidays are cancelled, travel options dry up, working-from-home days proliferate and millions self-isolate. And therein lies the opportunity from this crisis. A chance to pivot away from the routine of your everyday life, do something different, pick up some new skills. As Oliver Balch explained recently in this lovely little Upside piece, the digital world means it has never been easier to learn something new, whether that is bike maintenance, barbering or baking. What could you learn in a few short weeks? That rather depends on your dedication, I suspect. Sewing, juggling, CPR, drawing, wood turning, the Cyrillic alphabet, solving cryptic crosswords, cooking, meditation, temari, knitting, video editing, offspin, yoga, coding, diving (though this might be difficult in your front room), the accordion … the list is endless. So how about it? What will you learn? Let us know. Lindsey Smith has already been in touch: “I have planned my fortnight in self-isolation. The house will be spring cleaned, books read, but I may not have enough loo paper …” Of course, you’ll have to leave a little time in your study schedule for reading the best Upside pieces of the week. This week that is just 12 minutes: • The new-look department store that doesn’t sell stuff. Three-minute read • The baker who recycles old bread. One-minute loaf • The EU green deal – can it save the world? Four-minute read • Here comes the sun canoe. Two-minute read • Italy puts a brave face on it all. Two-minute read Lucky numbers It was, in truth, not a great week to be an investor (though don’t be fooled by the headlines about billions being wiped off share markets: these things have a habit of turning around). But if you were a Tunisian garlic grower, things were definitely looking up. Indeed, Covid-19 – while still clearly a supremely grave global event – continues to produce silver linings: China’s carbon emissions fell by one quarter as a result of its containment measures. Three quarters of Chinese virus patients have now recovered. New case numbers are falling in South Korea and other east Asian nations. Meanwhile this article demonstrates how social distancing, destined to become one of the words of the year, really can and does work to flatten the epidemic sine curve. What we liked The world didn’t seem so bad after reading this uplifting piece from the BBC about the revival of one of Britain’s great rivers. And here is some fascinating science about why visualising an action can lead to its better execution. What we heard Last week, we asked you what you thought of our coverage of coronavirus. The majority of you were positive, though for balance we include a mix of responses. Margaret Clough was pleased that we are making huge efforts to ensure that our reporting is balanced and responsible: All I can say is a huge thankyou for honest, balanced reporting, and really thinking about the effect your ethical reporting can have on our society. I wish more people could have access to it. Fiona Greig added: Keep doing what you do best … objective, balanced, trustworthy reporting. It’s what we need most to help us make sense of the world in these turbulent times. A German reader who didn’t want his name published is not a fan of the minute-by-minute type of coverage: I have also wondered how you will escalate the coverage as the outbreak grows (which is likely though not certain). If you are already at the top of the scale with the first few cases, the first few deaths in the UK, what will you do should people die in the thousands per day? And Karen Hubbard in Australia wonders if the media are making things worse: I think they are scaring everyone with the sensational way of reporting every new person case. They have turned it into a pandemic before it is and ordinary people feel out of control and are panicking. In Australia there is panic buying and now countries are closing there borders, yet so far it has caused less damage than the flu. Jeremy Becker in Sweden wanted a little more context: Thanks for your excellent coverage. In terms of perspective, I as a reader would appreciate some statistics comparing mortality rates for corona and other causes of death. Monica Lanman had a suggestion: Just one thought that someone might pick up - worldwide collaboration of the kind that is building over Covid 19 is exactly what we need over the climate emergency. Can we learn from the one and inject the same huge power and urgency into the other? Elsewhere, and changing the subject, Adam Davey wrote in from France, and from leftfield: Binned wine corks would insulate every home in the country, especially in France. Waste is an absolute scandal. I use all manner of materials to insulate my barn conversion in France. I don’t have a landfill bin bag at all. Zero waste. Thanks Adam. Corks it is then. Where was the Upside? In these charts, which suggest that this too shall pass. Thanks for reading. Keep in touch. Tell us about your experiences in these strangest of days. All the best.",

    "transcript": "A canoe slides noiselessly upstream through a landscape of luminous bright clouds reflected in the water. A team of young indigenous people are onboard. Such vessels are an essential and ubiquitous part of life in the Ecuadorian Amazon, but this one boasts a hugely symbolic difference from its predecessors. It is powered by the sun. The nine members of the Achuar indigenous group on board are returning home after learning about solar power and installation. It is a technological development they hope to use in their battle with a more traditional power source that threatens their very existence. Oil. “They have sold us out, they have sold our resources,” says Nantu, 31, referring to the authorities in Quito. “And they are expanding the oil wells. They are stealing from us without us noticing. That’s why we are now standing up, to defend what’s ours, our territories, our way of life.” Ecuador’s oil industry has wrought tremendous disruption and destruction on the peoples of the Amazon rainforest. It is not just the pollution, heavy machinery and deforestation. It is roads as well. A highway that starts in the town of Puyo has already penetrated dozens of kilometres into the territory of the neighbouring Shuar indigenous group, and it is about to enter Achuar territory. “The road is a poison,” says José, Nantu’s companion. “The road doesn’t respect us. It’s been imposed on us from the city. It’s a very dangerous territory for us.” The solar canoes are a defiant attempt to stand up to this incursion. The project, conceived by the Quito-based Kara Solar Foundation, aims to connect nine communities in Achuar territory with public transport powered by the sun. The project envisages an Amazon teeming with solar canoes that will potentially replace the tens of thousands of vessels that burn thousands cubic metres of fuel each year. As Kara Solar’s founder, Oliver Utne, puts it: “Sustained and truly intercultural collaborations can create technological solutions that serve indigenous communities, rather than destroying them.” Ecuador’s oil industry pumps about 500,000 barrels a day, most of it extracted from reserves in the Amazon rainforest. The oil is then piped to the coast and shipped thousands of miles north for refining. Much is sold for export, but some is transported back to Ecuador and driven by road back to petrol stations. From there it is poured into drums and transported in trucks or cars to to be used in canoes that in turn are propelled by two- or four-stroke outboard engines or smaller long-tailed engines known locally as peque-peques. The oil goes back into the rainforest from where it was extracted as pollution. The solar canoes are an attempt to forge an alternative. As with any research project, the two boats in operation have had technical problems and there have been accidents in the tricky territory. The river floods periodically and there are often currents, whirlpools and underwater obstacles to overcome. The surface of the canoe’s solar panel needs to be optimised so that it can carry the greatest number of photovoltaic cells without endangering the vessel’s stability. The durability and storage capacity of the batteries also need to be improved, to make them lighter and ideally to replace the lead with lithium without increasing the cost. There is a long list of other improvements that are needed, but the process is well under way. During the next phase of development, solar recharging stations will be installed along the canoe route. Seven young Achuar people are being trained in using the technology. These are “intercultural training” programmes taught by peers, who are also instructed by indigenous technicians. Concerned about the future of a growing population, the Achuar community is gradually diversifying economically in terms of moving beyond self-sufficiency toward sustainability. There is already an ecotourism project where as many as 24 people can stay in two cabins managed by the community, and a balanced food project that uses a solar power plant. The main and imminent threat, however, is undoubtedly the proximity of the road. Nantu makes a very clear complaint to the authorities in Quito: “I would tell the government not to carry out projects without consulting the indigenous peoples. They should carry out projects in consultation with the people, who are the owners of the territories. They should stop expanding oil frontiers and the arteries that reach the outer corners of the Amazon. It’s becoming very dangerous for us.” Nantu is aware that changes are taking place in the climate and of how global heating affects the territory and the world. “There is some variation of life here in the jungle. The flowering cycle has changed by one to two months. The rains are too intense, and the sun is too strong.” He has a vision for the future of his five children. He imagines an Amazon capable of being economically self-sufficient, a few community tourism centres managed by indigenous people and solar canoes managed by the Achuar with recharging stations along the river. No roads, no pipelines, no oil. This article was produced with support from the Rainforest Journalism Fund, in association with the Pulitzer Center",

    "date": "2020-03-11",
    "transcript": "Four-year-old Joris Niekus hops excitedly in front of a wall-sized flatscreen as his dad loads up an interactive version of Roald Dahl’s BFG (known as GVR in Dutch). Seconds later, face beaming, his digitised silhouette is bopping across the screen together with Dahl’s gangly giant. It’s just one of many experiences on offer at a new downtown development in the Dutch city of Groningen that is seeking to reinvent urban hubs for the post-consumer age. The €101m, trapezoid Forum building is part library, part meeting space, part science museum and part recreational hangout – a 10-storey “multi-space” designed to resonate with citizens who know that shopping is not necessarily the answer. It’s a new-look department store that doesn’t actually sell very much. But with high streets feeling the pinch across the developed world, with shops shuttered and town centres wondering what they are for any more, the Groningen experiment is being closely watched. Nowhere is that truer than in the UK, where more than 16,000 retail stores closed last year at the cost of more than 143,000 jobs. The picture in the US is similar, with more than 9,300 shops going to the wall in 2019 as shoppers increasingly move online. In Europe, city centres are being emptied of life as skyrocketing rental costs push low-income residents out to the peripheries. In cities such as Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Luxembourg, for instance, 80% of citizens say affordable housing is hard to find. It’s early days, but the Forum certainly feels like it is working. More than 700,000 people – three times the city’s total population – have visited the library since it opened late last year. So, what’s the big draw? There are books galore (92,000 in total), but they are for rent, not sale, distributed liberally across multiple mezzanine floors with a joyous disregard for Dewey decimal discipline. Geography on one floor, history on another, mathematics … somewhere, presumably. For the non-bookish, there’s plenty besides: a six-screen cinema, two exhibition halls, a couple of cafes, a museum (about comics, no less), a 250-seater auditorium, and a hip (but not overly hip) top-floor restaurant and bar. Oh, plus a rooftop “market square” with panoramic views over the whole of Groningen. “Every day when I pick him up from school, he asks to come to the Forum. He just finds it so much fun,” says Joris’s dad, Marcel, an archaeologist, who cuts his working day short every Tuesday to accommodate his son’s request. Right to roam The comment is music to the ears of Dirk Nijdam, the Forum’s director, who readily admits that lending out books has never been his priority. Instead, what’s driven his thinking since he took on the project six years ago is the idea of creating a space where anyone and everyone can wander in, kick back and collectively feel at home. “If people walk in and say, ‘Wow, Groningen has got a new library’, then we’ll have failed,” he says. “If you want to come in and just hang out, you should feel just as welcome as if you’re going to an exhibition or taking out a book.” This notion of “hanging out” gets to the real function of Groningen’s artful new creation: namely, helping fellow citizens mix and mingle and – who knows? – perhaps even taste that nebulous yet ever-necessary thing called “community”. It’s a mission born, in part, out of Groningen’s struggling city centre. The hope is that the Forum will revitalise the main market square, which, after the German occupation during the second world war was home to a dingy car park for decades. At the same time, the project marks a bold riposte to the effects of modern-day capitalist society: first, in its promotion of an individualistic society; and second, in its commercialisation of public space (ie with malls and coffee bars gradually replacing libraries and community centres). The Forum is a splendid example of form following function. Clean and contemporary, the final design shouts anything but library. Hotel lobby, perhaps? Department store, even? From the luminous circular information desk, to the free-floating elevators, to the immense, cathedral-esque atrium. It’s all quite discombobulating and really rather marvellous. Once through the door, the challenge is to make people stay. It’s all about “the experience”, says Nijdam, borrowing from big retail’s mantra de jour. So no security beefs on the door, no blaring Tannoy announcements, no endless queuing. Instead, it’s all soft furnishings, mood lighting and make-yourself-at-home courtesy. Signposts are also kept to a minimum. Exploration, not explanation, is the building’s guiding motif, says Kamiel Klaasse co-founder of NL Architects, an upstart Amsterdam-based firm that beat off an all-star list (including the late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid) to win the design contract way back in 2006. “The brief talked as much about searching as about finding and we interpreted that as an incentive to let people roam,” Klaasse says. Community connector The Groningen resident and social activist Ritzo ten Cate is an early cheerleader for the project. Describing the Forum as “one big welcome gesture to us as citizens”, he points to the diversity of the building’s users as proof of its communitarian qualities. The evidence seems solid. On any given day, you’ll find students working at their laptops, mums with their toddlers, school kids on assignment and grannies reading newspapers. All of them together, under one roof, seemingly as one. Nor is it just Groningen’s well-heeled citizens who make use of the space. On his many visits, Ten Cate regularly spots friends from the city’s homeless community. Some come to read or use the free internet, while others are after a warm corner to kill time or take a nap. “The Forum only opened a few months ago, but it’s already doing its job as a connector,” says Ten Cate, who has plans to run a large-scale hackathon there in June. But as much as the Forum brings people together, is it serving to create community. For Paul de Rook, an alderman on Groningen city council, it’s a crucial question. More than just shared physical space, genuine community is about a shared understanding of one another, he argues. “That’s why it’s really valuable to create spaces where people … can see what is going on in other people’s lives.” In a nod to this reality, the Forum seeks to orient all its cultural activities around a common thread. Whether it’s the current exhibition on artificial intelligence (recently on show at the Barbican in London) or Spike Jonze’s futuristic film Her at the cinema, everyone is collectively inching towards the same page (“optimism about the future”, in the Forum’s case). Dr Ward Rauws admires the sentiment but harbours doubts. An assistant professor of spatial planning at the University of Groningen, he notes that the core building blocks of community – social capital, civic culture, place identity and so forth – start first at a street-by-street level and expand out from there. Even so, he remains a big fan of Groningen’s Forum because of its role in helping foster “familiarity”. Echoing De Rook, he defines the term as a state of awareness that “other kinds of citizens exist who might think differently or look different, but who are part of the same community”. It’s a salient point for a university town such as Groningen, where town-gown tensions are a feature of daily life. Groningen’s audacious experiment in urban planning isn’t without its detractors, most of whom gripe about the final price-tag. Joris’s mum is in that camp. Her son begs to differ. Done with the BFG, he’s now playing a spelling game on one of the library’s iPads. His dad watches on patiently, albeit with half an eye on the upstairs cafe. “Afterwards,” he whispers, “we go for cake.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn",

    "transcript": "What is Europe’s green deal? The European Green Deal aims to transform the 27-country bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy, without reducing prosperity and while improving people’s quality of life, through cleaner air and water, better health and a thriving natural world. If that sounds ambitious, it is. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it “Europe’s man on the moon moment”. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic. Nearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution. Previous attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual. How will it work? The green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets – a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core – alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources. All of the EU’s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of “50 actions for 2050” for other sectors. Jobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. “The European green deal is our new growth strategy – a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,” von der Leyen said. What is the legal basis? All of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals. East European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK – which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda – will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP. The new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill. But what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans – charged with delivering the green deal – will throw all of its might behind the effort. “It’s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,” says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. “It will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.” Will the green deal make a difference? It needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 – good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that – disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key. On other environmental scores, the EU’s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s. Dozens of harmful chemicals have been phased out, farm animal welfare standards raised and recycling rates beat most of the world. But alongside those successes, the natural world has suffered a calamity across the continent: birds, insects, mammals, fish … few creatures (other than humans) have had a good time of it since the EU was created in 1992. How much will it cost and where will the money come from? At least €1 tn (£852bn) needs to be found over the next decade, according to the European commission. The biggest share, €503bn, should come from the EU budget, unleashing a further €114bn from national governments (because EU programmes often require a contribution from member states). The next €279bn would come mostly from the private sector: the idea is that companies would be encouraged to make risky green investments by loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, the EU lender, which recently pledged to phase out loans to fossil fuel projects. On top of this Brussels has promised a €100bn “just transition” mechanism to help retrain workers who lose jobs in shuttered coal mines or steel factories. But is it really €1 tn? Even friendly experts detect wishful accounting in Brussels’ figures. Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the €503bn from the EU budget as “green investment”, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to “green” the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU’s auditors highlighted how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out “green” cash with little oversight. Others fear that carbon financiers will game the system, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don’t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four “frugal” net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The €503bn is not even in the bank. Even if the EU realised its €1tn plan, it wouldn’t be enough. Bruegel argues the €1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission’s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from Aragón to Silesia. Why does the green deal matter internationally? This year – coronavirus permitting – will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world’s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible. But the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases fell short of what is required to stay below 2C, and since 2015 the world’s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after. But enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from Donald Trump’s US, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. The key player will be China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a pact between the US and China was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone. “EU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,” says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. “In the face of Trump’s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world’s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.” What do critics say? The EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. He points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. “The AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,” he says. “The green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won’t be going carbon-neutral,” says Grant. “This will increase the electoral strength of populists.” Some leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the “just transition” mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, wrote in the Guardian: “Will there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.” Will the UK be affected? Boris Johnson’s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain various loopholes that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees. The UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK’s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot. On the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What’s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim. That is what Europe’s green deal is meant to provide, and unless the UK forms its own parallel plans soon, its 2050 target will look increasingly adrift. Who are the green agitators in Europe? The idea of a Green New Deal has been kicking around US politics since at least 2006. The European Green Deal (minus the word “new’ with its radical overtones) is not yet one year old. The EU plan resulted when an unexpected political leader collided with newly-elected MEPs, energised by the global climate movement. Von der Leyen, a German defence minister, was a surprise choice to become European commission president, leapfrogging candidates who had run in the European elections in May. Those elections resulted in a record number of seats for European Greens, as climate change topped the agenda in Germany and the Nordic countries. Von der Leyen’s last-minute elevation angered the European parliament, pressuring her to lean to the left, liberals and Greens to gain support. To win MEPs over, she promised a European Green Deal within 100 days of taking office. Beyond the Brussels power play, politicians were responding to the streets, as school children walked out of their classrooms, demanding action. The school strike was personal. Chief executives, heads of government and senior UN officials told EU officials their children were asking what they were doing to save the planet. As one official recounts: “You can imagine a conversation with your own children is much more confrontational than a conversation with a shareholder, or a bad headline in a newspaper.” Who’s in favour, who’s against? It’s a bit like world peace: everyone backs the European Green Deal, in theory. But there is a big hole in the ambition to be net-zero by 2050: Poland, which says it will reach climate neutrality at “its own pace”. And beneath the surface, tensions over Europe’s green ambitions are not hard to find. At least eight countries, including Spain, Sweden and Latvia, want the EU to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target. Poland and Hungary think that is too much. Divisions will also come when hard choices have to be made: from closing coal mines, demanding more from farmers, to tougher emissions standards for the car industry. What role will the European parliament play in the green deal? EU governments agree environmental laws with the European parliament. That gives MEPs a weighty role across a swathe of new laws expected to flow from the European Green Deal: a revision of the EU’s heavily criticised carbon trading scheme, new performance standards for cars and vans, an overhaul of farm policy, changes to EU rules on state subsidies that will phase out support for fossil fuels. Typically, the parliament tends to raise the bar on green action – it last year declared a climate emergency. But MEPs often lose the battle against EU ministers, who usually get the upper hand in EU negotiations.

    "transcript": "It started on a modest scale with so-called “waste bread” – repurposing unsold bread that might otherwise go to waste into a new, larger sourdough loaf. Now there are savoury crackers made with leftover cheese ends, baguettes turned into croutons, and day-old croissants filled with fresh ingredients. It’s all part of a drive by a UK bakery chain to become a zero-waste business. At least 25 new products and initiatives are promised over the coming year by Gail’s, as part of an entire Waste Not range of foods which aims to cut down on ingredients squandered throughout the company’s supply chain. Globally, the UN estimates global food waste causes about $940bn (£770bn) a year in economic losses. It says a third of the world’s food is wasted while one in nine people remain malnourished, while food waste also accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Surplus bread remains one of the biggest waste problems for food retailers, according to the UK government’s food waste adviser Wrap, particularly from freshly baked lines which have a short shelf life. It is also wasted in our homes: Britons throw away 24m slices a day. The original “waste bread” is made from strong white flour, malt, and a decades-old sourdough “starter”, mixed with so-called “bread porridge” – a brownish, flecked mush of fresh breadcrumbs from leftover loaves blitzed into tiny pieces. “We freshly bake all our products every day and obviously we don’t know how much we are going to sell,” said Gail’s co-founder Tom Molnar. “The waste sourdough bread has proved very popular with our customers, and as a result, we decided to review our entire range of products and ingredients to see how best to tackle waste. It seems a good example of the circular economy in action and reflects the philosophy of our business.” The circular economy model – which aims to use closed-loop production to keep resources in play for as long as possible – is being increasingly used in a range of different sectors from food, packaging, plastics and fashion. Gail’s opened its first bakery in Hampstead in 2005 and today has 59 outlets in London, Brighton, Cambridge, Oxford and elsewhere in the south-east. Every night, its shops donate unused food to more than 40 local charities, but any leftover bread not sold or distributed in this way has, for the last eighteen months, been diverted into the waste bread. The first dozen Waste Not products, launched this month, include two more repurposed sourdough loaves – one using cheese. The chain also makes and sells up to 6,500 croissants every day, and those that are not sold are now being refreshed as part of the new range. Its ham and gruyère croissant, for example, uses yesterday’s flaky croissants filled with rich béchamel sauce, honey-glazed ham and gruyère cheese, then re-baked. Other croissants are similarly refashioned into almond versions. In the run-up to Easter, day-old hot cross buns will be turned into a novel breakfast version of the traditional bacon sarnie. Shard-like cheese crackers are made from leftover dough scattered with cheddar cuts from Gail’s cheese supplier Quicke’s. Even its butter – part of the new range – is made from the whey cream left over from the cheese-making process. Gail’s is also teaming up with Suffolk-based brewer Brewshed to create its first ever beer brewed with leftover bread, something increasingly popular in the brewing industry. Toast Ale, for example, was launched in 2016 by Tristram Stuart, the founder of the food waste charity Feedback, who was inspired by a Belgian brewer who follows the same process. Toast Ale has just launched its first beer brewed with ‘wonky’ crumpets made by Warburtons: Toasted Crumpet is a 4.2% abv session IPA where some malted barley has been replaced by crumpets that would have otherwise been disposed of. Meanwhile, Marks &amp; Spencer is repurposing leftover baguettes from its in-store bakeries into packs of crostini – extending their shelf life by seven days – and is also trialling turning leftover baguettes and boules into frozen garlic bread, extending their shelf life by 30 days.

    "transcript": "We’ve had French stand-up comedy, 56 hours of clubbing in Berlin and a crowdfunded Romanian hospital. How Europeans shaped English football - and cuisine. And of course, a string of news exclusives - on euroscepticism, demography, and Brexit negotiations. All this in week one of a brand new series that aims to cross borders, generate hope, and emphasise that while the UK might be leaving Europe, the Guardian is not. How welcome it is to see Katharine Viner’s defiant leader. As Keats said on first looking into Chapman’s Homer: “Then felt I like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken ...” etc etc. Denis Loretto I am a Canadian who has followed Brexit with a broken heart. Yes. It is a self inflicted wound. But your quality of journalism makes me believe there is hope for your lovely country and most especially for the next generation. Somehow the Guardian enables me to Keep Calm and Carry On. Wendy Young As a graduate in European Studies in the 1980s, who benefited from partnerships between UK, French and German universities that allowed students to study abroad for an academic year, who has since lived in Asia for many years before returning to live in the UK and voting Remain, I am proud to call myself European as well as being a citizen of the world. The last few years have been challenging. It feels good to know that my favourite newspaper will continue to keep me connected to Europe. Thank you. Nicola Tanner Thanks to the Guardian, for your renovated stance towards Europe, as for your engagement for a journalism without fear and without borders. I’m Italian, I live in Edinburgh and work in Italy: since Nov. 2017, I’m also British. In such a multiple – and sadly divided – identity, I’m proud of being a Guardian reader. Isabella Lazzarini Today I am simply writing to you to say a heartfelt thank-you for your commitment to Europe and the launch of the dedicated Europe section. The Guardian is my first port of call every morning and I am glad that I can support the Guardian’s free and impartial journalism through my modest partner/membership fee. Andrew Craston Just to say the new This is Europe section is totally brilliant; we’ve needed this for years! As a professor of modern languages at Birmingham, I regularly work with students and colleagues to explore European perspectives, and this has just made our lives a whole lot easier. Thank you. Helen Abbott I always support your free, independent journalism and read your papers which give me the opportunity to keep abreast of the times with a language full of historical background and of a deep sense of humanity. Anna Giordano I am French and a daily reader of the Guardian. I was terribly upset by Brexit. I am afraid it will loosen relations with many British people despite the fact they were “remainers”. Your decision to be a European news organisation will greatly help to keep these relations alive. Jacques Roos I am delighted that you have to decided to continue and deepen your coverage of Europe. I am an Irish citizen, and I often feel the coverage of European affairs here is not as good as it should be, so I am looking forward to your weekly newsletter ‘This is Europe’. Edmond Gibbons Your words are very much appreciated as were Katharine Viner’s. I saw something, clicked and followed, read her editorial, joined. There was no question about thinking about it. This decision by the Guardian to have this new site was an inspired moment for me; the choice between yes and yes. Brian Milne As a Europe-based supporter of the Guardian, who is highly appreciative of, if not reliant upon, the organisation’s brave journalism in this age of misinformation, I am overjoyed to read of the decision to uphold a European orientation. Peter Symmons The article by Katharine Viner in yesterday’s paper made me cheer out loud (very loudly)! I also wept and so I recognise I haven’t yet worked through all the stages of grief at leaving the EU! Ellen Wallace Well done – you are a constant inspiration to me (for about 50 years!). Thank you. Peter Wishart Delighted to hear from you and your decision to keep a focus on European events. You have my full support. A very happy member. Lesley Siddall This is a simple message to tell you how much I value your reporting on European issues. I’m particularly interested in what the rest of Europe is doing about the climate emergency, pollution and how transport, public or private cars, is being incentivised to make a positive impact. Mike Mellor I just wanted to agree totally with your three principal reasons for deepening your commitment to Europe. I think that there are lots of opportunities to learn from our near neighbours, such as: Modern architecture and the public realm – numerous examples throughout Europe. Cycling infrastructure and hydro-engineering in the Netherlands. Regional banks supporting business in Germany. Eric Kelsall Thanks so much for Katharine Viner’s inspiring message, and the news that the Guardian is going further than just ‘not turning its back’ on the rest of Europe. The European idea in the UK can and should survive the setback that Brexit represents, and open-minded journalism of the sort announced here will help considerably. As a linguist and a convinced Europhile over decades, I felt supported and heartened by what I read. Niall Hoskin Having moved with my French wife in August last year to escape the disaster that is Brexit, we, as Guardian members, are very heartened by your decision to align and commit yourself to Europe as we have. We look forward to your unsurpassed coverage and more excellent comments and articles, from Rafael Behr, John Crace and Marina Hyde et al and give our wholehearted support to you for our very uncertain future. Vance &amp; Véronique Whittall Don’t give up. You’ll be well ahead of the pack when we apply to go back in. Michael Rosenberg",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/project-believe-in-crowdfunded-hospital-inspires-romanians",
    "date": "2020-03-05",
    "transcript": "A short drive from downtown Bucharest, an eight-storey hospital is rapidly taking shape. The building, which will open in early 2021, is more than just a healthcare facility. It is a symbol of Romanian frustration with successive governments and a growing realisation that maybe citizens need to find their own solutions to the country’s problems. Since 2015, more than 300,000 people and over 4,000 companies have donated money to construct the facility, which will treat children with cancer and will be the first state hospital built entirely through private donations. More than €30m (£25m) has been raised so far, enough to build and equip it. The heavy metal band Metallica donated €250,000 when they came to play a concert in Bucharest last August. “I think Romanians needed a project to believe in because for the past 30 years nothing was built, no roads, no hospitals, no infrastructure,” said Oana Gheorghiu, one of the two founders of Give Life Association, the NGO behind the project. Since the end of communism in 1989, Romania has lagged behind in terms of public investment. It has the lowest spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP in the EU, at about half the EU average, according to the latest available figures from Eurostat. At the same time, each year thousands of doctors and nurses leave the country for better-paid jobs abroad, and corruption and scandals continue to plague the sector. Last year one Romanian entrepreneur, fed up with the lack of progress in creating a modern road network in the country, inaugurated a symbolic, one-metre-long stretch of motorway he had constructed to publicly shame the government’s lack of investment. While that stunt was aimed at drawing attention to a problem, the hospital in Bucharest is a potential solution, albeit one that will be hard to replicate. Donations have poured in through the NGO’s website and via SMS. Some of the biggest donations have come from the energy companies OMV Petrom and Engie, as well as Mastercard. The average individual donation on the website is about €16. “My donation isn’t a big deal, but I am very happy to see a project like Dăruiește Viața coming true,” said Livia Grigorescu, a schoolteacher in a small town outside Bucharest, using the Romanian name of the NGO. Grigorescu donates €2 a month via SMS. “For me, this is a hope for a better future and, in the meantime, a proof of what can be done when people really want it.” Built on the grounds of one of the city’s existing hospitals, the paediatric oncology wing will cover 12,000 sq metres, with a floor dedicated to intensive care, six operating rooms and about 160 beds. Construction started in June 2018. “We wanted to refurbish and remodel the oncology department here [at the existing facility],” said Gheorghiu, pointing out that they had done the same with a hospital in Timişoara, in the west of the country. But, she said, they found it would be easier to build a new structure than to renovate the existing one, which was constructed in the late 1970s. Gheorghiu, who was a student at the time of the 1989 revolution, said the Romanian healthcare system had not improved over the last 30 years. “It’s actually even worse than it was during the communist era, because the infrastructure was not developed at all so they have the same resources.” Vlad Voiculescu, a former health minister who co-founded a children’s cancer charity in 2014, spoke of a disconnect between the growth in other parts of the Romanian economy and investment in areas such as healthcare. “Our private sector has thrived. Hundreds of office buildings in Romania’s cities, impressive living areas, and probably the biggest shopping malls in Europe. Our government, on the other hand, has managed to build only one new hospital in three decades,” he said. “There is this urgency for decent hospital infrastructure, as sub-optimal medical care drives tens of thousands to move west each year. This hospital simply shows us that we, Romanians, are better than our government. That we can and we deserve better.” Since Give Life was founded in 2012 – by Gheorghiu and Carmen Uscatu, neither of whom had a medical background – it has helped to build 18 sterile transplant rooms in Romania, tripling the country’s transplant capacity. The association has also constructed the country’s first laboratory for the “deep diagnosis” of leukaemia, and renovated oncology departments for children and adults in three of the country’s largest cities. Even so, relations between the NGO and government officials have, at times, been strained. In contrast, the NGO is heavily engaged with its donors, using social media posts to keep them up to date with developments and to give them a sense of ownership. This has kept money pouring in. Given the progress, it is tempting to wonder whether this approach to healthcare funding could be rolled out in other countries in the region with ageing and poorly funded health infrastructure. However, experts are not convinced the model is replicable more widely. “It’s fantastic, it will save lives, but it reminds me of the 1990s,” said Pascal Garel, the chief executive of the Brussels-based European Hospital and Healthcare Federation. “It puts pressure on the government in Romania saying you’re not able to run the system properly and fund it. That’s incredible.” He said a healthcare system’s problems could not be solved by such an initiative because it could not be done over and over again for different medical issues and age groups. Gheorghiu said they hoped to inspire others and they are well aware that one hospital will not change the entire system. However, she said the aim was to create “an island where things work normally and when people come – patients, doctors and nurses – they will see that things can be done differently and they will start changing”. The new hospital will become part of the public health system upon completion, and Give Life is already looking beyond the initial construction. “We have the money for the first building, but now the project has been extended,” said Gheorghiu. “We’re planning to do another building that will be connected with this one. The new hospital building will be about as big as the first.”",

    "transcript": "In the low-lying Gelderse Valley some 85km east of Amsterdam, a Dutch university is changing how humans eat. There, a bright-eyed press officer with Willy Wonka flair is showing me the miracles of modern food science. One laboratory door swings open to reveal giant, fragrant basil leaves growing under multicoloured lights. In a greenhouse nearby, thousands of tomatoes are suspended mid-air like plump, levitating Buddhas. A few steps away, I shake hands with a world-famous banana scientist, who dreams of introducing Europeans to the many varieties of banana eaten across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and ending the tyranny of the common yellow Cavendish. For miles in every direction, fields bulge with crops; in some, drones monitor soil fertility, in others, giant luminescent panels light up greenhouses at night. The press officer is accustomed to impressing visitors. “What do you think?” he asks at every turn. The Netherlands is not a big place. You can drive across the whole country from the north to the south in under four hours. And yet it ranks consistently among the world’s top food exporting nations, in terms of gross value. The country’s surpluses are mind-boggling; how does the second largest exporter of tomatoes and onions also produce such outsize quantities of dairy and potatoes, and export more eggs than any nation on Earth? The mystery of how this tiny patch of northern Europe does it draws government delegations, multinational companies and agriculture students from around the world to marvel at the nucleus of the Dutch innovation juggernaut: Wageningen University. Wageningen is set to face its biggest challenge yet. By 2050, according to some estimates, the number of mouths to feed on Earth will exceed 9.7 billion. That’s the equivalent of having a second Europe and a second Africa on the planet. To feed all of humanity, according to the World Resources Institute, we will need to produce 56% more food while avoiding further deforestation. The climate crisis will not help: pests will multiply as temperatures rise; floods, droughts and extreme weather will ravage crops; and desertification will take large bites out of currently available arable land. Broadly speaking, humankind has two paths to choose from to confront what is about to happen. One option – we innovate our way out. Wageningen’s science addresses some of the biggest problems in our food supply system today: scientists there are developing plant-based meat, vertical farms and gene-editing technology. If the answer to the problem of humanity’s survival is going to come out of a laboratory, there’s a good chance that it will happen in Wageningen. Multinational companies and energetic startups are pouring money into the university; the collective brainpower of 8,000 international food scientists is part of the machinery that will determine how humans of the future will eat. The other option – championed by a small but spirited group of Wageningen students – is rather more drastic. Neurosis about surplus and production, the students say, has driven the Earth to crisis point. Hunger continues, even as agriculture occupies 40–50% of the earth’s habitable land, guzzles 70% of all freshwater, and accounts for about 10–12% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. A third of food produced globally is wasted, while many of the world’s hungriest people are farming cash crops such as flowers and tobacco, the students say. The cycle of year-on-year growth fuels unnecessary demand, while market-led models of resource allocation cause huge inequalities in access to food. The Wageningen model, one student tells me, is flawed. “The question of how to feed the world is a political one,” she says. Global hunger Louise Fresco, one of the world’s leading food scientists and president of Wageningen University, has been thinking about how to feed the world since she was 15 years old. In 1967, the budding scientist saw photographs of a famine in Biafra, Nigeria, and awakened to the urgency of global hunger. The images set Fresco off on journeys to Papua New Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she witnessed scarcity first-hand – in her book, Hamburgers in Paradise, she recalls eating roasted palm beetles and python in tomato sauce on these trips to poverty-stricken countries. “I contemplated how little was available to the world’s population,” she writes. Fresco was born in the aftermath of one of the most traumatic chapters in modern Dutch history, a manmade famine known as the Hunger Winter during the second world war in which about 20,000 Dutch people starved to death in a few months, as wartime rations in some regions fell to 500 calories per day. The echo of this event, encapsulated in the postwar slogan: “hunger – never again”, reverberates through my conversation with Fresco, and through many conversations I have at Wageningen. “I always felt that the coincidence of birth should be translated into some kind of a moral responsibility,” Fresco says in an interview at her office. “There was a great sense that something had to be done, that there is more than just going about your own life and being rich and happy.” The Dutch obsession with agricultural surplus is at the heart of the story of Europe. In the years after the war, the Netherlands’ agriculture minister Sicco Mansholt piloted large-scale mechanised farming. Mansholt wanted to secure the country’s food supply by increasing production. Heavy machinery, chemical fertilisers, and new research and technology were part of a modernising mission that Mansholt later evangelised across the continent as the first European commissioner for agriculture through the common agricultural policy. He sought to build a postwar Europe of plenty while lifting small farmers out of poverty and integrating Europe’s economies. But by the 1980s, CAP’s guaranteed minimum prices for farmers led to production overdrive, environmental devastation and obscene amounts of waste: Europe was paying millions to store hoards of unwanted meat, undrinkable “wine lakes” and mountains of grain and butter. Agriculture was devouring nearly 70% of the EU budget, disproportionately rewarding the biggest, most efficient producers. European popstars advanced the rhetoric of their leaders, singing “feed the world, let them know it’s Christmas” while their countries used export subsidies to dump surpluses on world markets at knockdown prices. Public opinion turned against Europe’s state-sponsored excesses, in favour of efficiency-driven American capitalism. Wageningen was suffering an existential crisis. “There was a questioning (sic) of – should we take responsibility, shouldn’t the market do things?” said Fresco, who at the time was a rising star at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and would have been aware of the waste mountains and the first international conversations about sustainability. Wageningen’s establishment turned to the giants of industry to keep the university afloat. Walking around Wageningen with Fresco, I am struck at how the town has compartmentalised the angst and suffering of the war in a small museum in its cobbled old quarter. The futuristic Wageningen next door is unsentimental and solution-focused. Its glossy, modernist buildings architecturally distance the lingering emotion of Europe’s history, and invite in only reason and logic. Big money propels Wageningen’s new swagger. Sleek corporate buildings of companies such as Unilever and Dutch dairy giant FrieslandCampina blend seamlessly into the campus architecture and the old university town has rebranded as “Food Valley” – a shiny agri-tech mecca with one big goal: shaping the future of food. This mission-driven Wageningen is providing dazzling solutions to humanity’s impending food supply problem. As an example, one of the university’s star scientists Leo Marcellis is pioneering new vertical farming techniques as a possible solution to producing more food without using more land. Marcellis grows plants in tiered shelves inside highly monitored labs. The potential of this innovation is immense, he says, conjuring skyscrapers of herbs and abandoned buildings stacked with vegetable farms. But there is a small-print environmental cost attached, Marcellis admits. His vertical farms require huge inputs of artificial light, and are partially funded by Philips, the lightbulb manufacturer. Marcellis’ land-saving vertical farms, it emerges, will require quite a lot of lightbulbs. The close relationship between Wageningen scientists and industry makes many people uncomfortable. Dutch investigative journalist Vincent Harmsen from One World magazine recently went to court asking Wageningen to release information about scientists’ communications with Syngenta, Monsanto and Bayer, large agrochemical firms. The university denied his freedom of information request, and a court upheld the university’s right to do so, on the grounds that Wageningen University’s funding is partially private. But without understanding the relationships between scientists and companies, Harmsen argues, it is impossible to discern scientific fact from company-sponsored fiction. This proximity between science and industry goes all the way to the top of the Wageningen pyramid. Fresco is a paid non-executive director of the multinational Syngenta. She previously held positions at Unilever and Dutch financial firm Rabobank. She argues that collaboration between private companies and science is necessary, and can be positive. Her role at Syngenta, she says, involves advising the company about sustainability. “Syngenta is not influencing Wageningen. It is contracting me, who tries to bring some good ideas to Syngenta. We work with all kinds of industry because we fundamentally believe that these big companies have such an influence in the world that they need to be helped to formulate sustainable products and ideas.” Forest farming Meanwhile, on an abandoned apple orchard in Wageningen, a handful of students are planting a forest. In it, they will grow pumpkins, walnuts and berries. The aim is to demonstrate that small-scale farming is viable and more environmentally friendly than industrial mega-farms. “Louise Fresco still thinks quite a lot in terms of ‘we have to feed the world’,” says Louise Vercruysse, one of the students planting the farm. “I’m not really into that. You have to first look at why the world can’t feed itself.” The young Wageningeners believe that profit-seeking industrial farming has driven the planet to the edge of crisis. The Netherlands’ fantastical food production messaging has hidden modern agriculture’s assault on the environment for years, says Vercryusse. Dutch bees and butterflies are vanishing at astonishing speed, while Dutch children are suffering from pollution-induced asthma at rates higher than any country on the continent. Nitrogen levels, caused in part by hyperproductive Dutch dairy farms, when mapped from space resemble a wound over the country. To combat emissions, in 2019 Dutch courts delayed 18,000 construction projects and cut the national speed limit. The activist students say Wageningen’s curriculum is still prioritising industry over the environment. To introduce new ideas to her peers, student Eva van Dijk, organises lunchtime lectures by Wouter van Eck and champions forest farming – where food is foraged or cultivated in ecologically diverse forest ecosystems. Far from feeding the world – Van Eck tells the students, European colonisers destroyed the world’s indigenous food production systems. Eighteenth-century Europeans did not recognise the indigenous plants of the Americas, seeing instead only timber forests that needed felling. Now, he says, Europe is trying to export its broken agriculture system to solve a hunger crisis it created. Van Eck argues that the calculations used to bump the Netherlands up in the export rankings are misleading. They are based on the monetary value of exports rather than the quantity or nutritional value of the produce. The Dutch dairy industry, for example, buys huge amounts of fodder from Brazil, using up farmland that could be used to grow food for Brazil’s native population. To Van Eck, the idea that the Netherlands’ surpluses feed the world, is a hollow and dangerous lie. “The Netherlands is a black hole for food production,” he says. “Wageningen is not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.” Van Eck gets a rockstar reception from the auditorium full of students attending the lecture. A number of them surround him at the end to examine the baskets of forest-grown fruit and herbs he has brought along and ask him if they can organise internships at his forest farm. Activist students at Wageningen organise underground seed exchanges, encouraging farmers to bypass the highly regulated, industry-dominated seed market. Some organise events where they throw seed “bombs” into parks and fields to break the monotony of the Netherlands’ controlled green spaces. The students believe the rational response to ecological crisis is to produce and consume less, even if it causes an economic backslide. This idea is catching fire around the world. Economists like Giorgos Kallis who champion “degrowth”, say western economies have achieved an optimal state, and should stop chasing GDP-driven yearly growth and focus instead on limiting environmental damage. At last year’s UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Greta Thunberg rebuked world leaders for continuing to pursue economic rather than ecological goals. “You are failing us,” she said. The young Wageningeners are aware that they will live through an era of environmental calamity that will shape their entire lives. Their university years lack outward signs of frivolous indulgence and instead are characterised by astounding personal choices. At Droevendaal, an ecological complex near the university, Van Dijk tells me the students bulk order organic produce like cereal and rice and share it between houses to keep costs low. Their primary mode of transport is cycling. They spend their spare time cultivating vegetable patches in their gardens and eat omelettes made from fresh eggs from chickens roaming the area. Solar panels provide their energy. Unwanted clothes, books and scrap are traded in a shed called the “Giveawayshop” to minimise waste. The students’ ideas, though, are untested. Van Eck admits in his lecture that his technique of farming is still a pilot project, and that he is not advocating for all farmers to turn their fields into forests. Scientists have raised questions about other alternative farming methods in the past. Many argue, for example, that some organic fertilisers and pesticides, though natural, can be harmful to the environment. Plus, lower yields on organic farms could mean having to use more land – which could lead to further deforestation. Disrupting food supply chains runs huge socio-economic risks, threatening millions of livelihoods around the world. In February, thousands of farmers in angry tractor convoys protested at The Hague, where parliament sits, fearing that debates about the environmental impact of Dutch agriculture could wipe out their businesses. On the apple orchard, the students agree that their experiments are only a starting point for the questions facing humanity. “I am still figuring out what I think the ideal path is,” said one, as I was leaving. “One thing is clear. The system we have now is not going to feed the planet without completely destroying the Earth.” • This article was amended on 10 March 2020.

    "transcript": "There will be women proposing to men, teenagers celebrating their fourth birthday and no shortage of people tying the knot. Yes, 2020 is a leap year, which means we all get an extra day, and this year, for the first time in almost 30 years, 29 February falls on a Saturday. People born on 29 February will be able to celebrate their birthdays on the right day for the first time in four years. Being a “leaper” or “leapling” makes some feel special, but others are peeved about logistical pitfalls such as with driving licences or passports expiring on days that don’t exist. We asked Guardian readers to tell us what they plan to do with the first Saturday leap day since 1992, when John Major was prime minister, Nirvana were in the charts and Donald Trump was just an unremarkable real estate scion with a penchant for parties attended by Jeffrey Epstein. A decent proposal An Irish tradition encourages women to propose on a leap day, and some make use of this opportunity. “I’m planning on proposing to my boyfriend,” said Claire*. “This comes from a longstanding joke that whoever proposes first takes the other’s surname. The ring has now been engraved with the date, so there’s no turning back, and I don’t think he thinks I would ever seriously go through with it.” Ellie*, 53, said: “I’m proposing to my man, but as we are not jewellery types I put together a two-day trip to Edinburgh this summer as his ‘engagement ring’. We’ve been together since 2009. On the 29th I’ll get down on one knee and present a ‘Clash of the Titans’ card which I’ve had printed with an itinerary for our trip.” Leaper birthday bonanzas Many a missed birthday will be made up for on 29 February as leaplings celebrate a milestone they get to hit only once every four years. A positive side-effect of leaperdom is the slower ageing: it’s common for leapers to insist their age changes only in a leap year. Amie, 35, from Norwich, said: “I’m going to be nine, the same as my daughter this year.” Lucy Armfield, 42, from Southwick, West Sussex, will be throwing her son a party. “Arthur is turning eight – his second ‘proper’ birthday – so we are surprising him by taking him and his brother to see the School of Rock musical. We decided when he was born we would always have extra celebrations on a leap birthday. On the other years we talk about his birthday ‘hiding, being secret and special’. I think it makes him feel special.” Bethan West, 39, from Fife, is adamant she will celebrate her 10th birthday rather than her 40th come Leap Day. “This is my big birthday as I will be turning 10 years old,” she said. “I have always had fantastic age-appropriate birthdays – my last was the ninth, which, had I not been born on a leap day, would have been in 1989, so my party was Little Mermaid- and Baywatch-themed.” As she awaits the jubilee party extravaganza organised by her family, she bemoans the difference in treatment for leapers in Britain and the US. “In the US leapers get treated fantastically with free food, drinks and discounts in hotels and attractions,” Bethan said. “It’s always been a UK leaper mission to be recognised properly, which we still haven’t achieved.” ‘We’re divorced now’ Alas, leap days do not always end happily ever after. “I’m a leapling,” Rachel* told us. “Every leap year day is special for me, however there was a disastrous one. Eight years ago my then husband woke me with a cuppa and lots of little parcels of party poppers, squirt string, party hats and flags. Oh how wonderful, I thought, there’s going to be a surprise party. I waited all day, excited. “But no, these were my presents. I’ve never felt so deflated. He thought they were celebratory – well, not without other people they’re not. He just didn’t get why I was pissed off. We’re divorced now.” Leaping into action For some, the bonus day is a chance to take some purposeful action. Caroline Hanks, 59, from Herefordshire, has decided to roll up her sleeves on the day she normally wouldn’t have. “We are spending Leap Day 2020 finding out about how to manage grassland and livestock as part of the solution to the climate emergency,” she said. “It’s all about healthy soils and the role of herb-rich grassland, wildflower meadows and livestock in regenerating healthy ecosystems in our wider landscape. “We are also discussing how to make sure we only plant the right trees in the right places to avoid damaging existing wildlife habitats and considering if natural regeneration of woodland has a role, too. Twenty-four hours won’t be long enough, but it’s a start.” John Dunn, 62, retired and living in Bath, will join hundreds of thousands of runners and walkers at parkruns worldwide for the first opportunity to run the event on a leap day. “At my age it will be my first and last opportunity to do so. I will be running at the Bath Skyline parkrun.” For Nelli Gronroos Steer, 35, a social media specialist from London, and her husband, Leap Day 2020 will mark the start of a new life. “We’re moving out of the UK on Leap Day. We’re leaping away, in sustainable fashion: we are taking ferries and trains all the way to Helsinki, Finland, where we’ve decided to move to, mainly because of Brexit.” Leap-a-versaries Ben Matthews, 48, from Swansea, will have his first “proper” wedding anniversary on Leap Day 2020. “We will be spending the day in north Wales riding the fastest zipline in the world,” he said. “For our anniversaries in the in-between years, rather than ‘getting away with not celebrating’, which many male friends congratulated me on, we decided that we’d celebrate our anniversary whenever we wanted on the gap years and commit to making the official anniversaries special.” Jane*, 64, from California, is celebrating her seventh – or 28th – wedding anniversary. “We got married on 29 February 1992. There were six other weddings that day, and we all had cheesecake wedding cakes.” *(Some names have been changed.)",

    "transcript": "Drivers in Coventry could be paid up to £3,000 a year in transport vouchers to ditch their cars under a UK-first scheme. The Transport for the West Midlands (TfWM) pilot project is designed to ease traffic congestion and improve air quality in the city. Those who scrap their cars will receive between £1,500 and £3,000 worth of mobility credits to spend using a smartphone app or Swift travel card, on public transport, taxis, bike shares or a car club. The offer is part of the West Midlands Combined Authority £1m scheme which will be trialled in Coventry next year, and could be rolled out across the region if successful. Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor, said: “Instead of asking people to trade in their old car for a new one, we are offering them credits to try something new – such as join a car-share scheme or take the bus or train. “Not only will people be saving money on the cost of running and maintaining their cars, but they will also help the region ease traffic congestion and improve air quality in the fight against climate change.” The trial has been funded by a £22m grant given to the region by the Department for Transport to develop and test new transport technology and schemes. Motorists who are willing to give up their cars will be able to apply for the trial scheme later in the year. Jim O’Boyle, Coventry city council’s cabinet member for jobs and regeneration, said: “This is a great idea which provides incentives to motorists. The key now is to work up the scheme in a way that benefits people who may be dependent on using a vehicle as part of their daily responsibilities. It’s about encouraging change without imposing it.”",

    "date": "2020-02-26",
    "transcript": "In a crowded prison courtyard in Suleja, Nigeria, a judge flipped through a battered folder detailing the case against a young woman who stood quietly before him in a faded pink dress. She was charged with “issuing a dud cheque”, a crime that carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. But she’d already spent three years in prison awaiting the outcome of her trial. The judge, Justice Ishaq Usman Bello, sat at a long table surrounded by fellow judges and prison officials. From an awning hung a framed poster of Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper and a broken clock. Inmates crowded in the cellblocks either side of the courtyard to watch the proceedings, their arms hanging through the bars. After several minutes of hushed discussion at the high table, Justice Bello leaned toward the microphone and spoke. “In light of the duration of detention exceeding the maximum penalty for the alleged crime, I hereby discharge you from this prison. You are free to go.” The woman, who’d been stoical before the pronouncement, collapsed to the ground and began to sob. She thanked God and the judge in equal measure, and the inmates watching from their cells erupted into cheers. By the end of the day, 13 other inmates had been released. Four had been in prison on remand longer than the maximum sentence for their alleged crime. The others had been imprisoned for failing to pay tiny fines for minor offences. They were just the latest beneficiaries of a mission to deal with Kafkaesque failures in Nigeria’s justice system. In 2016, Justice Bello began visiting prisons in his own jurisdiction, and the following year a presidential committee on prison reform and decongestion was established, which is led by Justice Bello and funded by the federal attorney general. The judge has visited 36 prisons and ordered the release of 3,822 inmates – about 5% of the Nigerian prison population. “It is part of my statutory responsibilities as chief judge to visit the prisons and address some challenges,” Justice Bello said. “One of them is congestion, others are when [defendants] stay in prison without going to court. There are many lapses that need to be addressed, so it has been my tradition as head of court to do that.” Spending longer awaiting trial than the maximum sentence for the crime violates the most basic legal protections guaranteed to Nigerian citizens, not to mention one of the few principles of international law that can be considered truly universal – habeas corpus. Chukwudi, whose second name is being withheld because his trial is ongoing, spent nearly five years incarcerated before being released on bail in 2016. In 2012, Chukwudi was driving from the capital city, Abuja, to visit his family in south-eastern Nigeria when he was pulled over by officers from the Special Armed Robbery Squad (Sars). He was arrested and accused, though not formally charged, with purchasing a stolen vehicle. He denies the allegation. Chukwudi was taken to Sars headquarters in Abuja. It was almost a year before he was brought before a court to be formally charged. The first time he appears on official records is 5 March 2014, when he was sent to a medium security prison near the capital to wait for his trial. “I was happy when I was brought to court because the pain of Sars is too much”, he told me. “In Sars, you are relieved only by the mercies of God. I saw people die. It was survival of the fittest.” Neither Chukwudi nor his family could recall the precise date he was arrested. Sars did not respond to requests for comment. Chukwudi hoped that once he was finally brought to court, his ordeal would soon be over. “But it happens not to be like that,” he told me. “You discover that a whole lot of systems are involved.” Like tens of thousands of Nigerians, Chukwudi was denied bail because he was unable to provide a guarantor. Despite Nigerians’ constitutional right to bail, many judges fear defendants may disappear if released, and believe that “remanding” defendants in prison serves the greater cause of justice. Countless visits to court resulted in Chukwudi’s case being adjourned, sometimes before it had even begun, forcing him back to prison while he waited for a new date. “Most times you feel like crying,” he told the Guardian. “You know you are returning to where you are coming from. Every time you go to court you must have prayed a lot, and every prayer is backed up with hope. You will tell your people: ‘Today I am leaving.’ Only for you to go to court to find the judge didn’t sit. Only for you to go to court and they brought you too late, the court has finished sitting. Only for you to go to court and find that your prosecution council is not there. So the aim of going to court is wasted, and they have their cases adjourned for another day.” By the time he was finally granted bail in November 2016, Chukwudi’s father was dead, his job and home lost, and friends and family distanced from him. “Normally if you come out of prison it should feel good. One experiences another freedom. But in Nigeria that is where another problem starts for you,” Chukwudi said. “Anybody who comes to know that you have been in prison doesn’t want to relate with you. Even your own family members. The way they are seeing it, the name of the family has been put to shame because you went to prison. When I came out, I learned that nobody wanted to see me.” These days he is the pastor of a church known as the Transformation Ministry that supports former inmates returning to civilian life. Eight ex-prisoners are currently benefiting from free basic accommodation. “I just fixed two with laundry jobs, and am working on computer training for the others,” he said. “It’s my way of giving back.” Remand inmates make up about 69% of Nigeria’s prison population. While this is not high compared to many western countries, the length of time they spend awaiting trial is. In prisons where this data is available, most defendants have been on remand for between one and four years, some for more than a decade. “In Rivers State, 14 people were awaiting trial for 15 years. Not one day were they taken to court,” Justice Bello told the Guardian, shaking his head. “We had to release them.” Because there is no systematic way to monitor cases, defendants may simply be forgotten in prison. Data collected by the legal aid organisation, Network of University Legal Aid Institutions, shows that there are more than 160 cases where defendants have not been assigned a date for their next trial. “Some of them last attended court in 2017,” the network’s Charissa Kabir told me. Another factor that exacerbates crowding is the practice of imprisoning convicts unable to pay small fines for minor offences. Research by Prawa, a Nigerian security, justice and development NGO, found that up to 80% of inmates were living on less than $130 per month prior to arrest. Income lost during remand combined with legal expenses often leave convicts deep in debt and unable to pay, meaning many serve between six and 12 months in prison instead. Up to 90% of inmates the presidential committee has released fall into this category. “Fines are paid by the government, and sometimes Nigerian NGOs”, said the committee secretary, Leticia Ayoola-Daniels. Numerous cases reflect extreme poverty. “We found a scenario where a pregnant woman was said to have stolen cassava, and she was there awaiting trial for almost four years,” said Justice Bello. “It’s lamentable.” Shortly after arriving in prison, the woman miscarried. He worries about the damage prisons inflicted on defendants behind bars. “To be in prison is a very dangerous thing. Some of them have attained some level of mental deterioration because of the horrendous nature of the environment they live in,” he said. The judge seems to be trying to activate the justice system by shaking its conscience rather than by devising a new judgment – the usual tactic for activist judges. He invites officials who have unresolved cases to prison to face defendants, and account for what went wrong. By admonishing lax lawyers and judges he turns turns lapses which previously went unnoticed into a source of personal and professional shame. “The visits do try to restore fairness, in the sense that they acknowledge that lapses in the administration of justice have resulted in the loss of freedom,” said Melissa Omene, a lawyer who has worked across government and civil society justice reform efforts. “Addressing a practitioner’s failure to carry out his duty requires more than simply calling on him to do so. Did he fail to act due to a lack of interest or resources? Did he fail to act for political reasons, or fear? Each of these will require a different reform strategy.” Justice officials need to be able to see into their own systems in order to detect and manage problems. To do that, they need better data. A quieter but potentially transformative piece of the committee’s work is the rollout of a federal prison (now corrections) information management system (Cims) as part of its wider efforts to establish a national criminal justice database. Cims has been partially implementing in 16 states, but only one prison is making full use of the platform. It features an early warning system that alerts the attorney general if an inmate stays on remand beyond 90 days, and allows officials to identify and hold to account officials and departments that cause unreasonable delays. If well managed, Cims could regulate some of the chaos that currently governs the lives of inmates. At the very least, digital records will make it harder for them to officially disappear. But it’s is only part of the solution. If not backed by political clout and people able to use the data, Cims risks remaining a technical solution to a political problem. Nigeria’s justice system has been the subject of numerous reform efforts over the past two decades. Committees have been formed, new laws passed, presidents come and go, and people like Chukwudi continue to lose years of their lives to a system that cannot or fails to detect those who fall through its cracks. Despite Chukwudi’s ordeal and everything he’s lost, when he compares himself with other former inmates, he still considers himself one of the lucky ones. Every Sunday morning his congregation files into the little church he has coaxed to life. The room fills with people, music and choruses of prayer, and it makes him feel a part of something holy.

    "transcript": "Sci-fi aside, how long will I live? Living to 100 will soon become a routine fact of (long) life. Life expectancies have been rising by up to three months a year since 1840 and although gains in the UK began to slow in 2011, it is still estimated that more than half the babies born in wealthier countries since 2000 may reach their 100th birthdays. It is an impressive increase: in the early 1900s, the probability of a baby reaching 100 was 1%. A newborn in the UK today has a 50% chance of living to 105. There were 3,600 centenarians in 1986. Today there are some 15,000. You do not have to be a newborn to benefit from this trend of increased longevity, though. A 60-year-old in the west today has an even chance of living to 90 and a 40-year-old can expect to live to 95. But the longevity boost is not done yet: it is generally agreed that the natural ceiling to human life is somewhere around 115. Others say that even without cutting-edge AI or other technological wizardry, we could live far longer. Opinion broadly divides into three groups: the “levellers” who say we are at peak lifespan now. The “extrapolators” who argue that technology and education have made their biggest leaps but can squeak us up to a ceiling of 120 before levelling off for good. And the “accelerators” – those determined to defeat ageing, who believe we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in scientific and technological research that will increase longevity, pushing us into the realms of immortality. Why are we living so much longer? Life expectancy has been increasing since we cracked infant mortality in the 19th century. Economy, technology, healthcare and education have all combined with vaccines, safer childbirth and medical advances in the care of stroke and heart attack patients to keep the relentless pace of increasing longevity going strong. But the growth in life expectancy began to slow in 2011 in the UK and people live longer in more than two dozen other countries. There has not been a big medical or health gamechanger in the past couple of decades. While some argue that we should celebrate the longest lifespans that humans have ever attained, others warn that illness and infirmity risk turning long lives into slow, miserable declines. How to avoid this? How can I stay healthy for longer? In his essay on ageing, De Senectute, Cicero says there are four reasons why people write off old age: it stops you working, it makes your body weak, it denies you pleasure and every day is one step closer to death. Then he shows why each argument is wrong. “The old retain their wits quite well,” he notes, “so long as they exercise them”. Dan Buettner coined the term “blue zones” for five regions he identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others (they are Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica, Loma Linda in California and Ikaria in Greece). The diets of those living in these regions, he discovered, consist almost entirely of minimally processed plant-based foods – mostly wholegrains, greens, nuts, tubers and beans. Meat is eaten, on average, five times a month. They drink mostly water, herbal teas, coffee and some wine. They drink little or no cow’s milk. Other scientists have added different ideas to the mix. Sufficient sleep and a sense of purpose are important but exercise is key – at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week, plus twice-weekly muscle-strengthening sessions, to reap health and longevity benefits. Having said that, short bouts of light physical activity, such as walking and cleaning, have been shown to increase the lifespans of older people. And a study published last January found that simply moving instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day could reduce the risk of early death by 17%. Some research suggests that club sports such as tennis and soccer are best for longevity because they also encourage social interaction, another vital ingredient to longevity. What other ideas are there for prolonging healthy life? At conferences on longevity, it is immediately obvious during the morning breaks that the buffets remain largely untouched – and that everyone drinks their tea and coffee inky black, disdaining even a drop of milk. Most serious seekers of longevity also practice both calorific fasting and intermittent fasting. In a nutshell, the approach is to eat 30% fewer calories and fast for 16 hours a day, though this may not be appropriate for certain vulnerable groups. In essence, it means skipping breakfast and not making up for the missed meal during the day. No one knows quite why intermittent fasting works. The best guess is that it has something to do with metabolic switching and cellular stress resistance causing the body to increase production of antioxidants. Repeated studies on mice going back a century seem to prove that it works – on rodents, at least. Last December, the New England Journal of Medicine reviewed all the studies in this area and concluded that a combination of fasting and calorific reduction does slow ageing, extend lifespan and counteract age-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and stroke. “Animal models show that intermittent fasting improves health throughout the lifespan,” the paper concluded. The problem with gauging its efficacy on humans is that, as the paper said: “It remains to be determined whether people can maintain intermittent fasting for years and potentially accrue the benefits seen in animal models.” Are there any anti-ageing drugs in the pipeline? US scientists are raising funds to launch a five-year clinical trial of a product called metformin, commonly prescribed for pre-diabetics and diabetics. Longevity advocates believe it may have a side effect slowing the development of age-related diseases. “I’m not telling everyone to go out and take it until our clinical trial proves it does what I believe it does,” said Dr Nir Barzilai, the director of the Institute for Ageing at New York’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “But if our trials come back with the results I expect then, yes, I believe everyone should take this drug.” Even more niche are the the promises of Dr Aubrey de Gray, a gerontologist who founded the Sens (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) Research Foundation with the goal of “undoing ageing”. “Sens is defined by a focus on repairing molecular and cellular damage rather than on merely slowing down its accumulation,” he said. The logistics of indefinitely healthy ageing will, he believes, be simple and affordable: “Mostly it’ll be injections once a decade.” Can I tell how long I’m going to live? The latest epigenetic clock, DNAm PhenoAge, will shortly hit the shelves. Epigenetic clocks – a form of molecular augury – were first developed in 2011 and claim to offer a glimpse into the future. By analysing the pattern of chemical chains that attach to the DNA in your cells, these clocks apparently reveal how swiftly you are ageing – and perhaps even how much longer you will live. The big sell with these tests is that while DNA is fixed at birth, our epigenetic patterns change according to our lifestyles. The promise of those who produce these clocks for commercial use is that they enable us to calibrate our ageing. The tests haven’t been independently evaluated and do not need to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration but that has not stopped some life insurance companies using the tests to predict lifespans. Researchers have jumped on board, too, using the clocks to test anti-ageing drugs and to look for an anti-ageing diet. Can I live for ever? Talk of immortality was “outlaw science” until a couple of decades ago but now it is attracting serious interest and big bucks: in 2013, Google invested $1.5bn (£1.1bn) in an entire division, Calico, which is devoted to “solving death”. The PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has given millions of dollars to De Grey’s foundation. Instead of focusing on why, say, we get cancer or have a stroke and how to treat each distinct condition, this branch of medical research argues for all these conditions to be regarded as symptoms of one far larger and deadly disease: ageing itself. Instead of trying to treat all these different diseases that develop as people age, the argument goes, we should be trying to treat that one big disease. If we can do that, all the so-called age-related conditions that currently harm so many and cost so much will be – by definition – eradicated. No one is saying it is going to be easy. This branch of research attempts to tackle ageing inside every cell of the body. In other words, change the whole genetic makeup of the human species. There are plenty of claims that we can already slow down the ageing of cells – or senescence – but the most radical adherents claim that the first person to live to 1,000 has already been born.

    "date": "2020-02-20",
    "transcript": "The G20 needs to move beyond economic growth and GDP as a measure of progress and factor in human wellbeing and social prosperity, one of its key advisors has said in a new report. In a hard-hitting report due to be submitted to the G20 group of leading developed and developing countries, experts said that issues including the climate emergency and mental health meant judging progress required a different yardstick of success. Against a backdrop of heightened political unrest in several major western nations despite continued growth in economic prosperity, Dennis Snower, president of the Global Solutions Initiative, a thinktank with links to the group of rich nations, said they should adopt a “recoupling dashboard” to assess wellbeing and environment alongside GDP. The report, shared exclusively with the Guardian, Die Zeit and Der Tagesspiegel, said there was an urgent need for all nations to use the dashboard to dramatically increase their focus on social prosperity, as a key tool in the fightback against growing political extremism across advanced economies. In an interview with the Guardian to mark the launch of the report, Snower said: “The financial crisis of 2008 made all these issues much more salient. Lots of people are now saying ‘I’m sorry but this system sucks’. “In addition to being materially prosperous, we need empowerment and agency – that is the ability to shape our destiny through our own efforts – and we need solidarity – that is we need to be embedded within our social circles.” In a proposal floated ahead of the G20 summit in Saudi Arabia later this year, the dashboard would include four separate measurements of economic and social prosperity: GDP per capita and environmental performance, as well as two new indexes assessing the “solidarity” and “empowerment” of citizens. All four dimensions would need to be in harmony to show a country was adequately serving the needs of its citizens, according to the proposals drawn up by Snower and Katharina Lima de Miranda, an academic at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The empowerment and solidarity indexes are drawn from existing major surveys of wellbeing compiled by the UN, World Bank and OECD, including assessments of job security, education levels, life expectancy, charitable activity, trust in strangers and confidence in government. Under the new dashboard, New Zealand, Finland and Iceland are among the most progressive nations on earth, while the US dramatically underperforms its level of GDP per head. India, China and Mexico rank among the worst performers on the dashboard of 35 nations. The report said that, over the past decade, the dashboard shows the empowerment of citizens and GDP levels in the UK have increased yet social solidarity has fallen, suggesting that the country has become more “neoliberal”. Although the plan could face resistance from some G20 nations and there is no guarantee the dashboard will ultimately be adopted, Snower said the proposal was the first stage in a drive to get countries to look beyond GDP as a signal of success. In the last four decades, globalisation and technological advances have generated significant growth in GDP, but have been accompanied by rising inequality, global heating and a sense of disempowerment among various groups. Several countries around the world are staging attempts to move beyond GDP and focus instead on the wellbeing of citizens. Last year, New Zealand’s Labour coalition government unveiled what it said was a “world-first” wellbeing budget, raising its spending on mental health services and tackling child poverty. Snower said that had nations monitored the wellbeing of citizens as much as GDP they would have had earlier warning signs about the fragmentation of society and rise of populist politics. He added: “Globalisation has costs that we’ve been blind to, and solidarity and empowerment have suffered.”",

    "date": "2020-02-17",
    "transcript": "Freshwater insects, mosses and lichens are bucking the trend of wildlife losses in the UK and have expanded their ranges since 1970, according to a new study. Reductions in air and water pollution are the most likely reason. Scientists say their new analysis shows that amid big declines in wildlife, action can help to reverse the trend for some species. The work analysed millions of sightings of 5,000 different invertebrate species by volunteers over 45 years. The research also found that the average range of insects had increased over that time. This finding does not conflict with other reports of serious declines in insect populations, the scientists said. The new analysis considered only whether a species was present or absent from a site, while the other studies measured falls in abundance and, for example, a population could fall by 90% and still occupy the same range. The scientists also said much wildlife had already been lost by 1970, which means that date is a low baseline. The pressures on invertebrate life, as well as better studied mammals and birds, include destruction of natural habitats, pollution and pesticides and, increasingly, the impacts of the climate crisis. “By looking at long-term trends in the distribution of understudied species, we found evidence of concerning declines but we also found that it’s not all bad news,” said Charlie Outhwaite at University College London, who led the new research. The areas in which freshwater insects, such as mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies, were found plunged by 47% from 1970 to 1994, but have expanded strongly since and were 7% higher in 2015 than 50 years ago. “That coincides with the implementation of the [EU] urban wastewater treatment directive”, which significantly cleaned up rivers, Outhwaite said. Mosses and lichens have expanded their average range by 36% since 1970, the study found. “Mosses and lichens are very sensitive to air quality and it seems like they have been improving” since the Clean Air Act in 1956, she said. The 3,000 species of terrestrial insects analysed experienced a slight increase of 5% in their range since 1970. But Outhwaite said: “We just looked at range and not the number of individuals. So it’s very possible that there are still huge declines happening in terms of the number of individuals.” “We just don’t have abundance data for [most invertebrate species], especially at a national scale,” she said. “So we’ve had to do the best we can by looking at their range size. But it’s really important we don’t over-interpret it and think everything’s fine.” The new work, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, also shows that the ranges of many insect groups in the UK have declined since the mid-2000s. Other research has shown big falls in insect populations since that time, which was when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced. “The trends in bees seen in this new study mirror the bee trends found in our 2019 research,” said Gary Powney, at the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, which was not part of the latest work. “The rapid and substantial decline in these pollinators in the late 2000s is a major cause for concern.” Other groups losing range in the new analysis included spiders and freshwater snails and mussels. The molluscs did not recover after 1994, Outhwaite said, “so something else is driving that change, potentially invasive species”. But fungus gnats and weevils showed strong expansion of their ranges. Determining the exact causes of changes is difficult, she said: “It’s challenging because you have multiple threats happening at the same time.” Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new study, said data collected by volunteer recorders had to be treated carefully. “Recorder effort has greatly increased in recent years, along with the publication of new identification books, online guides, recording apps and so on,” he said. “Obviously the more you look, and the more experienced the recorder, the more you will find. The modelling purports to take this into account, but I do not see how.” The relationship between the range and abundance of species is not clear, Goulson said, although they would be expected to track one another. But the new work suggests range could expand for some species while their abundance falls. “All in all, it’s very puzzling,” he said. “This kind of data is very messy in terms of biases, like sampling effort over time,” said Outhwaite. “But the models are designed to try to take those into account, so they don’t influence our trends.” She also paid tribute to the volunteer recorders. “Our study demonstrates the power of citizen science, as anyone can contribute to impactful research. There are over 80 recording schemes in the UK now, so there is definitely something for you if you are interested.”",

    "transcript": "The home delivery model pioneered by milkmen is getting a 21st century makeover as part of the war on plastic. A major new online service backed by the world’s biggest brands will deliver products ranging from soft drinks to washing powder and shampoo in refillable containers to your front door. The Loop, which launches next month, is one of the most ambitious attempts yet to eliminate plastic waste from the weekly shop. It is backed by major consumer goods companies Unilever and PepsiCo, who have created eco-versions of popular brands including Tropicana, Persil and Hellmann’s, to sell via the website. The service will also include products such as refillable Sure and Dove deodorant sticks, and pots of Signal toothpaste pellets, which do away with the need for plastic tubes. The delivery service, which bills itself as the “milkman reimagined” aims to change the way households shop and consume amid growing concern about the global plastic binge. At first shoppers will only be able to buy from the Loop website but a partnership with Tesco aims to put dedicated aisles in its stores later this year. It operates in the same way as other online supermarkets except, when the shopping arrives, the groceries are in durable metal, glass or plastic containers that can be returned and reused. Afterwards the empties, like milk bottles, are collected from the doorstep, cleaned and reused up to 100 times. Supermarkets have already begun to gauge whether shoppers are willing to put in the extra effort required to make refill schemes economical in their stores. Last year Waitrose created dedicated areas in a handful of supermarkets where customers can replenish products ranging from wine and beer to rice and cleaning materials. Sainsbury’s is to sell milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles this year as part of its plastic reduction drive. Tesco is eager to shrink its massive plastic footprint and has announced a series of initiatives – including the recent decision to banish shrink-wrapped multipacks of baked beans and soup from its shelves. Giles Bolton, its responsible sourcing director, thinks re-use schemes could have a big impact. “Loop has the potential to fundamentally change the shopping basket and how customers shop,” he said in a recent blog. There are also signs, spurred on by television programmes such as Blue Planet which exposed the detrimental effect plastic is having on the oceans, that people are trying to live more sustainably. Milk &amp; More, the UK’s biggest doorstep delivery company, said that last year 70,000 new customers signed up to have their milk delivered in reusable glass bottles. Similarly this week Abel &amp; Cole, the organic box delivery firm, said it was rolling out a “club zero” refill scheme, in which store cupboard foods such as lentils and porridge oats are delivered in reusable plastic pots alongside its vegetables and fruit. It said it had been inundated with requests from shoppers to take part in a small trial. Hannah Shipton, its managing director, said: “Club Zero helps anyone looking to cut down on single-use packaging, particularly those without the ability to get to a zero-waste refill shop or those not wanting to jump in the car to get to one.” Services such as the Loop are piggybacking on the growth of online food shopping in UK, where sales are expected to increase by 45% between now and 2024 to create a £16.7bn market, according to IGD, the grocery industry trade body. The online model obviously means people do not need to return their old containers to the supermarket, but Loop customers are required to pay refundable deposits linked to the size of each container. In France, where the Loop service has already started with the Carrefour supermarket chain, the fee starts at €0.01 but rises to €19 for large plastic tubs containing a bundle of nappies, wipes and sanitary towels. The pricing and full details of the Loop’s UK service will not be announced until nearer its 26 March launch date. The product range will be similar to France – where it launched last year with around 200 products – and prices are promised to be “competitive”. Mike Barry, a sustainability expert who spent 14 years at Marks &amp; Spencer latterly as head of its ethical scheme Plan A, is hopeful refill schemes such as the Loop will succeed but says the sheer volume of consumption on the planet presented a huge challenge. Plastic packaging is a £540bn industry and demand is still rising, particularly in Asia. “The new sustainable future has to cope with 7.7 billion people who are consuming trillions of items a year,” Barry explained. “Loop is an exciting alternative to today’s approach to consumption but the big question is can it be scaled quick enough to stop the ocean pollution crisis?” Barry said reuse systems like the Loop represented the “gold standard” but there was also an urgent need to reduce the overall plastic usage, for fewer types of plastic be used (so waste can be recycled more easily) and for low recycling rates to improve.",

    "date": "2020-02-14",
    "transcript": "Reoffending rates have been slashed in a pioneering police scheme in north-east England which experts say could lead to a transformation in how the justice system deals with violent crime. More than 2,660 offenders who have committed offences such as burglary and assault have taken part in an experiment in which they avoid prosecution if they take part in a rehabilitation programme for issues such as mental health and substance abuse. If they complete the four-month contract with police, they walk away without a criminal conviction. If they do not, they are prosecuted in the traditional way. The initiative by Durham constabulary is the longest-running and most advanced of its kind in England, with at least five other forces, including Surrey and Devon &amp; Cornwall, considering the introduction of similar schemes. The first results of the trial, seen by the Guardian, found a 15-percentage point drop in reoffending after two years among those who took part in rehabilitation compared with those who did not. Most of the 519 offenders in the first cohort of the trial had been arrested for violence, theft, drug possession or criminal damage. About half had no previous convictions but others had been arrested as many as 52 times. The results, which are part of a University of Cambridge study to be published in 2022, are the most significant indication to date of the long-term success of “deferred prosecution” programmes in England. The findings will reopen the debate about whether such initiatives represent “soft justice”, as some critics claim, or are successful in reducing crime and cutting costs. The idea has gained traction with senior police leaders and is to be discussed by the National Police Chiefs Council later this month. Jo Farrell, the chief constable of Durham constabulary, said the current criminal justice sanctions were not effective for dealing with low-level offences such as shoplifting, assault or drug possession. “What I’m not saying is where people commit serious offences, they won’t feel the full force of the law,” she said. “This isn’t about trying to do things on the cheap or divert people away from court or prison. It’s a cohort of people for whom this cycle will never end unless we do something different.” Under the Durham programme, called Checkpoint, offenders spend four months with a police supervisor who helps them access support for issues including mental health, to drug or alcohol use, homelessness and communication skills. Of the 2,660 offenders involved in the trial to date, only 166 (6%) have reoffended. The initiative also involves the victim of the crime, consulting them on the progress of the offender’s rehabilitation, although they do not get the final say on whether the offender is prosecuted. Durham police said only five victims had complained out of the 2,660 offenders who had completed the programme. Checkpoint costs the force £480,000 a year but an internal estimate suggests that for every 1,000 offenders it saves at least £2m a year in reduced crime. A similar trial in the West Midlands, which ended in 2014, tracked 414 offenders over two years and found that the amount and severity of reoffending by those on deferred prosecutions was lower, or no worse, than those who were prosecuted. That study, by criminologists at Cambridge, has not yet been published. Prof Lawrence Sherman of the university’s Institute of Criminology said there was mounting evidence against the prosecution of low-level offences such as theft or common assault. “It’s expensive, it rarely results in a formal punishment, victims aren’t satisfied with it. It’s generally a pretty bad way to manage low-level offences which are the highest volume offences,” he said. Sophie Gregory, criminology course director at Birmingham City University, described the Durham findings as significant and said: “We know that around two-thirds of women and a third of men are reportedly committing crime to fund addictions, so if we can go back to that root problem and help with some tailored support long term it has got to help reduce reoffending.” The debate about rehabilitation was reignited by the terrorist attacks in London Bridge in November and Streatham this month, both carried out by men who had been recently released after prison sentences for terrorism offences. Boris Johnson also made “law and order” a key part of his 2019 election campaign, promising among other things to prosecute within a week anyone caught with a knife. But Farrell said such a blanket approach may not always be appropriate. “Within all offences, there’s context. You get bold statements by politicians: ‘Everybody who carries a knife must go to prison.’ Policing is based on discretion – we have a lot of discretion and a lot of autonomy,” she said. “Context is everything and the situation you’re dealing with and their background. Taking a very binary position on things strikes me as a not very intelligent way of dealing with an issue.” Alex Mayes of the charity Victim Support said the one wish of those affected by crime was for the offender to stop offending. He added: “Where evidence shows offender management schemes to be effective at reducing reoffending, many victims of low-level offences may be open to credible and safe programmes. “However, just as in the wider public, justice means different things to different victims of crime. For this reason, where these schemes are used, it is vital that all victims receive explanations as to their use, and that victims’ ongoing feedback is sought in order to inform the process.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/fighting-fire-australia-wildfires-limiting-impact-aoe",
    "date": "2020-02-12",
    "transcript": "Vast waves of fire have torn through Australia in recent months, leaving forests of skinned trees in their wake. The wildfires have been one of the most damaging in the country’s history – more than 11m hectares (27m acres) have burned, killing 33 people and decimating wildlife populations. But they are just the latest in a succession of destructive blazes that have been flaring across the planet – even in the Arctic circle – in the past five years. The response from authorities, in Australia, the Americas and the Mediterranean often seems scrambled and ineffective. So what is to be done? Fire experts point to a host of techniques that can help prevent fires before they have even started. These range from deliberate off-season blazes designed to manage the landscape to using grazing animals to reduce flammable material, as well as requiring people to remove trees and brush that are too close to homes. Much of it draws on how our distant ancestors co-existed with forests and using agroforestry. Good fires The first thing to acknowledge is that firefighting doesn’t work with mega fires and probably never will, says Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. He says pictures of air tankers are just “good PR” for politicians. “We are almost fighting fires as we were 100 years ago except now we have bigger planes. All firefighters can do is protect the path of the fire and evacuate people. You have to wait for rain or wind to stop it.” Rather than being a show of strength, firefighting should be seen as a last resort used only when preventive methods have failed, says Rein. Growing up in Spain, he was told that all fires were bad but after studying them he realised the importance of “good fires”. “If we suppress all fires we are literally stopping life on Earth,” Rein says. “Wildfires were created by nature and they have well-recognised benefits – fire regulates the carbon cycle and has shaped all ecosystems known to man except Antarctica. The number one thing we can do to stop megafires is to create a natural fire regime.” Counterintuitively, this involves burning more fires, using a technique called prescribed burns – intentional off-season fires that burn up leaves and old wood and create breaks in the forest. Indigenous people know this and have been regenerating forests using fire-stick farming for thousands of years, but much of that knowledge has been lost now. Fires made out of season are often referred to as “cold fires”. They do not burn the canopy of trees, which means insects and other animals can take refuge without getting scorched. Many forests are reliant on fire to decompose dead wood and old leaves that otherwise lie on the forest floor. Some “phoenix plants” can only be regenerated by fire – sequoias, for instance, require fire to break open their cones so their seeds can spread. “Our fire management techniques in California are probably similar to those in Canada, Australia and the Mediterranean,” says Garrett Dickman, a biologist who has worked in forest management in Yosemite national park for 11 years. “It’s pretty simple in that you only have a handful of management tools – you’re either using fire, or you can use mechanical means. You can use livestock grazing too, which works pretty well in grass ecosystems.” Fire management strategies vary in different countries – very generally, forests closer to the equator should have more wildfires and those farther away should have fewer. There are obvious exceptions such as the Amazon rainforest, which straddles the equator and should naturally have very few fires (tropical forests are normally too humid to sustain fires for long and their trees are not designed to withstand them). Many US fire-suppression policies were created following devastating wildfires in the summer of 1910 (the “big blowup”) that ravaged large parts of Idaho, Montana and Washington. Forest rangers and ecologists understand the role of fires in shaping forests, but politicians have inherited this 100-year-old aversion to fire. There are signs this is slowly starting to change. In California the amount of land allocated for prescribed burns has doubled between 2013 and 2018. About 19,000 hectares are burnt each year, but experts say that number needs to be far higher. Concerns about smoke pollution and the liability associated if something goes wrong discourage landowners from preemptive action. Following a spate of fires in California between 2017 and 2019, there has been an effort to get rid of the barriers to prescribed burns, including removing liability for landowners and creating education programmes to help people understand their importance, though it is yet to be seen if these policies will be effective. Agroforestry Grazing animals help remove “fuel” from the forest floor and create natural breaks in woodland. Agroforestry systems – grazing animals and/or growing crops in forests – are part of cultural landscapes in Europe that are hundreds of years old. Having more people managing forests meant that small fires were less likely to get out of control. Because of lower population densities in North America and Australia, subsistence farming has had a less marked impact on forests. The slow decline of agroforestry was one of the factors that made the deadly 2017 wildfires in Portugal so destructive. Another issue is that ageing rural landowners – who often live next to forests – are not so active in clearing up brush from around their homes. The country also has large plantations of fast-growing (and flammable) eucalyptus trees grown to supply the country’s significant paper pulp industry, which may have exacerbated the problem. However, small changes are starting to happen – authorities are seeking to reduce eucalyptus cultivation and plant more fire-resistant oak and chestnut trees. Rural properties are now required to clear undergrowth within 50 metres (164 feet) of houses. A four-year study looking at land use in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain found that grazing animals were effective at reducing wildfires. “I get the impression that wildfires would still happen, but agroforestry is a way of minimising them,” says Dr Paul Burgess, a reader in crop ecology and management at the Cranfield Soil and Agrifood Institute, who helped write the study published in Agroforestry Systems. But some are frustrated that these policies aren’t being created faster. Greece, whose islands and coasts have been hit by increasingly ferocious fires, faced tough criticism of its firefighting system after Mati, a resort town east of Athens, was consumed by an inferno that left 103 dead in 2018. Following the tragedy, the European parliament called for tougher policies of prevention to be applied across the continent. “There were lessons to be drawn from Mati, but so far they have not been reflected in political action,” said Elias Tziritis, a forest fire specialist at WWF Greece. “There has to be a lot more emphasis on forest management and prevention of fires, a lot more focus on thinking ahead and not what should happen when a fire actually occurs.” People involved in EU land use policy are starting to recognise the importance of farming and forestry: agroecology and agroforestry have been identified as key sustainable agricultural practices in the European Green Deal, which commits at least 40% of the common agricultural policy budget to climate action. Burgess says: “In terms of agroforestry I think there’s an increasing appetite for integrated land management. In the context of Brexit there are more opportunities for it, too, which will also improve biodiversity, carbon storage, windbreaks and reduce soil erosion. It’s something the government is keen to look at, and I think we’re moving that way.” Marc Castellnou, an incident commander in the Catalan fire service who is also a fire analyst at the University of Lleida, says wildfires are essentially a problem of land management and rural policies. “We’re starting to realise that climate change isn’t just going to affect temperatures and sea levels – it’s also going to change landscapes on a global scale. The land as we have known it is not going to stay the same because the climate is changing. That is going to mean different policies when it comes to water and farming,” he said. Indigenous people knew the art of forest management but much of that knowledge has been lost. Martin Kealy, a chartered fire consultant and managing director of MKA Fire, says: “It’s an art that would have been practised for thousands of years but when the Brits came and took over Australia, that knowledge was lost. The same happened in the US. “These wildfires have been going on for hundreds if not thousands of years. It’s not something new and these fires will continue for hundreds or thousands of years – we just need to manage the land,” he said.

    "title": "Chile's drastic anti-obesity measures cut sugary drink sales by 23%",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/chiles-drastic-anti-obesity-measures-cut-sugary-drink-sales-by-23",
    "date": "2020-02-11",
    "transcript": "The world’s toughest controls over the promotion of sugary drinks, brought in by a nation beset by obesity, have cut purchases by nearly a quarter in two years, research has shown. Instead of a sugar tax, which the UK and other countries have chosen to impose, Chile has banned sales in schools and adopted stark black and white labels aimed at warning and educating families about the health dangers of junk food and drinks for their children. Unlike the UK’s traffic lights, which may award a red label for sugar but also green for fruit content, Chile’s ministry of health labels only deliver the bad news: high in sugar, high in salt or high in fat. Sugary drinks, unhealthy snacks and packaged foods must carry the front-of-pack labels. Chile’s Law of Food Labelling and Advertising, which came into force in 2016, also restricts marketing to children of any such foods or drinks and bans them from sale in schools. When the ban came in, the people of Chile were consuming more sugary drinks per head than any other country in the world, and counting the cost in terms of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other health problems. Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health, publishing in the journal Plos Medicine, have found purchases of sugary drinks dropped by 23.7% during the first phase of the reforms. The largest changes were in the amount of sweetened fruit drinks and sweetened dairy drinks purchased. “This regulation is different because it is the first to require warning labels about excess levels of nutrients of concern, such as sugar or sodium, on the front of food and beverage packages,” said first author Lindsey Smith Taillie, assistant professor of nutrition at the Gillings School. “The regulation includes the world’s strictest limits on how and where food companies can advertise junk food to children. The reductions we observed in sugary drink purchases were markedly greater than those seen following the implementation of standalone policies – such as a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages – elsewhere in Latin America.” The limits on acceptable levels of sugar, salt and fat have steadily dropped as tougher phases of the regulations were brought in. By the end of two years, the allowable amount of sugar in foods with no warning label will drop from 22.5g per 100g to 10g per 100g. Salt will halve from 800mg to 400mg per 100g. “This impact in the first phase is pretty impressive,” said Barry Popkin, professor of nutrition at the Gillings School, who said it was having an effect on families’ understanding of what constitutes a healthy diet. “We did focus groups with low and middle-income mothers and they were saying their kids were coming home and telling them to buy stuff without warning labels. “It is the first intervention we have seen showing potential for changing food norms. I think a lot of countries are going to look at this, because it is so impactful.” Some already are. “What’s amazing about the Chilean regulations is how much they have already influenced international food policy,” said Taillie. “From our work with advocates and policymakers, we know that at least a dozen countries have directly used Chile’s policies and the evaluation results to develop and inform similar policies. “We expect that in five to 10 years, much more of the world will look like Chile with regards to putting clearer labelling systems on food and drink packages to tell people which products are unhealthy and cut through the noise created by food marketing.” Chile is classified as a high-income country by the World Bank, with sophisticated food systems in which retailers exert a lot of control over supply, very much like the UK and Europe. Popkin believes his team’s analysis of their food warning labels will show significant impact on buying habits – unlike the traffic-light labelling in the UK. He thinks there will soon be evidence of positive effects on health but says the policies are aimed at long-term change, adding: “We will see a pretty immediate impact in the next few years on type 2 diabetes, but in overweight it takes time. We will get it in hypertension [high blood pressure] and diabetes but not quickly in weight.” A separate study has shown that the sugary drinks levy in the UK appears to be a success, said researchers in Oxford, Cambridge and London, because many manufacturers had taken enough sugar out of their products to escape it. The analysis, also published in the journal Plos Medicine, shows when George Osborne, the former chancellor, announced plans to introduce the tax, about 52% of eligible soft drinks contained 5g or more sugar per 100ml and were liable for the tax. The levy came into force in April 2018, and by February 2019, only 15% of soft drinks were still liable. “The levy is an important policy as it both reduces the sugar level of many drinks and increases the prices of high sugar drinks, helping the public to make healthier choices. These population approaches are important not only for preventing disease but also for reducing health inequalities,’ said Dr Peter Scarborough, associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford who led the analysis.",

    "transcript": "Holding an Allen key in a grease-stained hand, João Cruz looks every bit the professional bike mechanic. Wind back five years, however, and this 39-year-old former journalist barely knew how to fix a brake cable. “To be a good mechanic, you need tools and knowledge; I had the tools, but I needed to get the knowledge,” said Cruz, owner of Velurb, a small bike rental business in the Portuguese city of Porto. In response, he spent the best part of a year trawling YouTube for tutorials on bicycle maintenance. Even today, he still regularly logs onto the video-sharing website for “tips and tricks” when faced with knotty technical problems. Cruz is not alone. Around the world, a growing cadre of entrepreneurs are turning to video tutorials posted on YouTube to help them learn their chosen trade. Another example is Holly Winter, a copywriter-turned-professional-dressmaker from Farnborough in Hampshire. The self-taught designer and seamstress treats YouTube much like a personal instructor, using it to train up in everything from boning corsets to fixing her sewing machine. “Whenever I encounter something that I haven’t done before or if I need to brush up on some skills, then there is always a YouTube tutorial for it,” she says. As well as the sheer breadth of topics covered on the platform, the fact the information is free and readily available keeps her coming back. The appeal becomes especially clear when compared with the time and expense of traditional, in-person training options, she adds. “It’s only me working the job, so if I have to spend a day or more on a course, then there’s no one else making wedding dresses. I mean, my brides aren’t going to put their weddings on hold for me.” The obvious upside of learning a trade face-to-face is the ability to asks questions in the moment. But what happens once the course is over? The advantage of YouTube, Winter counters, is the ability to post questions and receive responses long after the tutorial has been delivered and uploaded. Chinelo Awa shares this sentiment. Owner of Good Cake Day, a bespoke London-based cake decorating venture, she has found most YouTube experts to be “surprisingly responsive”. Her go-to YouTubers include Matt Adlard (AKA the Topless Baker), Joshua John Russell and Lindsey Ann, all of whom clock up tens of thousands of views for their instructional videos. “If you put a question in the comments, then they usually come back to you … but if you go on a day-course and have follow-up questions, you might not be able to ask the teachers,” says Awa, who works part-time as a paralegal. Of course, not everything on YouTube is quality information – and not all its contributors are diligent at responding. Nor does the video-sharing platform offer the immediacy of interaction that some social media platforms do. Compared to Instagram’s “live” service, for example, which Awa uses to take real-time classes with professional bakers like Yolanda Gampp, YouTube can feel a little static. That said, Awa still rates it as a safe space to perfect her trade: “If someone has thousands of followers on YouTube, it’s easy to think that your questions can be stupid, but my experience is that people are happy to help.” Tai Alegbe agrees. Learning a completely new skillset can feel intimidating, says the co-founder of Contingent, a financial technology start-up. So, the ability to kick off at the beginning and advance at his own pace takes the initial sting out of the learning process. In his case, the challenge at hand was to get up to speed with basic coding. His initial fears were eased after seeing that most of the coders on YouTube weren’t tech geniuses, but “normal people”. As he notes: “Going online and understanding that these experts are just like you really helps”. YouTube, which is owned by Google, likes to promote its service as a practical tool for learning and not just a repository of teen vlogs and funny cat videos. According to the company’s own statistics, nine in 10 users worldwide perceive its platform as a “place to learn”. To drum home the point, it now boasts a dedicated “learning” channel for education-oriented uploads. “YouTube opens us a world of learning that may not be otherwise accessible, whether it is supplemental education, professional and everyday skills or even how-to tutorials and life hacks”, says Katie Kurtz, the company’s head of learning partnerships. Independent research appears to give credence to the claim. Research by the Pew Research Centre found that “how-to” videos are what bring 51% of all US-based YouTube users to the site. Likewise, in New Zealand, 57% of millennials on YouTube see the site as a place to “access knowledge and learn new careers skills”. In Australia, meanwhile, a similar proportion (54%) prefer to watch YouTube if they have a question rather than read a user manual or talk to someone on the phone. Charles Lomu in western Sydney fits that bill. A former high-school dropout, he describes how he used YouTube to commercialise his “side hustle” in barbering: “I was doing haircuts until the early morning, but I never looked at it as a profession because I’d never been to barber school. And then I turned to YouTube.” Today, Lomu, who now runs his own barber shop, is using his skills to teach barbering to disengaged students at the local high school. Predictably, he has loaded up a series of online videos about the course. For young people who have grown up using YouTube to help with their homework or teach themselves how to play the guitar, turning to it to learn a trade marks a natural step. Such was the case for Andy Smith, a 31-year-old economics graduate, who recently founded Reco, an e-commerce service for plastic-free products. Realising he would have to teach himself some rudimentary programming, his immediate instinct was to search online for video tutorials. Learning a trade via YouTube isn’t without its flaws, Smith says. First, there’s the issue of quality control. Secondly, the task-specific nature of many instruction videos can lead to a piecemeal or patchy understanding. Smith’s programming skills, for example, are still by no means “in depth”. That said, he feels he knows enough now to give clear instructions to any future contractors. “Has YouTube made me into a Jack of all trades?” he ponders. “Perhaps. If anything, in fact, it’s probably made me into a Jack of too many trades.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "“The problem with all the great songs,” my son said recently, “is that they are all sad.” “No they aren’t,” I replied. “What about ‘That pretty girl just farted, I think’?” He gave me a withering look. We both knew he was right. This is the uneven geometry of human emotions: the negatives tend to be much more powerful than the positive. Misery always lasts longer – and digs in deeper – than joy. Mistakes linger while triumphs are fleeting. And yes, bad news is more gripping than good. The big question is why. Any thoughts? There is a silver lining: this week we learned that, apparently, pop songs are getting sadder than they used to be. By my son’s reckoning, that must mean music is getting better. Back to the journalism. This week we gave you: • The possibility of far earlier cancer diagnosis. Two-minute read • The quest to save culture from the barbarians of the Levant. One-minute read • The video games where you do almost nothing. 90-second read • Sesame Street comes to refugee camps in the Middle East. Three-minute read And we also invited you to tell us about a local community project that works. Get in touch! Lucky numbers About 44% of new cars sold in Norway in January were electric. A good example for Britain, which set a new goal of 2035 for the discontinuation of new petrol and diesel car sales. India plans to double renewable energy capacity in just two years to 175 GW by 2022. Finland has meanwhile announced plans to give fathers the same parental leave as mothers: 164 days. What we liked Back to music, and a new study that pinpoints why high-tempo tunes are the best tracks to exercise to. We also like the idea of Chaucer in an app … What we heard Peter Ward wrote in from Peru: I’m involved in rural Peru working with secondary students to re-value their intangible cultural traditions using innovative technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. Students first select examples of local intangible culture which are in danger of being lost or reduced to superficial shows for tourists, such as traditional dances and festivals. Then they develop investigative projects using project-based learning around questions such as: “How and why has the tradition changed?” and “Why do people participate?”. Finally, they develop apps to summarise their investigations and share their investigations back to their communities. The project shows the power of using new innovative technologies to promote respect and re-valuing of traditional cultures in a country with poor education outcomes, and where culture is all too often reduced to nothing more than a product to sell to tourists. Sounds remarkable Peter – good luck. Betsey Westendorf, meanwhile, returned to the theme of happiness that we raised a couple of weeks ago: If you define happiness as laughing all day long, then it’s not as important as the items you mentioned. To me those items create happiness. There’s no better sense of physical wellbeing than the day after a bad headache, and discovering a way to help your body not create headaches from tension to consumption is even happier. Accomplishing goals make many of us happy. Feeling safe even when scary things are happening is possible and can be learned. So we have a lot of power over our happiness, and it has little to do with the circumstances Where was the Upside? At the awards for the Green Stories competition, a series of prizes for new writing that incorporates green solutions into novels and drama. Academic research has shown that this kind of storytelling is more likely to inspire green behaviour than catastrophic tales of climate change.

These days Isis is the group fighting for survival. And the Yazidi aretaking steps to ensure that their culture is preserved in perpetuity, whatever happens next in the region. A group are in Britain this week to perform their distinctive choral works and hand over a musical archive to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Audiences with Prince Charles and MPs in parliament will follow later in the week as the culmination of a music project designed to record and protect the Yazidis’ unique art form. But the project, delivered by the Amar foundation as part of a British Council initiative to protect heritage in conflict zones, is about more than just cultural preservation: it is therapy for people who have been through a collective trauma. Many Yazidi still live in camps. “When you are enjoying music with other people, or making it in particular, you have to be absolutely present and forget about the past and the future and that is a healthy way of living,” says Michael Bochmann, a virtuoso violinist and the music principal for the project. Bochmann’s work in the camps celebrates the power of music to bring participants together, “to the here and now”. Music has gradually encouraged young women, in particular, to leave the isolation of their tents and to sing, dance and support one another. Students in five camps are learning to play the tambour, a sacred instrument, and the daf (a kind of drum). “We are nothing without a future and dreams,” says Rainas Elias, 19, who was literally sold down the Euphrates river by Isis, and held captive until her family paid $12,000 for her release. Even then, she had to leave her daughter with Isis. “We hope one day those that committed these heinous crimes against us will be brought to justice,” she says. “We now deserve a decent life outside Iraq. Our home in Shingal is still a battleground and there is no security. We can never live in peace there.” Elias now lives with her father and mother and two younger brothers in a camp for displaced people. “The standard of living is very difficult,” she says, “and my father cannot work because he is sick.” There are few employment opportunities. To this day, Elias has no news about what has happened to her sister, and to her two older brothers, who were 18 and 22 when they were separated. Chief among her hopes is that one day she will hear that they have been “liberated”. Until then, she finds some comfort in the ancient music which is central to the Yazidi life and monotheistic faith. “The project is part of our healing process,” Elias says. “I feel very happy joining the choir with my sisters. It has helped me a lot psychologically, I can process a lot more.” For Emma Nicholson, who as the founder of the AMAR foundation is hosting the tour, music is “a source of life”. Given that the average time people typically spend in a refugee camp is now 11 years, “life for displaced people cannot just be queuing for food,” she says. “Music and culture must be in every camp.”",

    "transcript": "Are you involved in a grassroots community project. If so we want to hear about it. At the dawn of the 2020s, “activism” is an almost omnipresent buzzword.The acute housing shortages, increasing rates of unstable employment, low wages, rising living costs, environmental pollution and government cuts that have defined the last decade may have caused widespread political disenfranchisement and apathy. But a growing number of people are suddenly motivated to use their frustrations and turn them into action. Grassroots community movements come and go, and while some end up petering out before they have achieved the desired outcome, others effect markedly visible change. We are interested to hear more about the movements that worked. Are you or have you been involved in a grassroots activism project that ended up making an impact? It could be a local, regional, national or international movement, a small scale result that was achieved by mobilising the people living on one street, or a larger one, involving thousands of people, communicating online. It could be a group of people fighting for better housing in their community, a safer roundabout, the upkeep of a playground, against the eviction of a business or family, the closure of a beloved pub, club, library or sports centre. Or it could be bigger issues applying to more than one particular place, with people wanting to improve particular aspects of justice, equality, freedom, health, the environment, science, you tell us.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/31/they-survived-fire-and-lead-poisoning-so-what-happened-next-to-notre-dames-bees-aoe",
    "date": "2020-01-31",
    "transcript": "It is a crisp winter morning and the area around Notre Dame is sealed off as it has been since the fire last April that devastated the cathedral. Those in the know, however, especially those with the keenest of eyes, might spot some small movement high up to the south of the stricken and blackened structure. The bees of Notre Dame, whose escape from the inferno seemed almost miraculous, are thriving and conserving their energy ready to produce honey this summer, just as they have every year since they took up residence on the sacristy roof in 2013. Nearly 10 months after the Paris cathedral was ravaged by fire, the three colonies are healthier than ever, according to their beekeeper. Sibyle Moulin, who looks after the hives, spoke to the Guardian after she visited them for the first time in six months. Access to the site is restricted because the severely damaged 13th-century stone structure is still unstable and there is a risk from lead particles from the roof that was turned into dust in the blaze. Moulin, who had to undergo a health and safety course to resume visits to the honey bees, said the 30-45,000 insects in the three hives are absolutely fine. “There’s nothing wrong with them at all. The behaviour of the colonies is perfectly normal,” she said. “They’re not very active at this time of the year, but that’s how it should be. They seem fine.” When fire tore through the cathedral last year, most people feared the bees, which can number up to 50,000 per colony, had perished. Moulin’s company, Beeopic, received calls of support from well-wishers all over the world, who were moved by reports that the bees had not abandoned their queens in the face of danger, but had gorged on honey and hunkered down to protect their colonies. Although untouched by the flames which destroyed the cathedral’s famous roof structure, Moulin says she was initially worried the heat might have damaged the hives, given their position on the sacristy roof on the south side of the cathedral and approximately 30m (98ft) below the main roof. Another concern was that firefighters, whose priority was to control the fire, might have disturbed them in their frantic efforts to put out the blaze. “Of course, my first thought was for the cathedral itself. My second was for the bees. I kept watching the television footage of the fire but the captions at the bottom always hid the sacristy roof, which is below the main roof, so I couldn’t see if they’d been touched,” Moulin said. Drone footage in the aftermath of the fire showed the hives were intact, but it took several weeks of detective work to establish if the colonies had survived the proximity to temperatures estimated to have reached 800C(1,470F) at their peak. “An ounce of hope. The three hives are still in place … and visibly intact,” Nicolas Géant, head of Beeopic, tweeted hours after the fire was put out. “As for the occupants … the mystery remains. All that smoke, heat, water. “We will have to see if our brave bees are still with us as soon as we’re given access to the site, which may take some time,” he added. Two days later, Géant announced: “Our bees at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral are still alive.” Moulin says beekeepers had to piece together clues in film footage taken of the cathedral. “We examined satellite images and we saw the hives were intact and hadn’t been knocked over and there were no puddles of wax underneath them. As the wax melts at around 70C we knew they hadn’t been affected by the heat. We weren’t worried about the smoke, because we use it to sedate them so we knew they’d just go to sleep around the queen. “Then we were sent some film from some of the people working on securing the cathedral and we could see bees going in and out of the hives. We studied their behaviour and saw they were carrying balls of pollen on their feet which meant they were building up stocks of protein to feed the young. “As soon as we knew there were baby bees we knew it meant the queens were fine since they were producing them.” It was good news, but Moulin could not be 100% sure of the health of the colonies until she was given permission to visit the devastated cathedral in July, three months after the fire. “They didn’t seem to have been affected at all. Of course, there’s lots of noxious material all around them, including the lead dust, but they’re not like children; they won’t be licking walls or touching anything other than flowers. The only thing they might come into direct contact with that might be contaminated is the water they drink.” In July, Moulin retrieved 66kg of honey from the three hives, samples from which have been sent to laboratories in Canada to be tested for lead. Beeopic maintains the hives and bee colonies, but the honey produced from those on the roof of Notre Dame, and the 350 other hives in Paris that the company looks after – of a total of 700 dotted around the city – belongs to the owners of the buildings on whose roofs they sit, including that of Louis Vuitton on the Champs Elysées and the nearby Grand Palais on the north bank of the Seine. The urban honey bees, of the Brother Adam Buckfast variety, were developed for their mild temperament in the 1920s by a Benedictine monk. The Notre Dame hives were installed on the cathedral roof in 2013 as a gesture to promote biodiversity. There are also hives managed by other companies on the Paris Opera buildings, the Comédie Française, Coca-Cola’s French headquarters and several banks. Moulin, who normally visits each hive at least once a month, hopes to remove the queens from the three Notre Dame hives this summer and replace them with younger royals. The queen bees can live for five years, while their worker bees have a lifespan of around 45 days. “We usually do this every year because when the queen bee is older there is a tendency for the colony to swarm, which tends to frighten people in the city, so we try to avoid it. The problem is that anything leaving the site has to be washed down and decontaminated, and I can’t see myself putting the bees into the shower,” she said. “At first the authorities wanted us to remove the hives, but they’ve seen [the cathedral through the catastrophe and they’re still there, so it seemed more intelligent to leave them alone.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/fact-from-fiction-finlands-new-lessons-in-combating-fake-news",
    "date": "2020-01-29",
    "transcript": "You can start when children are very young, said Kari Kivinen. In fact, you should: “Fairytales work well. Take the wily fox who always cheats the other animals with his sly words. That’s not a bad metaphor for a certain kind of politician, is it?” With democracies around the world threatened by the seemingly unstoppable onslaught of false information, Finland – recently rated Europe’s most resistant nation to fake news – takes the fight seriously enough to teach it in primary school. In secondary schools, such as the state-run college in Helsinki where Kivinen is head teacher, multi-platform information literacy and strong critical thinking have become a core, cross-subject component of a national curriculum that was introduced in 2016. In maths lessons, Kivinen’s pupils learn how easy it is to lie with statistics. In art, they see how an image’s meaning can be manipulated. In history, they analyse notable propaganda campaigns, while Finnish language teachers work with them on the many ways in which words can be used to confuse, mislead and deceive. “The goal is active, responsible citizens and voters,” Kivinen said. “Thinking critically, factchecking, interpreting and evaluating all the information you receive, wherever it appears, is crucial. We’ve made it a core part of what we teach, across all subjects.” The curriculum is part of a unique, broad strategy devised by the Finnish government after 2014, when the country was first targeted with fake news stories by its Russian neighbour, and the government realised it had moved into the post-fact age. Successful enough for Finland to top, by some margin, an annual index measuring resistance to fake news in 35 European countries, the programme aims to ensure that everyone, from pupil to politician, can detect – and do their bit to fight – false information. “This affects all of us,” said Jussi Toivanen, chief communications officer for the prime minister’s office. “It targets the whole of Finnish society. It aims to erode our values and norms, the trust in our institutions that hold society together.” Finland, which declared independence from Russia in 1917, is on the frontline of an online information war that has accelerated markedly since Moscow annexed Crimea and backed rebels in eastern Ukraine five years ago, Toivanen said. Most campaigns, amplified by sympathetic far-right, nation-first and “alternative” Finnish news sites and social media accounts, focus on attacking the EU, highlighting immigration issues and trying to influence debate over Finland’s full Nato membership. Resistance is seen almost as a civil defence question, a key component in Finland’s comprehensive security policy. Toivanen said: “We are a small country, without many resources, and we rely on everyone contributing to the collective defence of society.” The programme, piloted by a 30-member, high-level committee representing 20 different bodies from government ministries to welfare organisations and the police, intelligence and security services, has trained thousands of civil servants, journalists, teachers and librarians over the past three years. “It’s a broad-based, coordinated effort to raise awareness,” said Saara Jantunen, a senior researcher from the defence ministry who has been seconded to the prime minister’s office. “Like virus protection on your computer: the government’s responsible for a certain amount, of course, but ultimately it’s up to the individual to install the software.” For Kivinen, who returned to Finland after a career in international education to head the French-Finnish school in Helsinki and pioneer the information literacy programme in schools, no one is too young to start thinking about the reliability of the information they encounter. “Kids today don’t read papers or watch TV news, which here are OK,” he said. “They don’t look for news, they stumble across it, on WhatsApp, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat … Or more precisely, an algorithm selects it, just for them. They must be able to approach it critically. Not cynically – we don’t want them to think everyone lies – but critically.” Fake news, Kivinen said, is not a great term, especially for children. Far more useful are three distinct categories: misinformation, or “mistakes”; disinformation, or “lies” and “hoaxes”, which are false and spread deliberately to deceive; and malinformation, or “gossip”, which may perhaps be correct but is intended to harm. “Even quite young children can grasp this,” he said. “They love being detectives. If you also get them questioning real-life journalists and politicians about what matters to them, run mock debates and real school elections, ask them to write accurate and fake reports on them … democracy, and the threats to it, start to mean something.” He wants his pupils to ask questions such as: who produced this information, and why? Where was it published? What does it really say? Who is it aimed at? What is it based on? Is there evidence for it, or is this just someone’s opinion? Is it verifiable elsewhere? On the evidence of half a dozen pupils gathered in a classroom before lunchtime, it is an approach that is paying off. “You must always factcheck. The number one rule: no Wikipedia, and always three or four different and reliable sources,” said Mathilda, 18. “We learn that basically in every subject.” Lila, 16, said she had grilled local politicians for a live panel discussion on the local radio station. Alexander, 17, said he had learned a lot from devising a fake news campaign. Asked why fake news mattered, he said: “Because you end up with wrong numbers on the side of a bus, and voters who believe them.” Priya, 16, said education was “the best way to fight it. The problem is, anyone can publish anything. There’s not much a government can do when they’re faced with big multinationals like Google or Facebook, and if it does too much it’s censorship. So yes, education is what’s most effective.” Part of that continuing education is also provided by NGOs. Besides operating an effective factchecking service, Faktabaari (Fact Bar), launched for the 2014 European elections and run by a volunteer staff of journalists and researchers, produces popular voter literacy kits for schools and the wider public. “Essentially, we aim to give people their own tools,” said its founder, Mikko Salo, a member of the EU’s independent high-level expert group on fake news. “It’s about trying to vaccinate against problems, rather than telling people what’s right and wrong. That can easily lead to polarisation.” In the run-up to Finland’s parliamentary elections last April, the government went so far as to produce an advertising campaign alerting voters to the possibility of fake news, with the slogan “Finland has the best elections in the world. Think about why”. Similarly, Mediametka has been developing and working with media literacy tools since the more innocent days of the early 1950s, when its founders were motivated mainly by fear of the irreparable damage that comic books might do to the minds of Finnish children. These days, the NGO, part-funded by the culture ministry, organises ed-tech hackathons with inventive Finnish startups in a bid to develop “meaningful materials” for schools and youth groups, said its executive director, Meri Seistola. “We work with pictures, videos, text, digital content; get our students to produce their own; ask them to identify all the various kinds of misleading news,” said Seistola: from propaganda to clickbait, satire to conspiracy theory, pseudoscience to partisan reporting; from stories describing events that simply never happened to unintentional errors of fact. Finland has something of a head start on information literacy, ranking consistently at or near the top of international indices for press freedom, transparency, education and social justice. Its school pupils have the EU’s highest PISA score for reading. “The level of trust in national institutions, in the media, in society as a whole, does tend to be higher in the Nordic countries than in many others,” said Faktabaari’s Salo. “But that means we really need even greater vigilance now, to prepare ourselves for the next phase. Because we have more to lose.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "title": "Almonds are out. Dairy is a disaster. So what milk should we drink?",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/28/what-plant-milk-should-i-drink-almond-killing-bees-aoe",
    "date": "2020-01-29",
    "transcript": "For environmentally minded consumers, the news is hard to swallow: almond milk is not healthy for the planet and the popular milk substitute is especially hard on bees. Our recent investigation into the connection between California’s industrialized almond industry and a record 50bn commercial bee deaths created quite a buzz. The widely read story prompted one primary response from readers: “What should we be drinking instead?” This is a thorny question, and food sustainability experts are reluctant to single out any one plant milk as best because all have pros and cons. But we’re going to try. One thing is clear. All milk alternatives are far better for the planet than dairy. A 2018 study by researchers at the University of Oxford showed that producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times more greenhouse gas emissions than any plant-based milk and it consumes nine times more land than any of the milk alternatives. (Land is required to pasture the cows and grow their feed, which the animals belch out in the form of methane.) Plant milks can, nevertheless, have a dark side, as when any crop is produced in mass quantities. It’s important to consider not just whether they are grown using organic methods. Other factors include how the farming of the crop affects people and native habitats in developing countries, the carbon footprint and water use. And while each product has its trade-offs, some plant milks are more sustainable than others. Based on interviews with experts, here is a an environmental ranking of plant milks, from the disappointingly sour to the sustainably sweet. Coconut: ‘An absolute tragedy’ Coconut has a reputation as exotic and healthy, but for poor regions in the Philippines, Indonesia and India, where pickers are often paid less than a dollar a day, the palm groves are no paradise. Because coconut trees only grow in tropical climates, the pressure to meet global demand is causing exploitation of workers and destruction of rainforests. “Coconut is an absolute tragedy and it makes me really sad,” Isaac Emery, a food sustainability consultant. “I love cooking with coconut milk but I don’t feel good about buying coconut products. Farmers in Indonesia should be growing food to feed their families instead of meeting international demands.” To avoid supporting unsustainable practices, choose coconut products that are certified Fair Trade. Almond: bad for bees While almond trees occupy smaller amounts of farmland compared with other crops grown for milk, this benefit is overshadowed by the negative impacts of almond farming in the US. Concentrated almost entirely in California’s arid Central Valley, almonds are the largest specialty crop in the US and the orchards cover a region the size of Delaware. Almonds require more water than any other dairy alternative, consuming 130 pints of water to produce a single glass of almond milk, according to the Oxford study. Satisfying continual demands for larger almond crops is also placing unsustainable pressures on US commercial beekeepers. Nearly 70% of commercial bees in the US are drafted every spring to pollinate almonds. Last year, a record number –over one-third of them– died by season’s end as a result of these pressures and other environmental threats. Rice: a water-guzzler Although rice milk is ubiquitous as an inexpensive and widely available dairy alternative, it offers little in the way of nutrition or environmental benefits compared with other choices. Rice is a water hog, according to the Oxford study, plus it produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other plant milk. Bacteria breeding in rice paddies pump methane into the atmosphere and large amounts of fertilizer pollute waterways. Hazelnut: on the up For consumers who want the nutritiousness and tastiness of a nut milk but without the environmental impacts of almond farming, the hazelnut is a rising star. Like all nuts, hazelnuts grow on trees that pull carbon from the atmosphere and help reduce greenhouse emissions rather than increase them. Hazelnuts are environmentally superior to almonds in that they are pollinated by the wind rather than commercial honeybees and they grow in moist climates, such as the Pacific north-west, where water is less of an issue. Hemp and flax: niche contenders Another way to ensure sustainable choices is to choose milk alternatives made from what Emery describes as “niche crops” such as hemp and flax. They are grown in relatively small quantities in the northern hemisphere, which makes them more environmentally friendly compared with a monoculture operation. Both plants produce seeds that make for a milk rich in protein and healthy fats. Soy: back in favor According to the Oxford study, soy milk is the joint winner on the sustainability scale. Plus, soy is the only plant milk that comes close to offering a protein content comparable to dairy. It was the go-to alternative long before almond milk came into vogue – but then soy fell out of favor. “Soy has a relatively high concentration of certain hormones that are similar to human hormones and people got freaked out about that,” says Emery. “But the reality is you would have to consume an impossibly large amount of soy milk and tofu for that to ever be a problem.” Recent studies have instead found that a moderate amount of soy is healthy, especially for women. The primary environmental drawback to soy milk is that soybeans are grown in massive quantities around the world to feed livestock for meat and dairy production. Large swaths of rainforest in the Amazon have been burned to make way for soy farms. The work-around for this is to simply do a little research and read the carton to find soy milk that is made from organic soybeans grown in the US or Canada. Oat: a humble hero Meet the winner: the unassuming oat. “I’m excited about the surge in oat milk popularity,” says Liz Specht, associate director of science and technology for the Good Food Institute, a not-for-profit that promotes plant-based diets. “Oat milk performs very well on all sustainability metrics.” Also: “I highly doubt there will be unintended environmental consequences that might emerge when the scale of oat milk use gets larger.” According to Bloomberg Business, retail sales of oat milk in the US have soared from $4.4m in 2017 to $29m in 2019, surpassing almond milk as the fastest-growing dairy alternative. But unlike almonds, there are already plenty of oats to go around. “Right now, 50 to 90% of global oat production goes into animal feed,” says Specht, “so there’s a huge existing acreage that we can safely steal share from without moving the needle at all on total production.” Oats are grown in cooler climates such as the northern US and Canada, and are therefore not associated with deforestation in developing countries. The only drawback with this trendy and guilt-free option is that most oats come from mass-produced, monoculture operations where they are sprayed with the Roundup pesticide right before harvest. A study by the Environmental Working Group found glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and a possible carcinogen, in all the foods it tested containing conventionally grown oats and even in one-third of products made with organic oats. However, the popular Oatly brand oat milk company maintains its oats are certified glyphosate free. The bottom line: as long as it’s not dairy Both Emery and Specht emphasize that whether it’s coconut, soy or oat, consumers should drink whatever plant milk is most appealing to them and not fret over sustainability shortcomings, which are chump change compared with the environmental harms from dairy. “Drink what you want,” says Emery. “If you’re going with plant milk instead of animal milk, you’ve already addressed most of the environmental problems that your animal milk habit was causing.” Follow these recipes to whip up a glass of hazelnut fig milk and other DIY plant milk varieties. • This article was amended on 4 February 2020.

    "transcript": "How to be happy? And is it even important? Big questions for a January afternoon. But is happiness the most important quality for you, or is there something bigger, deeper, more crucial? Let us know. You’ll make your Upside editor very, er, happy. This week, we dipped in and out of this subject in typically scattergun fashion: • Can you learn how to be happy? One-minute read. • 24 hours when time stood still. Four-minute read, but take your time. • The silver sharers finding rental contentment. One-minute read. • The latest tome by the UK’s “happiness tsar”. Two-minute read. Here on the Upside, we’d be tempted to suggest that, yes, there are more important qualities than simple happiness. The diminution of suffering might be one. Security and wellbeing might others. Fulfilment, purpose and achievement are all important to bring meaning to a life. And then there is the perfect cup of coffee … Elsewhere, though not technically an Upside piece of work, our investigation into the ill-gotten gains of Africa’s richest woman appears to have had tangible upside results as Isabel dos Santos was named as a formal suspect in a criminal investigation. Compare her to Britain’s youngest MP, who has opted to give away half her salary. And to the millionaires of Davos, insisting that they pay MORE tax. Honestly, Isabel, how much is enough? Lucky numbers Japan has reduced suicide to record low levels. Ditto England and HPV infections. Meanwhile, green shoots of the week: the share of renewable energy in Europe has more than doubled since 2004, to 18% today (pdf link). And China seems poised to slash the amount of single-use plastic that it churns out, as officials outlined a gradual ban. What we liked We were mildly encouraged by new research that has come up with a series of predictive tools that assess how likely a young person is to suffer from depression. Important, given how crucial prevention is as a tool to combat mental illness. We’d also quite like to move to the Copenhagen neighbourhood built entirely of wood. What we heard Melvin Reynolds wrote in about vegan toothpaste, of all things. Colgate may be the big brand but see Kingfisher Toothpaste to find out about a UK company that’s been at vegan toothpaste for years – albeit without flag-waving and claims to recyclable tubes as yet; though I saw a LinkedIn post on an independent developer of those recently too. Pretty sure the old-style metallic tubes would have been recyclable too (presumably not now used because they are prone to creasing and consequent leaking). Jehunita Mathews-Freeman responded to our piece about giving Liberian schoolkids a proper school lunch. There is an organisation called Doctors Spouse Asso, which is trying to raise funds to put first aid boxes in the primary schools in Liberia. We are desperately looking for any help and support for that project. If any reader would like to help Jehunita, do write in to the Upside, so we can put you in touch. Where was the Upside? At the Cardiff school where all pupils in one class got top marks in their maths exam. And in the Belgian port that created a car-free city. Make this newsletter great again by getting in touch with your predictions, hopeful stories, legends, random acts of kindness, suggestions.

    "transcript": "When an email popped up in Jo Newstead’s inbox promising a course that could make her happier, she was – to put it mildly – sceptical. “But then I thought, what have I got to lose?” she says. In her early 60s, she’d recently lost a close friend, and had stopped working. “I was at a crossroads, with a lot to deal with – but I wasn’t at all sure a course could help.” She went along to the first session, she says, with her arms folded, pretty certain she wouldn’t be back. So what made her end up cancelling parties so she could get to the classes – and why is she now a stalwart of the ongoing monthly get-togethers with her other happiness graduates? In a nutshell, she says, the course helped her understand how to view life through a positive rather than a negative lens. It gave her strategies to cope when things seemed to be going into a downward spiral, as well as a supportive environment and the space to talk things through. “It sounds trite and airy-fairy, but it was anything but – it was really useful, and very genuine,” she says. Newstead isn’t alone in finding the course – entitled Exploring What Matters, endorsed by the Dalai Lama and run by the UK charity Action for Happiness – helpful. New research released on Tuesday has found its approach has a real impact, reducing anxiety and depression by up to 20%, and raising life satisfaction by about 15%. That’s more than the psychological boost you get from finding a new job or a new life partner. And that makes it highly significant, explains economist Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, professor at Saïd Business School in Oxford and director of the Oxford University Wellbeing Research Centre, who conducted the study. “We know a lot about what drives wellbeing, and we know a lot about mental health issues in our society and the fact that they’re on the increase, despite improving economic conditions,” he says. “But what hasn’t been properly looked at until now is what can make a difference – what can move the dial on life satisfaction in a meaningful and sustained way.” Like Newstead, he wasn’t sure how much difference a short course of eight sessions could make when he started his randomised control trial involving 146 people. “But the results were really impressive – the course delivers significant improvements in wellbeing and reductions in mental health symptoms,” he says. “It’s clear that this intervention has huge potential and really does work.” So how does the course work? Another of its graduates is Rebecca Newey, 47, who lives near Aldershot. She was feeling angry, suffering mood swings and snapping at her husband and two sons, aged 12 and 10, when she signed up for the happiness course two years ago after hearing about it from another mother at the school gate. “The sessions start with being mindful: you stop what you’re doing and notice how you’re breathing. And then there’s a structured discussion about how to feel happier: so you’re with a bunch of people who are all aspiring to be happier, and there’s power in that.” One of the most important things she learned, says Newey, was how to react to an event. “You choose how to respond to something, and your gut reaction isn’t always the best way to react. You learn to take a moment to breathe, and to make a decision about what to do next.” That knowledge continues to make a difference in her life. “The other day my car had a flat tyre. Two years ago I’d have moaned and thought it was the end of the world: instead, I started to count my blessings. The previous day I’d been on a motorway, so it was good it hadn’t happened then; and it happened when my husband was around, so it wasn’t leaving me in the lurch unable to pick up the children.” So is finding happiness, in essence, a lot easier than we’ve been led to believe? Mark Williamson, director of Action for Happiness, says maybe it is – though there’s a caveat. “We don’t want to suggest you can simply choose whether to be happy,” he says. “Many people are in difficult circumstances, and feeling happy isn’t easy or straightforward. But what we do know is that we have the ability to make a difference to how we feel – there are tools that can help, and there’s an awareness that can change things.” The Action for Happiness website lists 10 “keys” to a happier life, ranging from connecting with other people and giving time and money to causes you care about, to being open to new experiences and doing regular exercise. So far about 6,000 people have taken part in the happiness course at 250 locations, and after the research is released on Tuesday, its availability looks set to rise. Participants are invited to give a voluntary donation, because the ambition is to be inclusive, says Williamson. “We didn’t want it to be just about happy and privileged people being a bit happier. We want everyone, including those on low incomes and from all backgrounds, to benefit.” The charity also offers an app and an online calendar, both with simple tips to make life easier. None of what you learn is rocket science, says Newstead, but it is life-changing all the same. “I still have bad days – everyone does,” she says. “But now I think about something from the course, for example I remember three positive things in my life. And that really can make the situation better.” How to be happy •Every day, make a list of three things you’re grateful for. You’ll be more resilient and mentally healthier within 12 weeks, according to research for Action for Happiness. •Say something positive to at least three people you meet today. •Go out for a brisk walk. •Do a mindfulness or happiness meditation – there are plenty online. •Support a charity, cause or campaign you really care about. •Notice when you’re being hard on yourself or others, and opt to be kind instead. •Plan a fun or exciting activity you can look forward to. •Re-frame a worry: ask yourself, will this matter a year from now? Could it be an opportunity, rather than a difficulty? •Find the joy in music: listen, sing, play, dance. •Treat yourself: do something today that you know will make you feel good.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/how-a-belgian-port-city-inspired-birminghams-car-free-ambitions",
    "date": "2020-01-20",
    "transcript": "Birmingham – once, proudly, the UK’s “motorway city” – has announced plans to entice people out of cars and on to bikes and buses. If officials get their way, the city will be split into zones, and, rather than driving direct, motorists will have to use the ring road for all zone-to-zone journeys. Those travelling by foot and bicycle in the new Brum won’t be inconvenienced: their journeys will be simple and – with fewer cars – safer. With cars out of the way, bus journeys will become swifter and more reliable. The Birmingham transport plan, launched last week, was influenced by Ghent’s zone-centred traffic circulation plan of 2017. This medieval Belgian city – a quarter of the size of Birmingham – demonstrated that it was possible to switch attitudes overnight. Streets were blocked to motorists one Sunday evening and – to the disappointment of the waiting media –there was no wailing, no gnashing of teeth, no gridlock. Motorists have since found that, while their journeys are longer in distance, they take less time because there are fewer fellow travellers on the roads. Motor vehicles used to make up 55% of trips in Ghent – that number has now fallen to 27%. Retailers and restaurants that had warned of Armageddon discovered that takings did not plummet. “Actually the economic situation has improved,” says the Green politician who led what had been controversial changes. Filip Watteeuw, deputy mayor of Ghent, points out there “has been a 17% increase in restaurant and bar startups, and the number of empty shops has been arrested”. A year after the imposition of the traffic circulation plan – in news that may encourage similarly minded politicians around the world, Watteeuw was re-elected with an increased majority. Another advantage of the intervention is that it is remarkably cheap to implement; Ghent’s plan cost just €4m (£3.4m) to implement. By comparison it costs an estimated £20m-£30m to build just one mile of motorway. “[A city’s] best car plan is a bike plan,” he said. “Providing more space for walking and cycling leads not only to more people walking and cycling, it also makes space for people who really need to use their cars.” A great deal of Ghent’s traffic congestion was found to have been caused by an excess of short car journeys – as planners had accurately modelled. “We had people complaining that a drive of 300 metres became a car journey of two kilometres,” remembers Watteeuw. “We had to explain that we don’t want people to use a car for 300 metres: they should walk.” In Birmingham 25% of car journeys are one mile or less. Thanks to new infrastructure, bicycle use in the city is rising but from a pitiful low of just 1% of all trips. Birmingham city council wants this to rise to 5% by 2023, but if it successfully introduces its circulation plan it might be surprised by far greater success. Ghent’s plan had imagined a cycling modal share of 35% by 2030, up from 22% in 2016. Instead, after an explosive 60% rise in cycle use, the target was reached last year, 13 years earlier than planned for. Ghent now has cleaner air: nitrogen oxide levels have dropped by 20% since 2017. It’s also a quieter city. “One resident described me as the best orchestral composer the city has ever had,” said Watteeuw. Before the introduction of Ghent’s circulation plan, all that could be heard was the cacophony of cars, complained the resident, but “now he hears birdsong”, Watteeuw said. “Instead of car noise,” he adds, “people can now hear each other talking and children laughing.” For Mel Jones, Birmingham city council’s head of transport planning, taming cars can’t come soon enough. “Growth in Birmingham’s population will result in 1.2 million additional daily trips across our highways network by 2031,” she says. “Accommodating all these trips by private car is simply not sustainable.” Road widening is off the table, she adds. It’s expensive, unpopular – and doesn’t work. “We need to look at ways of keeping the city moving in a sustainable and efficient way,” says Jones. Birmingham plans to remove one of the most significant incentives to motoring: car parking. Businesses will be incentivised to remove parking spaces through the introduction of an annual £500 per space workplace parking levy, and the city will build 12,800 new homes on former car parks. “Valuable land in short supply [should be] used in the most productive way possible,” the council says in its 36-page plan. “Reducing pressure on kerb space” will “provide improved penetration and accessibility by public transport in the city centre,” promises the plan. “Public transport and cycling provision will be prioritised over car parking provision.” The “allocation of road space will change away from single occupancy private cars,” the council says, because the priority should be “moving people, not vehicles”. Freight deliveries will be restricted to out-of-hours, and there will be a blanket 20mph speed limit across the city’s local roads. Birmingham must “build a future in which the car will no longer be king”, says Waseem Zaffar, the city council cabinet member for transport and environment. Cars, he adds, are “bad for the health of ourselves and our families, bad for our communities and bad for business as measured by the millions of pounds of lost productivity caused by congestion”. Watteeuw advises Birmingham’s councillors not to stagger any changes. “In Ghent, we implemented the plan as a whole overnight,” he says. “It was technically and politically the easiest way.” The Birmingham transport plan goes out to public consultation soon. Watteeuw – who received death threats before the implementation of the plan – urges the residents of Birmingham not to allow loud voices and vested interests to derail the process. “Talk to people, but be persistent, and don’t give in on the plan’s principal benefits,” he says.",

    "transcript": "It’s not just Generation Rent that struggles with insecure lets, unscrupulous landlords and bad accommodation. There are more than 400,000 people aged over 60 living in private rented accommodation, up more than 60% from 2007. Research predicts a third of over-60s could be renting privately by 2040, as rising divorce rates and sky-high property prices take their toll. For some older renters, the prospect can be depressing as it could mean poor-quality accommodation, insecure tenancy, isolation. But a new service is dedicated to matching older homeowners with lodgers of a similar age. Since opening for business last week, Silver Sharers has signed up more than 500 prospective landlords and renters, with six members close to signing tenancy agreements. Suzanne Noble, the site’s founder, said: “I’m 58 and I share my flat with my lodger, Ameet, 52. Despite my initial reservations about living with someone my own age, I’ve discovered I like our setup far more than I would have imagined. Ameet and I often share meals together, we have mutual interests and, when I just want to have a chat, he’s available. “The situation worked out so well that when my 62-year-old partner wanted to move into London to be closer to where I live, I helped to find him a similar arrangement and he now shares with a couple in their sixties. Now I’m helping others to do the same via my website.” In Paddington, west London, more than 20 putative renters and lodgers recently braved the wind and rain to turn up to the first Silver Sharers event, meeting potential matches over a glass of wine and a chat. Noble said: “This looks like fun – as if it’s a matchmaking, dating game – but it’s actually a massive relief for a lot of the people here to realise that they’re not the only person their age to have to rent a room. “Older people are rightly nervous of using the usual websites to find rooms because of the scams,” she said. “But also, most homeowners on those sites overwhelmingly specify that they only want to live with younger people because most of them are young themselves. “The feeling can be mutual. A lot of older people don’t want to rent from younger people either because they want their home to be a quiet, sedate space.” The benefits are obvious: the number and proportion of people aged 50+ living in the private rented sector has reached a record high but one third of older private renters have borrowed money or cut back on spending in the last 12 months to meet their payments. At the same time, more than two thirds of homeowners aged over 65 have at least two spare bedrooms, with many not only grateful for the financial help but the company of a like-minded lodger. There is also the question of dignity. Trudy, 68, said she finds having to rent a room a degrading experience. “I’m humiliated by the fact I have to rent at my age but it’s the hand that life has dealt me,” she said. “I owned my own house when I was married but gone are the days when the sale of a family home meant a divorcing couple could buy two smaller properties,” she said. “My ex-husband and I are both renters now. We had sizeable deposits from the sale of our family home in 2010 but mortgage advisors decided that my single income was too low for a mortgage. In my ex-husband’s case, they said he was just too old for a mortgage.” For Trudy and her generation, renting is often harder than for younger age groups. Their standards are higher and they want secure, long-term arrangements. Niki, 62, sold her flat in Muswell Hill and moved to Cyprus in 2011. When she found herself unable to get work abroad, she returned to the UK. “Because of ageism in Cyprus, my work just dried up there,” she said. “I came back to the UK but can’t afford to pay rent anywhere central without using up all my savings. “Most adverts on house-sharing websites specify maximum ages of around 40 for tenants. I’m also scared of being scammed on these websites. I want to do what I’m doing tonight: meet a homeowner that I have interests in common with so we can form a long-term, respectful bond.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/school-lunch-liberia-london",
    "date": "2020-01-14",
    "transcript": "It’s breakfast time in Domagbamatma (population: 63) in the depths of the Liberian rainforest, but there’s no food in evidence in the home of Massa Kamara. The eight-year-old has been up since dawn, collecting firewood, fetching water. Now she’s ready for school in a crisp white shirt and navy-blue skirt in her family’s muddy, two-room shack. In the narrow porch there’s a pile of rags, some carrier bags, a few bowls and a couple of plastic chairs. In a UK home it would look like stuff waiting to go to the tip. Here, it represents this family’s entire earthly possessions. Liberia is one of the poorest countries on Earth, and the Kamaras are one of its poorest families. They eke out a living growing vegetables on the land around the shack. In families that hover as close to subsistence as this one, sending their children to school makes little sense. Learning to read and write, to do addition and subtraction, might be an investment in a long-term future, but it doesn’t put food on the table today or tomorrow. And yet Massa is setting off on the 40-minute trek to school. This morning it’s dry: when the rain is pouring down, as it often does at this time of year, Massa carries her uniform in an old carrier bag to keep it dry, and changes into it when she reaches school. As we walk she speaks of the subject she likes best (English), her friends, and how she hopes one day to move to the city. At the Vorkor public school in a village near the regional centre Tubmanburg, smoke is curling from an open-sided “kitchen”, where several women are busy over a fire preparing today’s dinner in vast pots. In a couple of hours’ time, Massa, who has an old margarine tub in her bag, will line up with her classmates to have it filled with rice and beans. At Vorkor, mealtime isn’t just an important part of the pupils’ day: it’s the most important part of the day. And it’s because her family know she will receive a nutritious meal here that they make sure Massa never misses school. Three thousand miles away, at roughly the same time, pupils at Good Shepherd primary in west London are also sitting down to their lunch; and though they don’t know Massa and haven’t even heard of Vorkor school, pupils at the two schools are crucially connected. Because students at Good Shepherd are fundraisers for Mary’s Meals, the NGO that funds school dinners at Vorkor and 2,357 other schools in 18 countries across the world. And while the charity’s supporters come from across the entire community, in the UK and elsewhere, there’s something particularly heartwarming about the idea of kids in one part of the world trying to make things fairer for children somewhere else. That’s very much how it’s seen at Good Shepherd primary, according to the school’s headteacher, Imogen Lavelle. “We believe it’s our duty to help schools in countries such as Liberia,” she says. “So far we’ve raised more than £3,000 – the children have had own-clothes days, wear-your-pyjamas-to-school days, cake sales.” That £3,000 will go a long way: it costs Mary’s Meals the astonishingly small sum of £13.90 to feed a child for a whole school year, so the Good Shepherd is feeding a school of roughly the same sort of size as it is, around 250 pupils, from one end of the academic year to the other. That means a lot to Good Shepherd pupils such as Nathan Olano, 10, who’s in Year 6. “We know how hard it would be to do our lessons without our school dinner,” he says. And indeed, research for Mary’s Meals among the schools where it is working bears this out: in one survey, the percentage of teachers agreeing that “children in my class never complain of hunger” increased from 7% to 87% after the introduction of Mary’s Meals, while 98% of pupils said they found it easier to concentrate on their lessons once they had a full stomach. It gives children at Good Shepherd plenty of food for thought. “I sometimes think about what it would be like to go to school and get no lunch,” says Nathan’s classmate Darcie Meade, also 10. “Especially if you’ve had no breakfast either. Raising money for schoolchildren in countries like Liberia has made me a lot more aware of how the world is stacked against some communities.” Evi Chaudhari, also 10, says it’s given her hope – not just for children like Massa, but for her entire generation across the planet. “It makes me feel that if we can change the world while we’re still kids, how much more can we do when we’re older?” Mary’s Meals operates on a simple model. It was in Malawi in 2002 that a former fish farmer called Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, who’d reinvented himself as an aid worker, had a conversation with a boy whose mother was dying of an Aids-related illness. MacFarlane-Barrow asked what he could do to help, and the boy replied that what he needed was easy: food to eat, and a school to go to. MacFarlane-Barrow launched Mary’s Meals as a result. It now feeds more than 1.5 million children daily, with a budget of around £26m, almost 90% of which comes from donations. “One meal for one child costs just 7p – that’s pocket money even the youngest children have,” says Kim Webster, a spokesperson for Mary’s Meals. At a time when development often seems overwhelmingly complex and expensive, the easy digestibility and comparative cheapness of the need to feed and educate children is a big part of its success. And Mary’s Meals manages to keep overheads low by recruiting volunteers – in practice these are usually mothers or grandmothers with kids in the relevant school – to run their kitchens. There’s still, though, a long way to go. Unesco estimates that across the world 258 million children between the ages of six and 17 miss out on school because of poverty. It’s children who bear the brunt of global poverty, every which way you look: they make up 30% of the world’s population, but account for 50% of its poorest people. Many of these children are in Africa, where 228 million live in what the UN classes as extreme poverty; in sub-Saharan Africa, one child in three is stunted due to malnutrition. Even in the regions and schools that Mary’s Meals support, the terrain and weather conditions sometimes make food deliveries impossible. On one recent morning in Liberia, a river connection to a remote local school was impassable because of rains. Bags of porridge, rice and beans that had been stacked up on the bank for the short voyage were loaded back into a vehicle. Across the water we could see the faces of children who would be getting no school dinner until the water receded. Food is not the only challenge for young people in Liberia. One of the kindergarten children at Kondh school in Bomi County is Blessing Johnson, four. Her mother, Ma-tenneh, died of Ebola the day after she was born; a week later, her father, Molu, died of it, too. Blessing is being raised by her mother’s sister, Zoe, who already has four children of her own; to know her niece is getting fed at school makes a huge difference to the family. Before Ebola, of course, there was civil war, 14 years of it, in which more than 200,000 Liberians died and more than 1 million were uprooted. At another school, there is a boy who’s much older than anyone else called Waharbu Zinah. He’s 19, but he’s only been at school for six years. At the age of three he was kidnapped from his village by soldiers, and even after the war ended in 2003 he was effectively enslaved. “I looked after the man who had been the boss-man of the soldiers; I had to fetch and carry for him,” he explains. “I was just a small kid – I had no chance on my own.” He finally escaped when he was 13, and settled in Lowah; he works on a farm to support himself. “I don’t expect to see my parents again – I’ve no idea what happened to them. The only way I can have a future is if I provide one for myself – and I’m doing my best to do that.” Getting fed at school, he tells me, is the deal-breaker that makes it possible for him to afford to be educated, and furthers his dream of one day going to college. Seeing Waharbu’s tall frame squeezed behind a dilapidated desk, paying careful attention to the young man just a few years older than him who’s teaching reading from the school’s single blackboard, is a humbling experience. He may not be the sort of pupil the children at the Good Shepherd have in mind when they’re fundraising, but what Mary’s Meals is offering him is the most important gift of all: a second chance.

    "date": "2020-01-13",
    "transcript": "Half of UK universities have signed up to divest from fossil fuels in what campaigners say is a significant blow to the “social licence” of big oil. Seventy-eight of the UK’s 154 public universities have joined the divestment campaign, either divesting or pledging to divest hundreds of millions from the fossil fuel industry. Although some of the universities have only withdrawn from certain fossil fuels – such as tar sands or coal – others have already divested from all fossil fuels as part of what campaigners say it is an accelerating process of delegitimisation of the industry. Chris Saltmarsh from the campaign group People &amp; Planet said excluding the industry from universities was now “a mainstream and majority position”. “That universities across the sector are now divesting so fully and quickly demonstrates how far the fossil fuel industry’s social license has been eroded over the last seven years. It is increasingly common sense on UK campuses that these companies can play no productive role in solving the climate crisis.” Saltmarsh warned that those institutions that held out against divestment would be harshly judged by history. “Universities not yet divested can now choose to stand with their students on the right side of history or be forever known as complicit in the crimes of climate breakdown.” In the past year a flurry of major academic institutions – from University College London to York University – have pledged to divest completely. However several major universities, including Cambridge, are still subject to vociferous campaigns by students and staff over their links to the fossil fuel industry. A Guardian investigation last year revealed that just 20 fossil fuel giants are linked to a third of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis. And as awareness of the industry’s role in the climate crisis has grown, it has come under growing pressure in the UK with leading arts institutions facing calls to end their sponsorship deals and protesters targeting individual companies. Saltmarsh said: “Wildfires are wreaking destruction across Australia, the Amazon and beyond while fossil fuel companies profit from the extraction to blame for this devastation. Excluding this industry from our universities is now a mainstream and majority position.”",

    "transcript": "Welcome back and happy new year. The turn of a decade is always a great time for taking stock, for predictions and forecasts about the new era to come. In case you missed it, the Upside published its review of the super-trends of 2010s over the Christmas period – and asked readers what they thought the dominating tendencies of the 2020s would be. There were some thought-provoking responses. John Simke predicted that the 2020s would mark the end of seven decades of overenthusiastic consumerism: By 2030, buying consumer goods will not only be looked down on, increasingly it will not be done, particularly in the “rich” world. This will go far beyond “conscious consumption” to complete cessation of consumption. This will be led by the younger generation but will be picked up by everyone. Our economy will shift from being consumption led to being savings and investment led, as we spend trillions of dollars on a new energy system and climate change adaptation. Obviously this will be driven by the need to mitigate climate change. Kevin Fisher in Los Angeles forecast a series of ‘ends’. The end of work as we know it, the end of human contact, the end of disease: I think even in the next decade we will see more and more diseases eradicated completely and as we start to treat illness with in-body genetic engineering we will see hereditary conditions also disappear. Robbie Morrison in Berlin is buoyant about prospects for a more open society: I predict “open” will become a super‑trend: more specifically, open civil society organizations … and open analysis in pursuit of solutions to our existential crisis of sustainability. It was the open‑source world that bequeathed the ethos, the community norms, the decision processes, the copyleft and permissive open licensing models, the versioning and issues tracking tools, the concept of predominantly online collaboration, and the web platforms in support. So I see this fledgling super‑trend in the raft of new self‑organizing civil society communities confronting climate change, including Extinction Rebellion, GermanZero, Fridays for Future, and Scientists for Future. To this end, I’ve embarked on trying to build a community to analyze future zero‑carbon energy systems thus, with some background here. And finally, Tom Forster ran through an exotic list of predictions including skyrocketing pet ownership, drug liberalisation, the return of the city state, anti-fashion, nationalist art – and my own favourite, ocean travel: I think ocean/rail liners will start targeting #generationeasyjet, diversifying their onboard services to subcontract for millennial appetites such as rage rooms, food/beer markets, vegan cuisine, axe throwing, escape games, gin tastings, etc. As for me, I predict a giddy torrent of optimistic journalism. Already in the last week or so, we have published: How Bangladesh is leading the way in adapting to the climate emergency. Three-minute read How lab-grown food can save the planet. Three-minute amuse bouche The house that Verdi built – and the 60 retired opera singers who live there. Two-minute aria The wave pool for disabled surfers. Two-minute read Fukushima’s plan to replace nuclear with renewable energy hub. One-minute read Lucky numbers US greenhouse gas emissions fell 2% in 2019, according to preliminary estimates, as cheaper natural gas supplanted coal at a prodigious rate. Also falling in the US is the cancer death rate, by 2.2% in the latest year on record – the biggest ever reported decline. And it was a good week for auto workers in the US and bakers in the UK. Automakers GM and Ford made more than 1,500 temporary workers permanent members of staff under a new union deal. British baker Greggs gave its 25,000 staff a bonus of up to £300 each, as the company continued to thrive. What we liked? Vogue Italia’s startling decision to publish its January edition without any photos. Also, various media reports detailing Australian generosity to raise money to battle the bushfires. But most of all, we loved this NPR piece about the ‘scary moms’ and crowdfunded activists pressuring the Pakistani government to do something about apocalyptic air pollution. What we heard We had plenty of further suggestions for ‘Upside Legends’, following our article just before new year highlighting the unsung heroes who really deserve public acclamation. Inka Wienbarg wrote: Salma Zulfiqar started the Migration Project in 2016, she has been producing artwork and delivering her ARTconnects workshops to change perceptions in communities and promote cultural understanding and empower women, in particular vulnerable young women. Her passion and drive to create peaceful communities and have a positive impact has meant that hundreds of people have engaged in her ARTconnects workshops in the Midlands, Manchester, London, Norwich, Greece, the UAE, France and Italy – that have all have benefited from her work at a critical time when racism and hate crimes are increasing. Nicholas Hale nominated his sister, Rachel Bramwell: Rachel is a reception and special needs teacher at Thatto Heath Community Primary School in St. Helens, Merseyside. It’s quite a deprived area and my sister has taught at the Thatto Heath since she qualified as a teacher, 26 years ago. Come rain, shine or freezing snow, my sister is there for her class - day after day, week after week, year after year. I can’t even begin to imagine how many children’s lives she’s changed for the better. My sister and I have always shared a love of literature. In her masterpiece, Middlemarch, the great novelist George Eliot writes: “The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life.” Where was the Upside? In the British royal household, where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex showed the way towards a more streamlined monarchy.

    "transcript": "In the scorching farmlands of south-west Bangladesh, a single coconut tree stands as a barometer of climate change. Dulal Mondal, 70, a farmer, points halfway up the tree about two feet off the ground to indicate where the waters came the last time the area flooded. “Next time if heavy rain comes I don’t think water will recede as there is no natural draining or anywhere for it to go,” he says. Mondal lives in the Jessore district of Bangladesh where increased levels of salt in the water, uneven rainfall and flooding are creating great uncertainty for a whole farming community. Bangladesh is one of dozens of countries on the frontline of the climate emergency. Here global heating is no theoretical calamity of the future, but a very real, present danger. By 2050, it is predicted that one in seven people in the country will be displaced by climate breakdown. The sea level is projected to rise by 50cm over this time period and Bangladesh may lose approximately 11% of its land. Deadly storms are usually a question of when, not if. Here, the climate crisis is so palpable that the debate is not about restricting carbon emissions or preventing global warming but about how to adapt to the change and survive in times of unpredictable weather. For example, Mondal says that where once his peers would farm mainly rice, now they have taken to fishing. They use floating cages, allowing fish to breed in a secure area. Also, if water levels rise, the cages will too, so flooding is less of an issue. “About 20 to 30 years ago there would be a minimum of two crops per farming family but now because of waterlogging we have no more than one,” he says. Each cage is owned by one home and yields about 15,000 taka (£135) in additional income for the families a year. It’s also a consistent source of food, which could be vital if natural disaster hits. “In the last two years there was not too much rain but two years ago we were flooded,” Mondal says. “We worry about the future. If there is heavy rainfall the water could remain logged for a long period of time and we would have to take shelter on main road. We would stay there with our remaining belongings.” This farming evolution is just one element of a whole range of climate change adaptive practices taking root across southern Bangladesh, an area long prone to cyclones, rising sea levels and drought. “What’s important is investment in long-term development, to help people adapt to the effects that climate change is having now and help them to not only survive but thrive in their new climate reality,” said Adib Hossain, the head of programmes implementation at Practical Action, one of the charities helping to make changes. In this part of Bangladesh they have helped introduce effective fertilisers to increase crop growth as well as growing fish in cages and vegetation in sacks or beside rivers – a novel farming technique known as a “dyke garden”. The cages are made using cheap materials. Bamboo poles form an outer frame that can float and is covered in netting. They have a top cover to prevent fish jumping and escaping, or being caught by birds. With a capacity of one cubic metre, they hold up to 300 fish at a time. These cages are used for two growing seasons each year. The fish can be fed on scraps and waste – duckweed, oil cake, kitchen waste, rice bran and snails – and in just a few months they grow to full size. A woman standing beside Mondal goes down in a small wooden boat and pulls up the mesh cage, within which fish jump up and splutter around. She drops the net and they swim around once more. For the worried farmers in this area, the introduction of these cages has been reassuring, a constant amid a lot of inconsistency. In the nearby district of South Atulia another innovative technique has been employed. Land here is being used for fishing, with pools of water separated by a cracked mud path and spiky vegetation. Omal Biswas, 48, has three daughters and an adopted son. He used to farm rice once a year and during the monsoon he would fish in freshwater. Now he is able to make more money with dyke gardening techniques, growing vegetables around pools of water used for fishing. Omal has just harvested a crop, he says. They grow bottle gourd, chillis, indian spinach, red amaranth, sponge gourd, ridge gourd and tomatoes. “Before this technology was used I would yield around 20-25,000 taka a year but last year I harvested 120,000 taka through using different varieties of vegetables and growing more in the year. “Now I can grow vegetables while fishing but I used to rotate the land. I eat the vegetables too,” he adds. He adds that the additional income helps give them a better quality of life and now he has been able to buy six cows. “The cost of living is rising and the cost of production is increasing so it is a good portion of revenue,” he says. Practical Action isn’t the only charity supporting farmers. The National Agriculture Technology Program (NATP 2) by the World Bank has also helped people adopt resilient farming methods. Farmers have deployed ancient agricultural methods such as floating beds, which involve sowing crops onto floating islands made of the fast-growing water hyacinth. Crops such as cucumbers, gourds and eggplants flourish. Beds are raised so as to lie above the reach of tidal surges. In between, trenches serve as pools to farm fish and ducks. Others have turned to shrimp farming after land was flooded but Practical Action has helped people do this in a more effective way. Rubina Khatun is one woman who has benefited from this. “The cyclone affected my family. I swam across flood waters with my two sons and took refuge on the road and sheltered in a shop we own for two months. Then we returned to our home,” she says. Shrimp farming is now a major source of income for her family. The technique used to farm the shrimp more effectively includes using deeper water so the temperature does not change as quickly, and adding a fertiliser made from oil cake, date juice and sugar cane among other things. “I am not sure what I would do without it now,” Khatun says. “But this type of farming is weather dependent. We need rain. If there is less rainfall salinity increases.” Despite efforts to improve the situation, Bangladesh remains at the mercy of sharp changes in weather patterns. Deep uncertainty persists for millions, even if these newfound techniques are helped to mitigate environmental impact. “I am worried,” Khatun says. “Too much or too little rain, both are problematic.” For her, however, the concept of climate change is a world away. “I can feel it in terms of rain but I am not aware of this. I have heard non-government-organisations talking about it but just as a concept. All I know is shrimp farming is a major source of income out of all the ones remaining, so it’s a reassurance.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2020-01-05",
    "transcript": "Fukushima is planning to transform itself into a renewable energy hub, almost nine years after it became the scene of the world’s worst nuclear accident for a quarter of a century. The prefecture in north-east Japan will forever be associated with the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on 11 March 2011, but in an ambitious project the local government has vowed to power the region with 100% renewable energy by 2040, compared with 40% today. The 2011 accident, triggered by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, sent large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 residents. The 300bn yen ($2.75bn) project, whose sponsors include the government-owned Development Bank of Japan and Mizuho Bank, will involve the construction of 11 solar and 10 wind farms on abandoned farmland and in mountainous areas by the end of March 2024, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. A 80km grid will connect Fukushima’s power generation with the Tokyo metropolitan area, once heavily dependent on nuclear energy produced at the prefecture’s two atomic plants. When completed, the project will generate up to 600 megawatts of electricity, roughly two-thirds the output of an average nuclear power plant. Despite the Fukushima disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, Japan’s conservative government is pushing to restart idle reactors. It wants nuclear power, which generated almost a third of the country’s power before Fukushima, to make up between 20% and 22% of its overall energy mix by 2030, drawing criticism from campaigners who say nuclear plants pose a danger given the country’s vulnerability to earthquakes and tsunami. All of Japan’s 54 reactors were shut down after the Fukushima meltdown. Nine reactors are in operation today, having passed stringent safety checks introduced after the disaster. Renewables accounted for 17.4% of Japan’s energy mix in 2018, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, well below countries in Europe. The government iaims to increase this to between 22% and 24% by 2030 a target the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has described as ambitious but which climate campaigners criticise as insufficient. Abe insists nuclear energy will help Japan achieve its carbon dioxide emissions targets and reduce its dependence on imported gas and oil, but his recently appointed environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has called for the country’s nuclear reactors to be scrapped to prevent a repeat of the Fukushima disaster. “We will be doomed if we allow another nuclear accident to occur. We never know when we’ll have an earthquake,” Koizumi said when he joined Abe’s cabinet in September. The government is unlikely to meet its target of 30 reactor restarts by 2030 given strong local opposition and legal challenges. Japan faces mounting international criticism over its dependence on imported coal and natural gas. It received the “fossil of the day” award from the Climate Action Network at last month’s UN climate change conference in Madrid after its industry minister announced plans to continue using coal-fired power. Japan is the third-biggest importer of coal after India and China, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Its megabanks have been urged to end their financing of coal-fired plants in Vietnam and other developing countries in Asia.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/life-for-retired-opera-singers-in-the-house-that-verdi-built",
    "date": "2020-01-04",
    "transcript": "Renato Franco Perversi and Irena Domowicz are squabbling over who does the better rendition of the Neapolitan classic, O Sole Mio. Perversi, 87, sings deep, while Domowicz, who says you must never ask a woman her age, immediately replicates the kind of performance she might have given during her career as a mezzo-soprano. “There is more theatre in here sometimes than in the outside world,” she joked. Hardly surprising. The pair are among the 60 retired opera stars playing out their days in an elegant mansion in Milan founded by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. Verdi, famous for compositions including La Traviata, Aida and Otello, was in his 80s when he conceived the idea of a refuge for musicians who, he said, “are not favoured by fortune, or who, when they were young, did not possess the virtue of saving”. He did not want to be thanked for his generosity, and so stipulated that the home be opened after his death. The composer died in 1901, and the first nine guests moved into Casa Verdi a year later. For the next few decades, royalties from Verdi’s 27 works paid for the residents’ keep, including medical costs, and the building’s maintenance. Today most of the costs are covered by investments made by the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation, with residents paying according to their means. “The motives for which Giuseppe Verdi chose to build this house are still valid,” said Roberto Ruozi, president of the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation. “In the sense that there are numerous personalities who have dedicated their lives to music, who need to enter into a retirement home as they no longer have the economic means to sustain themselves, or who have complicated family lives.” Over the last 117 years, Casa Verdi has hosted 1,500 guests from across the musical spectrum, some of them famous, others less so. Perversi played the violin at La Scala for 10 years, while Domowicz toured with philharmonic orchestras across the globe. Another resident is 94-year-old Bissy Roman, a musicologist who was teaching well into her 70s. “Music is my life and I am very lucky to be here with other musicians,” said Roman. Casa Verdi is not so much of a “rest home” in the traditional sense. The sound of music is everywhere. On the morning the Guardian visited, guests were wrapping up a singing session around the piano. Instruments fill the rooms, including a wooden spinet gifted to Verdi to practise on as a child, while concerts are a regular occurrence. The home is also a museum to Verdi, containing items of his clothing, letters and paintings he commissioned from poor artists. The composer is nearby, having been laid to rest in Casa Verdi’s courtyard alongside his wife, the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi. When the sculptor and politician, Giulio Monteverde, wrote in a letter to Verdi: “Tell me the truth. What is your favourite work?”, the maestro replied: “The home I built in Milan for retired musicians.” The only big alteration to Casa Verdi came in 1999, when it was opened up to 20 music students, an initiative aimed at assisting young people as well as bringing the generations together. The two groups mix and the older musicians give the young people invaluable guidance. “For the elderly people, the youngsters are injections of life and vice-versa, for the young people, the elderly are their teachers,” said Ruozi. Roman said that one of the best things about living in Casa Verdi was the students. Among her favourites is Corrado Neri, a 25-year-old singer and composer from Sicily. “When I first came to Milan I really struggled to find a place to stay and study,” said Neri, who through Roman’s connections has been collaborating with a music company in New York. “I had applied to Casa Verdi and two years later they called to say there was a place. It was the best thing that could have happened to me. These people are my family and best supporters, I have learned so much from them.” Perversi has been a resident since early 2016. “There are no words to describe Verdi’s generosity … we still feel him around us,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary place to live, and yes, even though these are our final days, Verdi has given us the possibility to live well.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "'Water is my happy place': accessible surf school ignites passion for sport in Bristol",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/29/adaptive-surfing-the-wave-bristol-its-my-happy-place-disability-sport",
    "date": "2019-12-29",
    "transcript": "Fresh from her first ever surf, Sophie Elwes looks chilly but energised. The 31-year-old has spent the past hour riding prone on a soft-top board at the Wave in Bristol, a new artificial surfing lagoon that caters for people of all abilities and needs. Paralysed from the chest down since she fell from a balcony when she was 22, she credits her passion for water sports and snow sports with fuelling her physical and mental rehabilitation. Yet Elwes, who lives in London, had never before tried surfing. “I love stuff when it’s ‘on’ the water – it’s my happy place,” she says. “At first [after the accident] I was very wobbly but skiing and wakeboarding has given me strength. Most of all it’s helped me mentally, emotionally and with confidence. Having these kinds of experiences is a total gift.” The Wave was conceived by Nick Hounsfield, a former osteopath who is also the director of British Surfing. Opened in October, it is the first wave pool in the UK painstakingly crafted with people with disabilities in mind: smooth access ramps, dedicated changing facilities, beach wheelchairs and specially trained surf coaches are among its features. “From day one, our aim was to make sure the space was accessible physically and in terms of culture, to make sure that all people have the same opportunities on site as each other and to normalise being around people who have got physical or mental health issues,” Hounsfield says. By coincidence, half a dozen experienced adaptive surfers, among them men and women with physical, visual and learning impediments, also arrive to surf on the same day as Elwes. Louis Sutton, a 19-year-old who has autism, cerebral atrophy, cerebral palsy and dyspraxia, has come with his mother, Suzanne. Sutton’s combination of illnesses makes it difficult for him to navigate social situations, Suzanne explains, and he lacks the balance and coordination to play sports such as basketball and football. But he surfs with enviable poise and style, carving down the green faces of waves in the advanced section of the lagoon. “We don’t know why, we don’t know how; all we know is that his physiotherapist has said surfing is now officially part of his treatment. It’s like the messages to the muscles have started working,” she says. Furthermore, regular surfing has a profoundly positive impact on his behaviour and happiness. Academic evidence to support water-based healthcare – so-called blue health – is growing, according to Dr Easkey Britton, a marine social scientist who collated the findings of 33 studies featuring more than 2,000 people. “There’s definitely something about [being on, in or near] water that benefits how we feel in our bodies,” she says. “In the context of a physical disability, it’s the sense of freedom from gravity which takes the pressure off joints. For some amputees it really reduces the dependency on narcotics and pain medication. And mentally, psychologically, it has this huge effect on mood and wellbeing.” Britton ascribes this to the soothing sensation of water over the body and says three publications due out next year will further support the evidence in relation to adaptive surfing, in particular. Cornwall is already ahead of the curve: since 2010, NHS doctors have been prescribing surfing for children who are vulnerable to mental health issues. For Bruno Hansen, a yachtsman and four-time adaptive surfing world champion, the logic is simple: “We come from a womb where we’re in water and we’re made up of, what, [up to] 75% water? So I think we’re water creatures deep down.” Watching Elwes surf, Hansen recalls how he was paralysed in 1998 in a carjacking in South Africa and, a few years later, paddled into the ocean to drown himself. Instead, he says, he inadvertently caught a wave that “rebooted” him. “When I broke my back I thought: I can’t surf, I’ve got no job, I can’t captain a boat, and no girl’s ever going to want me – what’s the point of life?” he says. “But that all got wiped away by catching one little wave, like these beginner waves. So, to me, the healing power of surfing is way beyond what people realise.” The problem in Britain is that surfing is often inaccessible. Ethan Jolosa, 14, and his mother, Leah, frequently make a three-hour round trip to the Gower Peninsula in Wales, where Ethan learned to surf with supervision from the charity Surfability. “When you go to the beach, sometimes they have massive steps, it’s uneven, the shore is a long way away,” Leah says. “But here [at the Wave] it’s very flat and calm and accessible. They have four lifeguards for each group, they have slipways into the water; they’ve really thought about people’s adaptive needs.” Elwes describes a feeling of empowerment after her surf: she was offered a choice of boards before being safely propelled into whitewater waves by a team of three coaches, who swiftly came to her aid on the sole occasion she wiped out. “It was truly an inclusive experience,” she says. “I wish the whole world was designed [accessibly] like this.” After two hours in the water, Sutton offers the most telling verdict yet. “It was good,” he says – three words that delight his mother because he is usually reluctant to talk to strangers. “Surfing gives him something,” she says. “It makes him feel, I don’t know, maybe part of life.”",

    "date": "2019-12-26",
    "transcript": "Year-end, and it’s gong season again, another chance for the authorities to confer honours on the prominent, successful people in our society: sports stars and national treasures, cultural bards and civil servants and businesspeople. But are these fair? What is an honours system for? Should it be for people who play games for a living? For people who were simply doing their job? Should it be for people whom life has already rewarded – with fame, wealth, status, fans, admiration? Or should it be for unsung heroes whose celebration might encourage more of us to volunteer, give, sacrifice? We asked our readers to nominate their unsung heroes for public recognition. Do add your own nominations in the comment thread. Alison Inman Nominated by Leah Jeffery “Alison is the former president of the Chartered institute of Housing, and is a Women’s Aid supporter, tireless carer and champion of women’s rights – particularly the vulnerable. “I would love to see her in a position to drive the discussion forward in the House of Lords. As the social housing crisis deepens, I think having a voice with real experience would also be beneficial in providing an honest perspective and genuine passion for change.” Calvin Eaton Nominated by Adam Smith “Calvin started a non-profit called 540WMain [as in ‘540 West Main’] that is located in the Susan B Anthony neighbourhood of Rochester, NY, US. It is a neighbourhood that has a high poverty rate and has a lot of social challenges related to poverty. “The mission is to enrich the historic district as well as connect greater Rochester to the neighbourhood by curating accessible event space and high impact/low cost single session courses based in the arts, wellness and antiracism. “From his humble storefront, he is working to help improve the lives of everyone who lives in that neighbourhood and beyond. He doesn’t let the daunting challenges of poverty stop him. He just opened up his space and works every day to make a positive impact in people’s lives.” Andrew Davis Nominated by Juanita Bullough ”Since 1974, my friend Andrew Davis has been running the Wythenshawe Development Trust (now Wilmslow and District Recycling). He drives his van to collect donations of unwanted furniture and goods, which he passes on to the homeless and low-paid in north Manchester and Cheshire. “He also has stalls at a local market where he offers household goods to the less fortunate, and holds a weekly drop-in session at his HQ in the old scout hut in Lacey Green, Wilmslow. He is helped by a team of volunteers, many of whom are unemployed and/or have mental or physical health issues, giving them a purpose and enabling them to go out and meet people. “He relies solely on his supporters and odd grant aid and always helps others rather than himself. He deserves a medal – but if you asked him, what he really would prefer is a few thousand pounds to recondition the engine in his van. And by the way, he’s over 80.” Sixto Rodriguez Nominated by Mallory Bagwell “The musician Sixto Rodriguez (see the movie Searching for Sugarman), his destiny was out of sync with his fate. Fame and fortune have evaded him for most of his life. He probably won’t accept a knighthood, but for the Queen to receive a ‘Rodriguez’ award could be every bit as notable. The man has taken nothing yet given the world much.” Anna Tembo Nominated by Zoe Jones “What makes Anna truly extraordinary is her role as the vice-secretary of Ongolwe Women’s Development Association. The organisation brings together over 90 women’s groups to share learning, empowering them to take control of their own development and to have a voice in their communities, meaning that Anna’s personal success is radiating out in ripples. “As well as transforming her own family farm, volunteering in her community and supporting women’s groups across Ongolwe ward, she has started up her own shop, and is in the midst of creating a community Keyhole garden, with the help of her neighbours, for all to use. “Her perseverance in the face of a changing climate is inspiring to us all, and yet volunteers like Anna go largely unrecognised. The hundreds of women that Anna supports gain not just farm skills so they can feed their families all year round, but are also encouraged to set up their own businesses. They gain in confidence and prosperity, participating in decision-making in the home and in their communities. She is a shining example of how development begins within, and how one woman can have an enormous positive impact on those around her, when she has the opportunity to thrive. Andreas Bummel Nominated by John Vlasto “With very little budget, Andrew Bummel has been quietly advocating a world parliament [via the realistically achievable interim step of a United Nations parliamentary assembly] for over a decade. Despite the nationalist headwinds, he has won the support of the European, Pan-African and Latin American parliaments, and over 1,600 serving and former members of parliaments from all around the world, as well as numerous other notable figures (like the Dalai Lama). “We, the people of the world, face a global environmental crisis, and [the Upside notwithstanding], we are not tackling it effectively. Our economy has globalised, our impact on the environment has globalised, but our politics remains stubbornly and even increasingly national. National sovereignty was a solution to 17th-century religious wars in Europe, it is not the solution to the 21st-century global environmental crisis. Global problems require global solutions. Solutions, to be effective, must be enforced. Enforcement, to be legitimate, must be with the consent of the people. We need more effective and accountable global governance. We need a world parliament. “Andreas, in his quiet modest way, may be the person who saves the planet. He certainly deserves a knighthood for trying.” Alice Webb Nominated by Hilary Day “After losing her job with a big local company through mental ill health, Alice decided to use her talents to set up a self-help, peer-supporting, creative charity offering free workshops for anyone in and around Cambridge dealing with mental health issues. “The local services for mental health had all but collapsed due to lack of funding, and what there was required referrals from the local NHS services. Alice’s idea sidelined all that – self-referral was fine, no requirement to sign up for a course and complete it for the statistics, and workshops were free. “Running on a shoestring for the past nine years, Alice has inspired people to support the charity to give their time and talents, and was offered a home for the workshops in the local Methodist Church. There is also an allotment for gardening and making up vegetable boxes for people in the area who don’t have gardens but who want to grow things. “Why is all this so special? Because it works. Alice was very clear from the start that the charity should be run by its members for its members. Everyone involved in the charity has to have direct experience of mental ill-health themselves, or through a family member or friend. Members can decide when to attend the workshops and how often to suit their current health condition. “It works well – a friendly environment, a chance to chat and socialise, and a reason for leaving the four walls of the house on a regular basis with no demands made of you. The charity offers a chance to build inner strengths and self-confidence through being with other people who understand exactly what you are feeling because they have been there, or somewhere like it, themselves. “Many times, Alice has wanted to stop her work due to her own health needs, but she’s continued and has the love and respect of many in our community. Her story and that of the charity she set up deserve to be told.” John Pilger Nominated by John Powell “John Pilger has done a huge amount of work, often at risk to his life, to expose shonky and shoddy politics and politicians. Without his documentaries and newspaper columns we would be much less informed about corruption, including the support, by the CIA, of dictators on all continents. “Pilger is a strong critic of American, Australian and British foreign policy, which he considers to be driven by an imperialist agenda. Pilger has also criticised his native country’s treatment of indigenous Australians. He first drew international attention for his reports on the Cambodian genocide.” Max Roser Nominated by arch-optimist David Alcock How about Max Roser and his team at Our World in Data, which exists to conduct research and disseminate data to make progress against the world’s largest problems? And Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling-Rönnlund, Mikael Arevius and the rest of the team at Gapminder, who are carrying on the legacy of the late Hans Rosling by promoting a fact-based and overwhelmingly positive (they would say ‘possibilist’) world view [see also their 2018 book Factfulness].” Bridget Nodes Nominated by Lindsay Viljoen “Bridget is a volunteer dog walker at the Dogs Trust Shoreham-by-Sea. She is there every off day (she works as a nurse) walking the difficult dogs that the other walkers can’t walk. This provides the staff with precious extra time to spend with the dogs who need more attention.” Matty Healy Nominated by Lisa Gobin “Matty Healy, singer of The 1975, sings about what matters to the youth, and what should matter for everyone: climate change. His collaboration with Greta Thunberg, the single Love It If We Made It … the world would be a better place if his message got to more people. Keep up the good work, and thank you for reporting what most media don’t cover.” Fadil Elamin Nominated by Christine Ro “Fadil Elamin is one of the few children’s dentists in Sudan. He’s working under very challenging circumstances, from political unrest to frequent power outages. So his and colleagues’ research, showing the effectiveness of a dental hack that doesn’t require electricity, is especially useful.” Gina Miller Nominated by Rhiannon Pugh “I would nominate Gina Miller for her brave attempt to uphold British democracy.” Jess Philips Nominated by Mike Moule “I would nominate Jess Phillips for her courage, her honesty and her ability to maintain calm and dignity when all around her the world falls apart. She stands apart from many of our self-serving politicians and is a tribute to those who seek social and political change without reverting to slander.” Martyn Goss Nominated by Liz Vizard “My nomination is for Martyn Goss, who has recently retired after nearly 30 years working as first social responsibility officer and later director of church and society for the Exeter diocese. Unfailingly committed to justice, peace and care for the environment, he has been and still is an inspiration to Exeter people, of all faiths and none, who care about these issues. He did win a Church Times green champion award in 2017, but if knighthoods were on offer to such as he, he would be a strong contender (though no way would he accept one!).

    "transcript": "And so towards year-end and a juicy Christmas present for you this week, dear Upsider. In an unprecedented act, we are going to tell you about a piece we haven’t even published yet. With the decade about to turn, there have been a slew of articles about how terrible the 2010s were, sort of like the 1970s with extra carbon dioxide or the 1340s without the plague. Ever one to champion the underdog, we asked Guardian writers to look for the silver lining and pinpoint the super-trends of the twenty-tens (for that is what they are called) that were full of progress, promise or at least didn’t result in people calling each other rude names or telling barefaced lies. The answers in no particular order: renewables, streaming, veganism, environmental activism, poverty reduction, smartphones, mental health awareness, trans issues, anti-plastics, women’s sport (particularly football). Read the full piece on Friday 27 December. After two days of Christmas, you’ll want something to cleanse the palate. Back to the here and now. As this is our last newsletter of 2019, we thought we’d do two lists: the best pieces of the week, and the best pieces of the year. So without further ado, this week we gave you: • The simple fix that helped end the world’s first climate change war. Three-minute read • Dreaming of a green Christmas. Four-minute read • We opened our doors to a Syrian refugee family. What happened next? Two-minute read • An entire series on how to be hopeful. A lifetime’s work • How I escaped the vicious cycle of homelessness. 90-second read And this year, we particularly enjoyed giving you: • How to play cricket with only one arm. Five-day test • The kindest thing I ever saw. Five minutes of life affirming joy • The rise and rise of Bangladesh. Three-minute read • The age of the four-day week? Four days • How to plant billions of trees. Ages Lucky numbers There has been a sharp fall in the number of journalists killed worldwide this year, though 49 is clearly 49 too many. Meanwhile, most indicators affecting the poorest people on the planet are moving in the right direction, according to the World Bank. What we liked A new collaborative US project to examine the homelessness project and tease out solutions. This short piece from CNN on the 71 species discovered in 2019. And the New York Times listed its five heroes of 2019, sort of the Greta Thunbergs you probably haven’t heard of yet. Oh, and this was very Christmassy and uplifting, and nicely written too … What we heard Last week we asked for your highlights of 2019. Here are a few: When my 11 year-old granddaughter finally reiterated one of my constant comments about (how we should) care about the environment to save it for her children and grandchildren. Unfortunately (her plan) was that she was not going to have any children because of what’s happening today! Fiona Gray It’s been a sublime to ridiculous year for me. Wonderful and a little terrible. My youngest child left home and my son is in London so I sold up, and left Wellington, New Zealand for … Wellington, Somerset. I was invited by NHS for a routine breast screen about three months after my arrival. I’m careful of my health so along I went. They found a cancer. It’s treatable, I’ve had a small surgery and am now having chemotherapy. It’s not fun. I will need radiation after that. However, work (I’m a mental health nurse) has accommodated me with flexible hours, reduced patient contact and alternative administrative type work. People have been kind and supportive. I facilitate a therapy group at the hospital and now more than ever I’m practicing what I preach – staying in the moment, self soothing, fully participating in whatever I am doing, radical acceptance. By focusing on others I keep my spirits up. I am so grateful! Thanks NHS! My care has been exemplary. I came across this quote just after my diagnosis: “The Buddha called sickness, ageing, and death ‘heavenly messengers’ because they can powerfully guide us toward awakening.” I look forward to the end of my treatment , and the spring, and 2020! Jennifer Davidson, who wins the hole punch prize for best email My first granddaughter was born!

    "transcript": "In the arid lands that have seen one of the most brutal wars of the 21st century so far, green shoots of peace may finally be appearing. In the hot Darfur fields farmed by Adam Ali Mohammed, these green shoots are alternating rows of lentils and melons. “We tried lentils before, but there was not enough water,” the farmer says. Here in the Sahel, water is the key to life, but there is precious little of it – just 20cm of rain a year – and it is the source of much of the conflict. The climate crisis is making marginal existences even more fragile. It is no future threat here, with the Sahara marching southwards, temperatures rising and precious annual rains becoming ever more erratic. But a new approach is bearing fruit. The seasonal river that runs by El Fasher, the capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state, has been transformed by community-built weirs. These slow the flow of the rainy season downpours, spreading water and allowing it to seep into the land. Before, just 150 farmers could make a living here: now, 4,000 work the land by the Sail Gedaim weir. Crucially, the weirs are not just promising a more bountiful future, but a more peaceful one. Communities of farmers and nomadic camel herders, deadly enemies during the war, are coming together to plan and build them. This has often meant meeting face to face for the first time since the conflict began in 2003, but recrimination has turned into cooperation over shared water, and even resulted in wedding invitations. “There was a lot of killing here – there isn’t enough time to tell you about it all,” says Sheik Abdoelhman Saeed, part of the Sail Gedaim weir committee. “But now we are planning among ourselves to reach new areas with weirs.” Millet and sorghum were the staples, but Ali Mohammed has been able to expand into cucumbers and okra, lemons and grapefruit, and is trying sunflowers for the first time, all of which are valuable cash crops. “You give me the seed, and I will test it,” he says. Millions were forced to flee the violence in Darfur that killed as many as 400,000 people during a decade of conflict from 2003. Many people remain in huge camps today. “But if the fields are green like now, nothing could force me to go anywhere else,” says Ali Mohammed. The weir project on the Wadi El Ku river has also brought women, who do much of the farming work, to the fore. “Before, I was not able to sit with these men, and to speak like this,” says Azaz Mohammed, as the dam committee from 22 villages meets, sitting on carpets in the shade of a tree and sharing a meal harvested from the surrounding fields. The weirs are a “pioneer project”, says Enaam Ismail Abdalla, director general at the ministry of production in North Darfur, adding that the timing of the rains has completely changed due to climate change. The weirs are enabling people to return to their villages and adapt to the changing climate, which would otherwise drive them away once again, she says. She hopes they will be replicated in other parts of Darfur, Sudan and beyond. The collaborative climate-proofing provided by the Wadi El Ku project shows a way to tackle the complex mix of climate impacts, conflict and migration that are thought to be rising around the world. The Darfur conflict was labelled “the first climate change war” by some observers, with the then-UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon saying in 2007: “Amid the diverse social and political causes, it began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change.” Research has shown that climate impacts such as drought and increasing temperatures increase the risk of armed struggles, particularly in regions where populations are already divided. Bitter divisions are starting to dissolve 50 miles (80km) north of El Fasher along the Wadi El Ku, where the next phase of the project is taking place. Until very recently, project staff needed a convoy of dozens of heavily armed soldiers to visit. “Now we can go on our own: that is a real sign of improvement,” says Atila Uras, head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Sudan, which oversees the €16m EU-funded project, which is aiming to help 180,000 people. In the semi-desert encampment of Mamora, the pastoralists are reluctant to talk about the war. But after a traditional greeting meal of camel milk and goat meat inside an ornately decorated tent, Omer Ali Mohammed says: “For sure, during the conflict there was a breakdown of relations between the different communities.” He is a former member of the Rapid Support Forces, a government paramilitary group that grew out of the Janjaweed militias used by the former Sudanese regime to fight rebels in Darfur. In April, a revolution deposed President Omar al-Bashir after a 30-year rule. He is now in jail in Khartoum and faces genocide charges at the international criminal court in the Hague. “The government fuelled us to fight against each other, but we have realised we were being misused,” says another Mamora nomad, Mohammed Ahmed. “We got sick of the conflict. Now we want to live in peace. Our fathers and grandfathers used to live in peace.” The Wadi El Ku project began work in this area in September with a six-day peace conference of seven pastoralist groups and 44 farming villages. “At first, they were all very angry and shouted a lot. The farmers said these [pastoralists] have killed our people,” says Awadalla Hamid Mohamed, of NGO Practical Action, which is implementing the UNEP project. “But we gave them time and the tensions slowly reduced. It took two months,” says Hamid Mohamed, who managed to escape from Janjaweed kidnappers nearby in 2015, when working on the early part of the project. “They realised coexisting was good for them,” he says. The nomads need clear routes for their 600-mile (1,000km) migrations, which were getting blocked by farms, while the farmers need milk, meat and safety for themselves and their crops. The nomads also say that they feel marginalised, with little access to medical care and deaths during childbirth common. The key was enabling the communities to come to an agreement on how to share the water and land. “There are layers and layers of conflict, so we started with what they could agree on, and everyone agrees there is a problem with the environment, with water by far the biggest priority,” says Uras. “But if you look like you are dictating things, that is a killer.” The peace meeting led to a breakthrough: for the first time in years, the nomads invited farmers to a wedding in September. More than 800 people attended, including many young people who had never met, with some guests travelling from 25 miles (40km) away. “It was an opportunity to rebuild the old relations,” says Ibrahim Abdalla, the nasir (leader) of the pastoralists. In nearby Kafod, the hundreds of donkeys gathered on the edge of the town show it is market day. Farmer Abdelrahman Hamad grows potatoes, radishes and onions on the Wadi El Ku, which runs nearby, and says he lost people to the conflict: “But the project has brought us together. Now I can go to the pastoralists’ area no problem. There were a lot of problems to overcome, of course, but everybody needs peace.” Downstream, at the village of Shagra, a colourful crowd of women and children have gathered to see the star entertainer Sasa. As the crowd processes around her, clicking their fingers above their heads, she sings a favourite tune: “Look at the widows and the little children / They have drained our tears / Forwards, oh Darfur.” The gathering is celebrating 9,000 new trees being planted by a local women’s community association, replacing the many destroyed for firewood during the war. The shady spot is a now a meeting place, and the gum arabic trees a future source of income. “The men tried to plant trees – they failed,” says Fathia Hamed Xagod, chair of the women’s association. They lacked the patience, she says. In El Fasher, Fuzia Abass, chair of the Women’s Development Association Network, says the Wadi El Ku project is having a big impact on women’s lives. More widespread access to water means much less time carrying it to their homes, while the greater incomes from the farms means more girls are going to school. “But while women are doing most of the work, the men are dominant in the decisions,” she says. The Wadi El Ku project has not been trouble-free. In 2018, the long Korga weir, built five miles from El Fasher, was sabotaged. “All the communities upstream and downstream had agreed to the weir, whether they benefited or not,” said Adam Mali, a member of this weir’s committee. “It worked really well in the first year and everyone was very happy. But then a few people [downstream] became jealous.” A night-time raid with a mechanical digger fatally weakened the weir. Despite repairs, when the unusually intense rains came this year, the resulting torrent ripped a 50-metre hole in the structure. This ruined its impact and forced farmers to abandon the unwatered fields. The prime suspects were linked to the deposed regime, but with no witnesses, they were released from police custody. But the revolution has brought new people to power. The new deputy wali (governor) of North Darfur, Mohammed Ibrahim Abdelkareem, says: “This sabotage was a crime. We have issued a decree to protect all the projects – the current ones and all the future ones.” His office will also fund the restoration of the Korga weir. “These projects contribute to the repair of Darfur society. Water projects are usually in the areas where the war happened.” This represents a significant change in tone, says Uras: “I have met a few walis, but this is the first time I have heard one talk about peace.” Omer Abdelrahman, at the groundwater and wadi directorate in North Darfur, is clear about the critical importance of such water projects: “Water is the key to our life – if we are breathing, we need water. If it is not equally shared, then again we will have more war and more killing.” But Hamid Mohamed, from Practical Action, is cautious about the future. “Security is 99% better now. But the situation is still fragile – the tension is still there – and nobody really knows what is going to happen tomorrow.” • The UN Environment Programme assisted with travel for the Guardian This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Are you dreaming of a green Christmas? Households and individuals across the UK are turning their backs on the vulgarity of Christmas consumerism and waste by cutting back on obvious and most visible areas of excess such as unwanted gifts, plastic trees and decorations and unrecyclable wrapping paper. But the scale of our extravagance remains shocking. The Bank of England has calculated that the average UK household will splurge £800 extra in December on food and drink as well as gifts. Included in this is an average of 17 gifts bought per individual, according to online retailer Amazon. And according to a recent study by waste management company Biffa, the UK creates 30% more waste than usual over Christmas. This includes an estimated 227,000 miles of wrapping paper and 1bn cards that end up in the bin. An estimated 20% of gifts – some 120m items – will be headed for landfill on Boxing Day, according to the UK Gift Card &amp; Voucher Association. To make the most of the festive season without costing the earth, there are numerous other steps consumers can take to reduce their mountain of food waste, opt for the most carbon-efficient cooking, lighting and heating and even trim tedious miles spent on the motorway. The charity Oxfam helped blaze a trail with its range of poverty-busting ethical gifts including the “virtual goat”. Today, there is greater recognition the value of swapping physical gifts for more meaningful and useful experiences, and even investing time in volunteering. Which is more eco-friendly – a real or an artificial tree? Fresh trees are the more eco-friendly choice, as long as they are from a sustainable source. There are now well over 400 Christmas tree growers across the UK registered with the British Christmas Tree Growers’ Association, where trees are grown to guidelines governing sustainable cultivation. Look also for the FSC certification logo or Soil Association organic certification which means that no pesticides have been used during growing. You could also choose a tree with roots so that it can be replanted and enjoyed year after year. Artificial, plastic trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have less environmental impact than natural alternatives, depending on how they are disposed of. However local charity shops may accept them for resale if they are in good condition. A 2-metre (6.5ft) artificial tree has a carbon footprint equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions – which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is burned. Many consumers are also now opting to rent trees – complete with lights and decorations. Check your local garden centres or plant nursery, which will usually also deliver and collect the tree to save you the hassle. Among alternatives, Waitrose is selling a 30cm-high “edible” rosemary tree, shaped like its traditional counterpart, which can be used as a decoration or a Christmas table centrepiece. Friends of the Earth suggests that in smaller spaces indoor plants such as yucca or palm trees could be perked up with decorations. An estimated 8m trees decorated homes and offices across Britain last year, of which only 10% were recycled. The rest went into landfill, a wasted opportunity to create biomass that would have provided nutrients for depleted soil. Many local authorities and garden centres will be recycling Christmas trees in January. What alternative gifts would be better for the planet? Buy less and buy local. Each Christmas, a staggering 4,000 tonnes of products arrive in the UK by container from China. Presents bought locally means you will be supporting small suppliers and makers, while minimising your carbon footprint. Initiatives such as Small Business Saturday help, but support local retailers at other times too. Through its #AirWeShare campaign the environmental charity Hubbub urges shoppers to consider more environmentally friendly options for online shopping, including switching to a click and collect service to reduce the amount of city centre deliveries. The Carbon Trust says gifts that don’t consume electricity, such as toys and books, tend to have a lower carbon footprint than those that do. Buying good quality toys means they can be passed on to friends, family and charity shops, giving them a second or even a third life. And think whether you have to buy physical gifts? Could you buy an “experience” instead? Try gift tokens, cinema tickets, museum membership and so on. Sponsor an animal, buy some rainforest to protect, or even have a stab at making your own, including foodie gifts such as chutneys and cookies. Emi Murphy, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Christmas presents don’t need to cost the earth. By shopping around a little you can find unique gifts that support the fight against the climate crisis, keep plastic out of our oceans and boost tree cover.” Deck the halls with boughs of … anything eco-friendly? Choose decorations wisely and keep them to use again. As tinsel can’t be recycled, try to limit how much you buy, and keep what you have to use year on year. Most tinsel sold in the UK is made in China (and of dubious quality), although John Lewis’s is made in a factory in Wales (which churns out 12,000km a year, enough if laid end to end to get from the UK to South Africa). Wrapping paper is one of the most wasted materials at Christmas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates that last year’s wasted paper would be enough to wrap up Guernsey. If we all recycled just half the 8,000 tonnes produced we’d save 25,000 trees. When wrapping steer clear of anything shiny, plastic-lined or decorated with glitter, which are not recyclable. Try the “scrunch” test – anything that doesn’t hold its shape when scrunched into a ball is not recyclable. Use salvageable materials like newspaper, brown paper, textiles, string, raffia (made from bark which regenerates) and vintage ribbon. Wrapping in newspaper (try the distinctive Eyewitness photo double page spread in the middle of the Guardian which my family has been doing for years) looks better than it sounds. Increasingly popular and Instagrammable is wrapping with brightly coloured fabric – based on the traditional Japanese art of furoshiki. Ditch the commercial Christmas crackers which are typically dusted with glitter (containing microplastics) and contain ghastly plastic toys that nobody wants anyway. Make your own (Lakeland and Hobbycraft do handy packs of “fill your own”) and invite your guests to make their own hats. What’s the best thing to do for homeless people this Christmas? Homelessness has reached epidemic proportions in the UK, where half of the homeless people are in London. Official figures show that at least 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018 – a 22% increase on the previous year and the largest rise since records began in 2013. Homelessness charities say you can best help by donating directly to them in order to maximise resources. St Mungo’s, for example, says £25 would pay for a health check, £50 could fund a counselling session or £100 could buy resources for the charity’s Recovery College. Petra Salva, director of rough sleeper services at St Mungo’s, said: “Rough sleeping is harmful and dangerous at any time, [but is] increased when temperatures drop dramatically over times such as Christmas. I would encourage people to contact StreetLink to help connect someone with their local service as soon as possible. Giving money and food is a personal choice; we would encourage people to contact charities like St Mungo’s to see how they can help people in the long term.” Where can I volunteer? Check out whether local charities, old people’s homes, homeless shelters and food banks could do with a spare pair of hands. The Trussell Trust welcomes volunteers over Christmas for its 1,200-strong network of food banks across the UK, to help hand out a record number of emergency food parcels. The national food redistribution charity FareShare seeks volunteers at its depots across the UK to help sort food donated by supermarkets and to drive it to recipients such as charities and community projects serving up meals. You can also help FareShare by choosing a green token through its Community Matters “green token” scheme on Waitrose.com over Christmas. A similar scheme is FoodCycle, which welcomes volunteers for its 34 projects across the UK. Loneliness is always an issue at Christmas. You can volunteer or donate to Age UK, which says there are 1.4 million “chronically lonely” older people in England alone. What can I do to reduce my carbon footprint in the kitchen? If you are stuck when choosing what to cook, the Carbon Trust points out that turkey has a lower carbon footprint than beef, while vegetarian and vegan options are even lower than that. If you can’t steer clear of red meat make sure it’s British. Don’t overdo the cheeseboard, which has a high carbon footprint. Don’t preheat the oven for too long, or leave it on after the meal is prepared to keep food heated. And eat up those leftovers. What about plastics? It’s hard but not impossible to have a plastics-free Christmas. Food packaging is tricky, but supermarket chain Iceland is offering customers the choice of a plastic-free or reduced plastic packaging Christmas dinner this year. It is selling 18 Christmas products that are completely free from plastic packaging, including stuffing balls and black forest layered pavlova. Selfridges is removing plastic packaging from its own brand range of Christmas food, switching to home compostable alternatives for 90,000 mince pies and 3,000 Christmas cakes. Dispense with plastic cling film by using reusable beeswax-covered cotton cloths, available from Waitrose and Lakeland. And make you sure you recycle aluminium – popular as mince pie wrappers – correctly. A new campaign from the Co-op chain aims to stop tonnes of aluminium – including mince pie wrappers, from being dumped into landfill. Its research shows that more than one in five (22%) of UK adults do not recycle household aluminium and that more than 3,000 tonnes could end up in the general household waste. How can I reduce my travel? Hundreds of thousands of people will be criss-crossing the UK over the holiday, driving significant distances to visit family and friends – what some environmentalists refer to as “love miles” – adding to greenhouse gases and congestion. Avoid air travel if at all possible. Where a large number of people are travelling, the Carbon Trust advises people to check to see whether they can share a car or take public transport (though the railways are not for the faint-hearted at this time of year). Use car sharing websites and apps such as Liftshare and GoCarShare – sharing a journey means a lower carbon footprint for each passenger, less traffic on the roads, splitting fuel costs and hopefully enjoying some company. It urges people to consider a Skype chat rather than a visit. Can I offset my Christmas? Everything seems to be carbon-offsettable these days (you can even offset fake news now by paying to support its antidote – Guardian journalism). Offsetting Christmas is slightly harder (despite what companies offering opportunities to do so might say). With tree planting all the range now, you could forgo the palaver of getting a Christmas fir and dedicate a tree to a loved one – it’ll offset some carbon emissions, too. * * * Reading list Turning the Tide on Plastic by Lucy Siegle Veganish by Jack Monroe * * * Useful blogs 21 eco-friendly Christmas tips from Friends of the Earth Plan for a less wasteful Christmas from Recycle Now The Sustainable Christmas Guide from the Sustainable Restaurant Association Organic Gift Guides from the Soil Association",

    "transcript": "How’s it been for you? Annus horribilis or golden year? We’d love to hear from Upside fans about their 2019: what was the best thing that happened? The funniest thing you witnessed? The very best joke? The most promising dab of progress that you came across? Anything that made it good to feel alive? Email us at the usual address (theupside@theguardian.com). We’ll showcase a sample in next week’s festive edition, the last newsletter of the year. The best email wins a hole punch. For us, the most positive things of 2019 included: • The school strikes and mounting awareness of the climate emergency. • The fact that more people voted in elections than ever before. • The sudden awareness of the power of the tree. • The great progress in the battle against Aids and malaria. • The growing consumer backlash against environmental waste. • The cautious optimism about ketamine as a treatment for psychological disorders. • The numbers of companies successfully experimenting with four-day working weeks. • Upsider responses to our requests for unsung heroes – we will publish this as an alternative honours list between Christmas and new year. As for this week, an eclectic flurry of uplifting journalism, including: • Why Dutch prisons are so empty. Three-minute read. • A room with a view (to a career in journalism). One-minute read. • Young women take over Finnish government. Even shorter. • A new country for the Pacific? Ninety-second read. • The town giving families $500 a month. Two-minute read. Lucky numbers The world will be 1C cooler by mid-century than it would have been had ozone-damaging CFCs not been banned under the 1987 Montreal protocol. So it IS possible … Oh, and as pointed out by Beautiful News, everything that kills children is in decline. What we liked In a week, a year, a decade of division, kudos to the BBC’s Crossing Divides series, which found 10 reasons why Brits are actually not that divided. We also liked this New York Times piece about people hosting recently released prisoners to give them a stable re-entry into civilian life. What we heard Our recent piece on biochar generated a prodigious response from you lot. New Yorker Miguel Hoffman wrote in from El Salvador: Biochar can be a wonderful component to a climate change mitigation program. However, it does not make sense, as some would suggest, to grow, kill and then char trees. So, we ask, what other sources could be pyrolysed and charred? The answer just might be at our fingertips and within reach all over the impoverished world. Throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America, stagnant or semi-stagnant lakes, lagoons, canals and reservoirs have become home to massive and persistent infestations of the beautiful violet flowering plant the floating water hyacinth. Why does it reproduce at such great velocity? Because nature assigned it a double role: to suction every type of contaminant in its midst and to absorb all the carbon dioxide it possibly can. Essentially, its purpose in this world is to decontaminate waterways and decarbonise the atmosphere. Not bad for such a maligned “pest”! There is an added bonus to the water hyacinth. The plant has high levels of cellulose, oils and lipids and low level of lignin. The cellulose, oils and lipids are the components for biofuels. The low level of lignin makes the other components accessible for production of a perfect substitute for fossil fuels. Cyrus Forouhar wrote in on a recently revived laptop: I have an idea for what should be covered: The short lifespan of smartphones and laptops that invariably end up in a tip because manufacturers make it hard, or very expensive, to change batteries and carry out repairs, in the expectation that consumers will throw them away and upgrade to the latest offering. Case in point: I have a five-year-old MacBook that was reborn when Apple fitted a new (and expensive) battery. I am pretty sure that in a few years when I have to change the battery again, I will not be able to find a replacement anywhere and a perfectly good machine will end up in a council dump, a huge and unnecessary waste of materials and resources. We need to dramatically slow down strip mining the planet to produce new shiny gadgets. And Bev Colgan from the western US got in touch early with her Christmas wish: Hello Upside Santa, What I would like from you this year is to free up a few elves to start a project that gives low- or no-cost loans and knowhow to people in working-class neighbourhoods like mine for little solar projects. We have so much sun out here in the western US! And here in my neighbourhood are plenty of people who have the skills to build a solar car port to charge an electric car, or install a few solar panels to heat a garage/workshop in the winter, or put in an a solar-powered attic exhaust fan. But they, and I, don’t have the extra couple thousand bucks to pay for materials, or any clue, really, about how to successfully set about it. And most of my neighbours believe that solar is very expensive and only for the rich people. I’d love for your elves to do a successful pilot project and then watch the ripple effect. Saving the planet – and money – is always good news. Finally, Dieter Lehmkuhl wrote in from Berlin: I just read your article Good company: the capitalists putting purpose ahead of profit. Maybe you also might want to cover, if you haven’t done yet, the economy of the common good (Gemeinwohl-Ökonomie), which is a concept worthwhile to consider as an ethical and sustainable business. Where was the Upside? At the Bridge Builder Awards, which doled out $1m in seed funding for ideas to help refugees and displaced people. Read about one of the winners here: Also at the British Journalism Awards, which rewarded the brilliance of my colleagues Marina Hyde, Simon Hattenstone, Daniel Lavelle and Rob Davies with prizes.

    "date": "2019-12-12",
    "transcript": "When Stefan Koning, who has a history of psychosis, was found guilty of threatening a stranger with a knife, a long custodial sentence might have felt like the only answer. In fact, after a short spell in jail, he is back at his home in Amsterdam. “Bob is a character from Twin Peaks, a murderer who creeps into the skin of innocent people and makes them do terrible things like murder,” says Koning. “There’s a Bob in me who says ‘kill this person’, that sort of thing. If I take my medicines, Bob is quiet.” Koning is a beneficiary of a growing tendency in the Netherlands to avoid jailing people unless it is necessary. One key aspect of this is a prodigious programme of care in the community for people with psychiatric problems. “We work on two aims: number one, preventing another crime, and then on psychiatric suffering and the social problems that come with it,” says Hommo Folkerts, a forensic psychologist and outreach worker who helps Koning. “We don’t treat people with just depression – it’s people with psychotic vulnerability, autism, severe learning difficulties, often in combination with severe personality disorders, addictions, financial problems, no good home or links with family, and often they are traumatised. “Nobody would approve of the crimes or violence they have committed, but there is a very sad world behind them. If you want to mend all this, it will take a long time.” In 1988, the UK criminologist David Downes contrasted a relatively humane Dutch prison system favourably against those in England and Wales. Today plummeting prison sentences have left the Netherlands with an unusual problem: it doesn’t have enough inmates to fill its prisons, even after renting out places to Norway and Belgium. Since 2014, 23 prisons have been shut, turning into temporary asylum centres, housing and hotels. The country has Europe’s third-lowest incarceration rate, at 54.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. According to the justice ministry’s WODC Research and Documentation Centre, the number of prison sentences imposed fell from 42,000 in 2008 to 31,000 in 2018 – along with a two-thirds drop in jail terms for young offenders. Registered crimes plummeted by 40% in the same period, to 785,000 in 2018. Miranda Boone, a professor of criminology at Leiden University, has studied the collapse in the prison population. “There is no doubt that the prison population has been reduced very significantly in the last 13 years – an amazing and, in the western world, unparalleled development,” she says. Half of the people in Dutch prisons have received a one-month sentence, she says, and almost half entering detention in 2018 were actually awaiting trial. Experts attribute the decline to a variety of factors, including more sentencing before reaching or outside of the court system – such as fines – than other countries and the use of court-ordered mediation. But there is also a special psychological rehabilitation programme known as TBS. “TBS is a rather unique institution in the world,” Boone says. “In many countries there’s a choice: people can be held accountable for their deeds and are sentenced to prison, or not, and be put in a psychiatric institution. We have a psychiatric institution that is part of the criminal justice system for people who can be held not [accountable] or only partly accountable.” Unlike high-security hospitals in the UK or the Netherlands, TBS has very specific conditions. People must have committed a crime with a minimum prison term of four years and have a high chance of recidivism: the programme works on specifically on their reintegration into society. If this is not deemed possible, or they refuse to cooperate, they can eventually move to a normal high-security hospital and be confined indefinitely. There were 1,300 people detained with a TBS ruling in 2018: people stay in a treatment centre, sometimes after a jail term, and are treated for the psychological conditions that are thought to have played a role in their crime. Every two years, judges assess whether the treatment should be extended, and the average stay is two years. For Bas de Vries, 30, Amsterdam’s Inforsa mental health clinic has helped him to build a life again after a traumatic experience in his past led him to commit a violent, schizophrenic attack. “The most important thing in TBS is working on yourself to be able to re-enter society,” he says, from his sheltered home attached to the clinic. “I took a really difficult path. I was ashamed of what had happened and I didn’t really talk openly about it. At a certain stage I started to talk about it, and now I am where I am.” Like other TBSers, he has periods of leave, and he now has a paid job and is moving back to his home town and completing a qualification as a personal trainer. “I don’t think stronger prison sentences are black and white,” he says. “It depends on the person – some people need it and others don’t.” Melina Rakic, a psychiatrist and director at Inforsa in Amsterdam, says that TBS cases are always complex – because of psychological disorders but also people’s backgrounds. “A large proportion of cases are ‘have-nots’. These people are on the one hand extremely dangerous, like the woman this morning, who started a fire for the nth time,” she says. “They hurt themselves and other people, but these are also people who alongside their personal disorder or psychosis often often grew up with a mother who was an addict and a father who disappeared without a trace, with no money, or no food, or no winter coat … or nobody who says ‘it’s cold outside – take your jacket’. If you don’t have these things as a child, you don’t learn how to make attachments.” It is difficult to compare figures between those sentenced to a jail term and those offered TBS, but in Inforsa’s experience, its treatment has an effect in reducing recidivism. “There are often calls from broader society or here in the Netherlands that we need to punish people or punish them harder,” says Rakic. “But we know that for these people, punishment doesn’t help. They end up in prison, they get out, then within a few months they have committed another crime.” Miriam van Driel, De Vries’s TBS psychologist, believes a humane approach is simply the most logical. “The way you treat people – also in prison – makes a big difference in how they return to society,” she says. “If you treat them like dogs, people will behave like dogs but if you treat them as human beings, they will behave like human beings.” Gijs Weijters, senior researcher in recidivism at the WODC, points out that suspended sentences are becoming more common in the Netherlands, increasing the role of the probation service. “A large proportion of prisoners stay only for a short period and this is now seen as problematic,” he says. “We know that prison is not good for your life, you may lose your job or your house, and it’s questionable if short sentences help.” Other reasons for the decrease are a decline in the numbers of young men, and a sharp decrease in the juvenile crime rate – partly because of an obligation for police to provide an advocate for arrested juveniles, partly because property is better protected and also, says Weijters, “because juveniles spend more and more time online”. However, there are complications. There is a lot of public concern about psychiatric patients who sometimes do not come back from periods of parole, especially after one raped and killed a young woman, Anne Faber, in 2017. A police union has repeatedly raised concerns about crime that is simply unregistered, such as drug crime, and a report in Amsterdam said the city could not tackle drug-related criminal activity. It has led some experts to wonder if the Netherlands’ low prison population might be a result of failures in crime detection. “We try to give rehabilitation opportunities, through our TBS institution,” says Boone. “But if we don’t prosecute serious criminal behaviour, then that’s not a reason to be proud.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "For aspiring young journalists trying to break into the media industry, barriers to entry can be impossibly high. Unpaid internships combined with skyrocketing rents means often only the wealthy can get a foot in the door and there is a huge lack of diversity – journalism in Britain is 94% white, 86% university-educated and 55% male. A social enterprise is trying to tackle the problem by matching established journalists who have a spare room with interns who otherwise would not be able to afford accommodation. PressPad has so far supported 50 young journalists, giving them a place to stay during unpaid internships or work experience as well as valuable support and mentorship. It now hopes to crowdfund £30,000 to hire a coordinator to help expand its operation. A large proportion of the UK’s media industry is based in London, where a month’s unpaid internship can cost £1,019 according to research by the Sutton Trust. The BBC journalist Olivia Crellin founded PressPad in 2018 after hearing stories of aspiring journalists unable to afford the costs of starting out. She found that many of her colleagues were keen to improve access to the industry, and a quick Facebook post led to 20 willing hosts. Crellin said: “I had no idea if it would work or if people would be interested in it. Journalists work long hours; it’s a very demanding career. So the idea of taking a complete stranger, including one who is likely younger and in need of mentorship, into your home is quite a big ask.” PressPad has about 150 hosts on its books, all of whom are verified media professionals and will soon undergo DBS checks. Interns get their first two weeks of accommodation for free and are charged £150 a week after that, half of which is given to the host, but interns can apply for a means-tested bursary if they are unable to afford this. Media organisations can also buy PressPad “credit” that can be used to fund accommodation for their interns. Annissa Warsame, 20, was one of PressPad’s first interns. She stayed in Greenwich, south-east London with the journalists Kate Middleton and Meirion Jones while she completed an internship at Shine A Light, an investigative journalism project from openDemocracy. Warsame, a history and politics student from Birmingham, said she had no London connections to stay with so discovering PressPad was a stroke of luck. She said: “Kate and Meirion knew that they weren’t just offering a place to stay but they were cultivating this experience that would be something I could look back on when I’m hopefully a more established journalist.” Warsame asked for their advice and feedback after work each day and they had Sunday dinner together. She keeps Middleton and Jones updated on her life and has returned to stay with them for another work experience placement. “They said the door is always open for me. It’s really nice having that kind of connection.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "On a recent Saturday morning, for the first time in months, Tomas had time to go to the pool with his kids. He sat at the edge of the water breathing in the smell of chlorine and realized suddenly that his kids had learned to swim, while he had been working. This poolside revelation was generated in no small part with the power of cash. Since February, Tomas and more than 100 other families in Stockton, California, have been receiving $500 a month with no strings attached. The policy experiment is part of the historic Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (Seed) project, led by one of the youngest mayors in America, Michael Tubbs. As the name suggests, this guaranteed income program works to demonstrate what is possible when people who are struggling to make ends meet have the cash on hand they need to feel and be in charge of their own lives – and the Economic Security Project, the organization I co-founded in 2016, is pleased to be Seed’s first backer. All told, the project will run for 18 months, but we have already gleaned useful insights. With this extra $500, the most valuable thing that people are buying is time. Time to parent, time to rest, time to be part of a community and time to figure out the next move. Tomas had previously been so busy working side gigs he had no time to spend with his kids at the pool. Another participant quit her second job driving for Lyft; simply having one job instead of two opened up all kinds of time and space in her life. That $500 also afforded participants the time they needed to take big steps forward. One participant, Jovan, saved the $500 month after month until he had enough for a down payment on a larger rental home for his family. Sheila used to describe her emotional state as the “straight line emoji”. With that extra $500 a month, Sheila says that her stress has reduced and her sleep has improved and now she’s the “happy face emoji”. The “time tax” of poverty is not to be underestimated. People juggle the logistical chaos of holding down multiple jobs. They navigate the financial necessity of overtime. They lose hours to the inefficiencies of public transportation. Five hundred dollars a month doesn’t fix income insecurity or solve important structural problems, but for the majority of families in Seed, that $500 represents a 30% increase in monthly income, and that buys a lot. A big, important and sometimes messy part of why guaranteed income works - and why it’s working in Stockton – is trust. For the most part, trust in American society works in direct proportion to how much money you have; the larger your bank account, the more trust you are allotted. Our entire social safety net system is largely based on not trusting people who don’t have financial resources. While there is next to no scrutiny about how wealthy people spend their money, there are elaborate rules and mandates about what you buy with your food stamps and who can live with you in government-subsidized housing. The Seed project money comes with no restrictions. Our pilot project is predicated on the idea that people experiencing poverty know best what they need or don’t need, and can be trusted accordingly. It would have been impossible to anticipate the incredibly wide range of things that people did with the money. People put extra food on the table, people moved, people worried a little less and they put in fewer hours at work and a few more hours with their family and friends. One mom bought her daughter a pair of shoes for her birthday, free from worry about whether or not she could afford it. For her, that purchase was about a lot more than shoes – it was about feeling like a good parent who provides for her child, and there is no government program for that. People are working; the economy isn’t. That imbalance came through loud and clear as we got more information about how the $500 was impacting people’s lives in Stockton. There has been much hyperbolic hand-wringing about how cash transfer programs like Seedwill spur everyone to quit their jobs and no one will work ever again. I think most people would be hard pressed to stand behind that position after hearing from the Stockton participants. In fact, Tomas used the money to buy time to figure out his next career move. He not only spent more time with his kids, he researched, prepared, applied for and got a better-paying, salaried job with real advancement opportunities. There’s no way that he would have had the hours in the day to do that if he didn’t have the extra time and money that came with that prepaid debit card. Monthly guaranteed income is a way to start to rebalance the economy. The majority of Seed participants are working. Of course, a monthly income floor doesn’t solve all America’s problems alone – it needs to be part of a larger reimagining of our social contract that includes high-quality jobs, stronger unions and reining in the cost of healthcare, education and housing. Big solutions to big problems don’t come out of white papers or speeches, they come from the hard work of organizing, advocating and demonstrating what’s possible. Stockton is now a proving ground for innovative ideas that can be replicated across the country – keep your eyes on it.

    "transcript": "Hello and vřelé uvítání from Prague, where we’ve come for some c̶h̶r̶i̶s̶t̶m̶a̶s̶ ̶s̶h̶o̶p̶p̶i̶n̶g̶ conference or other. It’s the Prague Media Point journalism event, neatly subtitled “What’s Working?” I’m told that media in the Czech Republic is largely controlled by creepy billionaires, is awash with fake news and is struggling to make ends meet. Sound familiar? Still, it’s always inspiring to hear that the Upside is not alone: indeed there is a vibrant ecosystem of local journalists around the world seeking out what works in their community and trying to spread the word. My own particular favourites from this week: Tea after Twelve, a Bonn-based operation which publishes in English; Outlier Media, a community self-help grapevine from Detroit; Rubryka, a promising Kiev-based startup (which is only worth clicking through to if you read Ukrainian). And perhaps boldest of all, Takie Dela, a Russian outlet that connects journalists to social problems and charities trying to fix them, in a media environment that can only be described as hostile. Prague has not deflected us from some meaty journalism this week: it’s been a big year for exploring alternative economics, outdated metrics like GDP, growth and the primacy of profits. So this week we took a look at the 20-year drive for ever lower prices and the lazy assumption that all consumers want is cheap stuff. That’s certainly not the case in France, where Jon Henley uncovered a movement determined to pay fair prices. You’d be surprised just how many French people are on board. Other pieces offering joy this week: • It looks like the aftermath of a really good barbecue. But could it help tackle climate change? Two-minute read • How to make cities better using hip-hop and poetry.Ninety-second read • Singing the blues: the best way through post-natal depression? Two-minute read • And, for a bit of unbridled fun, the best things on telly in 2019. Hours of viewing Lucky numbers The number of new HIV infections is down 40% on 1998, according to the World Bank. The off-grid solar power generation in sub-Saharan Africa is one of the progress stories of the decade. Here – another million homes in Nigeria connected. And finally, if you want your teen to get a good education, you might want to consider moving to Estonia, which is a top 10 nation in maths, science and reading at age 15. What we liked Articles about the Valuable 500 movement, a business grouping which this week announced that more than 200 companies had committed to disability inclusion. This from the University of Vienna on the universal elements that music all around the world shares. And the pub offering free food to the homeless had a seasonal feel to it … What we heard Peter Marsh-Hunn wrote in from Italy after reading Jon Henley’s piece about consumerism in France. You may be interested to know about the development of Gas groups (Gruppo di Acquisto Solidale, or solidarity-based purchasing) all over Italy, something that started around 20 years ago. Here’s a link (in English). The Gas experience may be worth exploring in a future Upside article. Obviously, Italy’s different from the UK in that many people living in towns and cities still have links to villages where their ancestors came from, thereby facilitating the search for locally-sourced, organic produce. Local GAS groups that source products from areas where there have been earthquakes or other natural disasters often offer a solidarity lifeline by offering stricken producers higher prices so that they can get back on their feet again. Climate change continues to exercise Upside readers. Andy Crichton emailed in to extol old tech over new We are the impecunious owners of an industrially farmed olive grove. Four years ago we took it over, it was ploughed bare, no soil life, eroded. I can assure you massive change is possible with little more than labour and smarts and seeds. Yields up, water retention up, irrigation down, biodiversity up, no contamination... Finally, time for a herogram, from Bénédicte Bousset in Clermont-Ferrand, central France As a subscriber and English teacher in France, I often use your articles for my classes. But until the Upside came along, I was finding myself and my students getting very very depressed … Now, whenever we work on an article like the one about Amazon and the way workers are treated (because I believe they should know), I always add an article from the upside (like the one about kindness). My students love it! Where was the Upside? With the 2019 Guardian and Observer Christmas charity appeal, which this year is all about … trees. The Upside has reported this year about the tremendous power of the humble tree to arrest global warming and revitalise the earth. Our appeal is your chance to see the wood for the trees.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/06/singing-babies-postnatal-depression",
    "date": "2019-12-06",
    "transcript": "In the snug warmth of a children’s centre a group of mothers sing with their babies. But there is no Wheels on the Bus, no Wind the Bobbin Up. Instead, the women work their way through folk songs, lullabies and gospel, switching from Spanish to Hebrew to Igbo and Zulu and deftly following the group’s leader as she introduces rounds and three-part harmonies. This is a singing class designed not to entertain the babies – though they are perfectly happy as they chew on miniature maracas – but for the women themselves. Melodies for Mums, run by the not-for-profit social enterprise Breathe Arts Health Research, aims to help new mothers with postnatal depression (PND), or those at risk of it, combat their symptoms by singing songs specially chosen to improve confidence and help them bond with their babies. No musical experience is necessary. Since the programme began two years ago in Southwark, south-east London, 150 women have taken part. Now it is being expanded to reach hundreds more, as the sessions become part of a big study – funded by a £2m grant from the Wellcome Trust – into how arts interventions boost physical and mental health, and how they could be scaled up to become NHS treatments “Our long-term hope is that we can roll this out as a national programme that would be commissioned by the NHS as a new clinical service, so it’s not just seen as a nice, arty project that some mums might do, but as something underpinned by research showing it’s a very effective clinical treatment,” explains Yvonne Farquharson, Breathe’s managing director. That could mean some women with PND wouldn’t need to use other NHS services, saving it money in the long term, she says. Earlier research, which inspired the Breathe programme, found that mothers with moderate to severe symptoms of PND who did group singing saw a significantly faster improvement in their symptoms than a control group. The new study will test the impact and mechanisms involved further, with academics measuring women’s levels of the stress hormone cortisol and the “love hormone” oxytocin to assess bonding with their babies, and evaluating levels of depression, anxiety, coping, loneliness and social support. While some participants have a formal diagnosis of PND, others have milder symptoms. “They are finding it a struggle to cope,” says the project manager, Tim Osborn. Nine weeks into the current course, the women who speak about their experiences don’t describe themselves as being depressed. But for Bekki, whose son Henry had open heart surgery at 11 days old and spent five weeks in hospital, the sessions have been part of her recovery from that trauma, helping her build a bond she felt she had missed out on. “He was cared for by a lot of people in those early weeks and I felt like he didn’t necessarily need me,” she says. “[Here] it’s just me and him. It’s like a little escape.” She appreciates the way the singing is for the women, rather than the usual nursery rhymes, and that there’s none of the endless competitiveness of some mum and baby groups. “It’s like a release of the tension,” she says. Devlin’s daughter Leonora was born weighing just 2.55kg, was not gaining weight and suffered from jaundice. “I was having a lot of anxiety and feeling a lack of control,” she says. Constantly seeing different midwifes who all commented afresh on Leonora’s size only made things worse. “You’re already feeling really stressed that you’re not doing a good job and then the system is pouring salt in your wounds a little bit,” she says. The singing, she says, helps not just because it gets her out for a walk and into a community, but because it becomes “almost meditative”. “You’re singing these really silly songs, but you don’t have to talk and say, ‘what’s your problem, why are you here?’ You just share space.” PND affects one in 10 new mothers, and many more suffer from symptoms like anxiety, low mood and struggling to bond with their babies. But they often find effective support is lacking and their symptoms are missed. About a third of the women Breathe screens who are eligible for Melodies for Mums are not in touch with support services, Osborn says. The new research project, run by Kings’s College London and University College London, will be the world’s largest study into the health impact and scalability of arts interventions. “We’re seeing growing interest in using the arts for supporting mental and physical health,” says Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL, and one of the leaders of the Melodies for Mums strand (others will look at stroke and Parkinson’s disease). “There’s a wealth of anthropological and psychological research on the benefits of singing for individual mental health, mother-infant interactions and infant development.” A recent study with older people in Kent found group singing had a significant effect on mental health and quality of life, including reducing anxiety, depression and loneliness. At the children’s centre, Farquharson says the difference in the women is noticeable as the course progresses. “You start to see a spark in their eyes,” she says. “Friendships blossom, people walk in with their heads held higher.” Hannah, who signed up after struggling with breastfeeding and her son Kit’s sleep, admits she was sceptical about whether singing would make her feel better. “But actually it really does,” she says, as she prepares to head out into the dark of the late afternoon. “You really do feel lifted by the end. A bit lighter.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "date": "2019-12-06",
    "transcript": "Cutting air pollution can prevent deaths within weeks, according to scientists. They found the health benefits of clean air were “almost immediate and substantial” and stretched into the long term, saving billions of dollars. The review examined the evidence for the reduction of illness after levels of toxic air were reduced. It showed dramatic reductions in asthma and children missing school, heart attacks and the number of small and premature babies. “I was surprised at how rapidly the benefits arise,” said Prof Dean Schraufnagel, at the University of Illinois at Chicago and lead author of the report. “Our findings indicate almost immediate and substantial effects. It is critical that governments adopt and enforce World Health Organization guidelines for air pollution immediately. “Sweeping policies affecting a whole country can reduce mortality within weeks. Local programmes, such as reducing traffic, have also promptly improved many health measures.” Schraufnagel said the findings made sense. With coronary heart disease, for example, low oxygen levels are a key factor and can be made worse by a bad air day. “That could tip you over and cause a heart attack immediately,” he said. The researchers also said health benefits accrued, even when air pollution below WHO levels were cut. A global review earlier in the year concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. The World Health Organization says air pollution is a “silent public health emergency”, with more than 90% of the world’s population breathing toxic air. The report, published in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society by international experts from the Forum of International Respiratory Societies, found the benefits of cleaner air begin in the first week. When indoor smoking was banned in Ireland, the reduction in secondhand smoke led to deaths across the entire population falling 13%, heart attacks by 26% and strokes by 32%. After a 17-day traffic shutdown in parts of Atlanta during the 1996 Olympic Games, children’s visits to clinics for asthma dropped by more than 40% and to emergency departments by 11%, the report found. Factory and traffic shutdowns two months ahead of the Beijing Olympics also cut asthma and heart attacks. Other industry shutdowns have had dramatic effects, the scientists said. An eight-month smelters’ strike in the south-western US caused overall death rates to drop by 2.5%, while a 13-month closure of a Utah steel mill resulted in hospitalisations for pneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis and asthma being cut by about half, and days of school missed by children fell by 40%. Women who were pregnant during the mill closure were less also likely to have premature births. Indoor air pollution from solid fuel burning was a serious hazard too, and pregnant women in Nigeria given clean-burning stoves had healthier babies and fewer deaths in the first week of the baby’s life. The benefits of cutting air pollution persist in the longer term and is very cost effective, the researchers said. The US Clean Air Act is estimated to have saved $2tn in the 25 years after it became law, 32 times more than associated costs. “What are we waiting for? Here’s the evidence,” Schraufnagel said. “If it is competing interests or commercialism [blocking action] then we have to tell the people, and the people then can come out strongly and tell politicians we want cleaner air.” He said legal air pollution limits exist in many countries but that enforcement is often poor. Levels of nitrogen dioxide in the UK, emitted mainly by diesel vehicles, have been illegally high in most urban areas since 2010. But despite the government having been defeated three times in the high court on the issue, relatively little progress has been made. Schraufnagel said the biggest health benefits came from tackling the biggest pollution problems. However, reductions in toxic air, even below WHO guidelines, continued to cut disease.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/04/french-shoppers-rejecting-cut-price-capitalism-nicolas-chabanne",
    "date": "2019-12-04",
    "transcript": "The biggest-selling new food brand in French commercial history began life four years ago with a simple sum. Nicolas Chabanne was trying, without much success, to persuade supermarkets to sell less-than-perfect fruit and veg. “Someone said, would I please have a look at milk,” Chabanne said. “So I did. It was an absolute disaster. Dairy farmers were desperate, losing money on every litre; prices were being driven down mercilessly by the big retail groups.” Chabanne did the arithmetic: a mere eight cents (6.8p) a litre was the difference between a milk producer going bust (or worse: the suicide rate among French dairy farmers is 30% higher than in the general population) and making a decent living. “The average French consumer buys 50 litres of milk a year,” he said. “That meant that if consumers spent just €4 more on their milk per year, the producer might actually survive. I was convinced people would be prepared to do that.” His hunch has proved right. French consumers have bought 123m litres of milk labelled C’est qui le patron?! (Who’s the boss?) since its launch in November 2016, making it the fourth-biggest milk brand in France, outsold only by the most cut-price supermarket-own brands. CQLP, run by a cooperative of 7,500 members who have each paid €1 to join, sets more than just the price of its products. From honey to steak, flour to apple juice and sardines to chocolate, the 30-plus similarly sustainable lines it has launched so far are produced to specifications decided democratically by consumers. Many have enjoyed remarkable success, with overall sales exceeding their target 10 times over, Chabanne said. CQLP’s organic butter has become the country’s most popular brand and the fastest-growing new organic product in France; its free-range eggs, launched in January last year, ditto. As with all of the cooperative’s products, neither was advertised on TV, promoted in-store or pushed by a sales team. The movement is a response to the long-term squeeze that big retailers have been able to put on suppliers in many developed economies over the past two decades. The competition for space in supermarkets is so intense that farmers often find themselves accepting derisory prices for their produce. In Paris last week angry farmers blocked roads and faced off against police as 1,000 tractors from across northern France tried to converge on the Champs-Élysées in a protest aimed at putting pressure on supermarket chains ahead of annual price talks. Demanding an urgent meeting with President Emmanuel Macron and government action against falling supermarket prices, rising costs and cheap imports, unions said in some regions one in three French farms were operating at a loss or only just breaking even. Consumer revolt The basic assumption by supermarkets is that all consumers want competitively priced produce. The cheaper, the better. CQLP might have just rewritten that rule. In just three years, CQLP has won over nearly 11.5 million French consumers – about one in five adults. It has also boosted the incomes of more than 3,000 farmers and manufacturers, all of whom benefit from the pledge emblazoned in big, bold capitals on the brand’s packaging: “This product pays its producer a fair price.” “I have to say this doesn’t feel like a fad,” said Chabanne, 50, who talks with almost evangelical conviction about the movement. “I do think we’re talking here about a fairly profound shift in consumer attitudes – a realisation, essentially, that the big supermarket chains had forgotten what really matters.” Unarguably, “a whole lot of consumers now want to behave more responsibly”, he said. “They would prefer, if possible, to buy healthy, quality food, produced ethically, transparently and with respect for animal welfare and the environment by people who get a fair price for it. And they’re willing to pay a bit more for that.” C’est qui le patron?! is “basically about consumers both taking control of what’s on our plates, and supporting producers”, he said. “There will always be people, for all kinds of reasons, for whom price matters most. But there are also more and more who feel maybe slightly guilty when they shop for food – and would like to do better.” The idea is not completely new, with echoes of the fair trade movement that rose to prominence towards the end of the last century. The brand effectively applies the principles of fair trade, usually associated with developing countries, to a domestic market. It is a concept with proven appeal: roughly $9bn worth of Fairtrade products were sold globally in 2017, sourced from 1.66 million farmers, with 2,400 companies, including major multinationals, paying licence fees to their national Fairtrade chapters to use the mark on their products. C’est qui le patron?! sees international potential in its brand. It is early days, but Eat’s my choice in the US, Wie is de baas? in Belgium, ¿Quien es el jefe? in Spain and, in the UK, The Consumer Brand are all now in varying stages of their development. “Britain has exactly the same supply-chain issues as France,” said David Poussier, who heads the UK operation, which aims to have its first product questionnaires ready by mid-December. “Food retail is a massively opaque business, consumers are growing more and more aware, and many have real questions about what they’re buying.” He pictures the brand’s archetypal target customer as “perhaps the couple in their mid-30s, working parents, young kids, highly conscious of the climate crisis, the need to eat healthily, of animal welfare, single-use plastics in packaging, the plight of the farmer … but maybe unable to afford full organic. Well, we’re the answer.” Poussier said he has had an overwhelmingly positive response already from UK producers – particularly smaller farmers and food-processing companies who maybe cannot sell all their output on the local market, but are wary of dealings with big supermarket chains. To develop each new product, CQLP asks consumers to vote from a list of potential lines on its website: current options include salt, rice, mustard, olives and tinned tuna. Once a product is selected, consumers decide on its specifications, packaging and price by completing a multiple-choice questionnaire. For CQLP potatoes, for example, consumers, armed with an online briefing on the basics of potato production, must choose where and under what conditions they want them grown and stored, whether they should be organic, what the sacks should be made of (plastic or paper) and the price the producer should get: market, break-even, fair or “permitting investment”. Every decision is made by a majority of votes cast online, with the cooperative’s paid-up members, who set the key parameters and overall direction, each having one vote just like everyone else. CQLP covers its core running costs – relations with producers and retailers, quality control – with a flat levy of five cents on every euro earned. Chabanne could ask for no greater validation of his idea than the fact that all bar one of France’s notoriously aggressive, commercially cut-throat supermarket chains are now convinced of CQLP’s approach and stock its products – and that some of Europe’s biggest food multinationals, giants such as Danone and Nestlé, are in talks to develop CQLP-label products based on the same core principles. “It took a little while,” said Chabanne. “But in the end they got it pretty quickly. At the end of the day, we answered a lot of questions they were asking about consumer behaviour. Ultimately, this newfound desire of consumers to make sense of what they eat – literally, to help create it – has an unarguable logic. And the success of the products themselves did the rest.” Back in France, Chabanne is working on the next move. CQLP already has an app that allows consumers to locate its products in nearby shops – and ask managers to stock them if they don’t. He now wants to go further, with another app that will allow users to scan thousands of non-CQLP products and check them against the cooperative’s standards, as assessed by volunteer panels of expert consumers. Even if the process can necessarily only work with firms that agree to it, many – given the brand’s success – appear likely to do so. Long-term, Chabanne hopes the app will change big food’s behaviour. “They will learn clearly, unambiguously, what consumers want and expect of their products,” Chabanne said. “It’s a logical next step, because what drives CQLP is this goodwill army of consumers, hundreds and thousands of active volunteer ambassadors, who share, inform, pass on, visit stores, talk to managers, hang out with producers – who, basically, have decided, together, that things have to change.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "It traps carbon in the ground for centuries, boosts plant growth, provides a sustainable heat source and could even reduce methane emissions from cows. Biochar may not be a silver bullet to combating the climate emergency, but it certainly ticks a lot of boxes. A form of charcoal created via a special chemical process, biochar is not much to look at, resembling the aftermath of a particularly good barbecue. But it is already heating homes in Stockholm, feeding cows in Lincolnshire, and nourishing trees near Loch Ness. “When you look at the range of benefits it has, it is quite phenomenal,” says Marc Redmile-Gordon, senior scientist for soil and climate change at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). While stressing that biochar is only part of the solution, he adds: “If we stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow, we’ll still have a lot of carbon dioxide removal to be doing, and this is one of the most effective ways we can achieve that.” Following biochar’s recognition in the IPCC 2018 report, earlier this year Redmile-Gordon launched the society’s first trials to see how the material could improve plant growth. He estimates planting 10-20kg of biochar in your garden could offset the carbon from a five-mile return commute in a car for a month. Biochar is a form of charcoal produced when organic matter – for example wood, leaves or dead plants – is heated at high temperatures with little or no oxygen in a process called pyrolysis. The normal burning or decomposition of these materials would release large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Instead, creating biochar traps this carbon in solid form for centuries; it becomes a carbon sink that can be buried underground. This is nothing new – in Stockholm they have already developed technology to trap the heat generated in the process and put it to use, so now the focus is on what benefits biochar can bring once it is in the ground. Although results vary depending on the type of biochar and soil used, Redmile-Gordon says this stuff can “alleviate some of the stresses that come from climate change”. Biochar is full of xylem vessels and capillaries – channels that “can carry nutrients, air, water and house the biology that make for a healthy soil ecosystem”, he says. This means that in waterlogged clay soil it can reduce and redistribute water content, whereas in sandy soil affected by drought it can increase water-hold potential. While scientific research has established the benefits of biochar in theory, deploying it in a way that makes a real difference is a challenge. One of its most obvious uses is in tree planting, which is poised to become a major activity in the UK over the coming years. The Conservatives have pledged to plant 30m trees a year, the Liberal Democrats have promised 60m a year, while Labour’s manifesto pledges an ambitious tree-planting programme. “They bandy around these big numbers, but will they actually talk about the survival rates?” asks James MacPhail, commercial director of Carbon Gold, which sells biochar products for use in soil everywhere, from people’s back gardens to Ascot racecourse. Up to 80% of trees planted along the HS2 rail route died after last summer’s drought. For MacPhail, this suggests not enough is being done to ensure tree growth: “If you plant 1m trees, great, but if 800,000 die, was it really worth it? If you can just do one thing to guarantee the survival of a tree going in the ground then maybe trees can save the planet.” Research suggests biochar could be just the thing. Dr Saran Sohi leads the UK Biochar Research Centre in Edinburgh which is injecting biochar made from forestry residue such as bark around tree roots as part of a tree-planting project near Loch Ness. “It really does seem to offer some quite marked benefits in terms of tree health, early stage growth and nutrient management,” says Sohi. “Turning this particular part of the tree into biochar allows the nutrients to be returned to the forest sites in the process of replanting.” Other projects are making strides in integrating biochar into farming, too. Richard Copley is part of the Innovative Farmers network, and received funding to trial feeding biochar to some of his cows this year. As both a farmer and a tree surgeon, Copley was keen to use the waste from his tree felling in a useful way, and he noticed the positive effects of biochar on his animals immediately. Biochar is alkaline, so it balances the highly acidic diet of cows. Evidence suggests it is beneficial for microbial activity – like putting a probiotic into your stomach, according to Copley. Trials elsewhere have suggested biochar could reduce methane emissions, something Copley hopes can be explored later, as well as trialling the material on other animals such as chicken and sheep. Meanwhile, Donna Udall, a researcher from Coventry University, is exploring whether manure from the biochar-fed cows is more effective as a fertiliser than biochar by itself. In some instances biochar can reduce crop yield by absorbing the nutrients needed by the plants – biochar as part of manure could be the solution. While academics and researchers are optimistic about the benefits of biochar, they are not blind to the risks either. “If we’re wrong, and we spread hundreds of thousands of tonnes of charcoal over the UK, we can’t get it back out of the ground. We’ve got to be right. The stakes are really high,” says Udall. Sohi adds: “This makes the government a bit anxious, which is why I think starting slowly and getting comfortable with the technology first is probably a good idea.” Not only that, but there are also practical problems with trying to acquire the vast amounts of biochar needed to make a real impact. Udall says: “In order to scale up the technology, you’d have to plant woods everywhere, and obviously you can understand the impact that would have on the land that we need to grow crops.” Only when farmers, food producers and other industries start putting their biomass waste through a pyrolysis process as standard would there be enough biochar to roll it out on a wide scale, says Udall. But eventually biochar could be made from green waste in urban areas – everything right down to the banana skin lying on your desk, she adds. The key is working out how the source material affects the resulting biochar after pyrolysis, something which still needs substantial investigation. But with some estimates suggesting biochar could offset 1bn tonnes of carbon a year, it’s easy to see why people are getting excited about it. • This article was amended on 30 November to make clear that Marc Redmile-Gordon emphasised that biochar has the potential to alleviate some, but not all, of the stresses of climate change",

    "transcript": "It was six years ago that the American shopping concept of Black Friday really took off in the UK, when a woman trying to get a cheap TV in a Belfast branch of Asda broke her arm in a stampede. The next year police were called to a Wigan Tesco after reports that several hundred people were trying to break down the doors before the midnight opening time. Now one city in Yorkshire is fighting back against the pressure-selling “shopocalypse”. Buy Nowt Friday in Bradford encourages residents to enjoy a day without spending any money. The event, at the former Forster’s Bistro in Centenary Square, is hosted by Bradford Credit Union and the art charity Artworks Creative Communities, which four years ago came up with the idea of creating a Currency Free Zone on Black Friday. This year they are also putting on a free event in nearby Keighley on what has become known as Cyber Monday. Black Friday began in the US in the 1960s, pushed by retailers keen to encourage consumers to begin their Christmas shopping early, the day after Thanksgiving. Opponents to the concept came up with International Buy Nothing Day, a protest against consumerism that spread to the UK under the banner “Escape the shopocalypse”. It encouraged consumers to swerve the “absurd dystopian phenomenon” and the “rabid free-for-all” that had created a “brand of shoppers who will trample and fight each other to get their hands on next year’s landfill”. Ian Brewer, a financial inclusion officer at Bradford Credit Union, said Buy Nowt Day was Yorkshire’s riposte to Black Friday and aimed to encourage people to save their money rather than spend it on things they didn’t need. People on lower incomes could feel under pressure to take advantage of the offers, he said. “People feel disenfranchised if they are seeing all of these discounts and they can’t partake, so we are offering the chance to come down and make Christmas cards, do other crafts and listen to music, as well as get debt advice.” A band called Issimo will play a set, including a track called Money, about the victim of a loan shark. Brewer stressed the event was not anti-business. “We are not anti people taking advantage of the discounts on Black Friday. We are just saying: do a budget beforehand. Work out what money you’ve got between now and Christmas. If you’ve got disposable income and you want to take advantage of Black Friday, great. If you don’t have that money available, don’t spend it.”",

    "transcript": "Climate champions winner and overall winner Nottingham city council: Nottingham – carbon neutral by 2028 When Nottingham city council announced in January that it intended to become the UK’s first carbon-neutral city by 2028, it was the latest step in years of ambitious, innovative and forward-thinking environmental policymaking that has already yielded breathtaking results. It met its 2020 target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26% four years early; more than 40% of all journeys in Nottingham are made on public transport and solar panels have been installed on more than 4,000 council houses. Energy consumption of council buildings has been cut by 39% and it is on track to generate 20% of its energy from low-carbon sources by next year. And last year the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded that the city’s air pollution had fallen so much that a Clean Air Zone was not needed. The council’s vision and tenacity was recognised on Tuesday night when it was named the overall winner in the Guardian’s Public Service Awards. “This has been the year when argument over the climate crisis finally ended and the imperative for radical action became widely understood,” says the Guardian’s public services editor, David Brindle. “Many public services are still barely off the starting blocks in the race to tackle the emergency, but Nottingham has shown what can be done through inspired leadership and gritty determination,” he says, adding: “In scrutinising every aspect of its own practice, and taking bold steps to shape behaviour in the wider community, the city council has truly set the bar for excellence in how public agencies must respond to the threat to the planet.” Making the carbon neutral commitment was only possible, says Sally Longford, the Labour council’s deputy leader and portfolio holder for energy and environment, because of the work that had gone before – especially the efforts of her predecessor in the environment role, councillor Alan Clark, who died in 2017. “He was determined to make progress and drove forward quite a lot of the early development,” says Longford. “We got a lot of stick over the years. People thought we were anti-car, because we introduced various schemes to try and reduce car usage and congestion.” But it has paid off. “When I was talking to the officers about how far we could push this they were confident we could go further than other councils because of all the work we’d already done.” One policy in particular, its workplace parking levy (WPL), was a “gamechanger” according to Longford. Introduced in 2012, the WPL is aimed at employers providing 11 or more commuter parking spaces, with an annual rate of £415 per space. It is still the only such scheme in the UK and has not only tackled congestion and pollution but netted the council £61m for improving and “greening” public transport. That money has helped with the redevelopment of Nottingham station, an expansion of the tram network that runs on green electricity from the council’s own energy company, and the council’s fleet of 58 electric buses that has reduced carbon emissions by more than 1,050 tonnes. “We have a positive attitude to these things because they pay for themselves,” says Longford. “We’re putting solar panels on anything that doesn’t move, really, because it saves us money in the long run and helps support other work we’re doing.” The energy and transport teams have won funding from central government, Europe and other sources, and the savings the energy team generates means it actually makes a profit for the council that can be used to cross-subsidise crucial departments such as children’s services. Next year the council will be going out across the city to talk about what it is doing. “We have a lot of people who live in quite deprived circumstances and it’s not their highest priority,” she says. “They’re struggling to pay their bills and feed their families, but they will also be the people who will be the least able to cope in warmer climates. We have a duty to help people in all parts of the city adapt and find ways to improve their lifestyle.” Nottingham’s policies have not only benefited the environment but have also made a difference to people’s lives, says Longford. “A lot of quite hard decisions were made but people have been brave enough to give it a go. I’m very proud of what we’re doing.” Climate champions runners-up Mayfield and Easthouses Development Trust: River Esk cleanup project “What has wings and spends most of its lifetime in the River Esk?” volunteer Joy Godfrey asks in the first video she made with the Mayfield and Easthouses Development Trust to highlight sewage pollution near Dalkeith, Midlothian, caused in part by increased heavy rainfall. “A sanitary towel,” she answers with a grimace, fishing one out of the water. Within a week, the film, in which Godfrey also shows off slimy clumps of blackened wet wipes, tampons and a condom, had been viewed 2,000 times. A second film, in the Mary Burn tributary, quickly attracted the attention of the local member of the Scottish parliament. The campaign eventually led to a cleanup operation that saw Scottish Water remove more than 3,000 bin bags of sewage debris. Godfrey and the trust have continued to monitor the waterways and press for further action, and are working to build public awareness of good flushing habits – part of the current problem is that the sewers were not designed for wrongly-flushed sanitary products. Meanwhile, the issue of sewage pollution has been raised in the Scottish and Westminster parliaments. “In June 2018 just about every other rock was covered with a wet wipe,” Godfrey says of the part of the river near her house that inspired her action. “It really stank – it just smelled dirty and rotten. “There’s something about being affected by a problem and speaking from there that gives you power. To go into the river, hold these things and say ‘this is disgusting’ is much more effective than standing on the bank.” Norfolk county council: Norfolk assistance scheme Norfolk county council’s Norfolk assistance scheme used to provide new white goods and vital household items such as beds and sofas to individuals and families in crisis. In 2017-18, the average cost was £755. Under the scheme’s new reuse development project, applicants now get quality reused items from partners including charities the Benjamin Foundation and Emmaus Norfolk and Waveney instead. This more than halves the average award cost and means the scheme, which last year made 1,118 awards, can help more people while also supporting local charities and reducing the burden on landfill. The scheme went live in July, after pilots that ran from December 2018 showed the new average award was just £308. Another benefit is that people are now getting higher quality furniture, explains one of the scheme’s officers, Christina Campbell. “[Before] we had to go to the low end of the market, and a lot of those items didn’t have a long shelf life, so they would end up in landfill,” she says. “Now we supply better quality items they’ve got a lot more life in them.” The new system also empowers applicants by allowing them to decide how to spend their award. At Emmaus there’s a dedicated team for the system, which gives roles to formerly homeless volunteers who have been supported by the charity. “Now applicants are entitled to go and choose the items, they can have their own tastes,” Campbell says. “I’m very proud of it.”",

    "transcript": "In a volatile world jolted by protest, revolt and environmental alarm, capitalism is showing signs of twitchiness. For decades, business has been all about maximising profits and keeping owners happy. Now, thousands of companies and organisations are experimenting with broader values – purpose over profit, staff and communities ahead of shareholders – in order to meet the mood of the times. Driving this shift in consciousness is a phalanx of upstart, sustainable businesses. They cluster under different groupings – Conscious Capitalism, B Corp, The B Team, Just Capital – but all share the same central objective: to reshape capitalism for an environmentally endangered age. The best of these boast laudable motivations. In the past, if you wanted to change the world, you went into politics or joined a campaign group. Given the shift of power and resources to the private sector over recent decades, the smart money is increasingly on business to deliver solutions. Not business as usual, that is. Plastering products with eco labels or providing perks to employees will make not a jot of difference if, behind the scenes, companies are still happily burning fossil fuels and browbeating suppliers. “If businesses really want to be part of this movement for change, then great. But that change has to be radical and transformational. If not, it’s empty words and spin,” says Katie Hill, a spokesperson for the ethical certification body B Corp, which now counts over 3,100 registered members in over 70 countries. For a flavour of the changemaking businesses, she points to B Corps’ latest Best for the World list. The selection includes a US bank that specialises in financing community-based enterprises, a locally owned windfarm in Australia and a zero-waste Argentinian restaurant chain. (Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, recently announced that it too had been certified as a B corp). To date, founder-led businesses, cooperatives and employee-owned firms have tended to dominate such listings. Most are small, which makes sense. The larger the organisation, the harder it is to keep its mission clear and its values consistent. Small may be beautiful in ethical terms, but it’s not ideal for effecting large-scale change. If endemic poverty is ever to be reversed or global heating resolved, then big business also needs to embrace this more inclusive approach to business. There are signs of that happening. Natura, the huge Brazilian cosmetic brand, and its subsidiary The Body Shop, for example, now feature among a growing roster of multinational B Corps. The purpose-led business agenda received a shot in the arm this summer when the Business Roundtable, a grouping of some 200 top US companies like Amazon, Apple and GM, committed to “lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders”. Even the financial markets are beginning to prick up their ears. Take the rapid rise of the sustainable debt market, which has now passed the $1tn mark. Only last month, beverage giant PepsiCo issued a $1bn “green” bond to fund environmental programmes – a move unthinkable just a few year ago. “If the old economy makes a change, then that’s how you change the world,” said Dutch sustainable business expert Roeland Dikker Hupkes. Of course, the buy-in of big business comes with risks. Greenwashing is perhaps the most obvious, but some practices are more subtle. After the Fairtrade organic chocolate brand Green &amp; Black’s was taken over by food giant Kraft, for example, it started to produce confectionary that was neither organic nor Fairtrade-certified. Corporations are aware of a growing clamour, from consumers, employees, regulators, and even some investors, for business to demonstrate a social purpose beyond profitmaking. But can leopards change their spots? Most of the frontrunners in the “purpose economy” were set up to solve a specific social or environmental problem. Only then did they go about putting together a business to deliver it – not vice versa. In that sense, it’s a question few of them have had to ask. Take Fairphone. Located in Amsterdam, this hyper-ethical phone manufacturer insists on only using metals and other materials that are sustainably sourced and can be traced back to their origin. It’s a commitment that grew out of the firm’s origins as a campaign group against abuses in the telecoms supply chain. “Back then, we decided that we were not really creating any alternatives, so instead we should become part of the industry ourselves,” explains Eva Gouwens, the chief executive of the maverick phone brand. Yet retrofitting a traditional profit-maximising company is a different story altogether. The Belgian materials firm Umicore offers a very rare example of success. Once a dirty, old-school smelting firm, it has reinvented itself over the last decade or so into a pioneering recycler of waste metals. With ever lower margins in the smelting business, Umicore’s motivation was as much economic as it was environmental. The same cold logic enjoys growing traction in other old-school industries, from energy firms facing peak oil to carmakers confronting ever stricter eco standards. Also pushing companies to transform is a growing awareness among individual business leaders about the destructive route down which shareholder capitalism has pushed the planet. As Douglas Lamont, head of the UK beverage brand Innocent Drinks (now part of Coca-Cola), recently told a roomful of fellow executives at B Corps’ annual European summit: “We are the first generation of leaders who cannot say we didn’t know [about the climate emergency] … and we are also the last generation who can do anything about it.” The growing demand for a fairer, more caring form of capitalism has also given rise to a related phenomenon: the emergence of the purpose-driven consultant. Over recent years, a cottage industry of advisory firms has sprung up, all promising to help companies on this “journey” (a favourite phrase) towards a more purposeful, less profit-centric model of business. In the spirit of business-as-unusual, their approach is refreshingly unorthodox. “Bold”, “heartfelt” and “emotionally involved” are among the defining characteristics that sustainability expert Ed Gillespie associates with this new breed of consultant. To get the ball rolling, for example, conventional companies may well need a dose of shock therapy, according to Gillespie, who styles himself as an “insultant”: “Sometimes this will involve making clients feel very uncomfortable and might even lead to losing pitches, which most consultants are too chicken to do.” Another hallmark of these challenger consultants is their focus on the motivations and mindsets of individual decision makers. Alter how executives think and changes in business strategy and values will follow, the logic goes. David Rosenberg is one such proponent of this more personal approach. An associate at the advisory firm Better Future (also a certified B Corp), he is involved in taking corporate executives on “learning journeys” to overseas locations that lie “outside their comfort zone”. Past examples include home stays for cocoa-sector execs with smallholder farmers in Africa, and for bankers with their microfinance customers. “You confront them with challenges rooted in observable realities, [which] gives them fresh perspectives on their impacts in the world and presents opportunities for positive change,” says Rosenberg. For now, the companies and consultants pushing to reset capitalism occupy the fringes of the business mainstream. This is not surprising: attachments to shareholder capitalism and the pursuit for profit run deep. But change is in the air. And it’s this cohort of dissenters and disruptors who are pointing the way. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "The first batch of mince pies arrived in my supermarket in August. In September, my family started swapping present lists. I saw my first Christmas tree of the year a few weeks ago, before Halloween. And now it’s mid-November, well, it’s wall-to-wall ads on telly, and festive lights on every high street. Of course, it’s cliched to be cynical at Christmas. So instead of moaning about how the festive season gets longer every year, let’s celebrate all the great things that are still to come before we even get to the mulled wine. There are elections in half a dozen countries, including Dominica, Namibia and Uzbekistan. More people have voted in elections this year than ever before. And that’s before we get to Britain’s very own thrilling, if possibly inconclusive, general election on 12 December (full results available on Friday the 13th). There’s a vital global climate summit in Spain (after Chile had to pull out): another chance to correct our over-carbonated course. We get a new European commission at the start of December, and Scotland is scheduled to hold a citizens assembly on its future. Pope Francis is in Thailand and Japan, while Nobel prize winners receive their awards in Stockholm and Oslo. In sport, there’s the culmination of the F1 season, the Davis Cup, and, yes, the beach soccer world cup in Paraguay (a land-locked country not necessarily noted for its beaches). In more eclectic matters, it’s national tree week in the UK next week, along with Thanksgiving and Black Friday (otherwise known as Buy Nothing day) and then a big moment for facial hair everywhere on 1 December, as Movember morphs into Decembeard. It is only when all this is said and done that it will be time for all that goodwill towards men stuff. Of course, there will be a steady pulse of Upside journalism between now and then too. This week, in no particular order, we proudly present: … Probably the best children’s home in the world. Three-minute read The man who planted 2m trees.

I have two friends from Syrian Kurdistan, brothers, who arrived after crossing to Greece in rubber dinghies and have made new lives. They already own a house and a car and are pursuing a good education while doing several part-time jobs to realise their dreams and help their family in Syria. I know several other very positive stories in our little community such as wonderful nurses at our medical centre from Syria and Iran and young men from Afghanistan who contribute positively to the community. In response to our pieces about the rise and rise of sail, Grey Filastine got in touch: I’ve noticed that y’all are covering Greta’s journeys by sail.

And finally Shelly Nicholson sent us a note from Stroud, western England: Skills exchanges are a wonderful way to save money, learn something new and make friends. Made so much easier with WhatsApp. My local neighbourhood one in Stroud is amazing … we also lend each other baking and gardening equipment. Where was the Upside? The Roast Dinner Day movement, an initiative to bring people together over a meal, cooked up a treat in hundreds of communities up and down the UK. Find out how you could start one in your neighbourhood. Separately, the Supercity Art House was launched in London – an initiative to exhibit and sell the artwork of young, formerly homeless people. Thanks for reading. Coming soon: our alternative 2019 knighthood awards. Who would you nominate for a gong? Let us know at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "transcript": "I’ve been called many things in my life, but never an optimist. That was fine by me. I believed pessimists lived in a constant state of pleasant surprise: if you always expected the worst, things generally turned out better than you imagined. The only real problem with pessimism, I figured, was that too much of it could accidentally turn you into an optimist. But accidental optimism is not one of the known dangers of pessimism, a list that does include career impairment, poor health and early death. Optimism, by contrast, is associated with better sleep and lower levels of cardiovascular disease. One study this year claimed that people who describe themselves as optimists had 35% fewer strokes than those who didn’t. Another, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science last summer, found that compared with pessimists, the most optimistic subjects lived 11-15% longer lives on average. One of that study’s authors, clinical research psychologist Lewina Lee, described optimism as “a psycho-social asset that has the potential to extend the human lifespan”. She also suggested that a more positive outlook could be learned. “Interestingly, optimism may be modifiable using relatively simple techniques or therapies,” she said. But how does a pessimist go about transforming himself into the glass-half-full type? I decided to spend a week trying. Day one Before I go in search of the bright side, I need to make sure I actually count as a pessimist. I had always considered myself more of a realist, someone who sees the glass as comprised of approximately 50% water. What’s wrong with that? “A certain amount of stoicism is a good idea to help you cope with disappointment,” says the author and psychotherapist Philippa Perry. “The trouble is, if you are always looking at the ditch instead of the road ahead, you tend to end up in the ditch instead of where you wanted to go.” But being relentlessly optimistic sounds as problematic as being a full-time pessimist – both demonstrate a poor understanding of how odds work. Routinely expecting good outcomes just seems wrong. “We tend to confuse the familiar with what is right,” says Perry. Maybe I am more optimistic than I think, but I don’t even know how you would define optimism for scientific purposes, much less measure it. There are, it transpires, two main types: dispositional optimism and the “explanatory style”. Dispositional optimism can be described as the sense that more good things than bad things will happen in the future; explanatory or attributional optimism is more concerned with the causes behind good events, and the extent to which we view them as controllable and stable. Dispositional optimism is commonly quantified using a questionnaire called the Life Orientation Test – Revised (LOT-R). It is one of the measures used in Lee’s study and versions of it are widely available online. The LOT-R consists of a series of statements (eg “I rarely count on good things happening to me”), that are rated on a five-point scale running from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. I always think tests like this just measure my tendency to fence-sit – I don’t “strongly agree” with anything. But the results were unequivocal: I scored nine out of a possible 24, with the average somewhere between 14 and 15. “You are quite pessimistic,” is the diagnosis. Day two When it comes to improving my outlook, it is hard to know where to begin. I contact Lee to find out how scientists do it. “The Best Possible Self (BPS) intervention is the most widely studied training for increasing optimism,” she says. As Lee explains it, the exercise involves identifying some personal, professional and relationship goals, and then imagining a future in which those goals have been reached and everything has turned out as well as possible. In one study, participants were asked to turn this BPS into a coherent and personal story, and then imagine this story for five minutes every day over two weeks. I find a version of the exercise online that encourages me to write continuously about my future BPS for 15 minutes. This is what I end up with: “I have become a bestselling novelist, and I am so much in demand as a public speaker that I now employ someone to read and answer my emails. He is called Charles and even though this is his only duty, I pay him an absurdly generous salary, because that is what I am like. Thanks to my extreme generosity, Charles has come to regard me as foolish and out of touch. He has recently started to steal small amounts of money from me, along with some of the free luxury items I am often sent as a result of being a celebrated writer, which Charles thinks I will not miss. “He is right. I am not really interested in unsolicited luxury items, since I have everything I want already: an enviable career, rippling abdominal muscles, a special room for my awards. And I never have to spend a second reading or responding to emails. Every morning I wake up feeling excited about the challenges that lie ahead, and every night I go to bed grateful that the only real source of anxiety in my life is the upcoming talk I need to have with Charles about him taking the piss.” I’m not supposed to worry about taking steps to achieve this goal, which is good, because I can’t think of any. Day three One of the simplest strategies for increasing optimism is avoiding the company of other pessimistic people. I figure that I have a headstart here, in that I already avoid the company of most people. The doorbell rings. I think: this can’t be good. Then I think: stop that. The man at the door has a package for me. My wife passes through the kitchen as I’m opening it. “What’s that?” she says. “It’s my gratitude journal,” I say, holding up a slim notebook with the words “Start with gratitude” written on the cover in a self-helpy calligraphic font. “Stupid,” my wife says. “If you’re not going to be positive about my journey,” I say, “then you and I might have to stop hanging out.” “That can be arranged,” she says. I don’t disagree with her; the idea of a gratitude journal sounds stupid to me, too. If I dropped dead tomorrow, I wouldn’t want anyone finding it among my effects. But Perry is adamant about the benefits of the practice. “This is scientifically proven stuff. It’s fun, really,” she says. Life coach and psychologist Dr Sally Ann Law offers similar advice. “Develop a habit of making a note at the end of each day of at least three things that went well,” she says, “to help train your brain to notice the good stuff rather than focusing on the not-so-good stuff.” To overcome my resistance to the idea, I have ordered a ready-made “five-minute daily” journal with blanks to fill in. At the beginning there is a lined page headed: “My Thoughts”. I write: “This is never going to work.” Day four I spend five minutes thinking about my Best Possible Self, putting off my difficult talk with Charles for another day. In my gratitude journal, under the blank space headed “I am thankful for …” I write: “A small child in a pushchair said hello to me in the street yesterday, and I said hello back.” It is only a small thing, but it made me happy at the time and it makes me happy again thinking about it. Without the gratitude journal, I would have probably forgotten about the moment. I am pleased, but I can’t believe I have got to come up with another one tomorrow. There are endless online articles compiling strategies to increase optimism. One of the odder ones involves giving my pessimism a name – something such as “Mr Negative” – so that I can catch myself falling into habitually disempowering patterns. I tell myself there is no way I’m naming my pessimism, before realising I already have: Charles. Other advice includes the acquisition of a positive mantra – something inspirational I can repeat to drive out pessimistic thoughts. My gratitude journal has similar epigrams at the top of each page: “Every day may not be good but there is something good in every day.” Another one, attributed to the entrepreneur Mary Kay Ash, catches my eye: “Aerodynamically the bumblebee shouldn’t be able to fly, but the bumblebee doesn’t know that so it goes on flying anyway.” I am afraid I seized on this one for pessimistic reasons: it sounds like bollocks, and some casual research proves it is. Under the space in my gratitude journal headed “Things I want to remember from today …”, I write: “Bumblebee flight does not violate the laws of physics.” I think: progress. But here is another inspirational quote I found – it comes from Michael Jordan, perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time: “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” Those lines seem tailor-made for the reluctant optimist, because they encapsulate something counterintuitive about outlook: we tend to think of pessimists as being better prepared for setbacks, but in truth it is the optimists who prove more resilient. “Optimists tend to interpret adversity as being a discreet and temporary state,” says Law. “Pessimists, however, tend to interpret adversity as being pervasive and permanent: ‘It’s all really horrible and that’s probably just the way it will always be.’” This has an effect on more than just your outlook. Studies have shown that optimistic students spend more time preparing for exams than their pessimistic counterparts. I copy out the Jordan quote into my gratitude journal under “Nice things I heard today …” I feel silly doing it, but it uses up a big chunk of the page. Day five I try to spend five minutes reflecting on my BPS, but the whole scenario is getting away from me. I imagine that Charles has taken to hiding my things in weird places, and then claiming that I put them there and forgot about it. When I finally sit him down for our stern talk about taking the piss, he changes the subject and asks me to co-invest in his podcast start-up. I tell him I’ll think about it. In my journal, under the heading “Things I did for myself today …”, I write about spending an hour tidying my desk for the first time in months, but I don’t mention I was basically avoiding other, more pressing work. I feel I as if I am covering for my own failure and then trying to get credit for it by writing it down. That could describe my whole career. I re-read a strategy that Law emailed me at the beginning of the week. “Become as self-aware as possible about the language you use in your own head when you’re thinking about some adversity or setback,” she wrote, suggesting that when I catch myself using words such as “disaster” and “dreadful”, I should replace them with words such as “challenge” and “unhelpful”. I visualise finding my desk tidy in the morning, and how pleased with myself I will feel. Later, in the middle of cooking dinner, I discover that I have failed to buy a key ingredient. “Well,” I say, staring into the fridge, “this is a complete and absolute challenge.” Baby steps. Day six I sleep badly and wake up with a familiar sense of foreboding. Visualising a Best Possible Self strikes me as a waste of time, a way of deliberately courting disappointment. Besides, I am avoiding Charles. By the afternoon I am in a dark and self-defeating mood. In my journal, under the heading “I am grateful for …”, I have absentmindedly scrawled: “Get cat food.” I think about an article from the publication Trends in Cognitive Sciences I read that suggested dispositional optimism is at least partly inherited – to some degree, you either have it or you don’t. And I don’t. Law suggests I should not expect too much from a mere week of accentuating the positive. “Remember that although our brains are plastic and therefore we can change to some extent, we have to be realistic,” she says. Perry concurs. “Changing a thought reflex or a pattern is a bit like going to the gym,” she says. “You don’t go to the gym once and expect to leave with a six-pack, but if you go regularly and keep it up, changes do happen.” After I actually go and buy the cat food, I feel a bit better. Day seven There can hardly be a less scientific measure for increased optimism than a second go at the LOT-R test. It has got only 10 questions, four of which are fillers (eg, “I enjoy my friends a lot”) that don’t count toward the result. It can easily be gamed. But I didn’t expect my score to change at all and it did: I got 14, which is about average. I was conscious of no difference beyond thinking about my answers more carefully, in the context of what I had learned. Perhaps, for the pessimist, greater self-awareness leads inexorably to optimism. As Perry put it: “When we become more aware of our typical response, we can recognise what we are in the habit of telling ourselves. When we are aware of a habit, we then have a choice about whether to change it or not.” Once you accept that at least a portion of your pessimism is just a story you tell yourself – and an inaccurate one at that – it’s hard to hang on to it. With that in mind, it is time to sit down and have a little talk with Charles.",

    "transcript": "A dolls’ house with shutters on the windows and tendrils of ivy painted on the walls stands opposite a dressing table adorned with stickers, trinkets and coloured hair-clips. The room’s occupant is gesturing with sparkly nails, giving a tour of the premises and explaining how she picked out her own furniture and fittings from Ikea when she first arrived. This is Josephine Schneider’s House – a grand, 13-roomed residence built in 1906 in a leafy suburb of Copenhagen, funded by a Danish philanthropist of the same name to care for children who don’t have parents or whose parents can’t look after them. Our nine-year-old tour guide has lived at Josephine Schneider’s House for two years. “I like it here,” she tells me. “I get to play with the bigger girls – they’re 13 – and we all got to go to Majorca this summer.” An annual “family” holiday is a Josephine Schneider’s tradition, along with celebrating Christmas, Easter and the myriad festivals that make up the Danish calendar. This set-up could not be further from what many young people currently experience within the UK’s care home system, where 73% of homes are run for profit. Privatisation and a target-driven culture have seen nurture replaced by the very worst of institutional cold-shouldering for some of the country’s most vulnerable children. At the same time, the number of children in care in England is increasing sharply. But a British social entrepreneur is so impressed with the Danish model that he wants to import it to the UK, with the first facility set to open in Surrey in 2020. Emmanuel Akpan-Inwang – founder and director of the Lighthouse charity – was teaching English at a Birmingham secondary school in 2011 when he noticed a gross disparity in achievements. Only 4% of those from children’s homes were achieving five A* to C grades in English and maths at GCSE (levels nine to four), compared with more than 60% among all children. He decided to look into a new approach, dedicating evenings and weekends to research. He called on help from fellow teachers and a broad spectrum of experts; volunteered in a cross-section of UK homes; went full-time and funded in 2017; and, perhaps most importantly, spent two summers visiting lauded examples of residential care in Germany and Denmark. At Josephine Schneider’s House, staff and children sit down to eat together at a vast oak dining table with proper place settings and candles “for extra hyggeligt” in winter months. Once a week, the older children cook for everyone. “Nothing fancy, just pasta or burgers or pizza, mostly,” explains Alexander, a boy of 18 who has lived at Josephine Schneider’s for seven years. It was these communal moments that struck Akpan-Inwang when he first visited back in 2017. He found daily routines peppered with opportunities to build relationships. “At every single home that I visited in Denmark and Germany, every meal was shared,” he recalls. “Everybody sat down together, including the cleaner.” In UK homes, “Children were often coming in, making their own dinner and taking it up to their room to eat,” he explains. “The difference was how much time and effort was invested in getting to know the children.” Josephine Schneider’s is run by pedagogues – degree-qualified carers trained in behavioural sciences and in working with conflict. In the UK, very few children’s home staff are graduates. In Denmark, all carers in children’s homes complete a bachelor’s degree in pedagogy, with most pursuing further training. Newly qualified pedagogues earn 26,000 Danish kroner per month pre-tax (about £3,000), and this rises after a few years to a top income bracket of 35,000 Danish kroner per month. Pedagogues in Denmark are highly respected professionals, protected by unions and properly supported with monthly supervision and ongoing training. As a result, staff retention is high – at Josephine Schneider’s, four of the 10 pedagogues have been there for 20 years and two for 30. This allows lasting relationships to form and ensures that placement breakdowns are rare – children stay for an average of 13 years. With a sense of stability in young people’s lives, time and energy are freed up to focus on the higher goal of education. Danish pedagogues work with the council and social workers with the sole concern of ensuring the best outcome for each child. “The children all go to local schools. And whenever anyone new arrives we invite the whole class over, so they can see that it’s not like Oliver Twist,” explains Annette Olsen, manager at Josephine Schneider’s. “Sometimes it would be easier just to say, ‘You’re feeling sad today? OK, stay home,’” says Sanne Juel, one of the home’s pedagogues. “But we want them to be educated so they’re not sad for the rest of their life. So we have to put the work in, now.” In UK homes, Akpan-Inwang explains, “Sometimes getting up and going to school isn’t even on the agenda.” With education comes self-worth. And when it comes to imbuing children with innate confidence, the devil is often in the detail. Akpan-Inwang points to examples from ensuring cupboards are stocked with a specific chocolate bar that a child might like, to allowing them to decorate their own rooms. Another of the children’s rooms at Josephine Schneider’s House looks like something out of an interior design magazine. Inspirational quotes are framed around a dressing table, sheepskin rugs line the floor, a balcony looks out over a leafy green suburb. The older teenagers have their own floor and a “common room” with a cosy L-shaped sofa, PlayStation, Nintendo and stylish nesting tables. “We believe that just because you were born into a bad environment it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have nice things,” explains Juel. Next year, Lighthouse will launch its first home in the outer London borough of Sutton, with plans to open two more in the London area over the next four years. It is looking for experienced professionals who will undergo extensive training in social pedagogy. The Lighthouse architect has been provided with photos from Josephine Schneider’s House. He is working with a team of advisors including former Ofsted inspectors and young people who have experienced residential care. At the heart of their collective vision for Lighthouse is the exclusion of anything with the slightest whiff of institution. This includes, Akpan-Inwang explains, “locking things away in drawers, telling young people they can’t go into certain places, the jingling of keys … ” “I’ve met lots of social workers or youth workers who spent time working in residential care, faced frustration and left,” he says. “We’re trying to create an environment where those people can stay, grow and develop.” The end result will – he hopes – be a place that young people naturally gravitate back to. He recalls a dinner at Josephine Schneider’s when a boy who’d left for university came back for the evening to seek advice from the pedagogues on what courses he should take. “They’d looked after him since he was eight years old. These were the people he went back to for reassurance and support.” In the UK, children in care are often left to fend for themselves in an unregulated semi-independent sector within days of turning 16. The fallout is bleak: care leavers are 15 times more likely to end up in the criminal justice system and 25% of homeless people have come through care. “People wouldn’t do it to their own children but we do it to some of the most vulnerable children in our society,” says Akpan-Inwang. And so Lighthouse plans to open semi-independent accommodation for over 18s within walking distance of the Sutton home. Of course, Denmark and Britain are very different places, requiring nuanced approaches. When Lighthouse was looking for its residential site, careful risk assessments were carried out to ensure there was no gang activity in the area. Plus, in the UK only about 10% of looked-after children are in children’s homes (90% are in foster care), meaning they often have the most profound difficulties. At Josephine Schneider’s House, conflicts seldom escalate. “If there’s a disagreement, we’ll talk it out,” says Juel. “If they don’t want to be friends, that’s fine. But they have to respect each other and be kind.” Children are given space to calm down if they need to, with a walk around the expansive garden (complete with sleeping shelter and fire pit “for cook-outs”) or a session on the punchbag in the basement. “But we don’t tend to need this much,” explains Juel. Josephine Schneider’s House specialises in children who turn their anger inward. “That is our challenge,” she continues. “Children with aggression issues tend to be referred elsewhere.” Akpan-Inwang visited a home in the north of Denmark where children had “some of the most extreme behaviour”, but he returned satisfied. “Even those children were doing fantastically well. It gave me a lot more confidence about what we’re implementing in the UK.” It’s worth bearing in mind that a typical UK placement in 2014 cost about £2,900 a week, or roughly £150,000 a year; and costs have been rising year on year since then. At Josephine Schneider’s House, it’s 720,000 Danish kroner (about £83,000) a year. However, Akpan-Inwang points out that with better planning, these costs can be reduced and money provided by the local authority will stretch further as there’s not a goal to make a profit: “Additional funding isn’t going back into the pockets of shareholders, it’s going towards making sure young people get the best experience possible.” As Akpan-Inwang and his team work hard to bring their vision to life, they hope others will follow their lead. “We want to work with other parts of the sector to innovate together.” The past five years have seen a 20% increase in the number of children in care in the UK. So the Lighthouse vision is needed now more than ever. “There are no short cuts when it comes to children’s wellbeing,” says Olsen. “I see more and more in the UK and elsewhere a move towards quick fixes, patching people up. But you only have one chance at childhood. And if you get it wrong, you’re going to get an adult who needs more help and has problems later on. Taking a short-term approach to the welfare of children is a real failure of vision.” Not something that’s going to happen on Olsen’s watch.

    "transcript": "In January 2018, O’Plérou Grebet set himself a challenge. For every day of the year, the graphic design student, then aged 20, decided to design an emoji that reflected the culture of his home country, Ivory Coast, and the wider region of West Africa. “I wanted to create a project to promote African cultures to change the image the Western media have of Africa: hunger, poverty and wars,” he said. “I wanted to show a different and positive side.” Adopting a different theme each week, he shared his daily designs on Instagram. He started with food and drink – a topic that everyone identifies with. “People love to eat,” he said. He began sharing designs of foutou, (a bowl of mashed plantain and cassava) and gbofloto (fried dough balls) online. One of his favourite images, showing a plastic bag bursting with purple liquid, represents bissap (dried hibiscus flower juice). “I have memories related to it,” he said. “Women sell it in little plastic bags outside of schools, and I bought it from kindergarten to high school.” He didn’t tell his teachers or classmates at Abidjan’s Institute of Sciences and Communication Techniques about the project – but people soon noticed as it grew in popularity online. People began sending requests for new designs – anything from hairstyles to forms of transport. “I received congratulations and encouraging comments from many people across Africa and the diaspora, telling me my work is important and I should not stop,” he said. An advertising agency sent Grebet an Apple Mac so that he could create designs for iOS as well as Android phones. This year he launched a compilation of the images, which have since been downloaded more than 100,000 times. Grebet’s designs aren’t official emojis, because they have not been approved by the Unicode Consortium, a California-based organisation that reviews requests for new designs and sets standards for characters across different programmes and platforms. Grebet is working on a submission to the body. For now, images from his app, Zouzoukwa – which means “picture” in Bété, the language of the Bété people from the south-western Ivory Coast – can be used as stickers or standalone images. The number of official emojis has increased rapidly over recent years – a greater range of skin tones are now available, as well as icons that represent different types of disability, such as canes or wheelchairs, and symbols that are gender neutral. But vast areas of life remain unrepresented. “I think [Zouzoukwa designs] became popular because they fill a gap in digital communication for Africans. My work helps us to communicate more clearly, using emojis that represent how we live and what we want to say,” Grebet said. One of his favourite designs is “You saw that?”, a facial expression that he says is used in Ivory Coast and means something similar to “I told you so”. After posting it online, people elsewhere in West Africa began sharing the meaning of the expression in their home country. “My [Instagram] followers from Cameroon commented that they also use this gesture, but as a warning sign, like, ‘If you do that, you will see what I will do,’” he said. Another of his favourites is the Zaouli emoji design, a mask and dance from the Gouro people of Ivory Coast. “I love [the Zaouli design] because it’s a mix of many arts: painting, sculpting, music, dancing – and because I like its appearance too,” he said. Tech companies should do more to make sure their products are representative, said Grebet, but he added: “At the same time, I think it’s not really their role, but today with social media we have tools to make our voices heard and impact [what] these companies create. He cited the example of the campaign group Emojination, which pushes for greater representation among the official set of emojis and helped Rayouf Alhumedhi, then a Saudi student in Germany, get approval for the the hijab emoji. Grebet has now created 376 different designs, and he hopes to keep going by creating images for countries across Africa. “My biggest dream right now is to travel to more African countries, discover their cultures, turn their popular and traditional cultural elements into emojis,” he said.",

    "transcript": "“This whole area wants to be a wood,” says Edward Milbank, sweeping his arm across the former hill farm in Northumberland. Small saplings of birch have invaded the cleared ground, but many more trees are being pushed into the soil by hand. The bracken and rhododendron that had overrun the hillside took heavy machinery three months to rip out. “When you disturb the soil, it becomes a wood very quickly,” says Milbank. “But the Forestry Commission forced us to put in Scots pine as well. The entire area could be birch without spending a penny, but you have to be seen to be doing something to justify the [planting grants].” This former sheep and cattle farm, Doddington North, is being converted into England’s largest private new woodland in 30 years, with 680,000 trees being planted over the 350 hectares. Moving down the hill, Milbank points and says: “The reason we were able to raise the investment is that – sitka spruce.” The commercial timber tree will occupy 40% of the land, with native broadleaf trees such as birch, alder, aspen and oak on about a third and the rest managed as open grassland. Milbank, whose company Pennine Forestry is running the project, hopes it will encourage more wildlife, such as the red squirrels that live in an adjoining wood, and the kestrels that already fly overhead searching for the shrews that dart between tussocks. The UK needs 1.5bn more trees, according to the government’s official climate change advisers, to suck up carbon dioxide and help restore wildlife. But the question of how they will be delivered – private or public, commercial or wild – remains open, despite the pioneering effort at Doddington North, which should be completed this winter. James Trayte, who leads the team of planters, has done more than most. He reckons he has planted more than 2m trees in his 12-year career. Out since dawn, he has planted about 2,000 so far today, plucking the two-year old sitka saplings from bags around his waist, then prodding them into the hole he makes with a deft twist of the planting spade. “It was pure love at the start, getting paid to walk around on the hillsides, battling the weather.” After 12 winter seasons, the best time to plant trees, he is more blunt about the motivation. “It’s a brutal job and my elbow is going. What brings me back now is the money.” Milbank says: “Most local people have been incredibly supportive of the project, but not everyone. They thought we were taking away good agricultural land to put in trees.” But, if the national tree target is to be met, he says: “There will have to be some land that comes out of agricultural production and goes into forestry.” Much of the timber – and the carbon it contains – gets locked up in new buildings, he points out. All the saplings planted are UK grown, but global heating is already exerting an influence. “We take them from nurseries in the south of England, as that will be the climate we have here in the north in the future,” Milbank says. Very few plastic guards are used, though that has meant killing deer that would destroy the saplings and putting up fences. “It will be lovely to have deer back in here in 10 years”, when the trees are established, he says. Milbank is clear that management is essential to create and maintain woodland, such as removing some trees to let light through the canopy, a task that large wild herbivores would have done in the past. He thinks rewilding 25% of the nation, as proposed by Rewilding Britain, is unrealistic: “I can’t see land just being left – we are too small an island, with 66 million people.” Rebecca Wrigley, at Rewilding Britain, says: “We are not suggesting people are taken off the land across the country and that everything is fully rewilded. We’d like to see a mosaic, maximising rewilding but also production where that is necessary. Rewilding has to work for people and nature, economy and ecology.” But she thinks management is a forestry mindset and often not necessary: “Woodlands have been doing OK for millions of years without human management, though obviously you need fully functional ecosystems.” The government is not far off track in delivering the 11m trees over five years in England that it promised to fund in 2017: 3.6m were planted in the last two seasons, about 2,300 hectares. But, overall, planting in England fell in 2019. There was a jump in UK figures, thanks to Scottish planting, but only to 13,400 ha. That is well below the 20,000 ha target set for 2020 by the government advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. It wants 27,000 ha a year by 2030, a level not seen since the 1970s, when huge monoculture plantations fuelled by tax breaks earned forestry a bad name. “It is wildly optimistic,” says Milbank, but not impossible. “If the incentives are there, farmers will follow.” Mark Bridgeman, the new president of the CLA, the Country, Land and Business Association, and whose Fallodon Estate is near Doddington North, agrees. “Right now it is not going to happen. It’s about creating a market for timber,” he says, noting that the UK imports 80% of its timber. “That is ludicrous – we have one of the greatest climates for growing trees.” But both say the government now has a perfect opportunity for change with the proposed post-Brexit subsidy regime potentially providing public money for public goods, such as carbon removal, flood protection and cleaner air – all things that trees can deliver. “Trees are the ultimate long-term project,” says Bridgeman. Sitkas double their weight – and carbon removal – between the ages of 30 and 40, but the cost of planting is upfront, creating a financial obstacle. A new £50m government scheme launched last week makes a start on tackling that, with people planting trees able to get regular payments for carbon storage. Another obstacle is the cost of getting permission to plant trees. “It was blooming hard to get Doddington North through,” says Milbank, whose company spent £125,000 and 18 months preparing the planning application. “There should be a presumption in favour of planting,” not against it, says Bridgeman. John Tucker, at the Woodland Trust, a charity that has planted 10m native broadleaf trees in the past two years, agrees. He supports the Doddington North project, despite its commercial timber component, saying: “We need more trees, full stop – of all sorts.” All projects now have to meet the UK Forestry Standard, he adds, meaning no monocultures or ugly clear-cutting. Back on the chilly Northumberland hillside, Milbank is confident there is change in the air, “Climate change is now at the forefront of people’s minds and I think the political will is there,” he says. “It will be easier to plant trees in future.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/greta-thunberg-sparks-surge-in-sailboat-hitchhiking",
    "date": "2019-11-15",
    "transcript": "Hitching a ride on a sailing boat across the Atlantic might sound like a far-fetched endeavour reserved for the famous and well-connected. But Greta Thunberg has now managed it twice in three months – and her antics appear to be inspiring a growing, if nascent, movement in sail-hitching. Maritime hitchhiking has hitherto been reserved for sailors looking for experience on different routes and vessels. But after Thunberg’s transatlantic adventures, numbers have boomed. Daniel Krause, a full-time “cruiser”, helps to run the Sailboat Hitchhikers and Crew Connection Facebook group, which has sharply increased to nearly 21,000 members since Thunberg’s voyage. “In the past couple of weeks it has skyrocketed,” he said. People use the site to find crew members for their boat, or to find a vessel to hitchhike on. “It’s mutually beneficial,” says Krause. “You get a mostly free ride and the owner gets someone who can do nightshifts or who can help out with docking, anchoring and boat manoeuvres.” In most instances, hitchhikers just pay for transport to and from the boat, any visas they might need, and contribute to boat running costs like food. However, Krause has found many of the group newbies don’t have previous sailing experience. “Many people don’t understand about the movement of a boat on the ocean which can overwhelm people with seasickness and make them feel trapped because it’s a very small space and you could be out there for days if not weeks - and once you’re out, it’s almost always too late to turn back,” he says. “Sailboats can only go with weather and wind. Hitchhikers need to be aware that there are forces way bigger than the will of the people on the boat; it might be that the weather decides for you where you go.” There are dozens of Facebook groups and sites offering similar services. SailingNetworks was set up in 2004, originally branded as Crew Reunited to help boat crews stay in touch after a voyage. Now budding crew members set up profiles on the site to find captains willing to take them on. According to company director Jeremy Pocock, “younger people are seeing the opportunities to explore by getting on a boat as much more realistic than they might have done in the past”. He advises that anyone considering boat hitchhiking goes for a test run first, and then goes for a drink with the captain and crew afterwards, to ensure compatibility with both the vessel itself and the other personalities on board. Lawrence Herbert, a 22-year-old psychology graduate, is currently hitching rides on boats around the world to build up his already quite extensive sailing experience. He’s had some scary incidents over the years, which he says beginners might not be prepared for. “I’ve had a big sail stuck at the top of the mast with too much wind which was pretty terrifying. Someone had to go up to the top of the mast in pretty bad weather and cut the sail down, which is about as bad as it gets.” He’s currently en route to Southampton, where he’s got a place on a boat heading across the Atlantic to Saint Martin in the Caribbean, and has noticed a huge increase in aspiring boat travellers this year. “I do think the Greta Thunberg effect is huge. There’s an enormous amount of people in Gran Canaria [a popular hub for people seeking passage across the Atlantic], many who don’t have sailing experience, just trying to get on a boat.” He says these people often exchange cooking skills for passage. The demand could indicate commercial potential for an eco-friendly transatlantic sailing service, says Ross Porter, founding director of ethical travel company VoyageVert. “There’s no ticketed, fossil-fuel-free way of getting across the Atlantic. Now there’s all of this exciting technology that can be harnessed and applied to a problem that we have in the world, which is moving people sustainably over long distances.” He is seeking funding to build a sustainable sailing ferry capable of transporting 200 passengers 480 nautical miles in 24 hours - meaning it could transport people from Southampton to New York in around eight days. Porter eventually envisions this as a fleet which could sail a vast network of routes across the globe – and become the future of travel. A similar revolution is already underway in the shipping industry, which accounts for 2.5% of global carbon emissions, with companies developing strategies to transport goods on emission-free sailing vessels. For Krause, the increased interest in sailboat travel is a logical consequence of eco-friendly lifestyle trends that have grown in popularity in recent years. “People want to downgrade their consumerism and also travel sustainably, and that’s the perfect combination on a sailboat.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-11-15",
    "transcript": "When did immigration become a dirty word? Was it when Donald Trump started talking about his wall? Or when Nigel Farage put that nasty poster up in 2016? Earlier? The Arab Spring? The Afghan wars? When the EU expanded into eastern Europe? Even earlier still? Enoch Powell? Windrush? The hostility towards Jews, Huguenots and people of colour through the ages? Of course, immigration has been an emotive subject for as long as people have moved from one community to the next. Britain’s election will be no different, as was made palpably clear this week. Part of the reason is that people are mostly unaware of the benefits that newcomers bring. Politicians do not see many votes in praising the new skills, manpower, job creation, competitive edge and cultural diversity that immigration promises. And there are few newspaper articles that dwell on all the ways that immigration enriches us. The Upside has done regular work on this over the past 18 months , and this week was no different, as we covered the amazing story of the teenager who ran from poverty and despair in west Africa – and now wants to run for Spain. And this in a week in which one of the world’s most famous, inspiring refugees was finally given his freedom – after six years in detention. We are always searching for stories about the inspiring deeds of immigrants. Get in touch with us at theupside@theguardian.com if you come across any. Otherwise, this week was a week for: • Making ersatz meat from thin air. Two-minute snack. • Lower speed limits in the Netherlands. Slightly longer ride –and if you are at all geeky do check out this map of speed limits all around Europe. • How Greta Thunberg is kindling interest in sail hitchhiking. Two-minute journey • The countries where gay marriage laws has resulted in lower suicide rates. 90 second read. Lucky numbers Armies are getting smaller. That has to be a good thing. What we liked This piece in the Conversation about a zero-emission research station in Antarctica. The subhead could have been “Emissions: if we can cut them there, we’ll cut them anywhere.” And while we’re on the subject of sustainability, we were mildly encouraged by this from the Sydney Morning Herald: the world’s most sustainable retail mall. Finally, this New Yorker piece about how to have a great idea. What we heard Carlosthepossum wrote below the line under the Behrouz Boochani piece: All the very best to you, Behrouz. You are symbolic of several dimensions that are wrong with our society The oppression of people is one and as a Kurd you have experienced that all your life. On top of that we live in an age where journalists are regularly vilified for doing their jobs. These are dangerous times for speaking truth to power and you have done an amazing job, with the help of the Guardian … Most of all, however, for me you symbolise hope. You have shown how to stare down adversity, a lesson we all need to learn in these often dark times. Andrew Fynn wrote in with some profound thoughts. Fifty years ago Allan Savory realised that the cause of the massive global problems of desertification … was not what it might have seemed to be. He also saw that just knowing the range of potential tools-as-solutions would not solve the actual root cause. Instead he came to the conclusion that we all have an onboard genetically hardwired framework we use to make all decisions. And we don’t know we are using it. While useful for the kind of simple goals that we share with other animals – it is not fit for purpose for managing complex natural ecosystems or complex man-made systems. Savory developed holistic management, teaching that teaches, that this framework is relevant for everything we manage. If my hunch is correct, Allan has stumbled across something with profound potential to improve human management of systems, ecosystems, resources, people, companies, and organisations. What I am hearing is that when you shift to managing via a properly developed holistic context, conflict and unintended consequences disappear. Where was the Upside?

    "date": "2019-11-14",
    "transcript": "It took teenager Kone Yossodjo more than a year to run from poverty and despair in west Africa. He is still running these days, just a lot quicker. Despite never having competed in track events until he was 15, the 19-year-old Ivorian has been winning middle-distance races all over Spain. He competed in 11 races during 2018-19, winning five – and was crowned Andalusia’s 5,000m champion. Next year’s Tokyo Olympics will be too early for him, but Paris 2024 remains an aspiration. “He’s young, but he’s distinct and the fastest I’ve seen in 35 years,” says Paco Vallès, his coach. “I had faith my running would save me,” says a smiling Yossodjo in Seville’s María Luisa Park, as he recounts his rise from destitution. “I want to show the people of Spain that migrants can add to the society.” Yossodjo was 14 when he left Ivory Coast after his father died and his mother could not care for him and his four siblings. He walked, hid in forests and foraged food from trees and garbage dumps, before eventually making it to Morocco in November 2014. He waited there for an opportunity to cross the Mediterranean, until a smuggler took pity on him and charged him half the €3,000 price to leave. When he reached Spain in 2016, he was immediately detained and after 10 days was sent to a centre for minors in Seville. Yossodjo had always loved running as a child, so when a friend of his social worker introduced him to a local athletics club, he did not look back. Within a year he had finished second in Spain’s national youth 3,000m final. “It was a major shock to go from jail to racing in the championships in just one year,” says Yossodjo. Of course, he still has a way to go to become an Olympian: his fastest time for 5,000m is a little over 15 minutes, meaning he would need to shave an improbable two minutes off that to qualify for Paris. The 1,500m might be more realistic, but he would still need to trim his record of four minutes by about 30 seconds. But that might not be his biggest problem. His status remains unsettled, so he is not qualified to run for Spain. An eclectic group of supporters including his coach, volunteers and a not-for-profit organisation have gathered around Yossodjo to help him with any needs. During the day he studies Spanish, and at night works as an orderly at a nursing home. He has been able to obtain a residency card, which allows him to live and work. Under Raindrops, a scheme fostered by the not-for-profit Diálogos Para Construir, Yossodjo speaks at youth homes, for social work programmes, and at public schools to tell his story and encourage other migrant youths to take up athletics. Every afternoon he trains for a couple of hours. If he can meet the 1,500m time, his coach says, Spain will also grant him citizenship to compete – and although the pressure is intense, Yossodjo understands he is running for his future. “I will never forget my country, or that I am African, but my future is in Spain,” he says.

    "transcript": "One of the subtle ironies of Soviet life was that its founding moment was habitually celebrated in the wrong month. The “great October” marking the events of 1917 used to be commemorated every year on 7 November, thanks to a quirk of chronology dating back centuries. This was not lost on the locals, with their well developed sense of irony: even the calendar was against them. Of course, 1917 was not the only November revolution that upended the region. Another uprising 30 years ago this weekend upstaged the Bolshevik festivities and steered a swathe of eastern Europe on to a new course. But for better or worse? Much has been made of the disillusionment gripping the region, but as our central and eastern European correspondent, Shaun Walker, found out, in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, people have never had it so good. The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 was perhaps the most Upsidey revolution in history. If you’re not convinced, perhaps these before and after images from Berlin will change your mind.

The number of sick days taken by British workers has fallen dramatically since the mid-1990s. The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions intensity (a measure of emissions relative to economic output) has fallen by 66% since 1990.

Chemistry has never been so interesting… Also, we loved this piece in the New York Times by an old friend of the Upside, Jonathan Rowson, on whether we really need to pursue happiness at all. Happiness is fine as a side-effect, but it’s a cruel demand (Adam Phillips) What we heard Tony Guilmette responded to the Amazon rainforest story: I was wondering if you could cover the topic of the destruction of the Amazon as it pertains to Ecuador. Thanks in advance. Worth investigating, though not perhaps as part of the Upside, Tony. Francisco Sánchez Molina wrote in from Helsinki: Warm greetings from the Wolf Action Group in Helsinki, Finland. We are a small NGO that works on sharing science-based information about the wolf as a social and family-oriented animal in order to influence attitudes and reduce unnecessary fear and hatred towards wolves. We are writing to you to propose that the Guardian’s The Upside could write about the topic of wolf hate in Finland. In this otherwise peaceful, uncorrupted and well-educated country, poaching is the biggest cause of wolf mortality. Even though wolves are strictly protected by European law and Finland promotes itself as a destination for lovers of nature and the great outdoors, wolves are being legally hunted down. In fact, Finland was recently taken to the European court of justice over the way its authorities seem to easily hand out wolf-killing permits without sufficiently justifying their decisions. The present situation for the wolves in Finland is so severe that if public opinion doesn’t change, Finland could be left with no wolves at all. Where was the Upside?

    "title": "'Greta Thunberg effect' driving growth in carbon offsetting",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/08/greta-thunberg-effect-driving-growth-in-carbon-offsetting",
    "date": "2019-11-08",
    "transcript": "Growing concern about the climate crisis and the “Greta Thunberg effect” are driving huge increases in individuals and businesses choosing to offset their emissions by investing in carbon-reducing projects in developing countries. NGOs and organisations involved in carbon offsetting have seen as much as a fourfold increase in investment from people who want to try to mitigate their carbon footprints. Agencies who work with large corporations have also seen a spike in investment in carbon offsetting over the last 18 months. ClimateCare, a company that provides programmes to help organisations offset residual carbon emissions, has seen the amount of carbon offset increase from about 2m tonnes to 20m tonnes in that time, according to its chief executive, Edward Hanrahan. Smaller organisations have also reported massive spikes in offsetting. Caroline Pomeroy, the director of the NGO Climate Stewards, which offsets emissions for individuals and small businesses, said income from individuals offsetting had increased by 156% year on year, and that there had been an 80% increase in income from businesses and charities offsetting. Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Carbon offsetting has been controversial, with some critics saying it allows big polluters and individuals to buy carbon credits in exchange for a clean conscience while continuing to fly, drive and use fossil fuels. But in the past 10 years, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been created and participating companies and NGOs are theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers. The organisation Gold Standard was set up by the environment group WWF and other NGOs to ensure the integrity of projects that reduced carbon emissions and to ensure they contribute to sustainable development. Sarah Leugers, its communications director, said: “Everyone should be looking to reduce their emissions as much as possible first, but for most of us it is impossible at this time to reduce them to zero, so taking accountability and financing the reduction in emissions somewhere else in the world is a way to accelerate the path to a low carbon economy.” Hanrahan said large organisations were being driven to be responsible for not only the emissions that they created as a company, but also so-called “Scope 3 emissions” from the use of their products, by a combination of consumer pressure and governments pushing for corporations to become more accountable for their impact on the climate. Leugers said transformative projects were those that improved cooking facilities in the developing world, for example by providing biogas stoves and projects that improved access to clean water, thus reducing greenhouse gases from burning firewood to boil water. “These are life-changing for people in the developing world and have real impact on reducing carbon emissions,” she said. Gold Standard has reported a fourfold increase in income from individuals and small businesses paying for carbon offsets through its platform. “People are willing to take action and are looking for ways to take action. We see it as a way that someone can feel empowered and reduce their carbon footprint,” said Leugers. Climate Stewards funds a project in Nepal paid for by the purchase of carbon offsets, where 240 fuel-efficient cooking stoves have been built for remote communities. Each stove saves 6.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year per household and the stoves last for about 10 years. The price for a tonne of CO2 is not set globally, and varies between offset suppliers on the voluntary market. The US Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 assessed that for every tonne of CO2emitted into the atmosphere, we sacrifice between $11 and $212 in environmental degradation and negative social impacts. David Hughes, the chair of Climate Stewards, said: “This year, the whole business of carbon offsetting has suddenly taken off. It has been so gratifying to see a lot of individuals choosing to offset over the last 12 months – the numbers have more than doubled. “We are seeing the Greta effect, the impact of Extinction Rebellion, the impact of the words of David Attenborough, the school strikes, all of these coming together.” But Hanrahan said while voluntary carbon mitigation and individual actions were laudable, ClimateCare was clear in its call for mandatory carbon pricing and mitigation for large corporations and industries like aviation. “Our position is that this should not be an optional or voluntary thing. Expecting individuals to be able to make fully informed decisions about such a specialist, complex area is madness,” he said. “What we want is a scenario where corporates are mandated to pay a price on carbon that reflects the societal cost of dealing with climate change and carbon emissions, and to pay for mitigating their emissions.” Case study Flying to and from Malaysia to visit his family each year was causing increasing concern to Shanon Shah, a freelance writer from London. Through his partner, an Anglican priest, he was introduced to Climate Stewards, and began to see a way in which he could compensate for his carbon footprint. “But then I thought, it isn’t enough to offset the flights that I am going to take in the future, as I take them. I sat down and tried to remember all the flights I had ever taken in my life. “And bit by bit I accounted for my flying in the past. Every few weeks when I got a paycheck I offset a few of the past flights that I had made over a particular period. Over the course of six or seven months, I managed to offset all the flights I can ever remember taking. That was around 35 flights.” Shah is continuing his mission to reduce and mitigate his own emissions. “From now on, every time I book a flight I offset it.” But Shah thinks the airline industry itself has to be made accountable for its emissions. Emissions from international aviation are not included in national inventories of their emissions, and under the Kyoto protocol – something there is growing pressure to change – aviation is not subject to VAT or fuel tax. “It has excluded itself from all these environmental protocols, and there should be more pressure to make their emissions accountable,” said Shah. “But in the meantime I think that this is something I can do as an individual.” In Stoke-on-Trent, Daniel Charlesworth, 24, who works for the police, has made a similar decision. He has chosen to offset all his car travel. “I have been researching electric cars for months, but there is a lot of life left in my car and I cannot afford an equivalent electric car,” he said. “So I have begun offsetting my journeys each month and set up a direct debit, I think it amounts to about £7 per month. “I know that even if you have thousands and thousands of individuals like me doing the same it is not going to make a huge difference, but I feel I have a personal responsibility to be accountable for my emissions. And if what I am doing leads others to do it as well, it can help to drive change.”",

    "date": "2019-11-08",
    "transcript": "Europeans are happier with their lives than they were five years ago, according to a survey in 32 countries that hints at broad levels of satisfaction despite one of the most turbulent periods of postwar history. The Eurostat survey found that self-reported levels of satisfaction rose in all but three countries surveyed (Lithuania, Sweden and the Netherlands). It found the most content Europeans are in Switzerland, Norway, Finland and Austria. Across the EU28, satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 rose to 7.3 in 2018, from 7 in 2013. Lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded in Bulgaria, Croatia and Greece, though even here, people felt better about their lives than in 2013. The findings are something of a surprise given the social and political convulsions across Europe in recent years. The continent has been unsettled by waves of protest, mass immigration, a series of inconclusive elections and the rise of populism. Yet at the same time in most European countries, people live longer, enjoy greater prosperity and better health than at any time in history. The Eurostat survey uncovered clear evidence that life satisfaction depends to a certain extent on wealth, education and age. Of young people, 11% declared a low level of life satisfaction, compared with 30% for people over 75. Not surprisingly, satisfaction levels among the richest 20% were on average more than a whole point higher than those among the poorest quintile (7.8 against 6.6). Rich Finns were the most satisfied subgroup in the survey, poor Bulgarians the least. People with children, and people with degrees generally scored higher than average. “The mean rating for people with tertiary education is about one point higher than the one for respondents whose highest educational level is lower secondary education,” the report said. People were also asked how often they were happy. Remarkably, more than 60% said that over the last four weeks they were happy all or most of the time.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/07/bubble-barrier-launched-to-keep-plastics-out-of-oceans",
    "date": "2019-11-07",
    "transcript": "The world’s first rubbish barrier made entirely from bubbles has been unveiled in Amsterdam in an attempt to catch waste in the city’s canals before it reaches the North Sea. A Dutch start-up, the Amsterdam municipality and the regional water board launched the Great Bubble Barrier, a simple device that channels rubbish – especially small pieces of plastic – to the side of the Westerdok canal where it can be retrieved. Tests have shown it can divert more than 80% of flotsam. “More than two-thirds of plastics in the ocean comes out of rivers and canals – so if you have to intercept it, why not do it in the rivers?” says Philip Ehrhorn, co-inventor of the technology. “You can’t put a physical barrier in a canal: it has to be open for wildlife and recreation.” The hope is that the innovation will help to address the mounting crisis of plastic waste in the ocean. Estimates suggest as much as 8m tonnes of plastic ends up in the world’s seas each year – the equivalent of one truckload of old bottles, trays and containers every minute. The bubble barrier is a long, perforated tube running diagonally for 60 metres across the bottom of the canal. Compressed air is pumped through the tube and rises upwards, and then the natural water current helps to push waste to one side. It is trapped in a small rubbish platform on the side of the Westerdokskade at the tip of Amsterdam’s historic canal belt. Ehrhorn, a German naval architect and ocean engineer, got the inspiration from a water treatment plant he saw while studying in Australia in 2015. “At one stage they aerate the water, and on a big surface put air bubbles like a big jacuzzi,” he said. “The small plastic pieces that people throw in the toilet all collected in one corner and that was the kind of spark for me. If you can guide plastic to the side, can’t you do it in a more directed way and on purpose in a river?” At the same time, three keen Dutch amateur sailors and friends, Anne Marieke Eveleens, Francis Zoet and Saskia Studer, were discussing the problem over a beer in Amsterdam one evening and came up with the idea of a curtain of bubbles that sifts out waste but lets fish and boats through over a beer one evening in Amsterdam. The two teams came together to work on the idea, with the help of a €500,000 Postcode Lotteries Green Challenge award and other prizes. The first operational barrier in Amsterdam – due to run 24 hours a day for three years – aims to supplement dredging operations, which currently collect 42,000 kg of larger plastics from the Dutch capital’s waterways each year. Bubble barrier waste will be separately collected, then analysed by plastics action group Schone Rivieren (Clean rivers). Marieke van Doorninck, head of sustainability for Amsterdam council, hopes it will be a successful example. “Amsterdam’s canals have enormous appeal,” she said. “But when you think of them, you don’t think about plastic bottles and bags in the water. The bubble barrier will mean fewer plastics reach the ocean, and is a step towards better regulation of our ecosystem, to the benefit of man, beast and environment.” In the small, waterlogged country, this kind of innovation is welcome. Bianca Nijhof, managing director of the Netherlands Water Partnership, who organises the Amsterdam International Water Week conference, running this week, added: “The Dutch live with the water and don’t fight against it: 50% of the country is below sea level, more than half is prone to flooding and in 2018 we had severe drought,” she said. “This special relationship with water combined with an entrepreneurial mindset mean that innovation is at our core. The bubble barrier is one solution for clean water for all.”",

The loggers had other means of persuasion, besides bribery. They might offer to build a school or a meeting house in exchange for timber. When the work ran over budget, they would demand money – and since the Asháninka had none, they would take more trees to service the debt, according to Adelaida Bustamante, the community treasurer. And if that failed, they used violence. In 2014, four forest defenders from the Asháninka were murdered for their campaign to keep loggers off their land (Ramón asked me not to use his real name). Conflict such as this – over land, timber and forest – has taken on huge significance in the global struggle to confront the climate emergency and keep the world from overheating. According to the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change report, halting deforestation is essential to prevent climate catastrophe. A study this summer indicated the huge potential of tree planting and retention for stabilising the world’s climate. But in the Amazon, remote communities come under sustained pressure – financial, physical and, yes, televisual – to clear their land and surrender their trees. Almost 60% of Peru (675,000 square kilometres, or 260,000 square miles) is covered by Amazon forest. Peru’s primary forest, where you find the lofty hardwoods so prized by commercial timber traders, is shrinking at an alarming rate: Global Forest Watch reported that Peru lost 140,185 hectares (346,405 acres) of primary forest in 2018. Asháninka territory spans a protected area of primary forest across the east of Peru, near the border with Brazil, so their lands are effectively a buffer zone. Ramón discovered that, besides TVs and other gifts, people in the Cutivireni area were being offered a derisory price for their timber. He persuaded the community not to sell their part of the forest, and insisted they give back the TV sets. The loggers retreated, but it was pretty clear they would not give up. Working in secret, for fear of retaliation from the loggers, Ramón tried to come up with a long-term strategy for preserving the rainforest. He spoke to a Welsh anthropologist, Dilwyn Jenkins, who had been living in the region and studying the Asháninka people for decades. Jenkins, who died in 2014, suggested the community contact Cool Earth, a rainforest charity set up in 2007 by MP Frank Field. Cool Earth, which also has projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, offers finance and training to indigenous communities to support them in protecting their areas of the forest. The charity sets up funding for community associations, on condition that the whole group decides how they will spend it (in this remote region, the money is mostly wanted for emergency healthcare). It also uses satellite maps to show locals the extent of forest clearance in their area, and the speed with which the rainforest is disappearing. “The most effective strategy to conserve the rainforest, in any part of the world, is to empower indigenous groups who are motivated in the same direction,” says Tony Juniper, former director of Friends of the Earth, Cool Earth ambassador and author of Rainforest. “It’s a tried-and-tested strategy in South America. It has worked in Brazil, Colombia and Peru: if you look at maps of the forest in those countries, you will see that the areas under indigenous control are best protected.” The Asháninka know all about external threats. For years they survived a terror onslaught from the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who targeted young men to join their ranks and occupied villages that then came under retaliatory fire from government forces. In the 1990s, after the guerrillas were defeated, narco-traffickers slipped into their place, offering a high price for remote land for cultivating coca. They restored an airstrip that missionaries had built in Cutivireni in the 1970s and used it to transport drugs and weapons. After the years of conflict, the Asháninka face a new threat. The greatest driver of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is now subsistence farming, and as the population grows in these more peaceful times, there is an urgent push to grow more food. A study published in May this year, by Princeton University, on biodiversity loss in Peru, showed that in the western Amazon, smallholder “slash-and-burn” agriculture is the “primary driver of forest destruction”. The main method of farming among the Asháninka involves felling trees to make a clearing, creating space in the sunlight where their food crops can grow. In 2016, wildfires caused a spike in deforestation rates in Cutivireni – fires that may have been started by burning to prepare the ground for planting. So part of the Cool Earth project involves giving local people the information they need to make their farming practices more efficient and less destructive. Director Matthew Owen says that while campaigns against industrial-style palm and soya plantations are working, the focus must now switch to smallholders’ agriculture, which is responsible for keeping deforestation emissions stubbornly high. “Figuring out how to support better lives while keeping the forest standing deserves some of the innovation billions that go to carbon storage and better batteries,” Owen says. This much is clear from observations on the ground. After a long walk through the cool of the Cutivireni forest, past towering tornillo trees and mashonastes with their great buttressed trunks, dangling orchids and tree ferns – suddenly, a clearing. It looks like the aftermath of a battle: trees slashed to the ground lying, some half-burned, where they fell. Between the trunks sprouted yuca plants, the staple foodstuff of this region, as well as bananas and sweet potatoes. “People in remote areas have an obsession with growing yuca,” says Aurora Lume, an agronomy graduate and member of Cool Earth’s field team who grew up in the region (her family had to flee their village when guerrillas moved in). “A family of three will clear a hectare of forest to plant this crop. But the soil only has a useful life of two years. After that, they will move on and clear another patch.” The agronomist is helping Asháninka people in this area to boost the productivity of their land for food crops. Cool Earth also pays a coffee technician to visit the villages and advise on how to improve the quality of their coffee and cacao yields – these could be a useful source of income. Coffee grows better in the shade, so a successful coffee business keeps the forest canopy intact. The Cool Earth team convened a meeting in the tiny settlement of Tankoari, before a crowd of about 50, including children, and the chief. As woodsmoke billowed, Bustamante gave the villagers a severe lecture about the new clearings we had walked through. There had to be better planning, she insisted, if they were to continue to receive funding. Lume then unfurled the instrument that will enable this planning: a large satellite map. The map showed the area across the Ene river almost entirely stripped of forest after a government-sanctioned land-grab by farmers from the Andes in the 1980s. On the Cutivireni side, the picture was more varied: dark brown patches showed dramatic forest clearance from 2016, mostly caused by fire, and pale patches indicated the areas where crops were growing. Analysts at Cool Earth made these maps from data produced from Landsat images by Matthew Hansen at the University of Maryland. Campaigners, NGOs and investigators increasingly use Hansen data to compile evidence of large-scale clearance by multinational companies. But satellite mapping is also proving a powerful way to demonstrate to local communities the effect of their farming methods. The villagers at Tankoari were impressed: they had not realised the bald patches were so numerous, or so close together. “The people were taken aback by what they saw,” Daylar Capaquia, a field officer with Cool Earth, told me later. The Asháninka territory runs eastwards almost to the border of the Otishi national park, more than 3,000 sq km of pristine forest, and they had a sense of the forest rolling on indefinitely. “Now the Asháninka are realising their situation and understanding how precarious their environment is,” says Capaquia. “The mapping exercise is a new beginning, there’s a transition under way.” The Cool Earth funding agreements are, in theory, conditional on keeping the trees standing. “There will be a challenge,” says Capaquia. “Once they’ve agreed where they can cut down trees to grow food, they must stick to that.” The challenge was uncomfortably apparent as the meeting continued against the rhythmic sound of axe against tree trunk, followed by the slow, tearing noise of a 100ft tree crashing to the ground. Before the satellite mapping project, the boundaries between what is protected and what is not were never clear. Jaime Peña, a conservationist and forest expert from Cutivireni and adviser to Cool Earth, has been monitoring incursions into pristine forest for more than a decade. “We were clearing areas to grow subsistence crops, without planning or oversight,” he says, shaking his head. “You can’t be too heavy handed, but people have to understand that if they continue to clear at the present rate, in 15-20 years, they will have no forest. Mapping is helping villages to plan how they use land. It is creating the groundwork for a new chapter.” In the areas where Cool Earth is working with communities, planning and managing cultivation has reduced forest loss by half. The power of community engagement is being taken more seriously: the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Programme (Programa Nacional de Conservación de Bosques) in 2010, rewarding communities who succeed in curbing deforestation and managing sustainable farming systems in their territory with annual payments and technical support. As reports show an increase in illegal mining in southern Peru, with devastating results, the forests of Cutivireni have a much better prospect of survival.

    "transcript": "Maciej Grabski looks out over a panoramic view of the Baltic Sea, from the 32nd floor of the Olivia Star tower in Gdańsk, Poland. “My children never saw the dark, devastated atmosphere that I remember from the 1980s,” he says. “Many people take things for granted now.” The tower, built by Grabski’s construction company, is the centrepiece of a new business development on the outskirts of Gdańsk, and filled with the offices of multinational companies. It is next door to the squat, concrete Olivia sports hall, where the Solidarity trade union movement held its first congress in 1981, heralding the beginning of the end for communism in the region. The economic demands of Solidarity, which had sprung up at the huge Gdańsk shipyard and was led by Lech Wałęsa, rippled through Poland and then the rest of central and eastern Europe during the 1980s. By the end of the decade, borders were open, regimes collapsed and the Berlin Wall, concrete symbol of 45 years of European division, was being pulled down. What happened next was extraordinary, painful and unpredictable, as an entire region lurched into uncharted territory. Progress was fitful, messy and often unevenly distributed, sowing the seeds in some countries for the recent rise of populism. But 30 years on from the heady days of autumn 1989, a range of metrics demonstrate that the transition from communism to capitalism has been a remarkable success. Central and eastern Europe over the past 30 years has witnessed one of the most dramatic economic spurts of growth that any region of the world has ever experienced. People live longer, healthier lives. Air quality is better, and individuals are on average twice as wealthy. “This is the golden age for the region,” says Marcin Piatkowski, a Polish economist who recently authored a book called Europe’s Growth Champion, about the meteoric rise of Poland’s economy over the past three decades. “The whole region has been successful, as reflected in the fact that on average, no Bulgarian, or Romanian or Pole has ever lived better than they do now, both in absolute terms and in relative terms compared to the west.” Such optimism often feels misplaced, given that many people in the region still feel left behind. But the statistics show that since 1990, the Polish and Slovak economies have grown more than sevenfold, and those of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and the Czech Republic more than fivefold. At the same time, the nations remain some of the most equal in the world, as measured by the Gini coefficient (one of the leading measures of wealth distribution). There have been benefits when it comes to quality of life, too. In 1990, the average Hungarian, Latvian or Romanian did not live to see their 70th birthday, and life expectancy in other east European countries was not much better. Since then, longevity has surged as much as 10% in some parts of the region, and east Europeans are now more likely to be nearer 80 than 70 when they die. Grabski, born in Gdańsk in 1968, has a story similar to many of the generation of Polish entrepreneurs in the years after the collapse of communism. Young and enthusiastic as the transition came, he eagerly sought out any economic opportunities going. His first business involved repeated trips to Hamburg, where he would sleep in the car and return with a carload of spare automobile parts, which he could sell on for a profit. Later, he invested money in an internet startup, and then into construction. He now runs one of the city’s biggest companies. The “shock therapy” reforms that speedily pushed Poland and other countries in the region into capitalism have come in for criticism, but Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland’s reforms, still believes they were the best option for the country in the circumstances. “If you move fast from a bad system to a better one, you release new forces for growth,” he says in an interview at the Warsaw School of Economics, where he is now a professor. While communism left the region an economic basket case, it did also provide some of the seeds for growth: well-educated societies with low levels of inequality. And crucially, unlike in Russia and Ukraine, central European countries largely avoided a situation where a few people walked off with the majority of the prized former state assets. Particularly in Poland, the transition led to a class of entrepreneurs like Grabski, rather than a small group of oligarchs. “We had the Solidarity movement in the factories and they were like a watchdog. So directors couldn’t go into shabby deals like in Russia,” says Balcerowicz. Life under capitalism Fifteen years after the transition, Poland and seven other former communist east European countries joined the EU. With much of eastern Europe becoming part of the single market, it could be integrated into western European supply chains. For smaller businesses, it also meant operating in an improved institutional setting and convergence with EU standards. “Joining the EU was the key moment, not because of subsidies, but because of frameworks: anti-monopoly rules, environmental protection and so on,” says Grabski. In some countries in the region, these institutional frameworks are still under attack from governments, but the situation compared with neighbouring Ukraine, for example, where the courts, police and tax authorities are hopelessly dependent on political and big business interests, is incomparable. Life under capitalism was not rosy for everyone. At the vast Gdańsk shipyard, where Solidarity was born, the majority of orders came from the communist bloc and dried up after the transition. The shipyard was kept afloat with government subsidies, but these were deemed unfair according to EU competition laws. The shipyard was divided into several private enterprises, and little actual shipbuilding is still taking place. Many other communist-era factories across the region have gone the same way, unable to adapt to market conditions. But in place of the hulking shipyard, a number of smaller companies building yachts have sprung up in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland’s Baltic coast, and many of them have become successful. However, if there is one factory that symbolises both central Europe’s growth over the last three decades and the potential pitfalls going forward, it is not the Gdańsk shipyard but the Audi plant at Győr, in north-west Hungary. Audi first invested in the site in the early 1990s when it was a moribund heavy machinery factory for mainly communist bloc clients. Things took off when Hungary joined the EU in 2004 and could be integrated fully into the manufacturer’s supply chain. Today, Audi Hungaria is a modern-day capitalist version of a Soviet monogorod, or one-factory town. The vast complex on the outskirts of Győr is a set of nondescript white hangars linked by an internal road system, and the plant has its own restaurants, medical clinic, fire station and postal service. Every single Audi TT in the world is assembled here, while engines for many other models are also produced and shipped to Germany and elsewhere for assembly. In one vast hall, giant yellow Japanese robots whoosh and whir their way through the process of assembling the car bodies, cutting, welding, applying adhesives and piecing the cars together with minimal human input. Workers scurry between the halls, many with colour-coded polo-shirt collars denoting their status on the assembly line. The plant has over 13,000 employees, and when subcontractors and affiliated businesses are taken into account, it is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 people in Győr work in the automobile industry, which could amount to as much as half of the working-age population. While Poland is more diversified, by virtue of being the region’s biggest economy, for smaller countries in the region, the dependence on the German car market is huge, and some worry about the effects of a slump in the market on places like Győr. “If Volkswagen can’t sell to China, Slovakia gets hammered the next day,” says Piatkowski. Going forward, the key will be moving away from an economic model of western European countries outsourcing production to the east, and towards one that sees ideas and innovation developed inside the region. Only in this way, analysts say, will the countries of the region be able to fully close the gap in wealth and living standards with the other half of Europe. So far, however, there is little sign of the spending on research and development, or institutional reforms, that would be required for such a long-term shift. “Smart people across the region understand that the growth model is over, but whether real change is politically feasible is another question,” says Milan Nič, head of the central and eastern Europe programme at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “What I see is that businesses are looking for loopholes rather than changing the overall policies.” This kind of supply-chain relationship amplifies regional disgruntlement at being regarded a “second-tier” backwater by “old Europe”. Thirty years since the Velvet Revolution, some of those who helped bring down communism in 1989 are now supporters of populist governments who accrue political capital by attacking the EU. László Nagy, one of the organisers of the pan-European picnic in 1989, which presaged the fall of the Berlin Wall by allowing hundreds of East Germans to cross the Iron Curtain from Hungary to Austria and onwards to West Germany, complains that western Europe treats the new states like “the doormat of Europe”, with a condescending and patronising attitude. Additionally, while the statistics may show that on average even the poorest parts of society are better off than they were 30 years ago, this is little comfort to those in former industrial areas or rural regions where there is an overwhelming sense of decay; indeed, that decay can feel ever more pressing when compared to the progress experienced in shinier areas. Not everyone is convinced that the impressive statistics tell the whole story. Jolanta Banach, a former Polish finance minister from a leftist party, puts much of the popularity of the country’s current populist government in smaller towns and villages down to the unequal access to public services and infrastructure: while big cities in Poland are now linked by modern fast trains, public transport in rural areas is often poor, an issue across the wider region too. Public health and education services are generally in better shape than 30 years ago, but also remain underfunded. “When you look at the Gini factor, it’s not so bad, but that hides a lot of things. What you don’t see in the statistics is the uneven access to public services and infrastructure,” says Banach. The introduction of freedom of movement with EU accession has also led to millions of central and eastern Europeans heading west over the past 15 years. On the one hand, this has provided opportunities and experiences that were unimaginable to the previous generation who were stuck behind the Iron Curtain, but it has also combined with declining birth rates and a fear of immigration to contribute to shrinking societies. In the three decades since independence, the populations of all the region’s countries have shrunk. Latvia has lost more than a quarter of its population, Bulgaria and Romania around a fifth. With higher salaries a short and easy flight away, the process was inevitable. In parts of the region, this has led to chronic shortages of doctors and other skilled workers. In the long run, if the countries of central and eastern Europe can continue to catch up with the west, many of the emigres will be drawn back. With Brexit stalking the UK, there are already anecdotal signs of an incipient return. There are flights from London and other western European hubs to dozens of cities in the region, often cheaply. “We haven’t lost these people,” says Piatkowski. “The form of emigration has changed. In the 19th century a redneck from the Polish mountains would move to America and you’d never hear of him for 100 years. Now you can get a €20 Ryanair flight back to Kraków.” As the economic gap between the east and the west of the continent continues to narrow, it is possible that many of these people will eventually return to their home countries, bringing with them money, skills and networks developed during their time abroad. For all the problems, Piatkowski says it’s worth acknowledging just how fast things have improved. Poland has moved from 25% of German income levels 30 years ago to 60% today. “You can’t expect Poles to completely catch up with Germans within one generation. It’s only natural for people to aspire to a good life as quickly as possible. But it’s just unrealistic for this to happen. The whole region has been the dark periphery of Europe for the last 1,000 years,” he says. Wałęsa, Solidarity’s leader and post-communist Poland’s first president, who was in charge when the shock therapy reforms were made, has become a marginal figure on the Polish political scene, and his cantankerous criticisms of the current government are sometimes seen as counterproductive even by the opposition. But he is still respected for his role in bringing the country out of communism. Reflecting on today’s economy, he thinks neoliberal economies require regulation to make sure they stay fair. “When there was a communist bloc, the two systems were keeping each other in check to some extent,” he says in an interview at his office in Gdańsk. “Now there is no control over the development of capitalism. It’s like a road without traffic lights or road signs.” However, looking back at the economic transition, famously compared by him and others to turning fish soup back into an aquarium, the 76-year-old feels there are plenty of reasons to look positively on the past three decades. “Already the fish are swimming, and they’re doing all right now,” he says, with a smile.

    "transcript": "One of the best weekends of the year has to be the one that is an hour longer than all the others. Yes, it’s time to put the clocks back on Sunday – at least in Europe. We had a little look at all the knock-on effects of changing the clocks and found some subtle benefits, as well as a drawback or two. In short: great for a lie-in and possibly good as an energy-saving measure. But not fun if you’re a shift worker, and have to do that extra hour unpaid. Saving energy is a very 2019 idea, from flight abstainers to #FridaysForFuture school strikers. This week, Nicola Cutcher reported for the Upside on the innovators determined to cut back on the huge volumes of dirty fuel consumed by the multibillion-dollar shipping industry ever year. Otherwise, in no particular order, we also found time for: 2,000 of the world’s most impressive youngsters – all in one place. Two-minute read South Africa’s most inclusive public space. Four-minute read An enterprising way to get kids away from knives and gangs. Two-minute read The dogs of archaeology. Short and sweet Good news for seals. 90-second read Lucky numbers Donald Trump may have confirmed the US will definitely leave the Paris climate agreement. But as this rather pretty chart from Beautiful News demonstrates, he is very much in a minority. Meanwhile, Statista, a data research outfit, has come up with some numbers that show for all its current convulsions, people power is steadily taking over the world: more than half of all governments are now democracies. What we liked The UN has launched plans to mark its 75th birthday next year, asking people to come up with three things that can save the world. Natalie Samarasinghe, a driving force behind the initiative, says: “We are asking people to film themselves and upload to social media (Insta, Twitter, FB) tagging @JoinUN75 and using #UN75.” Alternatively, write to us at theupside@theguardian.com, with a subject line ‘Three Ideas’. Kudos to Positive News for a long read on co-housing: sort of like an estate where everyone has to talk to each other. And this was illuminating: the rise and rise of biochar. What we heard Lots of you wrote in about cargo sailing ships. Robert Melotti said: I really like the piece on sail cargo: we did something similar a while ago. I think an interesting commercial venture in the making is taking place in Australia right now. Government funding is just around the corner apparently, and plans for much larger sailing container vessels as well. Zdravko Podolski got in touch from Croatia: I really enjoyed your article on sail-driven transport. Can I draw your attention to the fact there is a shipyard in Europe, in Croatia in fact, that is capable of building clipper-sized sailing ships. One was just recently launched. It may warrant an article. And John Lucas sent an idea from Toronto Sailing vessels may well have a useful role but won’t scale to anything like the volume needed. Just look at a photo of London docks in the age of sail – then multiply by a few hundred! Has any organisation considered building undersea gliders for cargo? Steve Kirby is frustrated: I’ve just enjoyed your Winds Of Change article about sailing ships once again being used to deliver goods across the oceans. I would be interested if you would be able to investigate why many thousands of new homes are being built without solar thermal or PV panels on their roofs. Constant frustration to see new estates being constructed without a solar panel in sight. Surely it would be very easy and cost-effective to install solar as part of a new-build project of multiples of homes. Installing electric boilers would also make sense, especially as the use of gas is to be phased out in the coming years. Where was the Upside?

    "transcript": "When Henrietta Imoreh was 17, she pulled a knife on a girl at her school. She was arrested and expelled. Her life trajectory seemed destined for a downward arc. Henrietta had been in eight foster homes since she was 14. At the time she threatened her schoolmate, she was living alone in a hostel, scared, angry and alienated. But now she sits in Ernst &amp; Young’s office block in London’s Canary Wharf, where she has been setting up a new role of careers consultant for young people in care for E&amp;Y Foundation. She will take on the full-time role herself in January. “It seems so far-fetched, me working in Canary Wharf with all these smart, white, middle class people. It’s taken a lot of getting used to and I still have wobbles, but I’m basically now all ‘Let’s do it!’,” she laughs. The turnaround in her life over the past four years has been startling: she founded and runs two businesses, has joined other company boards and is a regular public speaker. The turning point was a chance meeting with the Agency, a social enterprise that works with deprived youngsters across the UK, encouraging them to create projects to solve the problems in their own community. Based on a hugely successful Brazilian initiative to help young people in the favelas, the Agency has spent almost 60,000 hours supporting and working with more than 250 young people to raise money, set up projects and create jobs. Today, parliament is hosting a celebration of the Agency’s work, giving politicians the chance to meet some of the young protagonists and discuss their enterprises and initiatives. The Agency is of course not alone in nurturing young British entrepreneurs. But its approach is novel. It uses government data to pinpoint areas of multiple deprivation and then targets young people who understand the area best, approaching them in parks, on the street, in chip shops and at bus stops. “We ask two questions,” said the movement’s Brazilian founder, Marcus Faustini. “Who is the most talented young person you know who should be in this project? And who are the ones who are not engaged at all, who you imagine won’t have any ideas? Because we want both of them.” These schemes tackle raw issues head on, including knife and gang crime, mental health, loneliness among care leavers, lack of employment and training opportunities and negative perceptions of young black men. Henrietta met the Agency by chance when she was 21. After threatening her schoolmate, she had spent two years in the pupil referral unit and two more in a hostel where the atmosphere was so threatening that the kitchen was often spattered with blood from fights. The day she met the Agency, she was sitting in the lobby of the Battersea Arts Centre in south London, crying. “Wandsworth council had been paying my rent late for four years and, at 21, the arrears they’d accumulated were suddenly my problem,” she remembered. “I was on my own, £2,000 in debt, with an eviction letter in my hand.” But then what Henrietta describes as a miracle struck: the Agency came to talk to her. “They changed the direction and course of my life. It’s 100% because of them that I’m here now,” she said, gazing out over Canary Wharf and grinning fit to burst. The Agency works by paying young people a small stipend to compete to participate in a three-part programme. They must identify a social need in their community, come up with a business idea to solve it and pitch their ideas to a panel of industry experts. Three successful bidders are awarded £2,000 each year to get their ideas off the ground. Those who are not successful are encouraged to join other schemes or offered support but no funding to continue with their own idea. Henrietta’s project was Redefine, a theatre company for care leavers. “When my project was chosen by the panel, for the first time in my life I felt proud of myself. I felt autonomy, responsibility and a sense of agency. I’ve always had external agencies – be it a teacher, a social worker, a sexual adviser, a counsellor, a mental health therapist – talking for me, but this time I could talk for myself,” she said. One weekday evening in Walthamstow, a deprived area of north-east London, a group of local teenagers are just setting out on their own journey with the Agency. Just 15, shy, gawky Ciaran makes a conscious effort to maintain eye contact and speak clearly. Using his own experience of knife crime and gangs, he is working to set up a sports club that provides a safe space for young people to talk about knives and gang membership, then offer them a route out. “I joined a gang because I wanted a second home,” he said. “That’s what my sports club will give these children: the chance to swap their gang for other groups that really will help them get the best out of their lives.” Faidat Ope is 19 and has come down for the workshop from Moston in Manchester, where the Agency has a thriving programme. “They recruited me outside the KFC,” said Ope, who has started a business to encourage young women to go into elite sport. “I had literally no intention of turning up, but when I heard what they were offering, I just thought it was too good to be true.” The Agency believes in giving its proteges freedom to build teams, test ideas, make it happen. With that freedom comes responsibility. “And the young people always rise to the challenge,” said Roisin Feeny of the Battersea Arts Centre, one of the key forces behind the social enterprise. “They grab that responsibility and work like they’ve never worked before because they are proud of their own idea, which has been born from their own imagination, passion, dedication, frustrations and hard work.” The Agency UK is a Battersea Arts Centre and Manchester’s Contact programme devised in partnership with People’s Palace Projects. This year’s programme in Waltham Forest was funded by and part of the Mayor of London Borough of Culture.",

    "transcript": "They fan out across the seas like a giant maritime dance, a ballet of tens of thousands of vessels delivering the physical stuff that has become indispensable to our way of life: commodities and cars, white goods and gas and grains, timber and technology. But shipping – a vast industry that moves trillions of pounds-worth of goods each year – is facing an environmental reckoning. Ships burn the dirtiest oil, known as bunker fuel; a waste product from the refinery process, literally scraping the bottom of the barrel, the crud in crude. It’s so thick that you could walk on it at room temperature. As a result, shipping is a major polluter – responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions. Not surprisingly, innovators are starting to wonder if there is another way. “Around 90% of everything we consume [in Britain] spends some time at sea, so we urgently need to make the transportation of goods more sustainable,” says Will Templeman, an environmental scientist-turned-entrepreneur. Templeman’s eureka moment came during a visit to the supermarket when he was agonising over the food miles in his trolley. He wondered if it would be possible to transport things such as coffee and chocolate with zero emissions. Then he remembered that this was how goods used to travel. By sailing ship. A quick online search revealed that a Dutch company was doing exactly that. The owners of Fairtransport were inspired to revive sail cargo after witnessing at first hand the yellow smog caused by commercial vessels. They restored two ships, a 70-year-old minesweeper renamed the Tres Hombres and a wooden ketch called Nordlys that dates back to 1873. Templeman arranged to board the Tres Hombres, sailing from the Azores to the Netherlands. “I was watching the ocean and it came like a ghost ship through the dawn mist. It looked like a pirate vessel. I was so excited.” He dreamed of launching his own ship but realised that the first step was to make full use of the sailing vessels already in service. He set up as a broker and together with his business partner, Will Adeney, went in pursuit of products to sell. They found their perfect olive oil in Portugal and arranged to have it shipped to Devon on board the Nordlys. They later sourced coffee beans in Colombia, and shipped them to Europe on the Tres Hombres. Their business, Shipped by Sail, was born. It joined a growing network of brokers and sailors passionate about transporting goods by wind power. The next step: to boost demand for this kind of transportation. “Consumers already understand organic produce and fair trade, and the next step is clean transport,” says Cornelius Bockermann, who founded Timbercoast, a German sail cargo company that has restored a schooner from 1920, and is now refitting a second. Clean transport is the missing link, as many so-called sustainable or ethical goods are currently carried on ships that pollute the air and sea. The perfect example of this is plant-based meat, shipped around the world from California. British couple Marcus and Freya Pomeroy-Rowden built their ship, the Grayhound, as a replica of an 18th-century lugger, and carry cargo between the UK and France, bringing West Country ale to Brittany and French wine to Cornwall. They supply small businesses along the way, for example providing wines to Dibble &amp; Grub on the Isles of Scilly. The couple enjoy the lifestyle of spending months at sea, making a living, while making a difference. Marcus says they’re bringing trade back to a human scale. “We’re taking quality products and transporting them direct to a distributor. We can understand and explain the whole chain for our products, from manufacture to the table.” In France, TransOceanic Wind Transport has developed a labelling system with a voyage number, allowing the customer to see how products reached them. Broker Alex Geldenhuys launched New Dawn Traders in the UK about six years ago and is still developing her “voyage co-op” model, bringing together farmers, ships and buyers. Geldenhuys has been inspired by local food communities and vegetable box schemes and wants to extend that movement overseas, building relationships with distant farmers to bring ethically produced, high-quality produce to the UK with a carbon footprint that is close to zero. She is seeking “port allies” to promote the idea in coastal communities, encouraging customers to pre-order products from the ships and turning collection events at the docks into celebrations of the whole process. A few weeks ago a French schooner, De Gallant, sailed into Bristol laden with produce from Portugal; the first time a tall ship had brought cargo to the city for decades. It was an emotional moment for Geldenhuys and the climax of years of work.“It was beautiful to watch her sailing in under the suspension bridge,” she says. Local people milled around the ship, sampling olive oil, almonds and wines. Geldenhuys acknowledges that currently she can only deliver to her customers twice a year. Templeman says: “Restaurants and other businesses need a regular supply to be reliable. So we’re warehousing goods.” Olive oil on De Gallant was transported by electric van to a restaurant in Bristol. The biggest challenge for sail cargo is scale. There are currently only a few small ships operating. Most companies feel that the time is ripe for expansion and have plans to build larger vessels. One of the founders of Fairtransport, Jorne Langelaan, has set up a new venture called EcoClipper to facilitate emission-free shipping worldwide. He is planning for more sailing ships running more routes more frequently. In Costa Rica, Canadian Danielle Doggett is building a sailing ship called Ceiba, which looks set to become the largest in the world. The project uses tropical trees that have fallen in storms, and more trees are planted as the building proceeds. Ceiba will be able to carry 250 tonnes of cargo (Tres Hombres and De Gallant take 35 tonnes), which is equivalent to around 10 containers. Yet this is still much smaller than the historic tea clippers, such as the Cutty Sark, and dwarfed by the largest modern container ships, which can carry more than 20,000. The shipping industry knows that change is on the horizon. From next year new regulations will further limit sulphur oxide emissions from ships. The International Maritime Organization has announced its ambition to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The world’s largest shipping company, Maersk, has gone further, pledging to be carbon-neutral by 2050. Templeman acknowledges that the largest companies want to make their fleets more energy-efficient, but points out: “We’re coming from the opposite direction and offering emission-free shipping right now, while asking what sail shipping could have been with another 100 years of development.” Marcus Pomeroy-Rowden adds: “We’re waving a flag to say the world can’t carry on as it is. We’re also showing what can be done in a different way.” Bockermann stresses that industrial shipping is only cheap because it externalises the environmental costs. “What you normally pay a shipping company doesn’t account for the damage to the environment, pollution or health. Our costs are comparatively high but if you had to pay for the damage of conventional shipping then we wouldn’t seem expensive.” Geldenhuys adds: “We might not be the solution to how everything is shipped in the world but we can make people think about what they’re buying and how it’s getting here. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. But we can all do something. We don’t need one solution to everything, we need a thousand solutions that can exist simultaneously.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "The world’s largest global forum for young leaders will open on Tuesday, as more than 2,000 young people from across the world converge on London. One Young World’s 10th annual summit will welcome young delegates from more than 190 countries as well as political and humanitarian leaders, including the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, Sir Richard Branson, Sir John Major and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. “Our young delegates are founders, activists and entrepreneurs in their own right, united by a common goal to resolve some of the world’s most pressing challenges – from climate change and violent extremism to sexual violence and poverty,” said Kate Robertson, a cofounder of the UK-based not-for-profit organisation. In a world where the most recognisable climate activist is a 16-year-old girl from Sweden, Robertson said: “At the heart of every global threat is a failure of leadership. This new generation is the most informed, most educated, most connected generation in human history.” The organisation estimates that almost 21 million young people have been impacted by its ongoing programme of mentoring across the world. The Duchess of Sussex, the singer Ellie Goulding, the supermodel Leomie Anderson and Edward Enninful, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, will also attend the annual four-day summit, which will be London’s largest and most international event since the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The summit will also feature speeches from 30 global chief executives, including Alan Jope of Unilever, James Quincey of Coca Cola, Bram Schot of Audi, and Feike Sijbesma from DSM. They will be speaking to some would-be leaders of the future, among them: Madhav Datt Datt founded Green the Gene as a small environmental club in his school when he was eight years old. The organisation is now one of the world’s largest youth-run environmental non-profits. It has projects in 62 countries and has mobilised more than 7,000 young people, all under 24, to build tangible solutions for communities facing acute climate crisis. Now 23, Datt has created a number of technology and data projects to address specific problems, including low-cost water filtration units, providing safe water to more than 40,000 people in rural Tanzania, recycling 3,000,000+ litres of swimming pool water annually in Haryana in India and planting more than 1,500,000 trees in Gambia and 600,000 in India. As a software engineering intern at Google, Datt developed machine-learning algorithms for Nest thermostat energy demand response programs, to reduce energy used by home heating/cooling systems during peak demand times. I learned about the climate crisis at firsthand: the water level in our local dam had fallen by 2ft, which meant our water and electricity was severely rationed. There was nothing abstract about the issue for me. Starting the environmental club, planting trees and talking to local shopkeepers about plastic bags were things I couldn’t not do. One of the biggest things that being young gave me was the power to go up against huge issues because I simply didn’t appreciate that they were widely regarded as impossible problems. Bella Burgemeister Burgemeister was 10 when she decided to write a book to help school-aged children understand the climate crisis. The book, now in its second edition, is in every school in her community in the south-west of Western Australia. In the past three years, Burgemeister has spoken to 5,000 children and 8,000 adults in schools, conferences and meetings. She is a climate activist and organiser. It was tough, aged just 10, to get my head around things like economic growth and responsible consumption but it’s important that children understand these issues because for most of my life, the major political parties have done as little as they can get away with when it comes to climate change. Young people like me are the ones who will live with the consequences of inaction on climate. That was a huge motivator for me. Some politicians and local councillors said I was too young but I didn’t care: I knew what I was doing was right. Edgar Edmund Edmund founded Green Venture Recycles, a company that turns plastic waste into affordable building products, when he was 14. The Tanzanian company has already turned more than 20m plastic bags into 20,000 bricks. I was 12 when I became aware that climate change was causing the floods that regularly destroyed my community. The flood waters were always full of plastic waste. When I was 15, I had a lightbulb moment: I realised that plastic was harder after being heated, which meant I could use the plastic waste to rebuild my community’s homes strong enough to withstand the floods. It was one solution to two problems. I asked myself whether I was too young to deal with this but I realised that if I had to wait for someone else to solve the problem, it would be too late. I designed my first machine using $20 of savings. It took me a year of hard work but after I’d finished, I took it to a science fair and won $100. I used that money to make a more efficient machine which was nominated for a prize in South Africa. I won $15,000 in that competition and used it to create an electric machine. Then I was invited to Sweden and won $7,000 and met investors who helped me get the machine into production. Brighton Kaoma Growing up in the Zambian city of Kitwe, 12 -year-old Kaoma saw the impact of climate breakdown firsthand: as floods and droughts began to destroy his community, he found he was having to walk an extra mile to fetch water and suffered repeated respiratory infections because of the toxic emissions from nearby copper mines. When he was 14, Kaoma asked a local radio station if he could present a show on the environment. Environmental Watch became one of the station’s most popular programmes, educating listeners about the problems affecting them – from global heating and deforestation to pollution – and how they could help. Now 25, Kaoma has founded Agents of Change Foundation, training young people to be agents of change in their community. It has trained 260 children so far, many taking up leadership positions in their own communities. I mobilised my community, we planted trees, I organised marches, opened conservation clubs in schools across the area. By the time I approached the radio station, they had already heard about me and my work. Being so young meant I was free-spirited: I wasn’t afraid on my programme to call a spade a spade. I called to task multinationals and government. People said I was too young. They threatened me by saying my life would be affected by getting on the nerves of everyone from government to local business. But I was fearless. I was too scared of my future, living in a world with no resources other than those that had been polluted, to let them scare me. Noga Levy-Rapoport Levy-Rapoport, 17, is a core UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal. She led her first London climate strike at 16. I have aways been aware of climate change but we all grew up being told that if we recycled more and switched off the lights, we would save the planet. I realised as I got older that that’s wrong. I realised that I couldn’t plan my future 20 to 30 years ahead because the world was going to hit a brick wall: it would descend into chaos. Young people have so much power because we’re so angry. We’re growing up in climate change and amid political disasters. There’s always a risk that adults will think that we will sort this out but we’re really clear: we don’t have time for us to grow up before a solution is found. We’re very clear that it’s your mess and you must clear it up. Kehkashan Basu Winner of the 2016 International Children’s Peace Prize, Kehkashan Basu has been campaigning on behalf of children’s rights, gender quality and climate change since she was 8 years old. When I was 8, I planted my first tree and began talking to the children and grown ups around me about environmental issues. I realised that the children were so much more responsive and enthusiastic than the adults I was speaking to, so I determined to work with children instead, informing them about environmental issues and what they could do about it. Young activists have an advantage over adults because we have an uninhibited view of the world. We’re not affected by cynicism or by awareness of how big problems are. We are determined to solve problems and are truly open to new solutions. The world needs more of that attitude.

    "date": "2019-10-20",
    "transcript": "Efforts to improve early cancer detection rates have been given a boost with a new major international alliance of researchers backed by £55m of funding. The unit will bring together six universities and charities across the UK and the US to share expertise, ideas and resources to increase the scale of research. The hope is to improve understanding of how cancer arises, develop tests and imaging techniques and design clinical trials to speedily bring innovations to the public. The earlier cancers are detected, the easier they can be treated and the better the chance of survival. At present, there are routine screening programmes in the UK for bowel, breast and cervical cancer, while targeted screening for lung cancer is being piloted. But while experts say these programmes save lives there is more to be done: current methods do not pick up all cases while for many cancers no screening technologies exist. “There’s still a major unmet need,” said Prof David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, which is part of the alliance and is contributing £40m over the next five years. “In fact around half of cancers are still diagnosed at an advanced stage and the outcomes for those people are very poor.” The £55m collaboration, dubbed the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED), will also delve into knotty issues such as why many people skip screening appointments, and explore how new techniques can be made easily accessible. “With this alliance one of the things that we are very committed to is taking things all the way through from the bench to the bedside,” said Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald of the University of Cambridge, another of the UK institutions. There are even hopes it might one day be possible to offer a tailored approach to prevention whether through surgery or drugs.“There could eventually be drugs that we can give you that nip things in the bud because we can predict what is likely to go wrong in you,” said Crosby. The alliance is looking to develop simple detection techniques based on blood, urine or even nasal swab samples, as well as working with sophisticated imaging techniques such as hyperpolarised MRI – this allows researchers to investigate how cancer cells generate energy and is showing promise in prostate cancer research. Prof Robert Bristow of the University of Manchester, which is also part of the alliance, said another project involves collecting pre-cancerous cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells from individuals with tissues at high risk of cancer and 3D printing them. This will allow scientists to change conditions such as oxygen levels or nutrients to explore what might trigger cells to become cancerous – potentially shedding light on the characteristics of early cancers and even ways to prevent them. “In a human being we never get to see a cancer being born,” said Crosby, adding that established cancers might behave differently to early ones. “If you can essentially give birth to a cancer in a piece of synthetic human tissue in the lab, you can see what it is like on day one and hopefully be able to detect and intercept it,” he said. The researchers acknowledged that some routine screening programmes, including for breast cancer, have been criticised for over diagnosis – a situation where cancers that would not have caused harm are found, often leading to unnecessary treatment. However, they say the alliance will explore techniques that will be better able to find problematic cancers, and distinguish them from those that are harmless – such as the use of MRI imaging to detect prostate cancer rather than traditional biopsies. They are also looking at ways to identify people at high or low risk of certain cancers, meaning those at high risk could be offered more frequent screening than those at low risk. The announcement of the alliance comes just weeks after it was found that cancer survival rates in the UK, while improving, are lagging behind those of other countries such as Norway, Canada and Australia. Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK’s director of early diagnosis, said that is down to a number of reasons, including a lack of diagnostic staff that delays diagnosis. “GPs need faster access to smarter tests, so that they only need to send people at the highest risk of cancer to hospital for further investigation,” she said. “ACED will aim to fast-track development of these types of tests and get them into clinical practice as soon as it is safe to do so.”",

    "transcript": "Oil has been a game-changer for humanity. It turbocharged more than a century of growth and destruction: people got bigger, went further, stayed warmer and lived longer. Oil powered travel, exploration, science, industry and innovation. But it also powered conflict, both as a fuel and a potential spoil. It exacerbated inequality. And it polluted – oceans, rivers, wildernesses and, of course, the atmosphere. It is clear that we cannot go on like this. That is why it was heartening this week to learn that renewables were experiencing such strong growth that demand for oil might peak in the next decade. Barely a week goes by without some new renewables record being achieved. In London, environmental activists are glueing themselves to trains and railings to urge the transformation that can halt the climate crisis. It may be quietly and slowly happening already. Elsewhere, we had an eclectic mix of stories on the Upside, including: • a soap opera as birth control? Two-minute read • a promising innovation in treatments for eating disorders. Three-minute read • young people having a great night out (in New Zealand local elections). Three-minute read Lucky numbers Gender equality is improving across Europe, according to the latest survey. But which country is best? Have a guess, then click here. Meanwhile, the World Bank reported that India has halved its poverty rate since 1990. What we liked An initiative founded by the journalist and photographer Oliver Gordon called Struggles From Below, which aims to “focus on solutions – and the people behind them”. Sounds like a fellow traveller… We also liked the idea of an all-African smartphone, made entirely within the continent, as reported by CNN. What we heard: Kalumba wrote below the line on an article about opposition to fracking: Excellent article which captures so well the grit and stamina of this inspired group. Their collective achievement is massively inspiring in the climate of these troubled times ... Long live! Councillor Tim Gard, in South Australia, called for “the means for bringing the large groups of under-40s together from each nation to create international synergies” on a range of issues. It is most stimulating to hear of trends towards reversing the manmade effects of climate change, albeit it must not be viewed as a replacement or reduction of pressure on the need to reduce emissions in any case. Ideally the best solution is not to pollute in the first place. Robert Griffin emailed: Love the emails. I think they would flow and read better if you didn’t underline the links in the text. Having them a different colour is enough, they don’t need to be underlined as well. To which our design team replied: We don’t rely on colour alone for the important element like hyperlink on the website, as some users have difficulties to distinguish the differences between certain colours.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/18/brain-hack-quest-for-new-treatment-eating-disorders",
    "date": "2019-10-18",
    "transcript": "In a dark, nondescript room tucked away in the depths of a London research centre, Lucy Gallop is demonstrating how we might treat eating disorders in future. Improbably, she presses on a pedal under a desk, like a driver pulling away in first gear. Magnetic pulses pass through an electromagnetic coil which is held to a patient’s head. Clicking sounds fill the room and the patient’s neural activity is temporarily altered over the course of a few minutes. A brain scan is visible to her right, the target area already visualised. “The neuronavigation tells you whether or not you’re at the right place,” Gallop says of the process, known as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). “It’s replicable so you know when the participants come in the next time, you’re stimulating the same area.” Gallop’s work carries deep personal significance: “My sister had anorexia so I was exposed to family therapy from a young age. And truthfully, it really exposed me to how treatment is very difficult – making a full recovery from anorexia is very difficult.” New treatment innovations are urgently needed for eating disorders, which affect an estimated 1.25 million people in the UK. Hospital admissions have almost doubled in the last six years and patients are sent hundreds of miles away from home for treatment. Earlier this month, new figures showed that one in six consultant posts in eating disorder services are vacant. Patients with eating disorders are twice as likely to die prematurely than the general population. Results from the project, led by the psychiatrist Prof Ulrike Schmidt at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London, have been cautiously promising. “Our brain imaging and behavioural studies suggest that the way in which rTMS might work is by reducing activity in a brain region – the amygdala, involved in anxiety and threat responses – and dampening patients’ emotional arousal, stress and anxiety,” says Schmidt. She says rTMS seems to affect attention, allowing patients to look towards food rather than away from it. It also appears to influence their choices, shifting towards “high-calorie tasty foods rather than their typical anorexia very low-calorie choices”. Ultimately, she says, that means patients become more relaxed around eating. One participant credited rTMS for helping to dim the “punishing thoughts and catastrophic guilt” she had endured in her 30 years with anorexia. “Whilst the difference is small, it is hugely significant. It has allowed me to eat morsels of food that would have not only been immediately dismissed before the therapy, they would have made me want to scream,” the patient said. It is relatively early days for rTMS (which has also been trialled in bulimia), which the researchers emphasise currently works best alongside traditional talking therapy. A 2018 randomised controlled trial showed 45% of those with anorexia receiving real rTMS reached normal weight 18 months after the study, compared with about 10% of those who received a sham treatment. However, participant numbers were small and there was a placebo effect during treatment. “One needs to exert a degree of caution here,” Schmidt says, warning about the unrealistic promises some private rTMS clinics are making to patients and families. “Only proper large-scale trials will be able to answer the question of whether the early encouraging results of rTMS treatment in anorexia nervosa hold up to further scrutiny.” The huge demand for treatment, and the paucity of existing services, appear to be stimulating an array of experimentation in the field. A second “neuro-hack” under development involves deep brain stimulation (DBS), an established surgical procedure in Parkinson’s. Seven people with longstanding and severe anorexia have been recruited to a pilot study at the University of Oxford – preliminary results are expected towards the end of 2020. The aim, explains one of the investigators, the psychiatrist Rebecca Park, is to stimulate a brain region called the nucleus accumbens, the “hedonic hotspot” which is central to reward processing. “In eating disorders, what is rewarding in life changes,” Parks explains. “It’s as if reward becomes warped towards pursuit of thinness. The eating and exercise rituals, obsessions and habits that characterise the disorder become entrenched over time.” The DBS process, which can trigger complications, involves implanting electrodes into the brain that are linked by extension leads to an implanted pulse generator (in the form of a rechargeable pacemaker) placed beneath the skin below the collarbone. The researchers quote “an overall risk of stroke of less than 1%, a haemorrhage-causing death of 0.01% and a risk of wound infection of 5%”. There are concerns about trialling a treatment that is so invasive and experimental without definitive data to support its use. The team’s ethical framework will include “checks and balances at all stages, supported by an independent ethicist who will act as a patient advocate”. Park concedes “there is a risk of instilling false hope, as DBS is not a magic bullet and is unlikely to help everyone”. Nevertheless she believes that evaluating it ethically for anorexia is a step in the right direction.” A third group of researchers based in Barcelona are innovating in a completely different space: a video game with built-in biofeedback that rewards emotional control. On a virtual tropical island, gamers enjoy sun and sand before experiencing tumultuous storms. The app is connected through Bluetooth to a single sensor that transmits heart rate and heart rate variability data from participants to the device. If participants can regulate their reactions and remain calm, their cardiac response is registered by the sensor, which rewards them by dissipating the storm. If they cannot regulate their emotions, the storm intensifies. This is biofeedback – gameplay dynamically adjusting to reactions. Improving this sort of emotional control can help those with eating and gambling disorders, conditions which both affect impulse control and emotional regulation, says Fernando Fernández-Aranda, head of the eating disorders unit at Bellvitge University hospital in Barcelona, who developed the game along with colleague Susana Jiménez-Murcia. None of these innovations can mask a shortfall of funding and expertise, as evidenced by the deaths of Averil Hart, who endured “clear failures of care”, and Hannah Bharaj, who was denied anorexia treatment. A recent Commons report concluded a lack of understanding was costing lives. Making the most of emerging technologies also means training health professionals and funding resources. Meanwhile, trials like the one at King’s College London will continue to search for treatments. Gallop, whose sister did eventually recover, aims to trial TMS in younger people, who she believes might respond especially well because of their brain plasticity. “I think it gives parents hope,” she says, “especially if your child has already gone through an unsuccessful trial of talking therapy, you kind of feel like you’re running out of options.” For these families, the hunt for a cure must continue.

    "date": "2019-10-17",
    "transcript": "Uganda has one of the highest birth rates in the world. It also has some of the most dedicated soap opera watchers anywhere in Africa. Now a group of enterprising Ugandans is aiming to tackle the former through the medium of the latter. Soap operas are expensive to make, however, so they plan instead to “hack” a Venezuelan import, recutting the existing series and overdubbing it with Ugandan actors. Using content originally from Nacer Contigo (Reborn), the new show has been rescripted and turned into a programme titled Love &amp; Wealth. It will feature episodes in which a female character undergoes tubal ligation as a method of contraception. There are other storylines on sexual health and the stigma around discussing sex with parents and in couples, plus the pitfalls of polygamy. Talks are under way to determine which African country Love &amp; Wealth will make its screen debut in, but it is hoped the show will be distributed to as many English and French free-to-air channels as possible on the continent. “Issues of sexual reproductive health, or gender, affecting youth as well as adults, cut across all sub-Saharan Africa, therefore we believe this show will be well received by and relevant to a wide audience on the continent,” said Gosia Lukomska, the director of integrated media at Peripheral Vision International (PVI). She said her team had intentionally watched Nacer Contigo with muted audio, so that even those who understood Spanish would not know the original plot and dialogue. “This way, the footage was sort of ‘tabula rasa’ [a blank slate] to us, we were not influenced by the original story and could create our own from the visuals available,” Lukomska said. When PVI tested the show in east Africa, viewers did not find anything unusual about a Venezuelan actor having a Ugandan name such as Wasswa, and remembered the characters’ titles well, according to the NGO. Sex education is a controversial topic in Uganda, where the average woman has more than five children. Civil society groups have launched a lawsuit against the government over its failure to issue a comprehensive sex education policy in schools, after a crackdown on reproductive education. A report recently linked a lack of sex education to a rise in teenage pregnancies and new HIV/Aids infections in adolescents. Telenovelas have proved to be successful imports in sub-Saharan Africa. Robert Mawerere, the head of programming at NTV, one of Uganda’s most popular broadcasters, said Ugandans loved telenovelas, whether they were Mexican, Filipino, Indian or Chinese, “as long as they are romantic, dramatic and with fantasy”. William Nyombi, the program manager for Marie Stopes Uganda, said they could be an effective way of getting across messages related to social behavioural change. “A young person (or) a lady will tell you a whole story of a telenovela, so it has impact,” he said.

    "title": "'Youthquake': The young New Zealanders voted into office – in between McDonald's shifts",

    "transcript": "They took gap years to stay at home and run for office. They list as their political heroes progressive leaders such as Jacinda Ardern and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And they plan to juggle their new roles as elected officials with university exams and shifts at McDonald’s. The record number of young New Zealanders, some still in their teens, who surged to victory in the country’s local government elections on Saturday – in what was dubbed a “youthquake” by commentators – were not lured by dreams of high-profile posts in national politics. Instead, they ran for roles on New Zealand’s city and district councils or community boards – where elected officials have always tended to be older, white and male, and where elections have been treated with apathy by voters of all ages. “It’s about representing our planet and representing a whole group of people who aren’t currently strongly being heard around the council table,” says Sophie Handford, 18, who was the youngest to be elected on Saturday, winning a seat on the lower North Island’s Kāpiti coast district council. “Obviously our planet doesn’t have a physical voice,” she says. “I see the extreme importance of raising issues related to the planet and our climate at all levels.” Inspired by the climate change activism of the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, Handford took a gap year after she finished high school in 2018 to lead New Zealand’s school student strikes over inaction on global heating. Her progressive agenda included boosting mental health support and tackling youth homelessness. The so-called “youthquake” in Saturday’s election did not reflect a large boost in overall voter turnout. Preliminary figures showed 44% of New Zealanders cast ballots – just two percentage points higher than at the 2016 local government elections. Youth voting figures were not available on Wednesday. But the number of elected officials under 30 doubled according to preliminary figures, from 14 to 30 after the ballot, and the cohort under 40 increased by a half, to 91 from 59 last election. In previous local government elections, more than 90% of those elected were over 40. The number of women elected also grew – from 19% of the country’s mayors in 2016 to 25% in Saturday’s poll. On Monday, Ardern, New Zealand’s Labour prime minister, noted the increase. “It certainly seems a bent of environmentalism across the country,” she said. “It seems to me that there was actually quite a bit of change in these elections.” ‘Put your hand up and get into it’ On Saturday afternoon in Rotorua, a lakeside town in the North Island, Fisher Wang, 19, has just finished his shift at McDonald’s when he learned that taking a gap year to run for office had also paid off for him. A few weeks before he was due to leave home for university this year, he says “this thought came into my head”. “It was like, Fisher, is that really what you want to do? Do you really want to go and study law and do all that for the rest of your life?” Meeting Ardern during her 2017 election campaign “really fuelled the fire” to get involved in politics, says Wang, who hopes to champion environmental and youth issues as a Rotorua Lakes councillor. He was “starstruck” when the prime minister rang to congratulate him after Saturday’s result. “She talked about her journey into politics,” he says. “The advice she gave me was to enjoy it, put your hand up and get into it.” Wang says he will continue to work at McDonald’s on his days off, adding that it was a good opportunity to hear from his constituents. Feedback while hitchhiking Another successful candidate who said victory would not change his habits was the new mayor of the South Island city of Dunedin, Aaron Hawkins – one of the country’s youngest elected mayors. Hawkins, 35, is already a familiar sight on the city’s roadsides because he hitchhiked to work as city councillor – a practise he would continue despite the offer of a mayoral car. “You’ve got 15 minutes and you get unfiltered feedback from people who probably aren’t ever going to turn up to a council annual plan process or a bylaw review hearing,” says Hawkins, who travelled to work on Wednesday with a beekeeper. “Getting those perspectives from people about what they think’s going well or not well in the city is great.” A two-term councillor, Hawkins was in 2014 one of only two local representatives in New Zealand aged under 30, and has worked to support other young candidates entering politics. “There’s a willingness in the wider community, not just among fellow young people, to see those perspectives represented in local decision-making,” he says. “The climate strike movement has been incredibly helpful in that, with thousands of young people marching in the streets, demanding that we do better and demonstrating leadership.” For the youthful newcomers, raising their profiles and convincing sceptical voters had at times been a challenge. Tamatha Paul, 22, who was elected to the city council in the capital Wellington, says she and 60 volunteers had run her campaign with military precision. Over six months, they had visited each home in her ward multiple times and texted voters with personalised updates on issues they cared about. “With political parties, often they have access to pre-existing data that will tell them who in the ward already supports them and they’ll just revisit those homes,” says Paul, a former student leader who has worked on prison and marijuana law reform campaigns. “I wanted a mandate and I didn’t just want it to be progressive residents, I wanted every resident I could sway while retaining my own values.” On the campaign trail, Handford, 18, says she was often asked about her life experience and credentials. “My response was, well, don’t I bring a different perspective? And maybe that perspective is what we need,” she says. “If you look at what life experience and credentials have done for us so far, maybe it’s time to reconsider the way we look at governance.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/rise-renewables-oil-firms-decades-earlier-think",
    "date": "2019-10-14",
    "transcript": "The world’s rising reliance on fossil fuels may come to an end decades earlier than the most polluting companies predict, offering early signs of hope in the global battle to tackle the climate crisis. The climate green shoots have emerged amid a renewable energy revolution that promises an end to the rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, before the fossil fuels face a terminal decline. The looming fossil fuel peak is expected to emerge decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies, which are betting that demand for polluting energy will rise until the 2040s. But energy experts are adjusting their forecasts as clean energy technologies, including wind and solar power, emerge faster than predicted and at costs that pose a direct threat to coal-fired electricity and combustion-engine vehicles. In the UK, renewable energy projects generated more electricity over the last quarter than fossil fuels for the first time since the country’s first public power plant fired up in 1882. It is a marked change from only 10 years ago, when gas and coal generated more than 70% of the UK’s electricity. The pace of progress has raised hope that the global groundswell of climate protest could spark fresh political will to accelerate the energy transition in time to keep global temperatures from rising to levels that could trigger a climate catastrophe. The UK Labour party has promised a Green Industrial Revolution to create almost 70,000 new jobs while working to create a carbon-neutral economy by 2030. In the US, the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aims to virtually eliminate the US’s greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade. Within the energy industry, experts believe the rapid rise of renewable energy in recent years may soon seem glacial compared with the changes to come. Michael Liebreich, the founder of the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), says the substitution of old technology with new is always “like waiting for a sneeze”. “The first 1% takes forever, 1% to 5% is like waiting for a sneeze – you know it’s inevitable but it takes longer than you think – then 5% to 50% happens incredibly fast,” he says. The world is about to enter this period of rapid transformation, he says. This change promises to upend the fossil fuel producers that fail to adapt at pace, and bring the rise of carbon emissions to an end. A growing number of energy experts agree. “Over the next decade we’ll see a far quicker than expected rollout of a number of clean energy technologies, which will almost certainly mean global emissions plateau,” Liebreich adds. The rollout is expected whether politicians increase their ambition or not, because the economics of clean energy are now too strong to ignore. Earlier this summer, BNEF reported that not only was renewable energy cheaper than building a new gas or coal plant, but it would soon be cheaper than using existing thermal plants too. This economic tipping point means it would save money to shut existing coal-fired power plants down and build new renewable energy projects from scratch. Abundant clean electricity could help remove the emissions from the world’s transport and heating systems too. By 2030, BNEF expects demand for road fuels to peak, while coal is expected to peak by 2026. DNV GL, a global energy advisory, believes that by the same year oil will no longer be the world’s biggest energy source, and by the end of the 2020s the world’s demand for crude will begin to fall. “It provides a lot of hope,” says Seb Henbest, the lead author of the BNEF report. “It provides a counterbalance to the doom and gloom we face, partly because it includes up-to-date data which tells a slightly different story.” It is a cautionary tale for fossil fuel companies that believe the world’s demand for polluting energy will continue to rise until the middle of the century. It is also a new narrative of hope, he says. “We’re a lot further on than we were. And yes, we need to go faster. And yes, it’s difficult and complicated. But at the same time we now live in a world where two-thirds of the global population live in a country where wind and solar power is the cheapest form of new electricity capacity. We have the tools to do this,” he says. Chris Stark, the head of the UK’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, says the precedent set by the renewables industry proves that emerging technologies to capture carbon emissions can follow suit. “Even 10 years ago we were looking at a very different trajectory for global temperatures. We’ve moved on to a trajectory that today looks like 3C of warming [above pre-industrial levels], but prior to this we were on track for more than that; 4C, possibly even higher,” he says. The progress to date is not yet enough to meet global targets set in the Paris climate agreement, but a plateau in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 could play a major role in averting catastrophic global heating above 3C. It also proves that further ambition could bring the world closer to the sub-2C goal. “This change is a testament to new climate policies, and the work that has been done around the world. We need to do more of that,” he adds. The UK plans to lead the world’s future climate ambitions. Next year, Glasgow will host the UN’s 26th Conference of the Parties climate talks, known as COP26, to set out a roadmap that keeps rising temperatures well within 2C above pre-industrialised levels. Claire Perry MP, the president for COP26, says the climate talks are “where the rubber hits the road on the historic Paris agreement”. She adds that “expectations are rightly high” due to the “mounting public concern over climate change”, but the UK is ready to deliver on those expectations.",

    "date": "2019-10-10",
    "transcript": "Conical flasks of green liquid jiggle in rotating trays while women in white lab coats study yellowing yeast samples. One has grown into the shape of a smiley face. On the other side of the laboratory, something important is happening with vials, pipettes and foil-covered bottles containing what looks a lot like urine. The aim is to produce a chewing gum that accurately predicts the female fertility cycle. “We need to see if the active ingredient survives in chewing gum, then we’ll add flavours,” says one of the researchers, Anett Stèger. A team of 13 students from the University of Copenhagen is on a mission to create a product to help women improve their chances of getting pregnant. Biotechnology and molecular bioscience students have been working together to create a “smart chewing gum” that will change colour to show where women are in their menstrual cycles. The plan is to replace baker’s yeast with human hormone receptors that can measure the oestrogen, LH and progesterone that are present in saliva when a woman is ovulating. The project, nicknamed “Ovulaid”, was started as a Danish entry into iGEM, the world championship in synthetic biology, which starts in Boston at the end of October. The researchers are an international bunch, with scientists from Nepal, India, Germany and Hungary as well as Denmark. Seven are women. “The competition can get quite intense,” says Stèger, who is Hungarian. “We’re working 40 hours a week on this, on top of our normal studies – so the drop-out rate is usually high. But we’ve only had one person leave. It’s a project we’re all really passionate about.” A fellow team-member, Hitesh Gelli Praveenkumar from India, first came up with the idea of a diagnostic gum when the group began brainstorming in February, before Benedicte Smith-Sivertsen, a Dane, suggested it could help women conceive. “My sister was going through fertility treatment at the time,” says Smith-Sivertsen, “and I was surprised by how hard it was – all these huge syringes and peeing on sticks every day. I just thought, why hasn’t anyone made this easier?” Most over the counter ovulation tests currently monitor LH levels, with higher end and more expensive ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen. “But we thought, what about a chewing gum that could do all of that, as well as measuring progesterone (which helps the uterus prepare for pregnancy) at a fraction of the cost?” says Stèger. There is clearly some work to be done. A prototype tastes a bit like wax. The researchers are working on a smartphone app to accompany the chewing gum for easy interpretation of the colour results and the gum is biodegradable. “The plan is that the gum will be very discreet in terms of packaging, available in supermarkets in a variety of flavours, and much, much cheaper than existing ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen that you pee on,” says Stèger. The hope is that Ovulaid will also have a developing world application. “We’ve conducted research with gynaecology clinics in rural India, where many hospitals don’t have the resources for regular fertility testing,” says Gelli, “so there’s a real excitement about the gum.” They’ve also looked into the impact it could have on areas such as Africa, where infertility is taboo. However, the market that may prove trickiest is Europe because the gum will contain a genetically-modified biosensor, and GM is tightly controlled in the EU. As part of the project, the team surveyed 1,500 women, 90% of whom said they still would like to use the product despite the fact that it contains GM elements. “And we’ve had hundreds of women getting in touch telling us they love the idea,” adds Stèger. Dr Shabana Bora, a fertility specialist at the Lister Fertility Clinic in London not involved in the project, expressed cautious optimism about the work, saying “since many existing ovulation tests create a lot of plastic waste, a biodegradable gum could help be a more eco-friendly, cost-effective alternative.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Tasnia Akter has come home. It’s a public holiday in Bangladesh, the one time of year the 25-year-old can leave the mayhem of the city behind and see her family: her mother, her aunt. And her daughter. “There she is!” Her little girl is standing in front of the two-bedroom tin hut in a remote village 200km (125 miles) north of Chittagong, south-east Bangladesh. Mother and daughter embrace. If she could, the young seamstress would still live here. The air is fresher, there is more space, and some of her friends still live in the village. There’s just one problem: “There isn’t any work.” Agriculture has ceased to be a feasible source of income. Money doesn’t grow on trees – it is spun in the textile looms of the city. And so this family copes as best it can, the older women raising the child while Tasnia works six-day weeks, sewing T-shirts and jeans for global consumers, for about 8,400 taka (£80) a month. These three generations are a neat microcosm of an entire nation. The older women, who grew up in the years after independence in 1971, worked in unpaid labour, trying to survive in the grinding poverty for which the country became renowned in the 1970s. The young girl, a 21st-century child, schooled and spirited, will in all probability enjoy better prospects. And in the middle, Tasnia Akter, from the “factory generation”, one of approximately 4.5 million textile workers who have transformed the fortunes and reputation of Bangladesh. The crucial question is this: is Akter a glorious paragon of the “rise and rise” of Bangladesh, with its 50-year journey to becoming a middle-income nation powered by hard-working women? Or is she a sickening example of an exploited labourer who ruins her health for companies making high margins and consumers who buy cheap jeans? The answer: perhaps a bit of both. “Sure, Tasnia suffers a lot, she has to support her family – but I had to suffer much more,” says her aunt, Honufa Begum. After her husband died, Begum worked as a maid in Chittagong. “Just provide food and lodging for me and my daughter,” she recalls asking the family. They did. But they did not pay her. Begum did not complain. “I am uneducated,” Akter explains, sitting on a bed in her aunt’s house under a fan. “In the city I could work as a maid. But I don’t want to be a slave. I don’t want to always be on my toes, waiting for orders. At least when I come home in the evening from the factory, I am done for the day.” Changed fortunes When the history is written of how much of humanity was lifted out of poverty in the decades after 1980, Bangladesh will provide one of the biggest chapters. GDP has soared vertiginously since 1980. The number of people living below the poverty line has fallen from more than 44% in 1991 to less than 13%. Numbers for neonatal and maternal mortality have dwindled. Family sizes have fallen. People now live on average one-third longer than they used to 40 years ago – a gain in longevity that is practically without rival anywhere in the world. But it has not come without tragedy, toil and exploitation. Six years ago, the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Dhaka, killing more than 1,100 people, injuring more than 2,300. Rana Plaza became synonymous with textile workers’ atrocious working conditions; for the blood, sweat and sacrifice so easily overlooked by western consumers hunting bargain T-shirts on the high street. Bangladeshi workers are still among the lowest-paid in the world. Over the years, however, activists, workers and researchers have fought for at least some change in the garment industry. The minimum wage has doubled. Safety improvements have been made. Many workers are able to put a little aside to ensure that their children get a proper education. And for Akter and the millions of other women who make up around 80% of the textile workforce, the industry represents a possibility to earn money. They can attain at least some economic freedom in a society where women typically are housewives; where the only option in the countryside is to marry. The vast industry generates myriad sub-industries too. The market along the dusty main road in Chittagong is usually bustling with people. Opposite the Clifton garments factory, Jallal Uddin, 38, is selling cake, bananas and tea to the workers on their way home. The father of two has had his stall for eight years now. He is proud of not having accumulated any debt. His formula is simple: the more garment workers there are, the more business for him. Tasnia Akter has been working for her factory for the past four years. The small premises is owned by one of the country’s big manufacturers: there are more than 30,000 employees, with brand customers such as WalMart and H&amp;M. For Akter, working in the factory means progress: it is a means of paying the debts of her family, to support her seven-year-old daughter, and to earn a living after her husband left her – a fate that many garment workers share. “I don’t really have a choice,” she says. She sends around 2,000 taka home every month, as well as the occasional windfall: a rice cooker is stored in her parents’ cupboard; the company awarded it to her for not missing any days and for working quickly. But if she can’t save anything for herself, is she really getting on? Is progressing from slave-like working conditions to meagre salaries really enough? Or is the country’s sweatshop image still accurate today? Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a thinktank in Dhaka, shakes his head. “Not at all.” The economist believes that – at least in a broader sense – the textile industry has lifted millions out of poverty. In the 1980s, workers lived in shacks and toiled in factories with no toilets or safe drinking water. Now even a cursory look at their lunch boxes will show they are eating better than in the past, he says. But he adds that many workers are malnourished and some still sleep on the floor. “Most workers can’t save anything for their post-work years.” Nevertheless, there are small indications that the quality of life is improving. “Workers like to spend the last penny for the betterment of the family: some send their children to private kindergarten, or to private tutors.” It was the Rana Plaza disaster that arguably triggered the biggest safety improvements. Following a broad deal between unions and more than 200 garment companies such as Primark and H&amp;M, more than 1,600 factories were inspected and hazards identified and dealt with. Factory owners invested in fire doors, sprinkler systems and electrical upgrades. Some tore down factories and built them anew to keep their business going. A general manager of the company where Tasnia Akter works says the new rules of business are simple: “No compliance, no contracts.” “If you compare pre-Rana Plaza and post-Rana Plaza, the one thing that really has changed is safety,” says Kalpona Akter (no relation to Tasnia), a labour activist and executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity (BCWS). Between 2005 and 2012, more than 500 workers died in textile factories. After 2014, the annual number of fatalities has remained “well under 30”, according to the Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights at New York University . “Workers are now more aware of their rights,” says Kalpona Akter. When she founded BCWS in 2000, few workers knew they had any rights at all. “Now workers perhaps won’t die in the factory – but they will nevertheless slowly die of malnourishment,” Hasan Maruf Rumi says. The activist and politician explains how it is impossible to feed a family on the new minimum wage of 8,000 taka. While the minimum wage has indeed been doubled, it is still only half of what the unions had suggested – and far from a living wage. A study by CPD found that the overall cost of living for garment workers had increased by 86% between 2013 and 2018, with food costs up 57%. Last December the influential manufacturers’ association BGMEA made it clear that owners would close factories if the minimum wage increased further. It called on brands to increase their prices as a result. Nothing happened. When asked how much she thinks she deserves, Tasnia Akter says: 10,000 taka, around £96. In Chittagong, many workers live near the factories. The streets, turned muddy by the rain, are lined with corner shops, barbers and vegetable sellers. Nadira Begum, a 26-year-old sewing operator, shares a room with her three-year-old daughter in a compound with other families. Her husband shows up from time to time; he has another wife as well. “As soon as there is a raise, everything gets more expensive,” she says. She already pays around 3,000 taka per month for the room. While Begum earns about nine times as much as her mother, she is unsure whether her purchasing power has gone up much. She does have amenities such as a fan and a fridge. She joined the union after it helped her when she was about to be fired for being pregnant, she says. Now she has lost her job. Begum believes it is primarily because she is a union member. But she doesn’t seem too fazed. One thing that has changed is her self-assurance, the pride in her abilities: “I am not worried. I am a skilled worker; I will just go and get another job.” • Tasnia Akter’s name has been changed This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "When Islamic State overran the Iraqi city of Mosul, human life was not the only thing in peril. Knowledge was, too. Fortunately, Ameen al-Jaleeli understood this. He used a friend’s wifi to transfer a vast batch of Wikipedia files for offline usage. When the militants cut the cables in July 2016, he was ready. “Reading gives me the feeling that I’m still a human being, especially when living under Isis, because knowledge has no limits,” he said. “Even under the airstrikes, I used to put my earphones on, listen to music and read.” Jaleeli downloaded files in English because Arabic is severely underrepresented on the internet. Now that the city has been liberated from Isis, he and a team of student translators at the University of Mosul are setting about redressing that imbalance. Together, they are making Wikipedia pages, academic articles and seminal works covering science, literature and philosophy available to Arabic speakers in attempt to confront lies with logic and pit critical thinking against propaganda and fake news. Just 0.6% of internet content is available in Arabic, despite it being the fourth most common language among internet users. Ideas Beyond Borders (IBB), the organisation behind the House of Wisdom 2.0 translation project, plans to narrow this chasm and democratise access to knowledge for the Arab world. The organisation’s founder, Faisal Saeed Al Mutar, grew up under the regime of Saddam Hussein. “It was kind of the motherlode of misinformation,” the 28-year-old recalls. Now he wants to arm Iraqi and Arab young people against the authoritarian regimes and extremist groups that silence diverse narratives and allow violence to thrive. So far the organisation has added more than 2.1 million words to Arabic Wikipedia, including entries on female scientists, civil rights, religious diversity, evolution and conspiracy theories. The response has been remarkable. Since launching in 2017, IBB has attracted more than 1 million followers to its Facebook page, and draws more than 40,000 views across its online channels a day. It has also translated books, including Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker and Waking Up by Sam Harris. Requests are flooding in and IBB is doubling the team of 60 translators to work with six more universities across Iraq as well as branching into Kurdish and Farsi. Every week, the team posts about a different female scientist on social media. “It’s very important to raise the understanding of people here that women can do anything,” said Shahd Shahin, 25, who recently graduated after suspending her studies for several years when Isis shut down schools and universities in Mosul. At the time, Shahin was too terrified to leave the house, so she stayed inside, reading works about science and space downloaded on her phone. “I had my books. When I read I used to go to another world.” Momen Mohamad, a third-year student, spends two hours a day translating articles for the project. He will be paid a small stipend but money is not what motivates him. “I want to do something good as a person from Mosul and show the world that we can achieve things,” he said. “Going through a really tough time helped us understand the world better and look to improve our knowledge.” IBB makes material available via PDFs, which can be downloaded for free. But on the street readers are finding their own ways to spread the word. “People have started unofficially printing our books or distributing them via Telegram and other platforms to avoid censorship,” Mutar said. What started as a translation project is rapidly becoming a youth movement, he added. “These are people who have every reason to feel hopeless – all they have known is war and destruction – yet they wake up every morning and translate stories about culture and diversity because they want to be part of a solution that makes their country a better place.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "What’s the funniest piece you read this week? Can’t remember? There may be a reason for that. These are such serious times that it’s getting harder to find the humour. Once upon a time, newspapers crackled with jokes, mixing up the serious stuff with light-hearted whimsy, satire and irreverence. These days, not so much. Aside from occasional oddities and political sketches, our news media seems less attuned than ever to the the bizarre, the comedic, the absurdities of modern life. Things are so serious that comedians are becoming politicians. Why? Have we lost our funny bone? When did everyone start taking themselves so seriously? Saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the first episode of Monty Python’s Flying Circus. In honour, the Upside has been trawling around, looking for the new Ernest Scribblers of this very earnest age. You can read our suggestions in What we liked, below. But first, a quick round-up of top Upside offerings of the week: 1. The women taking the plastic out of periods. Two-minute read. 2. Why Finland’s schools are so great. Three-minute read. 3. How the participatory budget in Paris works. Three-minute read. 4. Hitching to work: could it catch on? One-hour commute. What we liked My colleague Marina Hyde is always funny – though be warned: she is fabulously rude too. A jolly Sydney Morning Herald piece ripped into a new TV hit. There was plenty of value to be had in a British prime minister mentioning “kangaroo’s testicles” in a speech. A pub had a party at which everyone was called Nigel. The Economist had fun examining the far-fetched prospect of Donald Trump’s border moat. One-minute read (paywall). The New Yorker still maintains a daily commitment to satire. A protest stunt backfired – literally (video). Lucky numbers Long one of the most alcoholic nations in the world, Russia has become more abstemious over the past decade and a half, with booze consumption falling by almost half. Longevity has increased by 10% over the period from 65 to about 71. In the UK meanwhile, deaths from breast cancer have almost halved over the past 30 years. What we heard Michèle Sanniti inquired via email: I would love to read an article on what can be done about the huge amount of plastic that we generate everyday by using milk and orange juice cartons. Alternatives, campaigns, are the supermarkets working on this? Well, of course we have written various pieces on this, for example here, here and here. Still on the theme of all that unnecessary plastic: Thanks for a great article about environmentally sound menstruation products. I have been using the same 6 pads since 2002 or thereabouts. They are in cotton, and I just wash them in the washing machine and then use them again. They have little buttons on their wings to keep them tethered during use. Probably not great for the manufacturer, but multi-use pads is probably by far the most environmentally friendly menstrual protection. Name supplied Where was the Upside?

    "transcript": "Ella Daish has lost count of how many tampon pictures she has. People send them in from all over the world – plastic applicators polluting the environment, blue, orange, green, purple and yellow. “That’s a rainbow of plastic pollution,” says Daish, 27, a campaigner seeking to persuade companies and governments to remove plastics from women’s sanitary products. “This is a global issue, but period products aren’t talked about much; they need to be stopped at source.” Sanitary products are the fifth most common item found on Europe’s beaches, more widespread than single-use coffee cups, cutlery or straws. Some 200,000 tonnes of material is believed to end up in UK landfill every year. The water engineer Hazem Gouda has estimated that 700,000 panty liners, 2.5m tampons and 1.4m sanitary towels are flushed down the toilet every day in the UK. Daish is neither the first nor the only woman taking a stand against this. But, finally, there are signs that the government and the retail industry are taking the problem seriously. Last month, Sainsbury’s became the first company to stop producing plastic applicators for its own-brand tampons, removing 2.7 tonnes of plastic annually. “This move shows that people power has a huge impact. It speaks volumes,” says Daish, who is putting pressure on other big names, including Procter &amp; Gamble and Boots. “Plastic tampon applicators are used for seconds, yet take centuries to break down, and they have avoidable impacts on the environment.” The Scottish government has also taken a stand, with a £175,200 campaign in partnership with Zero Waste Scotland to encourage women to try free samples of period pants, menstrual cups and reusable sanitary pads. In Wales, Caerphilly council has taken the decision to devote all of its period poverty funding to eco-friendly products – a UK first. Alternatives are starting to catch on: there are products with cardboard applicators, as well as reusable versions and non-applicator tampons. Another option is the silicone menstrual cup that is inserted into the vagina to collect blood flow. Menstrual cups can be used for 10 years and cost about £20 – that equates to 16p for each menstrual cycle. But there is still a lack of information comparing sanitary products. “Despite the fact that 1.9 billion women globally are of menstruating age, spending on average 65 days a year dealing with menstrual blood flow, few good-quality studies exist that compare sanitary products,” says Prof Penelope Phillips-Howard from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and the lead author of research on the subject, published in the Lancet Public Health. Over 10 years, a menstrual cup is estimated to create 0.4% of the plastic waste generated by single-use pads and 6% of that produced by using tampons. “Menstrual cups will contribute to decreasing pollution of plastic waste from monthly use of disposable sanitary products,” adds Phillips-Howard who found that awareness about cups was extremely low, even though 199 brands are available in 99 countries. The Women’s Environment Network (WEN), which coined the term “environmenstrual” in 2004, is noticing real momentum for change in the UK. “After Blue Planet II, people realised the sheer scale of plastic pollution in our seas, our soil and our own bodies. Women seem happier to talk about periods … they had previously been seen as taboo,” says Kate Metcalf, WEN’s co-director. “We’ve still got a long way to go, but it’s becoming more mainstream and the Women’s Institute just joined our coalition, so our reach is spreading.” According to Metcalf, period education is “patchy and outdated”. WEN is collaborating with the UK-based nonprofit group City to Sea, which campaigns to prevent plastic pollution at source, to create a schools programme called Rethink Periods. It is training 600 teachers across England to get the message across to adolescents. Crucially, says the campaign’s national coordinator Clare Marshall, lessons are accompanied by a free box of period pants, menstrual cups, organic cotton disposables and reusable pads, so that pupils can see and feel the products. “Girls and boys are often shocked to find out that certain products contain plastic,” Marshall says. “They are keen to find out what they can do, so we highlight how Ella Daish is successfully taking on the big guns; hopefully teenagers will listen up.” Alec Mills, the co-founder of Dame, a company that produces the world’s first reusable tampon applicator, says the onus is on government to provide sustainable menstrual products in schools. “There’s a perfect storm of cultural change – people are more prepared to talk about their periods, plus there’s this enormous plastic-free environmental drive,” he says. “Finally, women are questioning the products they are using – now is the time to create positive changes and let the concrete set on a young generation making new habits.” But there is concern about the Westminster government’s new Period Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Procter &amp; Gamble which already supplies free Always pads and Tampax tampons to school pupils. “Our calculations show that it would be cheaper in the long term for government to promote reusables and plastic-free alternatives,” says Ruby Raut, the founder of Wuka period pants, which can be worn for up to eight hours and then washed. “This is simply not in line with the government’s call for all schools to become plastic-free by 2022.” Raut, Mills and Daish joined others to sign an open letter demanding that the Department for Education offers free sustainable alternatives to girls in English secondary education. The winner of the tender to provide free sanitary products in schools is due to be announced imminently, and campaigners want to see a substantial commitment to plastic-free products. The concept of plastic-free periods is nothing new. Susie Hewson founded Natracare in 1989, producing plastic-free, organic cotton tampons and pads that are home-compostable. “We won’t compromise on the materials we use or how they are sourced, but for big brands developing new markets, in India, for example, plastic is cheap to produce and light to distribute,” she says. Hewson adds: “The damage from our throwaway culture and unfettered growth is accumulating somewhere – there are consequences for everything we do.” She is calling for full disclosure of ingredients on product packaging to be a legal requirement. “Legislation is the biggest innovator – there’s a pressing need to reduce how much plastic we stick down the toilet.” Daish agrees: “We should know exactly what is in the products we put in and around such an intimate area of our bodies for extended periods of time; I wouldn’t put a plastic bag down there, I’m sure a lot of people wouldn’t – it’s a human rights issue.” Her goal is for all period products to become plastic-free: “We can all make a difference and change our habits – I just want to keep pushing for change.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/27/top-class-finland-schools-envy-world-ofsted-education",
    "date": "2019-09-27",
    "transcript": "It’s early afternoon in Lintulaakson school in Espoo, near Helsinki. The younger children are having a snack before starting their after-school activities. Upstairs a group of 12-year-olds are in a craft class, cutting patterns and making clothes on sewing machines. Outside, children play in an enormous outdoor space, equipped with a climbing frames, football pitches and basketball courts. “Hey, Petteri,” one boy yells casually at the principal, Petteri Kuusimäki. “Next year can we start school a bit later, at 10am?” Kuusimäki jokes with them. It’s all first names here. The Finnish education system is the envy of the world. Along with Tove Jansson’s Moomins, Nokia phones and Iittala glassware, it has become one of the country’s most celebrated exports – and it’s easy to see why. Its students consistently score well at the top end of the Pisa international league tables, and as Kuusimäki walks me round his school he describes a kind of education utopia – a place where teachers are highly trained, revered and trusted, and children’s wellbeing is paramount. There are no Ofsted-style inspections, no streaming by ability, no national exams until 18, no school uniforms, no school league tables and no fee-paying private schools. At its party conference this week, Labour committed to follow Finland’s lead and not only scrap Ofsted but abolish private schools by forcing their integration with the state sector. Explaining the policy, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4: “In some countries, it is not allowed to charge for education in any form … in Finland, for example.” The British Labour party is far from alone in its enthusiasm for the Finnish education system. Every year hundreds of delegations of teachers and policymakers from all over the world pour into Helsinki to see this nirvana for themselves. So popular has it become that international visits are strictly regulated and have to be paid for – a presentation costs €682 (£607) per hour and a school visit €1,240. In the past two months there have been groups from Israel, Brazil, China and Korea. In the coming weeks there will be visits from New Zealand and Lithuania. Meanwhile, Finland’s influence is spreading far and wide. Last month a school opened in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam based on the Finnish curriculum and pedagogical approach, with Finnish staff on the teaching team. Kuusimäki tells me Finland’s schools are well-funded and built around the principle of equality of opportunity for all pupils. He is baffled when I try to explain that some state schools in England are so strapped for cash that they are asking parents for donations. “As you may know, everything is free in Finland,” he says, university included. There is just one fee-paying school in the country, the International School of Helsinki, which has mainly catered for international employees of Nokia and other industries. Otherwise, charging fees is illegal and parents are happy by and large to send their children to their local school. “We really don’t have bad schools,” Kuusimäki says. In class children are listened to and respected, school lunches are free, detentions are rare and exclusions pretty much unheard of. Kuusimäki gave his last detention 15 years ago, and is visibly horrified at the idea of excluding a child from school. “As a principal, you can’t think like that. We are responsible for these children and their lives. We can’t give up.” But things are changing slowly. Schools are becoming more diverse – 20% of pupils at Lintulaakson school are from immigrant backgrounds, elsewhere it is 75%. The curriculum has been revised and Kuusimäki says more has had to be done to stretch gifted children. A compulsory pre-school year for six-year-olds has been introduced to help with school-readiness, and there is talk of starting even earlier, while the minimum school leaving age has recently been raised to 18. Meanwhile, parents “shopping for schools” is on the increase. Finnish education experts would be the first to admit they do not have all the answers and methods in one country do not always translate to another. John Jerrim, professor of education and social statistics at the University College London Institute of Education, does not believe England should be looking to Finland. “Its Pisa scores have actually been in decline. And there is no reason to believe their high scores on international tests are due to their schools. So there is no reason to try to copy Finland.” Not even on outlawing school fees? “The resource will just be shifted elsewhere,” Jerrim says. “There are lots of potential unintended consequences, for example, pushing up house prices near good schools.” In 2013 the celebrated Finnish educator Pasi Sahlberg paid a visit to Eton College, the most famous of the UK’s ancient, elite boarding schools. Once a maths and science teacher in Helsinki, Sahlberg now tours the world spreading the word about the wonders of Finnish education and advising on education reform. “It was like going 200 years backwards in time,” Sahlberg recalls of his visit. “I remember thinking while walking the corridors of Eton and watching students there that even if I had a chance to enrol my own kids to that school I would probably say ‘no, thank you’.” With its illustrious history, bizarre uniforms and £40,000 a year fees, Eton – which educated the current British prime minister and many before him – is a million miles from the modern egalitarianism of Finland’s schools. “I am often asked by people what is the most important thing I learned in school,” Sahlberg says. “I say that to learn to understand that there are different kinds of people in this world and that regardless where we come from we can be in same school and learn in same classroom. Eton boys won’t learn that in their school.” Like Jerrim, Sahlberg is sceptical about other countries trying to simply copy the Finland model. “There are so many myths about what the Finnish system is and is not. This idea of copying has done a lot of damage.” Finland’s schools are rooted in the country’s distinctive history and culture; the population is small (5.5 million), and taxes are high. “You can’t go to Finland and cherry-pick the things that seem to be interesting and say, ‘We want to do like Finland is doing’. It’s much more complicated than that.” He also thinks it’s unrealistic for Labour to promise to abolish private schools. “It’s come too far this whole private education thinking. It’s very hard to remove it altogether.” It would be better, he says, for Labour to focus on strengthening the existing state sector in England, which has become fragmented through academisation and free schools. “Just abolishing something, saying private schools should be made illegal, it’s not going happen.”",

    "transcript": "Wherever you travel as a journalist, however dicey the destination, there is usually an Upside tale to be found in art. I have a few personal favourites: Bosnian war art, the humour of the Mitki in the late Soviet period, the only artist in the Falkland Islands … This week, our Africa correspondent, Jason Burke, discovered that even in a country as demoralised as Zimbabwe, contemporary art thrives. His article prompted responses from readers pointing out that this is not limited to the capital, Harare. Pip Curling wrote in: I worked at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe and was on the board of trustees there too. I personally collected a body of work that told the story of the country from the late 1980s to probably 2007 when hyperinflation hit. My collection is sometimes the work of rural, self-taught and unsung artists which have never been seen because of the political situation. Misheck Gudo came as a young man from a small village in the eastern districts of Zimbabwe to try his luck in Harare. Often the self-taught artists tell a narrative more than they might attempt to expose an emotion or a feeling. The works are usually self-explanatory and require no verbal input from the artist. Myth, legend and proverb sometimes play their part. Misheck made this painting after the heavily contested general election in Zimbabwe in 2005. Art gives us that chance to stand back, take stock, see the context, the wider picture – a vital safety valve in societies that are seething with antagonism and dispute. In another furious week in the UK, the Turner prize comes as welcome relief. In Latvia, they’re trying to use culture as a unifying force. And as highlighted in this newsletter back in the summer, some even believe that art and culture can improve mental health. It can certainly improve your wealth if you find something valuable in the kitchen. Other Upside treats this week: 1.

Nearly a hundred people enjoyed a 20-minute show of upcycled secondhand clothes and eco-fashion on Saturday 14 September, in the setting of the upstairs floor of Chippenham Library.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/25/new-global-scorecard-to-map-extent-of-mental-illness-crisis",
    "date": "2019-09-25",
    "transcript": "A global initiative to measure the extent of mental illness around the world and identify some of the most effective treatments is unveiled in New York on Wednesday. The Countdown Global Mental Health 2030 project is aimed at improving the sketchy data for illnesses like depression and anxiety, and establishing proper metrics so that countries can be compared with one another. A scorecard will be produced every two years, so that the best performing countries can be held up as examples to the rest. The broad aim is to pinpoint successes and failures in treatment and encourage states – and donors – to invest in what works best to deal with illnesses that afflict hundreds of millions of people. “When it comes to mental health, all countries are developing countries,” said Shekhar Saxena, a Harvard professor who is leading the project in conjunction with the World Health Organization, the Lancet and other civil society NGOs. “There will be comparisons across countries and across time,” he added. “We need to measure how much progress we have made, and establish how we allocate resources.” The problem is that information on the mental health of nations is patchy, unreliable and hard to compare from one country to the next, making it difficult to set targets. There are no blood tests or X-rays that identify these types of illnesses, and much of the data rests on self-reporting or extrapolation of surveys. A tracker measuring the deleterious effect of disease on society – the global burden of disease – has operated since 1990, but its mental health component is shot through with uncertainty. Some countries have relatively robust assessment approaches, including doctor surveys and cohort studies. But many poorer countries do not. Additionally, the WHO collects information on services available in each country – the Mental Health Atlas – but here there are also big gaps. Dévora Kestel, the WHO director of mental health and substance abuse, says the aim is a “more real mapping of the situation”. “I am convinced that many countries are not even aware of the mental health burden in their population. So we need a stronger argument. If they do things that are doable in terms of funding they will be able to improve the mental health of the population – and also the economy of the country.” The countdown metric is being unveiled at the “Goalkeepers” summit on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. Kestel said that if mental health needs were more accurately pinpointed it would help donors make more judicious investments to improve global mental health outcomes. Victor Ugo, a Nigerian who set up a mental health self-help group in Nigeria because of the lack of services and treatments, said a clearer picture of the prevalence of illness – and the shortcomings of treatment – could spur the authorities into better responses. “This will mean that we can see where we are – with data, policies and programmes and funding within the African states. That will help us demand better accountability and better systems.” This article is part of a six-month global series on mental health.

    "date": "2019-09-25",
    "transcript": "It was a most unusual consultation. Dr Ayo Ajeigbe received the patient at his private practice in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, in his customary welcoming manner. But there was, it turned out, nothing wrong with the man. And when Ajeigbe asked why he was there, he simply replied: “I just wanted to see what a psychologist looked like.” Perhaps he shouldn’t have been surprised. Mental health professionals are rare in Nigeria, as they are in many other developing nations. In Africa’s most populous nation – a country of more than 200 million people – there are an estimated 150 practising psychologists. If mental health treatments are patchy, inadequate and underfunded in most western nations, they are practically nonexistent in the majority of lower- and middle-income countries – more than 100 countries worldwide. Here mental health provisions are the poorly resourced afterthought of health budgets that are in any case likely to be meagre. So what is to be done? Ajeigbe decided that a partial answer lay in the voluntary sector. A year ago, he agreed to head up the Abuja section of Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (Mani), a burgeoning user-led organisation fast emerging as a multi-pronged solution to Nigeria’s mental health crisis. Mani was launched in 2016 by Victor Ugo, a then medical student from Lagos who had suffered from depression, as a response to the lack of mental health support in Nigeria, where an estimated 7 million people have the same condition. Ugo’s vision was to drive change by raising awareness and dispelling stigmas that exist around mental health issues in Nigeria. And on Wednesday, he will appear at the annual Goalkeepers event on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, to make the case for more funding and fairer treatment for mental health. “If you have depression,” says Latifah Yusuf Ojomo, the deputy head of Mani’s Lagos team, “people can cast you as mad, which means that the majority of people who have mental health issues in Nigeria do not understand, or want to accept what they are feeling.” From the outset, Ugo decided that if Mani was to have any significant impact it would need to focus attention on the country’s most populous demographic. “Young people [in Nigeria] are much more open to learning new things,” explains Ugo, “they are much more focused on ways to change.” Mani needed a “cool factor”, something Ugo says was sorely lacking in the mental health sector: “Symposiums, that was all that was happening with mental health in Nigeria, just more and more symposiums, people would give a lecture saying we need to increase awareness, but nothing was happening.” Ugo and a small band of medical students took to social media, sharing stories and launching online campaigns. Then in October 2017 they hosted their first event, not a symposium as Ugo is keen to point out, but a food fair: “We just said come and you can taste different delicacies, play games and talk about mental health in a cool way.” The event was a huge success, and evolved into a series of monthly workshops focused on topics such as depression and anxiety. As Mani continued to grow in numbers, these meet-ups became known as “conversation cafes”, held in restaurants, parks and cafes, and eventually spreading to cities all over Nigeria, including Abuja and Ibadan. Each month, a different topic is selected – childhood trauma, the benefits of mindfulness, relationship strains, the reactionary attitudes of the “village” – a case study is presented and discussion groups form. Two years later, Mani is now a leading voice on mental health issues in the country, with more than 1,500 volunteers and active in 13 of Nigeria’s 36 states. Ugo is still taken aback by what the project has achieved. “We didn’t know we were going to end up here; in fact, I feel like we have been a hundred times more successful than we expected at the start.” Despite the initial success, Ugo knew that still more needed to be done. “We thought if we don’t balance this with some kind of help, we will cause more harm than good.” So, in 2017, Mani launched a 24-hour mental health support service to run alongside its awareness campaigns. The service allowed people to reach out over WhatsApp or Twitter for emergency help in the form of advice, counselling and supportive listening. An emergency response team was also created via a network of volunteer counsellors. Mani also launched a confidential 24-hour suicide hotline. Attempted suicide is a criminal offence in Nigeria, punishable by up to one year in prison. Currently, only 3.3% of Nigeria’s total health budget goes towards mental health, which leaves the public system chronically understaffed. It also leaves Mani with a limited pool of professionals to recruit. As a solution to this, Mani launched a “train the trainer” system in which mental health professionals educate volunteers in subjects such as active assistance and safe talk (a programme that teaches participants to recognise and engage individuals who may be a suicide risk). Ajeigbe explains: “What we do is train people in fundamental mental health skills, so if I train 10 people, they can in turn reach 100 people.” Mani’s volunteers come from a diverse range of backgrounds. Alle Ayodele, the head of the organisation’s Oyo state chapter, was studying microbiology when he decided to volunteer for Mani after coming across its support team on Twitter. He had been impressed by its speed and professionalism in responding to a series of suicide notes that were trending: “Mani took them really seriously, as soon as someone posted a note they stepped in.” Ekene Okeke, from Lagos, has a background in sociology and criminology. After suffering from depression and connecting with Mani on Twitter, she decided to volunteer for it. Okeke was recently called out on an emergency where a woman had high levels of anxiety and had been alone for several days. “I dropped what I was doing, and spent hours talking with her, I even went and bought her ice-cream.” It’s moments like this, Okeke says, that make volunteering so rewarding: “In the end, the woman was able to calm down and has since reached out for help.” Informal mental health support networks like this are becoming more prevalent around the world, as people realise that health systems cannot cope with mental illness, and that society will have to come up with other strategies. Examples include park bench psychotherapy in Zimbabwe, a peer-support initiative in Kenya, community-based self-help in Pakistan and the Phola organisation in South Africa. In Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, Mani has launched a training programme for schools. The programme will include a series of “mental health clubs” where students are taught about coping mechanisms, the effects of bullying and consent workshops. Mani also trains teachers and parents on children’s mental health, the latter a group that Ugo identifies as especially crucial. “Culturally, young people are not allowed to speak up,” explains Ugo, “you have to listen; respect is really crucial. If I need help, I ask my parents and they decide if I need help.” When Mani’s WhatsApp service began in 2017 it immediately identified an issue. “Many more females seek help than men,” Ajeigbe explains, “this is because according to societal norms men are supposed to be emotionally strong.” About 85% of the initial calls were from women, so Ugo and his team researched how their service could appeal more to men. “We read that men are much better at using test-based services,” says Ugo, who immediately incorporated a test into the programme. This resulted in a 40% increase in men reaching out. Recruitment of volunteers is one area where Mani does not need to worry – it currently has 500 applications waiting to be processed. “The good thing is that many people who talk to us end up volunteering for us,” says Ugo. More than 10,000 people have now spoken with Mani using its WhatsApp service. The success of Mani may have exceeded Ugo’s initial expectations, but he is not one for complacency. He has now set his sights on persuading the government to change the national policy on mental health. He is also seeking a broader funding base, as 90% of the costs of the organisation are borne by the founders. “At the moment we are still very much self-funded, Ugo says. “This is a big challenge, considering how much more impact we believe we can make, and the speed with which we are growing our network across Nigeria.” • Mani can be contacted at contact@mentallyaware.org and on +234 805 1493163 • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

    "date": "2019-09-23",
    "transcript": "To err is human, it is said, to forgive divine. And soon that noblest of human qualities will be available in emoji form, following a global effort to find the most appropriate icon. A coalition of charitable and peace-building organisations in Finland are leading the quest to crowdsource an emoji to be added to the thousands available to smartphone users. Ideas for the emoji mooted on the campaign’s Instagram include a vine of leaves cast across a love heart, two people from different ethnicities clasping hands in front of a heart, and a love heart with a plaster placed upon it. “In our modern digital communication culture, emojis are an essential way of expressing human feelings beyond words,” says Tuomo Pesonen, from the Evangelical Lutheran church of Finland, which came up with the idea and is one of the founding organisations of the #forgivemoji campaign. “We were surprised to realise that the official emoji selection has dozens of different cats and even two designs of zombies, but there isn’t an emoji for forgiveness.” He explained how the campaign will strive to promote a message of peace and mutual understanding across the world and that it was hoped a future emoji would help encourage people to carry forgiveness into their every day communications. Campaigners will urge managers of the emoji list at the Unicode Consortium to add the winning idea to the collection, which is used by millions of smart phone users across the world. There are thousands of emojis, from yawning faces, to falafels, mischievous sloths and prosthetic limbs, and of course the ubiquitous smiling turd. A new “drop of blood” icon was also introduced this year following a campaign by Plan International UK, a girls’ rights charity to introduce a period-themed emoji. But of all the weird, wonderful and miscellaneous icons, none appear to equate to saying sorry. Antti Pentikäinen from the Deaconess Foundation, a non-profit organisation helping disadvantaged people, said reconciliation was key to sustaining peace. “Without it, conflicts continue in cycles and get worse,” she said. “We urgently need to learn better how to reconcile. These skills are needed everywhere. Different ways to encourage apologising and forgiveness are an essential part of it, and this includes the social media environment.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-09-22",
    "transcript": "In a makeshift studio, in an empty house on a ridge with a spectacular view of trees and blue sky, two artists are setting out brushes and paint. Half-finished canvases lean against walls. The bustle and noise of the city is far away. Gresham Tapiwa Nyaude and Helen Teede are among a new wave of young artists in Zimbabwe who are attracting attention from collectors and curators worldwide. Both now work in a converted house surrounded by forest, a 40-minute drive from the capital, Harare. Almost two years after Robert Mugabe, who died this month, was ousted in a military takeover, Zimbabwe is enjoying an unlikely boom in contemporary art, despite an economic crisis and unstable, sometimes violent, politics. The success is linked to its problems, the artists say. “We want to talk about the time we are living in [in our paintings] … It comes out abstract and indirect but we have a collective responsibility to address what we know, what we see … There is source material in every day,” Teede, 31, told the Guardian. Valerie Kabov, who runs the First Floor Gallery in the centre of Harare and represents many emerging artists, said the post-Mugabe boom had been “unequivocal”. “We’ve had a lot of international collectors coming and there is interest growing all the time … For a very small population of artists, the number of internationally successful artists that have emerged from Zimbabwe is really extraordinary.” Kabov attributes the depth of talent in Zimbabwe to a tradition of education and intellectual inquiry, and “living in a really interesting matrix”. “They cannot make work that is not important because there is nothing in their lives that is not important. There is none of this navel gazing. Here everything is real. The work comes from a really strong place emotionally … You add a little bit of skill and … boom!” Art from across the African continent has enjoyed a surge of international interest in recent years, with works newly visible in art shows, featured in the specialist media and sought after by major institutions. In Cape Town, on one of the world’s most recognisable waterfronts, a vast new art museum, the biggest ever in Africa, opened in 2017. The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa has already been described as “Africa’s Tate Modern”. There are also new museums in Marrakech and Lagos. Last year, the prestigious Frieze magazine published a long report on contemporary art in Zimbabwe. The South African Goodman gallery is opening in London next month with a show that includes works by Kudzanai Chiurai, one of Zimbabwe’s best known contemporary artists. Another well-known artist, Misheck Masamvu, won fame when Zimbabwe invested in a pavilion at the Venice Biennale art fair in 2011. Since 2012, Kabov has travelled to international art fairs to represent her artists and boost the international profile of the country in the contemporary art world. “Zimbabweans themselves are not aware of the extreme talent in their midst, because it is not considered an indigenous tradition,” she said. The devastating economic legacy of Mugabe’s 40 year rule means artists in the former British colony face many obstacles: a lack of exhibition spaces, limited opportunities to sell their work and difficulties getting basic supplies of artistic materials. Teede is concerned that the lack of a major domestic art market will mean that little work currently being produced remains in the country. “There’s always been a crazy amount of talent here … But all the best work that is being produced at this super exciting time is being sold overseas and that is a big loss. In 50 years maybe there will be a museum and it will all have to be brought back,” she said. Many aspiring artists attend workshops run by the National Gallery, founded in 1957 and housed in a Le Corbusier-inspired building in the centre of Harare. Nyaude, who studied at the National Art Gallery for two years and was picked to exhibit at the high-profile New Museum Triennial in New York last year, said one factor driving the boom was economic. “You have a possibility as an artist to do pretty well and there is so little other opportunity so if you have a drive to make art, that’s a push factor,” he said. Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former spy chief and senior ruling party official who was confirmed as Mugabe’s successor in a contested election last year, had promised voters he would make Zimbabwe “open for business”. But foreign investment and re-engagement with the international community has been stymied by widespread human rights abuses. “Living in Zimbabwe, you are affected by the politics every day, not directly, but it is there … The absurdity of the situation defies language. You can’t speak about politics directly here.Painting is a way of working things through that you can’t think through logically,” said Nyaude, 31. Amanda Mushate, a 23-year-old artist represented by Kabov, said the biggest obstacle she faced was reconciling her creative ambitions with the expectations and habits of her friends. One recent painting, entitled WhatsApp Gold, was inspired by the intensive use of social media of many of her peers. “The biggest difficulty as an artist is to be myself, to be the real me in my social life,” Mushate said. “Other girls of my age, they are interested in their careers and don’t understand me being an artist. If they came to appreciate what I do, that would be my biggest achievement.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-09-19",
    "transcript": "The global climate strike kicks off on Friday and will ripple across the world in more than 4,000 locations, the start of a weeklong movement to train international attention on the climate emergency. It’s the latest of a succession of strikes on Fridays led by schoolchildren – but this time adults are invited to join in. What will happen? Millions are expected to take to the streets in more than 130 countries, with support on this occasion from unions, churches, and local community groups. Some are calling it the biggest mass protest in the history of the climate crisis. How can you get involved? Possibly the best place to start is by consulting the Fridays for Future map, which details what is going on and where in more than 130 countries – and thousands of locations – worldwide. Hovering over the pin brings up basic details of where the action is happening. It’s worth noting that timings will vary from city to city and that some countries (notably New Zealand and Italy) have put back their protests until Friday 27th. More detailed information can be found by searching Twitter for a city or location near you and adding the hashtag #climatestrike. Another useful global resource is the global climate strike website which offers ideas on how to organise workplace or lunchbreak action, as well as how to add banners to websites and social media pages, if digital solidarity is as much as you can manage. Friday’s action is expected to be widespread in many countries with plenty of regional happenings to draw people who don’t want to waste all that carbon by travelling. There will be an estimated 800 actions in the US, 400 in Germany, and scores more in the UK, Australia, France and Belgium. In all, 13 Indian cities and 12 Indonesian ones are taking part. Of course, the major capitals are the places to head for the biggest crowds. London’s event starts at 11am, but marchers are being warned that police will restrict them to Westminster, so careful as you go. The action in Brussels will culminate outside EU headquarters, after starting at the city’s North station. In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and “citizens meetings”. The action group Libérons le Louvre (Liberate the Louvre) is planning an “action” at the museum in protest at its long-standing partnership with the petrol group Total. In Berlin, typically, the day will climax with a 3pm outbreak of techno at the Potsdamer Platz under the motto “No Future, No Dancefloor”. Extinction Rebellion have announced plans to block traffic at strategic points “where it will hurt drivers” around the capital. New York City is anticipated to host the biggest climate strike the country has seen in decades. Thousands are expected at the strike, which is being co-hosted by more than two dozen local and national groups. Protestors plan to gather at a park outside New York’s City Hall at 12pm and march a mile down to Battery Park, where Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak in the afternoon along with other performers and speakers. If you are out and about, do keep us posted on what is happening. But of course, the strike is just the start. The next question is: what will you DO?",

    "date": "2019-09-18",
    "transcript": "A bio-plastic made of organic fish waste that would otherwise end up in landfill, with the potential to replace plastic in everyday packaging, has landed its UK graduate designer a James Dyson award. Lucy Hughes, 23, a recent graduate in product design from the University of Sussex, sought to tackle the dual problems of environmentally harmful single-use plastics and inefficient waste streams by harnessing fish offcuts to create an eco-friendly plastic alternative. Her solution, a biodegradable and compostable material called MarinaTex, can break down in a soil environment in four to six weeks and be disposed of through home food waste collections. Hughes, from Twickenham, in south-west London, used red algae to bind proteins extracted from fish skins and scales, creating strong overlapping bonds in a translucent and flexible sheet material. Although it looks and feels like plastic, initial testing suggests it is stronger, safer and much more sustainable than its oil-based counterpart. It is estimated people in the UK use 5m tonnes of plastic every year, nearly half of which is packaging. Only 51% of local authorities in England have separate food waste collections and even where recycling schemes are in place, the majority of bio and compostable plastics are not generally suited to existing waste treatment infrastructures. An estimated 492,020 tonnes of fish waste are produced by the fish processing industry every year in the UK and it is considered a huge and inefficient waste stream with low commercial value. Unwanted offcuts include offal, blood, crustacean and shellfish exoskeletons and fish skin and scales, all of which ends up in landfill or incineration. Through research carried out on the Sussex coast, Hughes found fish skins and scales were the most promising sources for the plastic alternative, due to their flexibility and strength-enabling proteins. A single Atlantic cod could generate the organic waste needed for 1,400 bags of MarinaTex, she found. “Plastic is an amazing material, and as a result we have become too reliant on it as designers and engineers,” Hughes said. “It makes no sense to me that we’re using plastic, an incredibly durable material, for products that have a life cycle of less than a day. For me, MarinaTex represents a commitment to material innovation and selection by incorporating sustainable, local and circular values into design. As creators, we should not limit ourselves to designing to just form and function, but rather form, function and footprint.” As this year’s winner of the UK category of the James Dyson award, Hughes won £2,000 for her invention. It will now be entered in the international category for the final leg of the award in November, which will give the overall worldwide winner a further £30,000 in prize money, plus £5,000 for the winner’s university department. The award operates in 27 countries, and is open to university students and recent graduates studying product design, industrial design and engineering. It recognises and rewards imaginative design solutions to global problems. This year’s runners-up are an AI-enabled wearable device to help monitor asthmatic symptoms and predict triggers, designed by Anna Bernbaum, of the Dyson School of Engineering, in London, and solar panels which can be draped over backpacks or tents, invented by Bradley Brister, of Brunel University London.",

    "date": "2019-09-17",
    "transcript": "A new effort to rally governments and corporations behind technologies that suck greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to help stave off disastrous global heating will be launched at the United Nations on Tuesday. The first annual Global Climate Restoration Forum, held in New York, aims to spur international support for emerging and sometimes controversial methods to claw back planet-warming gases after they have been emitted from power plants, cars, trucks and aircraft. The Foundation for Climate Restoration, the group behind the forum, has released a manifesto for its goal to “restore” the climate by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to those of a century ago. Atmospheric CO2 is rising sharply, peaking at 415 parts per million this year, far above the level during most of human history, around 300ppm. The foundation aims to restore this historical norm by 2050, saying success would be on a par with the moon landing or the eradication of smallpox. It warns that the current climate is leading us “down a path toward the probable extinction of our species and thousands of others”. “Mother Earth will survive without us but we’d like for humans to survive too,” said Rick Parnell, chief executive of the foundation, which was created last year. “This is the beginning of a 10-year strategy to get governments and companies to understand the need to restore our climate now. Humanity got us into this situation, it can get us out of it.” Global average temperatures have increased by around 1C in the past century due to the buildup of planet-warming gases from human activity. World leaders have agreed to limit this rise to 2C, and ideally 1.5C, although global greenhouse gases are not declining and major emitters such as the US and Brazil have shown signs of going backwards. Any realistic chance of avoiding highly dangerous levels of global heating will likely involve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, either through mass reforestation or nascent technology that either eliminates it from industrial processes or sucks it directly from the air. The Foundation for Climate Restoration’s report outlines the most promising of these options, such as Climeworks, a Swiss company that uses giant machines to pull CO2 from the air and use it in greenhouses to boost plant growth. It has more than a dozen projects under way and has partnered with an Icelandic project that injects CO2 deep underground into basalt formations. Another avenue defined by the foundation as “permanent, scalable, and financeable” is a company that turns CO2 into limestone that can be used in building. It recently supplied concrete for a new terminal at San Francisco’s airport. The report also mentions the intentional placing of iron in parts of the ocean to boost its ability to absorb CO2, as well as efforts to seed reflective sand across the Arctic to reduce escalating melting. Some environmentalists have rejected such approaches as radical geoengineering that will have harmful unintended consequences. Others have criticized the development of CO2 removal technology as distracting from the need to reduce emissions. However, the UN-hosted forum highlights the narrowing window to confront the climate crisis before scientists’ warnings of severe societal impacts become reality. “Mitigation and adaptation are absolutely critical in climate change, the piece missing is restoration,” said Parnell. “It’s not about leaving things as business as usual, younger generations won’t allow that. But we need a breakthrough, we need to go further.” David Keith, a Harvard academic who has led solar geoengineering work, said it was “encouraging” that the ideas were being discussed but said the ambition of the forum may be a little unrealistic. “I think the timescales they propose for deployment of carbon removal make little sense and seem ungrounded in the real-world politics of cutting emissions which ought to be our first priority,” he said. Klaus Lackner, director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University, said it would be difficult to restore the Arctic and that iron fertilization of the oceans “has not been proven. In fact most data suggest that its contributions would be small, they also would have large ecological impacts.” “I think [the foundation] wants to do the right thing, but it is also important to do a careful analysis,” Lackner said.

    "transcript": "Who would you give a knighthood to? It’s a question that has preoccupied Britain this week after former prime minister Theresa May conferred honours on a few personal favourites, including a former cricketer convicted of domestic assault and political advisers whose advice turned out to be not so shrewd. The list raises an obvious question: what is an honours system for? Should it be for people who play games for a living? For people who were simply doing their job? Should it be for people whom life has already rewarded – with fame, wealth, status, fans, admiration? Or should it be for unsung heroes whose celebration might encourage more of us to volunteer, give, sacrifice? So come on Upsiders, now is your chance. Email us at theupside@theguardian.com with a name (obscure, well known, old, young, British, foreign, we don’t mind) and a short statement as to why they deserve to be Upside Legends. We will publish the best responses here. If you agree with Galileo and think the whole system is a nonsense, now is your time to vent. As food for thought, there are plenty of good candidates for Upside Legends in our weekly Upside offerings, in particular: 1. The people of St Ives, trying to turn their town into a paragon of mental health (three-minute read). 2. The psychiatrist rescuing mentally ill people from the streets of India (two-minute read). 3. The medics who have dramatically improved cancer survival rates in the developed world over the past 20 years (two-minute read). 4. The researchers trying to save the northern white rhino using IVF (18-month gestation period). 5. New tech to help disabled people (90-second read). Lucky numbers Beijing’s air is getting better. Actually, the same is true in the UK: better, though perhaps not yet good enough. Also, somewhat randomly, in some eastern European countries, more than half of all scientists are women, according to the Economist. What we liked This piece from Positive News looks at the various groups standing up to online bullying, a pervasive problem that causes mental illness. We’re also intrigued by this plan to give Americans $50 to donate to a news outlet of their choice – a measure to breathe new life and funding into a moribund sector. What we heard From Celine Pompeia in Brazil: There’s a nice story in the Brazilian newspaper “A Folha de São Paulo”, Sept 9, page A3, about the benefits gained by prisoners given access to books. There does seem to be lots of evidence of the benefits of giving prisoners something to do and something to aim for. And Anthony wrote in by email: We need to establish ways to reward people that don’t encourage a larger carbon footprint. Paying an income for people to live on is fine, but our culture is to incentivise and reward through further payment and that’s problematic. When people acquire spare money most of the feel-good, status related ways to spend it are high-carbon, such as bigger cars or houses, or holiday flights. Everyone ends up aspiring to things with a bigger carbon footprint. There are lower-carbon rewards, such as esteem within the family, locality or wider, or individual services – if I became rich I’d hire decorators. But for these and other examples, although they exist at a grand scale their more modest counterparts aren’t readily identified, sourced or, crucially, aspired to widely or commonly used for reward. I’d like to know what others make of this issue. Where was the Upside? In Denmark, where the government found $1.6m to buy the country’s last four circus elephants to allow them to retire. Also, out there on the dark side, on a planet far, far away… Thanks for reading. Spread the word. And above all, email us with your thoughts or share them via our form.

    "date": "2019-09-11",
    "transcript": "Australia has better cancer survival rates than other similar high-income countries, a global study has found. The study, published in the Lancet Oncology journal by the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, reviewed 3.9m cancer cases from Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Norway, Ireland, Canada and Denmark and compared the one-year and five-year survival rates for seven types of cancer: bowel, oesophageal, pancreatic, stomach, rectum, lung and ovarian. Australia had the highest five-year survival rate in all but lung and ovarian cancer. The five-year survival rate in Australia for oesophageal cancer was 23.5%, stomach cancer 32.8%, colon cancer 70.8%, rectal cancer 70.8% and pancreatic 14.6%. All countries showed an improvement in one- and five-year survival rates over the data period, which extended from 1995 to 2015. The UK had the lowest five-year survival rate of five of the seven cancers, the exceptions being oesophageal (lowest in Denmark) and ovarian (lowest in Ireland). The chief executive of Cancer Council Australia, Prof Sanchia Aranda, said the higher survival rates could be attributed to earlier detection, which she said was due to the management of referral and screening services in Australia. Australia had the densest per capita availability of imaging services for the seven cancers represented in the study, Aranda said. “In Australia our primary care practitioners can refer patients for a full range of investigation, whereas in places like the UK that’s mediated through a secondary referral to a specialist,” she told Guardian Australia. “So we can get it done much earlier, and either rule out cancer or make a directed referral.” Australia’s split public and private health system also allows a doctor to refer a public patient to a private diagnostic service, with part of the cost of that service covered by Medicare. Aranda said that model took the burden off the public system and “evens out outcomes” but there was still a sharp divide in survival rates between wealthy people and those from lower socioeconomic groups. “People in the lowest socioeconomic group have a 37% higher mortality from cancer than people in the highest economic group,” she said. “So we shouldn’t be complacent about being number one. It should spur us on to make sure that those outcomes are equitable across their population.” People from lower socioeconomic groups had a lower rate of participation in national screening programs for breast, bowel and cervical cancer, Aranda said. Poorer people are 40% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 2.5 times more likely to die from it. Among Indigenous communities, rates of mortality are 3.8 times higher. Only four in 10 eligible Australians (those aged 50 to 74) take part in the national bowel screening program. A 50% increase in participation would save an additional 84,000 lives through early diagnosis by 2040, Aranda said. The director of cancer medicine at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Prof Danny Rischin, said the study showed the Australian system was working relatively well to provide high quality care. But he urged caution in interpreting the data, because of classification differences between jurisdictions. “I think the important trend is that overall, looking at the seven countries and across the different cancers, we’re right up the top for all of them and if we’re not first we’re second,” he said. “So I think overall the results suggest that our system is working relatively well.”",

    "date": "2019-09-11",
    "transcript": "“A minister, a pub landlord and a mayor … it sounds like the start of a really bad joke, doesn’t it?” The Rev Matt Finch laughs as he recalls the origins of a novel attempt to create a paragon of mental health in the small Cambridgeshire parish of St Ives. The three men – who walked not into a bar but a coffee shop – are trying to bring a smile back to the face of a community that has suffered its share of recent blows. As a collective, they hope their string of initiatives to reach people in their darkest hour could establish St Ives as a model town for others to emulate, in an age of growing mental discomfort. An old market town around 12 miles north-west of Cambridge – population 16,384, according to the 2011 census – St Ives is venerable enough to feature in the Domesday Book. Back then it was known as Slepe. There have been some rude awakenings of late. In April last year 28-year-old Carl Malik, a popular regular at Floods, the pub at which Phil Pope worked his way up from teenage glass collector to proprietor, took his own life; a loss compounded by the suicide of his father Kevin seven years earlier. Last December, 26-year-old Adam Hyde, a keen cricketer for St Ives and Warboys cricket club, did the same. Tim Drye, who replaced Pope as mayor in May 2018 – and whose son was a friend of Carl’s – decided it was time to act. “It resonated with me,” he says. “I’d had mental health issues of my own at university. I said something in my speech about supporting a few existing charities and wanting to make St Ives a better place for mental health and to do something, not knowing what it would be. That phrase created a ripple that spread to others.” Finch was one. A textbook trendy vicar, boyish, with tousled locks and a ready smile, Finch marked his 40th birthday by cycling from London to Paris for Calm, the Campaign against Living Miserably. Wearing Calm’s T-shirt initiated conversations that brought home just how many people struggle with mental health. “In all, 84 men under 45 take their lives every week in the UK – and no one talks about it,” he says. “If this was affecting the baby-boomer generation, or retired people, we’d be all over it. “So, Tim and I said: ‘Let’s try to make St Ives a Calm Town.’ Around 50 people – including Carl’s mum – came to our first meeting, which drew out people’s details, interests, gifts and talents. We planned another and invited people to be part of a guiding team.” That sparked a network of spontaneous activity, as Amanda Mumford, a hydrologist with a cheery smile and winningly self-deprecating manner, explains. “I’d been reading one of those books you pick up in Waterstones, written by the CEO of the Danish Institute for Happiness – there was a chapter about getting to know your neighbours, and building communities,” she says. “Not long before there was a lady on our street whose husband had died. I wanted to knock on her door, but wasn’t sure I’d know what to say, which seemed a real shame.” Inspired by the meeting, Mumford decided to get everyone together. “So, last Christmas, we took a drinks invitation to every house on our street – 46 in all – just to pop in, low-key, on a Saturday for a mince pie. We thought: ‘What’s the worst that can happen? No one will come and we’ll have a load of mince pies.’ But people showed up – including many who have lived on the street for years, decades, and hadn’t met each other. I think there’s a lot of loneliness out there – and it can be easier to open up to people you don’t know well.” On a sultry night in late summer, the Calm Town team gather at Floods to discuss their push for the autumn. Monday is market day in St Ives. Under the stern gaze of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in the market square – the erstwhile lord protector once lived here – local people go about their business. Once cattle and grain were traded by those going to St Ives. Now, against a backdrop of high street staples such as Wetherspoons and Greggs, they rummage among anything from Turkish towels to “Graveside vases - £2” and boxes of batteries, cooking foil, coin holders and assorted frippery. It’s still early days for Calm Town – the group admit they are finding their feet – but they are clearly energised and exercised by giving structure to their simple initiatives: group walks, coffee mornings and signposts to help. The junior section at Warboys cricket club now sport caps with the Calm Town logo; there are school tie-ins where seven-year-olds are pen pals with 97-year-olds. Discussions are going on about establishing the group as a charitable trust. The committee natter about their Facebook page, whether a separate website is required, and where the “calm couch” – a customised sofa taken to local events – is wanted next. It’s all very English, very polite and, it has to be said, motivational. “If we can develop a culture in our town now that it’s OK to talk – and my 12- and eight-year-old sons grow up realising that this is how you spot if your mate’s struggling – that could be an amazing 10-year project,” Finch enthuses. “We’ll be a town that has a vocabulary around mental health when starting conversations is often the most difficult part. “What we’re about is a movement for change – and I think any town, any village can do what we’ve done. It’s just saying: ‘We care passionately about this.’” Pope’s next wishlist item is mental health first-aid training courses for local businesses, having been on one himself. “I haven’t had one person say no,” he says. “You might sit in a hairdresser’s chair for up to an hour – they’re the kind of people who really are going to be able to tell where you’re at.” When I suggest to Drye that it’s reminiscent of the Games Makers, the volunteers who so enlivened the 2012 Olympics, he agrees wholeheartedly. “And I was so cynical about that!” he says. “But the wonderful thing is that it’s triggered a lot of really creative people. I was back in my home town, Barnsley, the other day, thinking: ‘How could you make that work here?’ “St Ives is a very good place to live – a nice vibrant town with a good economy – you’ve not got that there. Still, if it only encourages some people to give it a shot, and they make the place better than it was, that’s a good enough place to be.” Besides Mumford’s “meet the street” initiative – a forthcoming community barbecue has garnered several offers of help – there are calm walks, courtesy of yoga and pilates teacher Nicola Guitart, weekly 25-minute strolls from the top of the town with rallying points. Lisa Valla, head of Eastfield infant and nursery school, holds a monthly calm coffee morning for parents to come and chat. “If you just put ‘free cake’ and ‘I promise we won’t speak to you, you’re just there to chat to each other’, you get them in,” she laughs. Designer and art gallery assistant Laura Bridgens feels planting the seed is as critical as the work itself, especially for a group who are, essentially, enthusiastic volunteers. “There’s a danger of trying to do too much,” she says. “Calm cuppa, calm walk, meet the street, first-aiders – linking Calm Town to the school community, pointing people to links with teenage mental health – that’s enough for now. If we clarify and crystallise the simple things we’re trying to do and do them really well, then, hopefully, it should grow organically.” Drye agrees. “It’s a group of people who’ve grasped the nettle and run with it,” he says. “There’s a lot of interest in trying to see how a ground-up approach to mental health might complement a strategy developed by somebody in the NHS to try to impose on the location. “What’s surprised me is how many different things are already in place, like the NHS 111 option 2, where you can ring up and talk to somebody – I’d never heard of that. If all we end up doing is raising awareness of some of these professional groups, then that would be really good.” (Editorial note: NHS 111 option 2 is only available in some regions). Mumford adds: “Because we’re still relatively new, very amateur, we’re still trying to work out exactly what Calm Town is – and what it isn’t. But it’s brought together people interested in making a difference. There aren’t many of us and it’s quite challenging, but it’s got legs. “If you just make a little effort to do something, you can make a big difference – and helping people makes you feel good. “We want to inspire people to develop their own initiatives and do them in their own way, whatever works for them, rather than dictating what people should do, or doing it for them.” The steering group winds up – monthly responsibilities and checklists are doled out, farewells are said. On the River Great Ouse that has flowed past the Grade II-listed Floods beer garden for centuries, a gull alights on the surface, creating a ripple illuminated by the rays of a brightly fading sun.

    "transcript": "Bonjour! This week, the Upside has left behind BoJo’s baffling Brexit and holed up in Paris, where we have been attending the grandly named Convergences World Forum 2019. You have to admire the aim: zero exclusion, zero carbon, zero poverty. The mood was uber-positive. “You are the indispensable vector for transmitting inspiration,” conference lead Thibault Larose told an evening session (though my translation might be a bit literal; I’ve been called many things, but never a vector). There was no shortage of upbeat news (though no one could tell me how you say “the Upside” in French). A joint project by France Inter and Konbini on combating single-use plastics, a sneak preview of an imminent enviro movement called On est prêt and a discussion about whether soap operas can encourage activism among parts of the public that the mainstream media doesn’t reach. We were asked about the origins of the Upside, the challenges of the work, and even about our growing newsletter following (that’s you – we were very complimentary). We weren’t asked about our greatest hits this week, but if we had been, we would have said: 1. The Irish village matchmaking asylum seekers with locals. Two-minute read. 2. The innovators trying to take the carbon out of air travel. Three-minute read. 3. Are mental-health first aiders the answer to workplace distress? Three-minute read. Lucky numbers HIV diagnosis in England fell to its lowest level for almost two decades. Meanwhile, organ donation among BAME communities rose to the highest level ever. What we liked Back on the apparently popular theme of being nice to other human beings, we salute Unesco’s attempt to champion some of the world’s kindest people. Some inspiring examples here. And also here, courtesy of the lesser-known East Idaho News, which reports on a girl who made $400 from a lemonade and cookie stall in her front yard – and GAVE ALL THE MONEY AWAY to a children’s hospital. With video goodness. Of course, it’s not just about being kind to other people. One woman in the Bahamas sheltered 100 stray dogs from the onslaught of Hurricane Dorian, according to CNN. And finally, another piece in praise of slow, serious journalism, as opposed to shrill, rapid digital hysteria … What we heard Karsten Hein writes from Berlin: We are a group of blind and sighted people centred around our photo studio for blind photographers in Berlin. We started our projects on blindness and visual art in 2012. At the beginning we learnt how to overcome a handicap, visual impairment, with the help of one of the eminent human abilities, cooperation. The blind photographers started soon to develop personal styles. Building on their growing visual imagination and the not-less-eminent human ability to turn a handicap into a benefit, they are now creating unique pictures. Next Friday they will receive the prize of the jury of Wiesbadener Fototage. Now we plan a new project. On the internet pictures are like black holes for blind people. Principally every picture on the internet should be described. Yes. Where to begin? We thought Wikipedia would be a good place and German Wikimedia agrees with that. So in 2020 we will start a joint project on picture descriptions for Wikipedia. The project will be to look for multipliers in the search for picture describers. Schools, universities etc that shall commit to have their students of art, art history, creative writing etc write a certain amount of picture descriptions per semester. And we received this, from Lindsay Viljoen I think human acts of kindness is important. What about covering articles like animal-rescue successes, ecology-rescue successes, festivals and events which make people feel good? They don’t have to be articles in other publications, they can be from members of the public who write in. What about looking at people who volunteer and the reasons why they volunteer? I volunteer as a dog walker at our local Dogs Trust branch. Why do I do it? Because it makes me feel good. What about people who have paid train fares for people who haven’t enough money to pay for a ticket, or bought food for someone, rescued a hedgehog? I think there is an overwhelming amount of good done in the world. Where was the Upside?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/02/uk-training-record-number-of-mental-health-first-aiders",
    "date": "2019-09-02",
    "transcript": "Britain is training record numbers of workplace “mental health first aiders” to confront a sharp rise in people expressing mental distress, though evidence of success is mixed, according to a Guardian study. Requests sent to every FTSE 100 company show that they alone have trained more than 10,000 staffers, while mid-tier and even tiny businesses are appointing first responders who can be approached confidentially by those with depression, anxiety, stress and other conditions. A national training body, Mental Health First Aid England, said 140,000 people were trained in 2018-19 – the most ever in a single year, from local hairdressers to employees in global corporations. Almost half a million people in Britain have now been through an MHFA programme – about one in every 100 adults. “We have worked in more than 20,000 businesses and organisations,” said its chief executive, Simon Blake. “The exciting thing for me is that training courses are as likely to have someone from a shop in Doncaster as from a City firm.” In terms of numbers, big firms lead the way. More than half the FTSE 100 companies have mental health first aiders (some call them “buddies”, “champions”, “advocates” or even “be well allies”). Lloyds Banking Group has a programme to train 2,500 by next year, while National Grid and Severn Trent both have more than 1,000. The BBC, NHS and other firms including Goldman Sachs are in on the act. The construction and finance sectors seem particularly keen. Government departments have trained prodigious numbers: the Department for Work and Pensions alone has more than 1,000, according to Blake. But there is concern that mental health first aiders are being viewed as a panacea when actually their impact can be quite limited. In a report last year, the Health and Safety Executive concluded: “There is limited evidence that MHFA training leads to sustained improvement in the ability of those trained to help colleagues experiencing mental ill health.” Academic research has found that training is good for raising awareness, but unproven as a strategy for improving mental health. Experts in workplace health warn that some recruits might not be the best people for what is a subtle role, and warn that first aiders need support and supervision themselves to ensure their own wellbeing. They add that a two-day training course does not produce instant experts. Alan Bradshaw, a business psychologist, said: “My main problem with it is that organisations see it as a tick in the box. It’s essentially reactive, when what they really need to be doing is the preventive bit, the proactive management of stress risks at work.” Dr Jo Billings, a consultant clinical psychologist at UCL, said: “There are pros and cons. Anything that raises people’s understanding of mental health is a really good thing. But it’s not sufficient to tackle mental illness in the workplace.” While some companies may be keen to simply tick boxes, others say that their first aider programmes are part of a bigger strategy. Some offer free subscriptions to digital tools such as Headspace and Unmind. Others provide counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for staff. Many have confidential helplines, often known as employee assistance programmes. Mental health first aiders volunteer for the role and typically complete a two-day training session. They are not counsellors, psychologists or experts, but simply first responder “listeners” who can signpost services. Imogen Truphet, who works at the School of Life in London, says the intense two-day course gave her confidence to respond to distressed colleagues without saying the wrong thing. “You listen without judgment, you give them information and support but you don’t give them advice,” she says. “You encourage them to seek the appropriate professional help – mostly but not always about going to your GP – and encourage them to talk to family and friends.” Natalie Rose, a wellbeing champion for HS2, says: “The first thing you have to do is listen. Show some understanding, compassion, have patience, point them in the right direction of where they can get some support.” “If there was someone I was wildly concerned about I would let them know that I had a duty of care to speak to someone else about it. It’s a fine line because we do not replace any trained medical specialists.” Mental health first aid came to the UK from Australia in the 2000s, but took a long while to take off. Trainee numbers were low until the middle of this decade, when concerns over the sharp rise in the number of people presenting with mental distress prompted a response from business. Blake agrees that MHFAs alone will not transform the psychological wellbeing of a company or organisation, and emphasises that it has to be part of a bigger strategy that includes work-life balance and managing the sources of stress in the workplace. “Mental health first aid on its own is not enough,” he said. “We need to ensure prevention, early intervention, job design and to ensure that people are not tied to phones and emails all the time. “Mental health first aid works best in an organisation that has started thinking of things like this.” Case study Niki Garcha-Davies has worked for six years in Lloyds’ risk division. Last year she did the two-day training course to become a mental health advocate, and quickly found herself applying her new-found skills. “I take part in charity fundraisers and earlier this year I went on a walk with some colleagues. We went off in a big group and I started talking to one colleague about why I was doing the walk. It was easy to get to the conversation of mental health. My colleague started talking about their own situation. “I just made sure they were aware of the resources available to us – the Headspace app is free, for example. I spoke about how I’d used it and also about how the employee assistance programme is just a phone call away. They contacted me afterwards to say how much they had appreciated the chat, they had used the app and were planning to reach out to the assistance programme.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/02/can-blind-people-make-great-architects",
    "date": "2019-09-02",
    "transcript": "Visualise yourself entering a new building. What do you notice first? The answer for most people will probably be the internal structure, the colour of the walls, the light entering through the windows. But stay a little longer and you might start to experience the space differently: you’ll hear sound reverberating, you’ll feel air currents, textures and materials, you’ll smell wafts from the kitchen. For blind people, this multi-sensory experience is their first impression of a space. And now a new programme is trying to harness that unique ability by training more visually impaired people to become architects. As the first step in running a foundation course aimed at people who see things differently, the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL ran an architecture and design workshop for people with visual impairments this summer. “Going to start an architecture degree as a visually impaired person is so horrendously daunting, there’s so much that’s inaccessible,” said one of the students on the five-day course, Poppy Levison, who is about to start studying at Central Saint Martins. “I’ve been brought up to analyse spaces,” she says. “I remember my vision support worker when I was four asking: ‘Is it better if the window’s behind you in the classroom?’ It’s something I’ve always been asked to think about.” One key exercise in the workshop involves documenting how different spaces make you feel. Levison has particularly enjoyed sharing thoughts with her fellow students. “I know my experience, but that’s not what’s always going to be best for everyone,” she says. “Some people really like daylight, and some people really don’t. It’s about finding ways in the future to balance those ideas within a building.” The workshop is run by the DisOrdinary Architecture Project, which aims to change attitudes towards disability and accessibility. DisOrdinary promotes the social model of disability, which argues that people are only disabled when they are confronted with a barrier. If those barriers are removed, the disability ceases to exist. As such, the founders believe that integrating the perspectives of people with a range of disabilities into the architectural design process from the outset will build better spaces for everybody. “If people from a whole cross-section of society aren’t involved in architecture, then the outcome at the end won’t work,” says Zoe Partington, an artist and one of the co-founders. “If you develop a building with incredible acoustics capabilities so sound doesn’t reverberate around, it’s not just about disabled people, it works for everybody,” says Partington. “It can still be a beautiful environment, aesthetically amazing, but you can get the balance right.” Visually impaired architects are also more attuned to the importance of wayfinding, which is especially valuable in public transit areas, as well as the need for space for guide dogs – which likewise benefits wheelchair users and people with children. Jos Boys, a co-founder of DisOrdinary and a lecturer at the Bartlett, thinks there is growing interest in inclusion and alternative perspectives. “It feels like a new generation’s coming in,” she says. “My experience with younger students is that they’re much more interested in that stuff, they see it as a positive, it’s something they really want to get engaged with.” The Bartlett’s work with DisOrdinary is led by its dean, Alan Penn. As well as wanting to increase diversity in a profession he describes as a “monoculture” dominated by white architects from mostly affluent backgrounds, he is looking to foster new ways of thinking about architectural aesthetics. “It occurred to me you’d get different ideas if you had some people involved where the visual sense wasn’t their primary way of thinking about things,” he says. “I’m trying to disrupt the architectural fixation with the visual. I don’t want to patronise blind people or lead them up the garden path.” He testifies to genuine interest from the profession in increasing representation from people with visual impairments and other disabilities. “As soon as I mention it to leading practices, Norman Foster and so on, they want to be involved. They have the same issues about diversity and new thinking.” Although there are some visually impaired people working as architects (often without disclosing their disabilities for fear of stigma), Penn has identified just two practising blind architects in the world. One of these is Chris Downey, a San Francisco-based architect who teaches on the DisOrdinary course. He lost his sight 11 years ago, after 20 years in the profession. Downey is doubtful that, at present, architecture is a viable profession for someone who has been blind since birth. While there are workarounds to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to contribute – for instance through tactile drawings and 3D printing – licensing exams are a barrier. “I don’t know that you could go into a traditional practice,” he says. Nevertheless, there is a spectrum of visual impairment, and Downey thinks that even for those who are completely blind, there is value in learning the principles of architectural design, not least because these can be applied to a range of creative careers. His experience of becoming blind later in life has fundamentally shaped his understanding of the purpose of architecture. “It’s less about the sight I’ve lost, but the realisation of how much of the environmental experience that I wasn’t designing, that I was leaving to chance, leaving to possible failure because I wasn’t designing for it,” he says. “I’ve discovered more possibilities and a strategy toward a richer design than I was working with when I was sighted.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "Matchmaking Irish village finds harmony with asylum seekers",

    "date": "2019-09-01",
    "transcript": "It seemed a match made in hell. The village did not fancy the asylum seekers. The asylum seekers did not fancy the village. Residents of Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, on Ireland’s west coast, rejected a government plan to settle asylum seekers there in a lopsided vote: 197 against, 15 in favour. Authorities ignored the vote and bussed in dozens of people from Africa, Asia, eastern Europe and the Middle East to a hastily converted hotel in April 2018. The newcomers feared hostility and isolation in a windswept village with few amenities and poor transport links. It was a forced union laden with irony: Lisdoonvarna was famous for a venerable matchmaking festival that draws tens of thousands of visitors each September. Now, 16 months later and with a new festival under way, it turns out that on one level the match has largely worked: villagers and asylum seekers have warmed to each other. “They are very active in the community and are very well-liked,” said Elsha Daly, the daughter of Willie Daly, Lisdoonvarna’s official matchmaker. “People here have become very accepting of different cultures.” Other residents – business owners, taxi drivers, older people – echoed the sentiment. The new arrivals said initial anxiety had turned to relief as they encountered friendliness and generosity. Emboldened, several plan to attend the matchmaking festival, which started on Saturday and continues until the end of September. “People are good to me. They make me feel welcome,” said Mputu Wabalekelayi, 30, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The single mother of two is open to romance. “I want to see the music and dancing. Sharing is good. Maybe I’ll meet somebody.” Sayed Ali, 20, who arrived from Bahrain, said rudimentary English would not deter him from socialising. “People say hello. I feel safe. It would be nice to meet girls.” Ireland’s policy of accommodating asylum seekers in rural hotels – a response to overcrowding at shelters in Dublin – has prompted protests from residents who cite cultural differences and strain on public services. Arsonists in Roosky, County Roscommon, twice attacked an empty hotel earmarked for asylum seekers. Authorities cancelled the move. Lisdoonvarna, in contrast, has channelled the spirit of its festival. Launched 160 years ago to find wives for farmers, it has broadened into a global, LGBTQ+ friendly event for singletons and music lovers. “Some matches are made in heaven but the best ones are made in Lisdoonvarna,” says the slogan. The 107 asylum seekers at the King Thomond, a three-star regency-style hotel just outside the village, have settled into the community without backlash. The children attend schools and many parents have found work. Volunteers from Lisdoonvarna and neighbouring villages visit the hotel to teach knitting, host coffee mornings and help with transport. “The people are good, decent,” said Smoyo, 47, a Zimbabwean who declined to give her last name. With her meagre cleaner’s wage she half-joked about storming the festival with a friend. “We are looking forward to getting some men.” Several factors smoothed the integration. A spa town, Lisdoonvarna is accustomed to foreigners. Residents sympathetic to hosting people fleeing persecution appear to have been underrepresented in the vote. Increased school enrolment should help Lisdoonvarna avert the school closures that afflict other rural communities with dwindling populations. Hotels, B&amp;Bs and restaurants are grateful to have workers willing to scrub pots and toilets – jobs difficult to fill. Asylum centres can be grim, with bad food and surly staff, but the King Thomond is well-run, said Orla Ni Eili of the Clare Immigrant Support Centre. Asylum seekers there endorsed that. Willie Daly, a fourth-generation matchmaker credited with 3,000 marriages, relished the prospect of matching asylum seekers with some of the estimated 40,000 visitors expected to pack the village in coming weeks. He meets clients in the Matchmaker bar and notes their details in a leather-bound folder tied with shoelace known as “the lucky book”. He advises clients to be relaxed – intensity, or worse, desperation, can repel suitors. And to be decisive. “The good-looking and the good dancers, they get spoiled with attention and sometimes can’t choose.” Despite the festival bunting and “love is in the air” slogans, Lisdoonvarna is hardly a fairytale ending for asylum seekers. Ireland’s system of “direct provision” satisfies material needs but traps asylum seekers in a bureaucratic limbo of dependence and uncertainty about their fate that can last years, causing anxiety, stress and depression, according to critics. Ending up in rural areas – a money-saving tactic for the state, which rents hotels on the verge of closure – can compound feelings of isolation and frustration. “I’m stuck, not happy,” said a woman who fled violence in eastern Europe. She had no intention of joining the revels. “The festival means nothing to me.” Another woman, aged 29, said she had fled an arranged marriage in the Middle East to a much older man. She was bemused at the prospect of being matched at a festival still associated with elderly bachelors. Vikisha Sesay, 25, in contrast, was intrigued. Having escaped homophobia in Sierra Leone, Sesay hoped to meet other members of the LGBTQ+ community and to see Irish craic in action. “I want to experience it. Why not?”",

    "transcript": "Leila Rahimi was so scared when she first moved to New Zealand that she struggled to leave the house and would spend days working up the courage to walk to the supermarket for basic supplies. “I was so, so depressed, and I was so down and so unhappy,” says Rahimi, 36, a football player and coach from Iran who arrived in New Zealand as a refugee in March 2018. A few months after settling, Rahimi was invited to join a local bike club, and was given a second-hand bicycle by ReBicycle, a local charity. Within weeks, her depression had begun to ease as she cycled the steep green hills and harbour paths of Wellington, sometimes travelling 45km on a weekend. “That bike totally changed my life, it gave me hope,” says Rahimi. “I love that bike. I bike everywhere. I feel free now.” New Zealand accepts 1,000 refugees a year under its quota system and many struggle to access affordable and reliable transport options. A driver’s licence and a car can sometimes take years to acquire. Hilleke Townsend, co-founder of ReBicycle EkeRua, says many former refugees have never learned to ride a bike in their home country, and women are particularly disadvantaged because cycling can be frowned upon for cultural reasons. Long robes and loose-fit clothing can also be an obstacle. ReBicycle has donated more than 200 bikes to former refugees in Wellington, and is now expanding bike-riding lessons around the capital as demand soars. Another 500 donated bikes have gone to Kiwis who struggle to afford one. “Giving people a bike means they can travel further afield but for almost no cost,” says Townsend, who said some former refugees spend as much as three hours a day walking to and from English language lessons. “If we cut down on transport time it gives people more opportunity to socialise and have a normal life.” ReBicycle’s bike-riding lessons are such a hit it is urgently looking for more volunteers to work with former refugees. Learning to ride a bike is almost always more difficult as an adult, Townsend says, and can take days and weeks, rather than hours. For Rahimi, cycling has given her confidence. Rahimi has also learned to fix bikes and volunteers helping other refugees learn to ride. She also enjoys the competitiveness of the sport – with other riders challenging her to ride further at weekends and beat their record. “I used to be so shy,” says Rahimi. “But they don’t care about who I am; they just care I am human. They give you a good feeling that you are safe, finally.”",

    "date": "2019-08-31",
    "transcript": "“Flight shaming is not going to solve all our problems,” says Liam Megill at the start of another marathon day trying to make aviation history. “You can’t take a train to the [United] States, so instead we have to make flying sustainable.” Greta Thunberg demonstrated this week that you can travel long haul without burning fossil fuels. But not everyone can travel on a zero-carbon yacht. In the global battle against carbon, aviation is one of the toughest challenges of all. Grids are getting ever greener thanks to renewables, cars are going electric, even construction is exploring new ways to become more sustainable. But air travel is popular, dirty and, most importantly of all, hard to power with anything other than hydrocarbons. That’s where Megill comes in. The German-Canadian is seeking the holy grail of air travel – a manned aircraft powered by a liquid hydrogen fuel cell. The technology, engineered by the non-profit organisation AeroDelft which he co-founded in 2017, promises a sort of atmospheric alchemy: a power source whose principal emission is water vapour. It’s 8am and Megill has an 18-hour day ahead of him, culminating in a nail-biting control and systems test flight at nearby Rozenburg, the Netherlands, and then back to the workshop until 2am to finalise the wing and tail mould designs, paint part of the internal fuselage and run some simulations. Making aviation history is hard graft, but if the team’s latest endeavour, Project Phoenix, is successful, flying could become not just the safest form of long-distance transport, but eventually also the greenest. A shiny white, yellow and blue prototype for Project Pheonix’s motor glider was unveiled in April to a ticketed audience, and boasts a range greater than 2,000km, at a cruising speed of 200km/h, on just one tank of liquid hydrogen. Inside Phoenix’s simple, tented workshop within Delft’s Tec Factory, the ambitious project, says Megill, is “slowly becoming a reality”, as daily deliveries – from 100 metre rolls of fibreglass to tiny electrical components – begin piling up. The full-scale, two-seater aircraft should be ready for testing by 2021, and Megill, a qualified flight instructor, may even pilot it himself. The design features a pioneering “boundary layer suction”: 14m tiny perforations on the wing to reduce drag. Safety features include sensors and vents, in case of a hydrogen leakage, and an electric battery should the fuel cell fail. Revisiting hydrogen since the Hindenburg (1937) and Challenger (1986) disasters can be a hard sell. “In the public’s mind, they still have hydrogen as a very scary, difficult substance to use,” acknowledges Megill. “[But] it isn’t all that much.” Hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant element, produces three times more energy per kilo than kerosene, although in gas form (at 700 bar), is six times the volume and requires heavy compression tanks. Phoenix keeps the hydrogen in liquid form by storing it at -253C (-423F), halving the space needed. But hydrogen’s trump card is that, when mixed with oxygen to create electricity, it emits nothing but water vapour, unlike conventional jet fuels, which are spewing out ever larger amounts of carbon dioxide every year. AeroDelft is investigating measures such as storage tanks to ensure that all water is released at low altitude or in dry air to prevent cloud creation which can have a greenhouse effect. Liquid hydrogen has been flight tested as far back as 1988, with the Soviet Union’s Tu-155. But like Boeing’s Phantom Eye 25 years later, it relied on a combustion engine, losing about 70% of the fuel in forces of friction and heat. Phoenix’s liquid hydrogen fuel cell, explains Megill, will be twice as energy efficient as a fuel-burning system. Sceptics point out that most hydrogen is still produced using steam methane reforming (SMR), which even with carbon capture and storage, still creates as much as 150g of greenhouse gases per kWh. Creating hydrogen via electrolysis is more costly and the process (excluding manufacturing)is carbon neutral only if the electricity is generated with renewables. “If you produce hydrogen in a dirty way, it has no advantage over kerosene,” says clean technology expert Bertrand Piccard, who, in 2016, completed a carbon-free flight around the globe in Solar Impulse, a plane whose electric batteries were 97% energy efficient and powered only by the sun. Piccard’s achievement was widely heralded. But the solar option looks a long way from becoming a mass-market alternative. Scaling up the single-seat aircraft, whose solar-cell-covered wingspan was already as large as a jumbo jet, is still problematic. “It’s not tomorrow that we fly fully solar aeroplanes with passengers … but it will come,” says Piccard, who points to fuel-saving aircraft towing systems (ATS) and route-optimising software such as SkyBreathe as “an intermediate way” to reduce the carbon cost of flying. The other technology under exploration is battery-powered aircraft. Norway announced last year that it wants all short-haul flights to be electric by 2040. But sceptics counter that battery cells will never be enough to power big aircraft and long-haul flights, and that hybrid solutions will have to come first. Though hydrogen production is increasingly efficient and projects such as Big Hit on the Orkney Islands and HyBalance in Denmark are good examples of hydrogen being produced efficiently, fully sustainable hydrogen-based aviation is still some way off. “Hydrogen would be facing a strong headwind if it wants to be the solution to sustainable aviation, especially in the timescale that we know we have to act,” says Julian Beach of Green Fuels, the world’s leading manufacturer of biodiesel equipment. Biofuels, for their part, have been extensively criticised for the huge amounts of land that would be required to produce sufficient quantities of fuel to make a difference. In 2017, 69 countries, including the Netherlands and the UK, voluntarily signed up to Corsia (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) targets, which include more than halving aviation’s CO2 emissions by 2050. For Megill, a carbon-free future for aviation requires time, courage and collaboration. “Our goal is to show that it works and hopefully convince others to make the infrastructure to make green hydrogen,” he says. He hopes that by 2030 the technology that the Phoenix has demonstrated could be used to create a commercial passenger aircraft, but a major investor would need to take over. A 1:3 scale model of Phoenix, with a wing span of 5.7 metres, will make its maiden flight next year, doubtless highlighting once again that carbon-neutral flying is technically possible, and that liquid hydrogen is a potentially sustainable fuel. Until investors see the value in that, flying less is probably still the best path of travel. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Match point. A muscular, tattooed man takes a deep breath before raising a hand to serve. His opponent purses his lips in concentration. The crowd is hushed. A ball is fired across the room, clips the edge of the table, and it’s game over. The crowd erupts in cheers and burly men launch themselves on to the winner. Blokes playing ping pong might seem prosaic enough. Only on this occasion they are in jail. A prison guard watches over the hall, as the banter kicks in and other matches resume, older hands coaching newer members of the group. “Everyone who’s here now is not getting into any trouble, and that’s because there’s an incentive,” says Axel James, 30, a prisoner at HMP High Down in Surrey for the past three years. “You get a good rapport with the officers. When they know that you are well behaved, you get more gym sessions and it can lead to other sports as well.” He attends the table tennis sessions each week. To qualify for the weekly sessions, inmates must have a good record – no violence, drugs or abuse are tolerated. Traffic-light stamps that denote behaviour are meticulously recorded in a log book. Too many red entries and prisoners stay locked in their cells. The incentive appears to be working: violent behaviour has fallen by 83% among attendees – and demand is growing. So far 250 prisoners have passed through the programme since it started two years ago, with many on a waiting list eager to play. The initiative is also aimed at tackling one of Britain’s most stubborn justice problems: the revolving door that puts offenders out on the streets and then sucks them back in again. According to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures, 29% of adults and 42% of young people reoffend within one year of release. But a select committee report this summer claimed recidivism can be dramatically reduced with sports-based programmes both in and after prison. James looks forward to the sessions all week because he believes the movement and concentration required by the game allow him to mentally break free from the tedium of prison life. “There’s a lot of eye contact, you have to remain focused because it’s a quick game,” he says. “So I would say it’s an escape for prisoners.” Coaches and volunteers from Brighton Table Tennis Club have been going to High Down every week to train the inmates as table tennis coaches. So far they have awarded 24 level 1 coaching qualifications. The group have got to know each other well, and have developed a genuine camaraderie as the prisoners and volunteers laugh and embrace one another in victory. “I’m really very fond of them,” says Sandie Clark, 72, a volunteer who has travelled the hour to High Down every Tuesday for a year. “They get scarred by the prison, but when they’re with us they remember who they are. There’s a warmth and an intimacy there which is not allowed for the rest of the week. The fact that people are interested in them gives them a bit of confidence – many of them are unsure of themselves.” She adds: “They’re going to come out with more than just a qualification – it empowers them, they can see other ways of coping with things.” Michael, 51, who used to be at HMP High Down and is now at an open prison, frequently returns on day release for the table tennis club. “At times, if they’re short staffed and there’s been incidents, people can be left in their cells for three or four days and only come out to get their food and go back to their wing,” he says. Tensions reach boiling point, so physical activities like ping pong “release that tension”, he believes. “Ping pong also brings people together across the prison buildings. You are one big community in prison even though you don’t like half of the people. We all have to mix, we all have to get on, we’re living under each other, like a powder keg situation.” For Jack Finch, 34, the programme changed his life. He was introduced to table tennis in High Down during his two-year sentence. On release he went straight to Brighton Table Tennis Club and got a full-time coaching job in Moulsecoomb, on the outskirts of the city. “There’s nothing for these kids to do in Moulsecoomb, so when they see me, they’re happy to get involved in something. I’ve been there and it’s tough,” he says. “Crime is the last thing on my mind – I’ve got so much going on,” he says. “But I could’ve easily been tempted to go back to it.” Rosie Meek, a psychology professor at Royal Holloway, University of London and author of the MoJ’s 2018 review of sport in prison, says that giving people a positive and alternative identity to that of an offender is a really powerful predictor to reduce reoffending. “Coaching is a valuable and meaningful way to do it,” she says. “If we can equip people with the skills once they come out of prison to become volunteers in their communities, to engage their kids, maybe, in table tennis, or even for some to work in this sector … that’s really powerful.” The programme has proven so successful that the MoJ says it is “considering options for extending it further”. So far, the nearby women’s prison, HMP Downview, and Ford open prison in West Sussex have introduced similar schemes. The new justice secretary, Robert Buckland, welcomes the ping-pong scheme for “truly harnessing the power of sport to change lives and reduce reoffending”. He adds: “It is vital that we set offenders up with worthwhile skills such as teamwork, leadership and discipline, so they have a better chance of securing employment on release and resettling back into the community.” Back at High Down, James believes ping pong is his ticket to a life outside jail. “I would definitely say having a sport like table tennis, having people come in, it opens doors for a lot of people. How are we supposed to be better people if we’re not given that opportunity?” Some names have been changed",

    "title": "The female bakers healing rifts in Central African Republic",

    "date": "2019-08-28",
    "transcript": "The bakers of Bamingui have lost loved ones to war. Rebel soldiers drive past their roadside bread ovens daily. A spectre of violence remains. Regardless, Yvette Abaka and her female baking collective make dough and roll with it. In this impoverished, rebel-held corner of the Central African Republic (CAR), this group of mothers came together last year to better their lot. Since then, their loaves have become a hit in the wider community, promoting the women as their families’ breadwinners and promising further, quietly profound, change. “This bakery makes us more powerful than before,” says Abaka, the group’s leader and a 50-year-old mother of two. “My husband respects my work. Now I am his equal.” In this turbulent country, scarred by years of conflict, Abaka’s bakers are not the only people hoping for something good to come out of the troubles. Following a major ceasefire brokered earlier this year between the government and 14 rebel militias, groups of women are coming together across the nation to reinforce the grand strategy for peace at a community level. They are rebuilding their country from the ground up, forging formidable sisterhoods in the ashes of a protracted conflict. High rates of sexual violence, maternal mortality and teenage births have made CAR one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. But now female activists, displaced mothers and survivors of rape have joined forces to heal deep wounds and restore trust between opposing ethnic factions as part of an ambitious attempt to mend a broken country in the heart of Africa. Besides Abaka’s bakers, another group called Femme Debout (“Woman Standing”) is defying religious tensions by bringing together Christian and Muslim widows in Bangui, CAR’s capital, teaching them commercial skills and helping traumatised individuals recover collectively. Elsewhere, in camps for displaced people, where people shelter from militants who use sexual violence as a weapon of war, survivors enrol with associations to fight the stigma of rape and to cultivate hope. “Such groups are vital forces for social change,” says Viola Giuliano, a researcher in CAR for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an NGO focused on civilian protection. “They are uniquely placed to find and prioritise solutions and enable a sense of ownership of the peace process, which is key for sustainable, long-term reconciliation.” In the northern village of Bamingui, lead baker Abaka is familiar with such horrors of war, having survived six years of it. In 2013, an alliance of mainly Muslim rebels assembled close to her village before running amok through the rest of the country, committing atrocities and seizing power in a bloody coup d’etat. In response, “anti-balaka” militias consisting of Christians and animists rose up and carried out revenge attacks against Muslim communities. Increasing waves of violence killed thousands, displaced more than a million people and prompted warnings from the United Nations of an impending genocide. The rebel coalition has since fragmented into numerous armed groups competing over territory and access to mineral reserves. Among the many fatalities was Abaka’s son. Her brother, aunt and grandfather also perished in the bloodbath. Today, gunmen from the same rebel group that killed them frequently drive past her home and bakery. While the militants’ presence has taken on a surreal air of normality, Abaka’s war-weary community – like others nationwide – fear this uneasy truce could shatter at any time. “At first the kids were scared of all these weapons, but now they’re used to it,” she says. “But I do worry that the war will begin again. We’ve already lost so much. We cannot afford for it to happen again.” Despite these concerns she presses ahead, along with seven friends, with what they do best. They rise at dawn and congregate to scrub baking trays, gather large logs, chop up kindling and light fires in the kilns. Beneath a tin roof, they knead dough into hundreds of rolls. Small ones sell for the equivalent of 7p, a medium one for 14p, a loaf for 35p. Any profit is split between the women, allowing them to buy key household items and reinvest the remainder. Revenues are modest; the impact, big. With almost half the country affected by acute food shortages and several regions teetering on the brink of famine, food production for malnourished communities is crucial. The bakers sell to local Muslim families, bringing once-divided communities together to intermingle in the marketplace. And in a place where the international response to a humanitarian crisis has received less than 50% of the funding it needs, a little extra cash represents a lifeline for struggling families. “This bakery is the only opportunity we have to make any money by ourselves,” says Estella Yarsara, Abaka’s fellow baker and a 27-year-old mother of five. “This work means I have some extra food for my children too. I do this to help myself and to help my family. We all want to lift up our community.” The job has upended a conservative hierarchy, helping Yarsara challenge her role in society: “If I have some money and my husband does not, I can intervene and support him. It is making our relationship more equal. I don’t have to depend on him. I have more strength in the family.” Their bakery opened last September, kickstarted by an EU-funded initiative. While this programme was focused primarily on wildlife conservation in the nearby Bamingui-Bangoran national park, officials were keen to reach out to the wider community. In addition to the bakery operation, other locals are taught how to farm guinea fowl, produce shea butter and air-dry beef in order to reduce an unsustainable dependence on bushmeat. Reverent Yakoudou, a park manager, knows the value of this investment: “Women are more reliable with money. They use all their profits to look after their family and reinvest in the business.” Abaka’s vision for the bakery’s future confirms this. She hopes eventually to open up a permanent shop, selling their bread among many other products: “That way we can help our children and our community even more.” Although separated by hundreds of miles of rebel-held roads, Abaka would find a sister in arms in Florence Atanguere, who runs the Femme Debout women’s association for widows and orphans in Bangui. Many of its members have suffered displacement and witnessed extreme violence, yet despite the war’s divisions along religious lines, Christians and Muslims are welcomed alike. Supported by UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, the group meets every week on the edge of the capital to discuss their difficulties and successes. From sewing to soap-making, they are taught new skills, helping them foster solidarity and a boisterous, entrepreneurial spirit. “Little by little women are getting together to fight back,” says Atanguere, a mother of six who saw her brother stabbed to death when rebels stormed her neighbourhood in late 2013. She fled to a squalid camp for displaced people and eventually returned home three years later, founding the association with the women she met there. “We are sisters. We are all Central Africans. It doesn’t matter whether you’re Muslim or Christian. Here, we are all equal.” While the worst of Atanguere’s ordeal is over, more than 600,000 people remain displaced within CAR, with a similar number uprooted as refugees outside the country. Many of the women have been raped by militants. Yet among these exiled communities, there is resilience and a restless desire to rise above such harrowing circumstances. One of them is 18-year-old Céleste, who was five months pregnant when rebels attacked her village in northern CAR late one night. Gunshots and the roar of motorbikes woke her. “They raped many girls and tortured many men,” said Celeste, just 15 at the time of the attack. She wasn’t spared either. Four soldiers entered her house, each taking turns to rape her: “My pregnancy was visible but they still did it anyway.” Afterwards, she fled her village and hid in the bush for several days, surviving on whatever she could find to eat. Her distress was amplified by memories of what she had lost. Before the war, she had enjoyed helping her father farm cassava, okra and peanuts, participating at school as an enthusiastic dancer and eager pupil. Now, forced from home, her sense of helplessness grew when she learned a few days later that her fiance – the father of her unborn child – had been murdered in the course of a car-jacking. Céleste, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, eventually made it to a displacement camp on the outskirts of a rebel-held town called Kaga Bandoro. She moved into a cramped tent where she saw out the last few months of her pregnancy but could not shake off the psychological and physical pain of the attack. “Sleeping at night has been hard,” she said softly. “It is difficult to forget. I miss my fiance terribly.” Yet even in this overcrowded and perilous camp, where armed groups freely operate, Céleste has started to overcome this nightmare. A friend introduced her to a women’s association where fellow survivors of rape enter a shared process of mutual healing and, together, tackle the stigma of sexual violence. “I now feel that I have the strength to deal with what has happened,” said Céleste. “The pastor at church teaches us to forgive, let go and move on. During therapy sessions, we can express ourselves. We talk about what has happened and discuss any problems that we still face.” Céleste and her fellow members are keen to return to school. Their dream: to take up midwifery and help pregnant mothers receive the care that war and poverty have denied them. In spite of the camp’s dangers and dreadful conditions, her son is now two years old and in relatively good health. With her country edging towards greater stability, Céleste clings to the hope of a life beyond their tiny, dusty tent – for now, the only home her child has ever known. • Jack Losh is a journalist, photographer and filmmaker with a focus on conflict, conservation and humanitarian issues This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "When Hind Ayadi decided to do something about the amount of rubbish in her neighbourhood, kickstarting a national cleaning campaign was not her intention. But “Ma cité va briller” (“My suburb is going to shine”) has become just that: a viral initiative that spread throughout France, to Algeria and beyond in just a few days. Ayadi, founder of youth arts nonprofit Espoir et Création, lives in Garges-lès-Gonesse, part of the northern suburbs of Paris and previously famous only for gang violence. But at the end of July, Ayadi and other members of Espoir et Création decided to work with local young people to raise awareness of environmental issues and the importance of protecting natural resources – as well as encouraging them to feel proud of their town. Hind managed to inspire around 40 residents between the ages of eight and 25 to volunteer to pick up litter and trash all over the city for almost a week. “Teenagers don’t always feel preoccupied by environmental issues but this time, they wanted to get involved,” Hind explains. Impressed with how much of a difference they saw around them and keen to see it go further, the volunteers decided to use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to challenge the southern French city of Marseille to make a similar effort. Teamed with pictures of their work, the hashtags they used, #cleanchallenge and #marseille, immediately went viral. And to their amazement, Marseille accepted the challenge. “When I found out about the challenge and our nomination, it was obvious that we had to take over,” says Ismaël Cousin, president of Marseille education nonprofit, Action Bomaye. Cousin recruited a group of 20 local families who cleaned up the streets of Marseille – before challenging Montpellier. Since then, the word has just kept spreading. Residents throughout the country have been inspired to get cleaning – whether their city has been directly challenged or not. Nice, Poissy, Perpignan and Mantes-la-Jolie embraced the trend last week along with 25 other cities; while others including Argenteuil, Stains and Arras are poised to join the list. But while there is certainly less litter around, in Garges-lès-Gonesse, crucially, not only did challenge participants make sure their city was clean, they also improved its image. Before the challenge, Garges-lès-Gonesse had a bad reputation; local and national media coverage tended to be limited to reports of violence. In fact, on July 21, just a week before the cleanup, a 29-year-old man was severely wounded after being shot three times in the middle of the street. Known for its long-standing neighbourhood gang rivalries and violence, Garges-lès-Gonesse is relishing its new role as the linchpin of a national initiative. “Conflicts are rife, the younger ones like to challenge one another on Facebook or Snapchat,” Hind points out. “That’s why I wanted to encourage them to join a cause that would still imply the challenging part but with a positive impact on their neighbourhoods. It brought them all together, even those who were part of rival groups.” The project has become symbolic for the residents, refocusing attention and casting a positive light on their city. Now, instead of shaking their heads at another report of bloodshed, people are congratulating and even emulating them. Thanks to the power of social media, cleanup challenges have become increasingly popular. The Instagram-friendly #trashtag movement is another online challenge that gained global prominence earlier this year, encouraging people to choose a spot to improve and to share striking before-and-after pictures of their handiwork. Similarly, Ma cité va briller is proving to have global appeal. Following its success in France, residents of Aïn Benian and Ghazaouet, both in Algeria, decided to roll up their sleeves last Friday – and have subsequently challenged cities in Morocco and Tunisia to do the same. Back in Garges-lès-Gonesse, proud volunteer Adil Nazir, 16, marvels at the scale of the response: “It’s rewarding to see that we’ve reached so many people,” he says. “Now, we’re fully committed to keeping our city clean.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "title": "Optimism may hold secret to longer life, study suggests",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/optimism-may-hold-secret-to-longer-life-study-suggests",
    "date": "2019-08-26",
    "transcript": "Seeing the glass as half full may mean a longer life, according to research suggesting that optimists not only live longer in general, but have a better chance of reaching 85 or older. It is not the first time optimism has been linked to health benefits. People of an upbeat disposition have previously been found to have a lower risk of heart conditions and premature death. Researchers now say it could also play a role in living a long life. The team behind the study say their findings could also be cause for cheer. “A lot of evidence suggests that exceptional longevity is usually accompanied by a longer span of good health and living without disability, so our findings raise an exciting possibility that we may be able to promote healthy and resilient ageing by cultivating psychosocial assets such as optimism,” said Lewina Lee, the lead author of the study at Boston University School of Medicine. While such a possibility has yet to be tested, Lee noted that other studies have shown optimism levels can be raised. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Lee and colleagues report how they analysed data from two previous long-term research projects, one involving female nurses and the other focused on a cohort of men. The former were assessed for optimism in 2004, with participants having an average age of 70, and followed until 2014. For men, optimism was assessed in 1986, with participants having an average age of 62, and deaths tracked until 2016. The team split about 70,000 women into four equally sized groups, based on their scores for optimism. They then compared lifespan for the most optimistic with the least, taking into account factors including age, sex, race, education, depression and other health conditions present at the outset. The results show the most optimistic group of women had a lifespan almost 15% longer than the least. Similar results were seen in men, even though optimism was measured slightly differently. When the team compared the fifth of men boasting the highest optimism scores with the least optimistic, they found the most positive men had lifespans almost 11% longer. Research suggested people who are more optimistic might also lead a healthier lifestyle, thereforethe analysistook into account factors including exercise levels, diet, smoking and how much alcohol participants drank. The resulting effects were smaller – although still pronounced – with the most optimistic group of women having a 9% longer lifespan than the least optimistic. The most optimistic fifth of men had a 10% longer lifespan than the least. These figures remained almost unchanged for women when social life was considered, although for men a clear link to optimism was no longer present – possibly because of the smaller size of the male group. But being optimistic was not only linked to a longer lifespan. For men and women it was also linked more specifically to living to 85 or older – “exceptional longevity” when health behaviours were taken into account, with the most optimistic group of women having 20% better odds of reaching age 85 than the least. Most of the participants in the study were white, and few had low socioeconomic status – meaning more research is needed to see if the findings hold in other groups. Also, income was only considered among the men, and for men and women optimism was only considered at one point in time. Lee said it was not yet clear why optimism is linked to longevity. “In our study, healthier behaviours, fewer depressive symptoms, and more social ties only partially accounted for the association from optimism to exceptional longevity,” she said, adding there are likely to be other mechanisms at play, such as optimistic people coping better with stress. Dr Catherine Hurt, an expert in health psychology at City, University of London, said the study highlighted the importance of psychological wellbeing alongside physical wellbeing for living a long and healthy life. “The results suggest that as well as educating and encouraging people to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly to maximise longevity we should also be promoting psychological wellbeing and the importance of optimism,” she said. “An optimistic outlook appears to be a key part of a healthy lifestyle.” Lisa Bortolotti, the professor of philosophy at University of Birmingham, added other forms of optimism could also bring benefits. “We can also have biased views of our abilities and our future: we may think that we are excellent drivers, or that we will never get a divorce, when evidence suggests otherwise. These biases can be good too. If we believe that we can attain our goals, we are more likely to persevere when difficulties arise.”",

    "transcript": "In the age of hysteria, polarisation and antagonism, it’s a relief to know that simple acts of kindness are not a thing of the past. The Guardian’s Upside series asked its readers to write in this summer with stories of the kindness of strangers. Here is the best from the mailbag. Thanks a lot I suspect most of us, distracted by whatever, have gone into a mall and paused in confusion upon leaving, trying in vain to remember where we parked in the relentless sea of cars the same colour as ours (in Arizona, white is popular for obvious reasons). That happened to my wife Mary yesterday. She is 83 and moves a little slowly. Part way down the first aisle, she realised that “lost car syndrome” had struck her. It was 105 degrees out. A young woman in a huge SUV stopped, lowered her window, and asked if she was having trouble locating the car. When Mary nodded, the woman said: “Happens to all of us. Get in. We’ll find it.” Mary has a handicapped tag, but doesn’t always use it. She didn’t think she had this time, but it turned out she was wrong. After a few circuits around the parking lot, she spotted it — in a handicapped space. The young lady let Mary out and with a wave and a smile, she drove off to her own parking challenge. Oh, how I would like to give that gracious young lady a warm hug. She made my day, and I wasn’t even there! Al Bell, Peoria, Arizona You’ll never guess who I had in the front of my taxi A few months ago, I travelled from London to Liverpool for an interview at National Museums Liverpool. After the interview I thought I would visit some of the museums. My train was just before 5pm. And I hadn’t clocked quite how late I had cut it. Unfamiliar with the city, I thought getting a bus would take forever, so I jumped in a cab – with 12 minutes to spare before my very expensive ticketed train was leaving Liverpool Lime Street. Little did I know that some cabs in Liverpool don’t take cards. I had no cash on me. When the taxi driver dropped me off, I told him to wait and I would get cash out to give to him. He knew I was running late for the train, and waived the fee. Instead he said: “Don’t forget me if and when you get that job in Liverpool. Us Liverpudlians aren’t so bad.” He was such a kind man. Four months later, I got the job and moved to Liverpool. And I have never forgotten that first taste of Liverpool and its people. I made my train. And got the job. And just wanted to thank the taxi driver. Sahar Beyad, Liverpool The gentle touch My daughter and I were visiting my elderly mother at her nursing home. We went into the lounge where the residents were sitting in a semicircle facing the tv which was on but which nobody was watching. As usual my mother beamed as she saw us draw up two chairs to sit in front of her. Conversation was difficult because my mother had no short-term memory but it didn’t seem to matter. About half way through our visit, the frail looking lady sitting next to my mother began to weep silently. Tears poured down her face and I’m ashamed to say I froze, not knowing what to say or do. My mother, who has dementia, knew exactly what to do. She took hold of her neighbour’s hand and stroked it gently with her thumb all the time looking with great concern into her face until slowly the crying ended. I was deeply moved, upset and worried about the reasons for the distress and put to shame by my mother whose immediate reaction was deeply humane. No words were exchanged between them, there was no need. I left feeling I’d been taught a valuable lesson. Jan Forster, Cardiff Birthday drinks On my 29th birthday (I was in medical school then) I went to a restaurant/bar with some friends for drinks. We had a bottle of wine and some other drinks and when we wanted to pay, the waiter said the wine had already been taken care of. The couple at the table next to ours had overheard us talking about our studies. They said they had once been students themselves without a lot of money and therefore wanted to do a nice thing for us. Oh and happy birthday. It completely made my night. Nina Loretz, Zurich Walk this way I’d buggered my knee and was in a huge brace and on crutches, feeling wretched, miserable, afraid to go out in case I fell over and broke my arm, and in fairly constant pain. One day I was crossing the road at one of those big intersections that has a diagonal crossing. The countdown started and I could tell that I wasn’t going to make it across before the lights changed. A guy crossing at the same time saw me shooting panicked looks at the flashing sign and slowed down to walk at the same speed as me so I wasn’t alone in the middle of a busy intersection when the traffic resumed. Obviously the cars wouldn’t have run me over but it still made me feel much safer to not be the only one in the oncoming traffic. Kate Alley, London Dental health When I was sixteen (in 1965) I ran away from home. I lived on the streets for months and got into a pretty dire state. A girl I knew looked at my decaying teeth and told me: “You must come to see my father.” I was taken to a smart flat in Hampstead and was introduced to Dad, who was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis. Dr Frankel was a dentist with a private practice in Harley Street. He invited me to his surgery and, over several sessions, he gave me sixteen fillings – for free. Dear Dr Frankel, I still have all of my teeth (at seventy). John McAllister, Bristol Train champion Last year my daughter and I were on the train from Carlisle to Manchester. There was a stag party, loud and pretty annoying, and getting cross looks from some passengers. Then along comes an older lady, who couldn’t find her case. She was going from compartment to compartment, desperately searching. One of the lads stands up, puts a hand on her shoulder and says: “Don’t worry love, I’ll help you find it.” The pair of them set about searching. Her station comes, and goes, and still the case isn’t found. She starts to cry. He takes her in his arms, gives her a soft hug and tells her that he’s not leaving her. He’ll stay with her till the case is found and until she’s gets to where she is going, even if it takes all day. She asks him about his plans and says that she can’t ruin his day. He says that it doesn’t matter. He won’t leave her. He tells his mates that he’ll see them tomorrow and then the pair of them go off to find the conductor. Over the next hour or so we watched as the case was found, and the two worked out a plan for how to get her back to her station. The lad had found a double seat in front of us and they spent the rest of their journey having the loveliest chat about her family, his family and the silly things they had both done in their lives. It was the sweetest thing I have ever experienced. And I wished it had been me who had jumped up to help. That lad sacrificed a stag night to help someone who could have been his Nan, and I think everyone in that compartment wished we were him, and we all had a smile on our face and a tear in our eye. Judith Raddatz Wedding belles My husband is English and I’m Indian. In 2018, we decided to have a small register marriage ceremony in England to get a head start on the visa application process. As everything was done on a really short notice, none of my friends could make it to the wedding, so there I was at the hotel getting ready all by myself on the big day, wishing at least one friend was there with me to share my excitement, anticipation, happiness and everything associated with a wedding day. At this point I was interrupted by a knock on the door. I opened the door to a girl from the downstairs bar holding a small bottle of prosecco in one hand and a glass in other. She hugged me, handed me the prosecco and said she was sorry my friends couldn’t make it, but no bride should be getting ready by herself without a little bridal party. I barely knew her, but she made me a little less homesick for my friends and I felt a little less alone. Her kindness and thoughtfulness is one of my fondest memories of my wedding day. Surya Vishnu, Winchester Checkout chum Today an unknown friend came to my rescue in the supermarket when I had put three items through the self-checkout and found I had left my debit card at home. Next in the queue, she stepped forward and put her card on the machine and paid my small bill, saying it was just her good deed for the day. I hope she has had the same warm glow that I have had for the rest of the day! Also that I see her again to repay her random act of kindness! Elise Forbes Dinner lady I had grabbed a coffee and was lingering outside Kings Cross station waiting for a train. Amidst the busy lunchtime throng I spotted a young lady walking towards the station’s entrance with a takeaway bag of food. It was fairly large and I presumed she was doing the lunchtime run for her colleagues. But to my surprise she casually approached a nearby homeless man and gave the bag to him. She said a few words and quietly returned the way she came. A heartwarming moment. Tim Bechervaise, Wiltshire And then she said I’ll give you shelter from the storm Today I was walking to the shops with my ten month old in a sling, when it started absolutely pouring down. I tried huddling under a tree with an umbrella and a waterproof coat around us both, but the rain was too heavy and we were both still getting wet. I looked up and there were people hurrying out of the park. A lady seemed to be headed towards us purposefully, but I didn’t think much of it. As she approached she said “I live just up here – would you like to come in and take shelter from the rain?” She let us wait inside for the rain to pass before we set off again for the shops. This is just one of several random acts of kindness I have been the lucky recipient of since having a baby. It has really restored my faith in humanity in these testing political times. Lizzie Thomson, Sheffield Lost in Amsterdam In the days before we all had mobile phones, I’d been invited to give an address at a conference held at a Dutch university. My contact person there seemed a classic absent-minded professor when it came to travel arrangements and was forgetful about answering emails requesting clarification. The result was that I got off the train from Amsterdam at the station he’d instructed, but it was tiny, apparently out in the middle of nowhere and seemed all but deserted. As I looked around baffled, a Dutch man who’d got off the same train asked if I needed help. I explained I was going to the university and was supposed to take a taxi from the station. He told me I was a long way from the university and there were no taxis, but he’d be happy to drive me. It must have been a 20-minute drive and it was, I ascertained, out of his way. When he dropped me at the university reception, I thanked him profusely and asked if I could pay him, but he just waved me on with a smile. I don’t know what I would have done without him! Anne Marie Karlson Night bus When I was in university in Dublin I was working late one night and ran to get the last bus home. I was the only person left on the bus when the driver shouted back to me asking me where I was going. I said I was going home and told him where I lived, the bus driver then changed his route and dropped me at my door! Miriam Phelan, London Room at the top At our academy, I gave up my office space for an additional student entrance and lobby space at school and was going to move my stuff into a new, unfurnished space over the summer holidays. When I came back after the first week of the holidays, our site manager had moved everything out of my office, hung all of my posters, pictures and display boards and set the new office up better than I ever could have, and even included a USA feature wall to remind me of home. After such a long school year and all the challenges of maintaining our site I was completely knocked out that he would think to do that, take the time and make such a kind effort.

    "date": "2019-08-26",
    "transcript": "The decade has not been kind to Manteigas. Nestled in the mountains in the Portuguese interior, this pretty town has suffered a familiar kind of slow-motion decline. “Once the factories started closing, then the schools closed, the shops closed, even the chapel closed,” says Maria José Santos Salvado, a wizard with needle and thread who was laid off as a textile patcher when her factory shut in 2011. “All the young people left. Manteigas became a town of old people.” It’s a common enough story in southern Europe, where rural decline is a long-term tendency that has accelerated since the financial crisis. But are fortunes about to reverse for people like Salvado? After the surprise intervention of a husband-and-wife team from Lisbon, the looms of her old factory are chugging noisily once again. With orders streaming in from as far afield as Japan, her deft skills are in higher demand than ever. Isabel Costa, formerly a high-flyer in Portugal’s corporate retail sector, and her lawyer husband, João, are among a small but growing number of investors turning their eye to Portugal’s rural interior. It is no easy task. Years of economic decline following the 2008 banking crisis, coupled with harsh government austerity measures, have hit the country’s rural regions especially hard. Between 2014 and 2017, the population of Portugal’s interior declined by 5.6% as birth rates stalled and young people left. Business activity (or lack of it) has followed suit. Although Portugal’s economy is now finally getting back on its feet again (GDP grew by 2.8% in 2018), the vast bulk of this growth is concentrated in Lisbon and a handful of other (mostly coastal) cities. “More and more people are investing in the interior of Portugal … but they need to look at these projects almost as a kind of mission, not as a way of getting rich,” advises Costa. This is true of her own venture, which, despite growing year-on-year, was never designed to be a major money-spinner. Indeed, its origins were more coincidental than commercial. Costa had placed an order with a local manufacturer for burel wool – a historical speciality of Portugal’s mountainous Serra da Estrela region. She quickly discovered that the manufacturer was in a “bad situation” and agreed to buy its working looms and its back catalogue of patterns. She rented a disused factory space owned by the local council, re-hired 15 of the firm’s employees, and restarted operations. With some luck (Microsoft hired her to refit its Lisbon headquarters) and plenty of hard work (she spends half the year travelling to trade shows), Costa’s Burel Mountain Originals brand now employs more than 60 people and supplies two high-end stores in Lisbon and Porto. “We couldn’t just sit back and see this incredible heritage destroyed. I couldn’t sleep knowing about this problem and doing nothing to retain the area’s industrial history and to teach the next generation,” says Costa, who also owns two boutique mountain hotels close to Manteigas. Catarina Vieira is of a similar mind. A former finance manager from the coastal city of Aveiro, she owns a modest six-chalet quinta, or estate, near the town of Seia and is a vocal proponent of Portugal’s nascent eco-tourism market. Chao do Rio is the polar opposite of the vast, package-holiday complexes that now litter the Algarve. The food she serves is all locally sourced, the swimming pool is “biological” (read: unchlorinated and teeming with frogs), and the only loud music you will hear is the sound of birdsong. “The whole idea behind projects like ours is that they are on a small scale and they show concern for the environment and social awareness,” says Vieira. Her vision of a small-scale, culturally-sensitive mode of development is shared by many of those investing in Portugal’s interior. Like Bruno Vargas. A 41-year-old former marketeer, he jacked in his city job five years ago to run a four-hectare farm in Rio Maior, a village located in the Centro region. His venture, Herbas Organic Herbs, specialises in hand-crafted aromatic tea infusions. Business is good. He exports to various European countries and employs seasonal labour from the local area. By his own admission, however, the venture grew out of the “romantic idea” of a more balanced lifestyle as much as turning a profit. “I had the idea that it would be a different kind of life, with more time for my family and less pressures. That’s not turned out to be true, of course. If you have a business, you have pressures, but at least my mind is clearer about why I’m doing this,” he says. Not all embrace this pared-down model of rural development. The Portuguese government provides warm words, for instance, but little in the shape of financial support. Such public investment as exists for rural enterprise development tends to come from the European Union. To get started, for example, Vargas received €40,000 (£37,000) in seed-funding from ProDer – a nationally-managed fund for rural development primarily financed by the EU. Costa and Vieira also received help from the same fund. Even less sympathetic are large-scale investors, for whom big is – as ever – beautiful. Despite being located in an officially designated natural park, for instance, Manteigas is soon to have a huge, luxury hotel constructed in the wooded glacial valley overlooking the town. In a similar vein, international mining firms are now sniffing around. It transpires that Portugal’s central belt is especially “blessed” with reserves of lithium, the alkali metal used in batteries for smartphones and electric cars. “If mega-mining comes to the centre of Portugal, it will spoil everything. We really need to cherish these small projects and put away these crazy dreams of Portugal as the future Arabia,” says Vieira. The economists would disagree, arguing that mega-mining and commercial tourism promise far higher levels of capital investment and job creation. The central government, which campaigners fear is poised to greenlight a lithium mine on the edge of Serra da Estrela, appears to agree. From his holistic yoga retreat near Tábua, in the district of Coimbra, Tony Speirs is watching with anxiety. Originally from north Wales, he set up shop in central Portugal a decade ago. Over that time, he has seen large-scale commercial investment completely alter the once sleepy coastline of the Algarve. He hopes his neighbours will take note and opt for a different route. As he himself readily admits, micro-enterprises like his will not transform Portugal’s rustic interior into dynamos of economic development. But they are helping spark into life pockets of entrepreneurial vitality. For Speirs, that’s enough. His neighbours, he says, are of like mind: “Here, people think once your business is working, why grow it?” Why, indeed?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/fashion-g7-summit-sustainability-kering-inditex-macron",
    "date": "2019-08-21",
    "transcript": "There have been few fashion statements over the years at G7 summits (dress code: world leader suit, sensible shoes). But this year, G7 leaders will be joined by more than 20 fashion retailers and brands, including the owner of Gucci, Kering, H&amp;M and Zara’s parent company, Inditex, for a key fashion moment – a global pact to fight the climate crisis and protect biodiversity and the oceans. The deal to be concluded in Biarritz at the weekend comes as the global fashion industry faces an unprecedented backlash from young people concerned that it is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. Without action, the industry could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050. The issue is soaring up the agenda, with models on the catwalk at London fashion week next month set on a collision course with campaigners from Extinction Rebellion who want the event scrapped in the face of the climate emergency. Growing numbers of young people are turning away from fast fashion towards reuse and resale sites such as Depop in the UK, Thredup and The RealReal in the US and YCloset in China. The secondhand market is expected to overtake fast fashion in the next few years and be 50% bigger than it by 2028, according to a report by market analysts GlobalData for Thredup. The surge in environmental concern is forcing brands to accelerate sustainability plans and club together to bring about change not only in stores but with the factories and suppliers they share around the world. Last month Inditex, the world’s third-largest apparel company, announced that all of its collections would be made from 100% sustainable fabrics before 2025, the first international high street store to make such a commitment. It is switching to renewable energy and pledging to send zero waste to landfill by 2025. The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee investigation into sustainable fashion has also prompted action, despite the government rejecting a recommendation of a 1p per garment tax to fund better textile recycling schemes. The committee’s report published in February named and shamed brands such as Boohoo, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx, which had been slow to take action: failing to use sustainable cotton, collect used clothing or sign up to the government-backed sustainable clothing action plan (Scap). Scap, whose nine large retail signatories including Next, M&amp;S, Primark and Asos have committed to reducing their water use, carbon footprint and waste sent to landfill by 15% by 2020, said it had seen a notable increase in inquiries about joining up. With the spotlight shining on the fashion industry, Primark, one of the flag-bearers for the kind of one-use fast fashion so heavily criticised by environmental activists, is experimenting with clothing recycling bins at its new store in Birmingham and has pledged to introduce a full scheme this year. It has also launched sustainable cotton jeans and eco-friendly glitter. Giorgina Waltier, sustainability manager for H&amp;M in the UK and Ireland, said: “There has definitely been a significant change in people’s attitudes towards sustainability and fashion in the last 12 to 18 months, with a real sense of urgency around these issues and a definite demand from consumers for more action and greater transparency from brands.” H&amp;M, the Swedish group that also owns the Cos, &amp; Other Stories, Monki and Weekday brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, up from 57% now. It is also testing out a free mending service. Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering (whose boss François-Henri Pinault, was asked by French president, Emmanuel Macron to help pull together the G7 fashion-industry deal) said the international fashion pact would enable global retailers to share best practice and ideas and combine their buying power to push for change right back to the agricultural practices involved in supplying raw materials. “Many companies have taken the initiative but if they do things on their own it has less impact on the ground than if they work together,” said Daveu. She said the group could combine efforts to find solutions to problems such as effective recycling of textiles and fibres for garments that can’t be worn again. “More and more customers and clients, generation Z and millennials, are expecting brands to act,” she said. “Listed companies also find more and more investors and financial analysts are taking factors like climate change into account on risk management. Chief executives and designers are also citizens of the world and very conscious that they have an important role to play in one of the most important issues of our century.” “It’s not an option, it’s now a duty of running a global company.” But there are fears that the G7 pact will only add complexity and confusion: there are already many groups involved in sustainability, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Global Fashion Agenda and Common Objective, a private enterprise that recently took over the former Ethical Fashion Forum, which was run as a charity. Several retail and sustainable fashion experts told the Guardian they were concerned that the array of standards and global groups which brands and their suppliers were now expected to sign up to could divert resources from actual action. “It’s great what Macron is doing,” said one big retailer who has held back from signing up to the G7 pact, referring to the fact that it was the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who asked Kering’s boss, François-Henri Pinault, to help pull together the G7 fashion industry deal. “But our responsibility is not to just sign something and the job is done. It is fine to say stuff but actually doing stuff is what’s important. Resources can be consumed by meetings. Let’s keep the balance on delivering.” David Moon, of Scap,said global initiatives served to get big company bosses focused on environmental issues but he said “national action like Scap can really drive change. We can [muster] capital investment and ensure people are measuring and managing change.” The UK government has backed an extension to Scap when it winds up next year and the new deal is expected to involve more retailers and to take steps towards developing industry-wide systems to recycle and reuse textiles and fibres. Most big retailers now agree they have to adapt to survive. Waltier said: “Our planet doesn’t have the resources available to facilitate the linear production model that the vast majority of the fashion industry operates and therefore systemic change is the only option.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/19/dutch-take-cycling-to-a-new-level-with-worlds-biggest-bike-park",
    "date": "2019-08-19",
    "transcript": "In a nation with more bikes than people, finding a space to park can be a problem. The Dutch city of Utrecht is unveiling an answer at its railway station on Monday morning: the world’s largest multistorey parking area for bicycles. The concrete-and-glass structure holds three floors of gleaming double-decker racks with space for 12,500 bikes, from cargo bikes that hold a family to public transport bikes for rent. It is part of a strategy in which hundreds of millions of euros are being devoted to enhancing cycling infrastructure across the Netherlands, a nation so fervent about its two-wheelers that it is applying to add cycling to its inventory of intangible heritage. “We are striving to make it a cyclists’ paradise and there’s still much to be done,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, a junior infrastructure minister. “I’d like us to make better use of what I call this secret weapon against congestion, poor air quality in cities and climate change that is also good for your health and your wallet.” She added: “If you want to get people out of their cars and into public transport, you need to make sure using public transport is easy and comfortable. It needs to be very easy to park your bike as close to the train as possible – and you don’t want to be looking for half an hour for a space.” According to the Dutch Statistics Office, 60% of all trips to work in the Netherlands are made by car and just a quarter by cycling – although in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, (known as the Randstad region) cycling is more common. Demand for public transport is growing, the main four cities are predicted to expand, and the Netherlands has been struggling to meet its climate crisis commitments, so encouraging more bike use is a political priority. “In the next 10 years, 500,000 more people will come to urbanised areas, and if all of those people bring their car then we are going to have massive congestion,” said Van Veldhoven. “So investment in public transport, cycling lanes and cycle parking facilities is crucial to keep this area that’s essential for our national economy moving.” The national railway service NS is investing tens of millions in bike parking, according to its spokesman, Geert Koolen. “We have over 1 million train passengers a day and in our bigger cities – like Utrecht – more than half arrive at the station by bike,” he said. “At Dutch stations there are some 490,000 parking spaces for bikes and we expect 5 million bicycle rides on OV-fiets [shared public transport bikes] in 2020.” Utrecht is promoting cycling as part of a “healthy urban living” policy. “We are counting on biking as a healthy and sustainable form of transport for a growing city,” said the deputy mayor, Victor Everhardt. “Cycling is in the genes of people from Utrecht and in 1885 it built the Netherlands’ first bike lane. Every day, 125,000 cyclists go through the city centre to work, school and the station, and the world’s largest bike park sits perfectly in this global cycling city.” The scale of Dutch investments shows cycling is about more than just the issue of transportation, according to BYCS, a social enterprise behind a network of international cycle mayors. “The bike park in Utrecht shows you need massive investments into cycling infrastructure parking, cycle lanes and great architecture, but we believe this is one of the most impactful things a city can do,” said its strategy director, Adam Stones. “If you look at it as transformation – how it addresses mental and physical health, brings communities together and addresses resource use and the environment – you put more weight behind it.” But some experts sound a note of caution. Although the Fietsersbond, a Dutch cycling organisation, warmly welcomes the investment, it warns that it is irritating and counterproductive when bike parks are combined with a no-tolerance policy to on-street parking – as in central Amsterdam, where “wild” parked bikes are confiscated. “I am not a fan of this,” said its director, Saskia Kluit. “There’s a grey area growing where the government wants a clean appearance and wants to get rid of the bikes, but parked bikes give the street liveliness and movement, and if you want the benefit of the cyclist shopping, it’s better they can stop everywhere they want.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "date": "2019-08-14",
    "transcript": "In an office made from a jigsaw puzzle of reclaimed windows, a single-use fork is being fed into a transparent cube. A hand crank is turned on the side of the cube and the fork is being shredded, ready to be melted down into a filament that can be 3D-printed into a brand new product, in this case a ring with a heart. “Plastic is a wonderful material,” muses Casper van der Meer. “Our message isn’t that we’re against plastics, we just have to use it better and to recycle it.” Van der Meer is the co-founder of Better Future Factory, one of 30 businesses set up in a vast derelict swimming pool complex on the banks of the river Maas in Rotterdam. Besides designers and engineers, there are bio-scientists, growers, caterers, brewers, architects, carpenters, storytellers. Oh, and hundreds of worms. The idea is to create one ecosystem that shares resources and reuses waste in a trial “circular economy”. They call it BlueCity. With environmental threats multiplying almost as fast as the waste in landfill, “circular economy” has emerged as a buzzword – the promise of a system that circulates products for as long as possible and promotes a more sustainable use of raw materials. The world generates 2bn tonnes of solid waste annually – enough to fill 250m builder’s skips. If these were placed end to end, they would go around the world more than 23 times. In the UK, 12m tonnes of municipal waste went to landfill in 2016, of which half was biodegradable. Globally, tens of millions of tonnes of plastic are discarded every year – but less than 10% is recycled. A 2050 circular strategy has been in place in the Netherlands since 2016, with a nationwide objective to halve primary raw material usage by 2030. Rotterdam is trying to position itself as a leader in the circular economy movement. As an emissions hotspot and a significant consumer of raw materials (because of the port of Rotterdam) it has an urgent need to deliver on the rhetoric. In March this year the municipality of Rotterdam announced a four-year pilot, pointing to innovations such as BlueCity as crucial to the programme. “Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for a large proportion of the city’s economy and employment,” explains Marijke Visser from Rotterdam Circular, a government initiative. “This makes them important for changes in business behaviour and processes, but also for behavioural change.” BlueCity is an impressive asset to point to, not just because of the startups but because of the building itself. Thirty years ago it was a Center Parcs resort, a giant glasshouse called Tropicana with flumes and jacuzzis, saunas and spas, shops and restaurants. By 2012 it had fallen into disuse – but to Siemen Cox, the hulking superstructure looked like a giant greenhouse. Cox was looking for a site for his innovative enterprise growing mushrooms from coffee grounds. A plan was hatched to house circular economy startups in the old spa changing rooms beneath the dome. Cox is a zealot and a charmer, meaning it didn’t take long for him to sell the idea to three other sustainable entrepreneurs in architecture, consultancy and construction, and an investor who bought Tropicana in a public auction for €1.7m in October 2015. From that point on, BlueCity accelerated from a brainstorm hashed out on one of Tropicana’s many windows to an ecosystem of circular entrepreneurs. Everyone was eager to begin. “We saw that the circular economy was an economy of consultancies writing reports and roadmaps. This is why we started doing,” explains Sabine Biesheuvel, one of the original founders. “It’s completely different to what we imagined we’d be doing in the beginning.” The renovation is Biesheuvel’s sticking point. It’s not finished. Tropicana’s former nightclub and events centre have been converted into Rotterdam’s first circular office wing, which opened two years ago with 100 workplaces, conference rooms for hire and a communal kitchen-bar fittingly shaped in a circle. But the water park under the dome, Tropicana’s once noisy epicentre, stands quiet and vacant, its green flumes slowly flaking into gaping pools that have been dry for nearly a decade. There’s more life stirring beneath the dome, however, on the lower level, which is partly finished. Worms compost all of BlueCity’s organic waste here in the concrete bowels of the building, which is also where the production workshops and the BlueCity Lab are located. Down here mangoes are being mashed into leather, recycled plastic is 3D-printed into new products for market and regenerative bio-based concepts, such as mycelium furniture, are being grown and tested. There’s also Vet &amp; Lazy craft brewers, who are developing a pioneering chemical-free rainwater purification system, and the circular caterer Arabella van Aartrijk, who bakes cookies from Vet &amp; Lazy’s spent grain and rescues “ugly” food. Superuse Studios, the sustainable architecture and solutions firm behind Tropicana’s circular redevelopment into BlueCity, is down here too. The fact that all of this is going on in and around a derelict water park attracts curious visitors from around the world, who want to see the waste-as-a-resource theory in action. It gives it the edge over other similar circular innovation hubs in Europe, such as De Ceuvel in Amsterdam, CRCLR in Berlin, SPACE10 in Copenhagen or Sustainable Workspaces in London. It’s the spectacle of BlueCity that helps it to grow and sustain itself as a private enterprise. (It has received less than 10% of its funding from the municipality and some indirect funds from the European commission for programming and projects only.) But the BlueCity spectacle also poses a dilemma for Biesheuvel, whose ultimate intention for the venture is to flip the narrative about waste in order to instigate system-wide change – not to become just another tourist attraction. “We are a raw experience. People come here because of the raw innovation, they want to be inspired and to think differently, but they don’t really want to think differently,” explains Biesheuvel. “It’s hard to tell who is sincere about really changing and who is window dressing.” Nevertheless, BlueCity is making measurable impact through its fast-track circular programmes that link budding entrepreneurs with corporate clients to solve real waste-stream solutions. And through its debate and events programme, the hub is arming the public and businesses with practical steps for change, or simply providing a more positive spin on waste. “Given the focus on the circular economy and the experimental labs they facilitate, BlueCity is very valuable in the Rotterdam innovation ecosystem,” says Visser. “BlueCity is increasingly becoming the hotspot where the circular economy is created. A place where the city is reinvented through experimentation, in a healthy and sustainable way.” But is focusing on individual residuals and micro-innovations for waste making enough of an impact when waste is such a huge problem? And are entrepreneurs really the ones to deliver the system-wide revolution required for the world to go fully circular, or in other words eliminate waste for ever? “It’s not a matter of trying to replace everything we have with something new because that requires a huge amount of consumption and materials,” says Rupert Wyllie, an industrial designer and circular economy advocate in London. “To expect small business to scale up or change the behaviour of others in industry isn’t practical.” You could argue that something so radical can only come from the top down, from government policy and from companies spearheading innovation and investment, which can be a lengthy process. It’s taken the European commission more than three years to deliver the 54 actions stated in its circular economy package, and this is still only the stimulus for change, not change itself. But the BlueCity pioneers aren’t waiting for change to trickle down in order to act. “Consumers need positive alternatives,” says Biesheuvel. “I really believe everyone wants to do something, but it’s really hard to know where to start because the problem is so big. But this is also an opportunity.” • A chart first published with this article contained errors and has been removed This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Out the top of St Agnes, a steep village on Cornwall’s north coast, sits a small utopia. The disused mine stack at Wheal Kitty overlooks a group of warehouses reinventing local industry: there is the HQ of the pioneering marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage, its big green eye logo staring at zero-waste shop Incredible Bulk. Next door to that is Canteen, a community-minded cafe uniting local people over £5 meals and long trestle tables. Often they are ravenous from a surf or beach clean at Trevaunance Cove down the cliff, a hypersaturated blue on this scorcher of a summer’s day. Then there are the offices and flagship store of Finisterre, an outdoor apparel company focused on sustainability and functionality. Tom Kay, who founded the business 15 years ago, meets me in the office breakout area. The place has the sweet, salty tang of surfboard wax, and Kay’s dog, Otis, roams around under employees’ desks. Finisterre’s aim, says Kay, part hippy, part focused businessman, is to connect people with the sea. “We believe that they experience better wellbeing, better health, better spirituality, mental space,” he says. Once a week at Finisterre, staff start an hour late so they can participate in Sea Tuesday – getting wet in whatever way floats their boat, board or body. “Hopefully, there comes with that a guardianship, realising the importance of looking after the sea.” After all, what the sea gives us, we seldom give back. David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II kickstarted a nationwide battle against the single-use plastics clogging the oceans. Surfers have an intimate relationship with the water, but the damage they do goes under-reported. Wetsuits are made of neoprene, a synthetic rubber originally invented to line landfill sites: good for staying warm while surfing in December, less so for the environment. Finisterre estimates 380 tonnes of wetsuit waste ends up dumped every year. Eighteen months ago, Kay decided to do something about it. Wetsuits from Wetsuits is Finisterre’s mission to create the world’s first fully recyclable wetsuit, and to pioneer the means of recycling any old suit. Finisterre already uses a biodegradable rubber in its suits. It makes clothes from Econyl, a recycled nylon made from discarded fishing nets and carpet tiles. Fully recyclable wetsuits are the next step. “We have an outlook to do something about these problems if we can,” says Kay. “We’re very much involved in solving these problems in innovation.” Finisterre hired what Kay believes is the world’s only full-time wetsuit recycler to help the company look for sustainability solutions. Jenny Banks is a graduate of the material futures MA at Central Saint Martins in London. Normally, at the start of such a project, she says, you would spend a year reviewing existing research. “But it’s been so hard to find information,” she says. “We’ve got one or two papers on testing wetsuit properties and construction, and a lot of those testing standards are military standards from the 50s when they started making diving suits.” It is possible that the knowledge is “kept within the walls” of the main suppliers, she says. Or that there has not actually been much wetsuit innovation since the San Diego physicist Hugh Bradner invented them in 1952. “There’s a reason why we still use the materials that we use in nonrecyclable wetsuits today,” says Banks. “They are pretty brilliant.” Conventional wetsuits can contain as many as 15 different materials that are nearly impossible to separate at the end of a suit’s life. Finisterre’s plan was to design a suit made of a limited number of materials to maximise the quality of rubber and other material that could be recovered in the recycling process. So Banks started chopping up standard suits and testing the constituent parts for stress and durability. “Fabrics are great for meaning the foam doesn’t overstretch, but the fabrics make recycling really hard. That was the starting point of the redesign – asking: how do we still make the foam strong, but make it recyclable?” One solution was using a “skin finish” – a texturised biodegradable rubber that prevents water from getting trapped in the fabric and chilling the wearer. But it is controversial, and not for its environmental impact. “Skin finishes were used in the 70s and it’s seen as a very retro thing,” says Banks. “There are a few small brands that still use it as a style point – some people love it and some people hate it. You’re balancing style and sustainability …” But the prototype that Kay shows me at Finisterre’s office looks sharp: the skin finish appears technical in an on-trend way. It is a men’s suit because women’s are harder to cut. He has tested it out in the water and, even designed as a 3mm-thick summer suit, it is a bit warm, and not that easy to get on and off. He has me stick an arm down a sleeve, which is sticky – removing a wetsuit at the best of times can be a pretty undignified battle. Still: “This is the most recyclable suit out there in the world, pretty much,” Kay says proudly. “It’s got no laminate on it, you can take the stitching out and then the theory is that it can be totally recycled.” There is still a lot more testing to go – next, Kay and other testers will wear the suit with temperature sensors for a more precise assessment of the heat situation. This is the “upstream” element of Wetsuits from Wetsuits: the creation of a product that can be recycled. “Downstream is when the product has gone through the hands of the customer and is about to go to landfill,” says Kay. Here is where another, chemical recycling process comes in. Kay discovered UK company ReNew ELP, whose hydrothermal test plant in Australia uses catalytic thermo-hydrolysis to break down any old wetsuits and marine waste from Sydney’s beaches into a bio-crude. When Finisterre put out a call for old suits to send to Australia, it got 100 in two days. Banks admits that this discovery may make Finisterre’s recyclable wetsuit seem redundant. But the more materials go into the bio-crude, the more that need distilling afterwards, which is expensive. “By simplifying the materials within our suit,” she says, “we maximise the amount of good quality, pure material we can recover and reintroduce into our wetsuit manufacturing.” Obviously, these processes also have an environmental impact. “We’re trying to find a partner to do a life-cycle assessment to find out what the balance is between the environmental impact of the recycling and the environmental impact of making them from virgin,” says Banks. By talking about this, Finisterre is giving away the company secrets. But that is the point. Other surf brands “won’t do it because it’s a nice thing to do, or the right thing to do,” says Kay. “But they will do it when you can prove an economic case. The innovation around the future of business growth has to be waste as a resource. If you can prove that you can get the bio-crude out of the plant in Australia, and that’s saving half of the raw material cost at the start, suddenly there’s an economic argument for it. If we as a brand could prove that change is possible, that’s something I’m really excited about, and really gunning for.” Wetsuits from Wetsuits was initially conceived and funded as a two-year programme, which would theoretically end in November, but Banks says it is realistically a five-year plan that needs support from the big guns. “At the end of these two years, it’ll be about presenting the prototype, the information from our wetsuit testers and the lab, and saying, this is totally feasible, let’s do this together. We’re a tiny brand in the whole scheme of the wetsuit industry. The next phase would be about partnership and collaboration, and building up enough momentum from the wetsuit industry to put pressure on the supplier to make that change.” Finisterre is not yet profiting from the programme, and once it hits the market it will have to persuade customers to spend more. Kay notes the growing awareness around the climate emergency, but says he does not think most people will splash out on sustainability. “So that’s the challenge: getting proof of concept, testing this first recycled wetsuit out, and then starting to think about the economic viability.” It has taken longer than Kay and Banks thought it would to get here, but both sound irrepressibly enthused about what is still to come. “We could have waited for one of the bigger wetsuit brands to figure this all out, but we didn’t, which I think is testament to how dedicated we are to our ethos of looking after our environment and bringing about positive change,” says Banks. At any rate: the joy of surfing lies in never tiring of the pursuit of perfection, so their temperaments are well suited to their mission.",

    "transcript": "Journalists do what they do for lots of reasons. Some are natural storytellers, gossips even; others get a kick out of unsettling the mighty. Some simply want to find things out to satisfy their natural curiosity. Most want to think their work has real-world impact, though I must confess that an awful lot of things I have written over the years have passed through this world without touching the sides. Usually it is the investigative types, the diggers and undercover reporters whose revelations lead to the biggest change, a minister toppled, a policy reversed. But not always. One of the many joys of editing the Guardian’s Upside series – optimistic journalism that focuses on solutions, initiatives, innovations, people making a difference – is that it often ripples back out into the world it reported on, inspiring readers to take action, generating change for the better. For me, this is urgently needed in a world where a surfeit of dismal news – a crisis crisis if you like – is demoralising audiences as never before. We surely won’t fix the world if we keep on telling people that everything is rotten, hopeless, unfixable. While we have a duty to inform and educate society on where we are going wrong, we feel it is only proper we should point out where it is going right too. When we do, when we show what is possible, it can have a powerful virtuous effect on the lives of the people we write about. For example, earlier this year, we published the story of a pioneering group of Yazidi women who set up a female-only community in Syria as a safe space from the hideous violence and abuse they had faced at the hands of Isis. Within hours, emails were pouring in from readers asking how they could support the community. We gathered them together in a WhatsApp group and put them in touch with community leaders, so they could figure out how best to send money. One reader, Gill Whittaker, said the aim was “to do something together … Thus a more certain ‘upside’ outcome may be achieved”. Another example: last year we wrote about the Remakery, a cafe in Edinburgh that also fixes your broken appliances while you wait. Almost 100,000 people shared the article on social media. The piece became part of a virtuous circle, with people around the world getting in touch with the owner, Sophie Unwin, asking how they could set up a franchise in their city. “As a result of the piece I had more inquiries from across the UK (Nottingham, Brighton and elsewhere) and also internationally (one group in Montreal, others in the US) and I think a few others in Europe and New Zealand too,” Unwin told us. “Some people directly referenced the Guardian feature and said they found it inspiring. “We’ve received other funding and are in conversation with other potential partners – there is a lot of interest. I would argue that the article also helped raise the wider agenda, as evidenced by news like Ikea’s work on the circular economy. Repair culture is moving more into the mainstream, which has always been one of the aims of this work.” When we wrote about an obscure cleric who drives around Iran’s poorest province bringing books to children, enough people were touched to club together and buy him a new car for his rounds. “This was a particularly cheering and hopeful piece in a climate of nastiness and Brexit tedium,” wrote Paul MacGowan. “I wonder if you could let me know if it’s possible for me to send donations to support his work?” A piece about paint recycling prompted no end of tips (and jokes) from readers. An article about an African environmentalist generated offers of legal support and a UN promise to champion her case. A focus on tree-planting in Niger brought inquiries from farmers in southern Africa. Best practice doesn’t always spread itself. The Upside has sought to deepen this connection between readers and subjects through a weekly newsletter, which attracts a prodigious digital mail bag each week. We continuously encourage our 30,000 subscribers to get in touch with alternatives, ideas and suggestions. When they do, others can be moved to get involved. “One of the pleasures was reading about the Green Ukhiya Star Team in The Upside,” wrote Beverley Colgan recently, referring to a little known Bangladeshi group planting 1m trees in the country’s south-east. “I went to their Facebook page but it had no big, obvious ‘contribute’ button.” We put Beverley in touch with the tree planters. Readers come up with great solutions, too. When we asked what people were doing to cut their carbon, we had hundreds of responses. The innovative things individuals are doing in a dozen countries around the world prompted more readers to write in and commit to flying less, cycling more or eating less meat. When we asked people for their favourite foreign word that is hard to render into English, it threw up many ideas, notions, tendencies and instincts that some cultures have that others could benefit from. (My own favourites: saudade, turangawaewae, philotimo). The media must recognise it shapes the world we live in, as well as reflecting it. Hyperbolic coverage of terrorists and school shooters and people who take their own lives will encourage copycats. Hysterical coverage of populism, recession and mental illness risk turning into self-fulfilling prophecy. But the same is true of optimism. Writing about inspiring characters – environmentalists, health workers, inventors and unsung heroes – will encourage more young people to follow in their footsteps. When we report progress, more progress ensues. What better way to change the world?",

    "transcript": "In a whitewashed studio in northern Denmark, 11 unemployed strangers are embarking on a hearty rendition of Yellow Submarine. Jonas Thrysøe is not one of them. At least, not yet. The 36-year-old has agoraphobia, rarely leaves the house and can’t think of anything worse than a group singalong. And yet by the second chorus he is putty in the choirmaster’s hands. “I swore I’d just stand at the back and listen,” he says. “But the mood was infectious.” Out of work and in his second year of sick leave because of anxiety and panic attacks, Thrysøe had become isolated. “I’d avoid situations where I thought I’d get anxious, until I ended up avoiding all situations. It was a vicious circle,” he says. With a master’s degree in European studies, Thrysøe had dreamed of a career in Brussels or the Danish government. “But things got so bad I couldn’t even leave the house. It was … a kick in the groin,” he says. Then the Kulturvitaminer (culture vitamins) programme came along, offering Thrysøe and other unemployed people in Aalborg with stress, anxiety or depression the chance to go on a crash culture course. Partly funded by the Danish health authority, and administered by the local jobcentre, the municipalities of Aalborg, Silkeborg, Nyborg and Vordingborg set up pilot schemes to encourage cultural participation for those unemployed or on state sick leave. Mikael Odder Nielsen, the Aalborg course leader, says: “We wanted to see if we could make people’s mental health better, reduce social isolation and help them get back into the labour market via culture.” Participants were invited to go on two or three cultural excursions a week for 10 weeks. This appealed to Thrysøe. “It was an activity that would get me out of the house, something that wasn’t a medical appointment, where I was treated as ‘normal’. Because I am not my anxiety, I’m me. And the course helped me feel like ‘me’ again,” he says. Evy Mortenson, 49, was working in a kindergarten in 2013 when work-related stress resulted in unemployment, followed by periods of ill health and chronic insomnia for the next six years. “Before I went down with stress, I would often go to concerts and museums,” she says. “But then I stopped. Nothing made me happy or even made sense any more.” After several temporary contracts but no improvement in her health, Mortenson’s caseworker at the jobcentre enrolled her for Kulturvitaminer. “As soon as I walked into the welcome meeting, I felt a sense of relief. It was a shared experience and there were no expectations, we were just all there together in a judgment-free space,” she says. This was key, because many participants have not taken part in cultural activities for years, if ever, says Nielsen. “If you are depressed, culture is often the first thing you don’t bother with, you’re too preoccupied with getting through the day. My role is to get them used to this world again, or even introduce it for the first time,” he says. So far, 200 people, mostly women in their late 30s or 40s with family commitments, have taken part in the Aalborg programme. “They tell me, ‘I used to do this sort of thing a lot before I had kids.’ I tell them, ‘This sounds depressingly familiar’,” Nielsen says. “But there are men too, because it’s not a space where you have to talk all the time: you’re there to do and experience things.” There are eight strands to Aalborg’s programme, including singing (which is proven to release dopamine and promote a sense of belonging when conducted among a group), visiting the city archive to learn about local history and genealogy, and music appreciation. “We use playlists developed by music therapists to give your brain a break, which in turn allows your body to take a break,” says Nielsen, adding that the music is intended to “reduce arousal” – it is “music that’s predictable, a bit boring, even”. Such as? “Jack Johnson.” There are also visits to the theatre to watch new productions, and coaching sessions in which actors teach participants about body language to help with confidence in job interviews. The programme has an agreement with the Aalborg Symphony Orchestra in which participants are taken to watch rehearsals and performances, something that often leads to tears, says Nielsen. Researchers have found that watching music performed live reduces stress. Participants also visit the local art museum and take part in creative workshops, an activity proven to develop resilience. Participants are also encouraged to snuggle up under blankets in a dimly lit room in an Aalborg library while a librarian reads to them for two hours. Most of the participants will not have had books read to them since childhood, so this can prove an emotional experience. Mortenson says: “I spent so much of my life reading to others, but this time I needed help and I felt taken care of. It was very powerful.” Brain scans show that when people are immersed in a book, they mentally rehearse the activities, sights and sounds of a story, stimulating neural pathways, increasing empathy and improving wellbeing. Participants are encouraged to talk about the books, “but not in a school-type way”, says Thrysøe. Finally, there are guided nature walks, because numerous studies have shown that spending time in nature is good for mental health. Nielsen says: “These are also valuable in terms of seeing how slowly things grow, in contrast to our busy modern lives.” Culture as a cure is not a new idea. In 2008, the then UK health secretary, Alan Johnson, called for the arts to be part of mainstream healthcare, and in 2009, the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommended participation in the arts and developing creativity for the protection of mental health. A decade on, evidence for the impact of the arts on wellbeing is growing. Research shows that “art on prescription” is valued by referrers and participants alike, and is also cost-effective, with a reduction in the number of visits to the doctor and participants gaining transferable skills. But provision in the UK remains patchy. In contrast, Australia has had a national arts and health framework to promote integration of the two since 2013, while Sweden leads the way in Scandinavia in terms of art on prescription. But Denmark is catching up, and the relationship between culture and health is increasingly being identified as an important factor in a sustainable Nordic welfare model. Anita Jensen, a postdoctoral researcher at Aalborg University, says: “We can see that it works for many people. It’s relatively inexpensive, with no known negative side-effects.” The 10-week course costs 12,000 Danish krone (£1,440) per person, while a single session with a psychologist is about 1,000 krone and a week on sick leave costs about 4,000 krone, including benefits and cost to employers. “Because Denmark is a small country, we have a unique opportunity to make a difference by offering arts on prescription as a public health initiative,” says Jensen. Nielsen agrees. “We’re largely funded by the state, but the council can also decide that this is worthwhile and fund it independently from their own budgets when the pilot programme ends in November,” he says. Mortenson says: “I’d like to see the whole world taking their culture vitamins. I’m not the same person as I was when I started this process. I listen to classical music every day now, I meet my culture group for outings, even though our 10-week programme has finished, and I have a support network with new interests. I’ve even applied for a job in an art museum.” Thrysøe has also noticed a shift. He says: “The course altered my outlook – I’ve redefined what success looks like. I went from being very isolated to being ready for the job market and happier, too. It changed my life.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "transcript": "On a quiet street in a low-income Paris suburb, the doctor’s waiting room was so full that patients spilled out on to the pavement. Some from distant housing estates had travelled here as early as 4am to be sure of a place in line. “This doctor is really loved because he takes time to listen to you, he calms you down,” said Yamina Derni, 63, who had been treated for benign tumours. “You don’t even notice his age.” Christian Chenay, who celebrated his 98th birthday last month, is France’s oldest practising doctor. “I couldn’t possibly give up work,” he said in his small consulting room in Chevilly-Larue after treating his final patients of the day, an unwell toddler and a woman suffering from high blood pressure. “How can I stop when there are only three doctors in this area for a population of 19,000?” he added. “I keep going for my patients, particularly for the older ones, who I like to encourage. I love medicine. But I also like to keep active. If you stop working, you go downhill. At my age, if you spend your time watching TV and snoozing, you won’t survive long.” Chenay’s decision to keep working is partly due to France’s shortage of local family doctors. Although the country has a reputation for one of the world’s best healthcare systems, the lack of general practitioners has reached crisis point. The problem is acute in rural areas where millions struggle to access care, but also in some of the low-income Paris banlieues. Half of all general practitioners in France are now aged over 60, and some work beyond retirement in order to keep practices open. Chenay is not alone in continuing into his 90s. Four years ago a 93-year-old doctor, François Le Men, finally retired from his practice in rural Brittany, apologising his heart problems. Chenay began work as a general practitioner in this area of the Val-de-Marne almost 70 years ago. He has outstayed his own son, who also worked as a doctor but who retired at 67. “I’ve seen a lot of change,” Chenay said. “The internet means more people now come in saying ‘I’ve looked it up online, I’ve got such and such illness and need such and such treatment.’ In reality they have no such thing and don’t need that treatment at all.” He said he had been most struck by a rise in domestic violence. “Knife crime against women by their partners seems to me to have got much more prevalent in the last couple of years,” he said. “Men assume they can get away with it.” Chenay, who says he wakes at 6.30am every day, sees patients on Mondays and Wednesdays and cares for members of a religious retirement home one afternoon a week. But he said the heavy administrative load of the French health system, as well as his continuing study of latest research, meant he worked around 60 hours a week. He’s the only doctor in the area who accepts patients without appointments. A sheet of paper and a pencil are fixed to the wall in the waiting room where people write their name on a first-come-first-served basis. Chenay believes that a large part of general practice work is looking beyond initial ailments and helping patients with underlying mental health issues. He said the low-income Paris suburbs were a “forgotten place” where unemployment affected mental health and undocumented migrants often survived on little. Chenay was born in 1921 in the western town of Angers and worked part-time as a welder to get through medical school. He walks with a cane due to a leg injury sustained while jumping from a train to escape forced labour during the Nazi occupation of France in the second world war. “The leg only really bothered me when I reached 80,” he said. He doesn’t wear glasses and he said his sight was excellent after a cataract operation. “My hearing is also good, certainly better than the 18-year-olds who wear earphones with the volume up,” he added. Sarah Lahrouchi, 31, who has been a patient of Chenay’s since she was born, said: “He’s got an amazing memory and he takes time to investigate the why and how of what’s wrong.” In recent years he had supported her when she lost her premature baby son following a car crash during pregnancy. She said he had treated four generations of her family: her late grandmother, her parents, her siblings, and now her own children aged between three months and six years. Another patient, Leonor, 61, said: “He helped me after I had two miscarriages at a time when there was not much support for that.” Life at the surgery has not always been easy. Chenay’s late wife, Marthe, was repeatedly stabbed in an attack outside his consulting room several years ago. She survived but later succumbed to Alzheimer’s. He and his current wife, Suzanne, whom he married at 91, have installed security cameras. Chenay said he had been lucky enough to know six patients aged over 100. One woman who reached 106 had survived her family being deported during the Nazi occupation, and had lived alone for 25 years but kept “in good spirits”, still going out with a walking frame in her final years. Asked for advice on living to a healthy old age, Chenay said: “I never smoked, drank or took drugs. So I’d say avoid those three things. Never stop, keep active. The key is learning to deal with stress. You can’t avoid stress – the organism needs it to develop defence mechanisms – but you can learn how to manage it. Make it a routine: whenever you have some down time, even five minutes, ensure you sit back for a moment and really relax.” He said he didn’t fear for his own health. “There’s no reason to stress at my age because I’ve got a one in five chance of not waking up in the morning,” he shrugged.

    "transcript": "The other day I saw a marvellous thing. A dad and his young son were running for a bus that had already left. Resigned, they slowed to a despondent limp. Then, unexpectedly, improbably, the bus also slowed to a stop, the doors flew open and the driver beckoned them aboard. In that moment, he made four people happy: the father, the son, me, and I suspect himself. The world is full of small moments of kindness like this. As we head off into a summer recess, we’d love Upside readers to flood our inbox (theupside@theguardian.com) with their own examples. Subject line: human-kind (geddit?) But first, let us send you on your way with our best Upside stories of the week. No overriding theme, just some summer joy. 1. Britain’s very first “climate assembly” – 56 ordinary Londoners take on an extraordinary problem. Three-minute read 2. The EU (remember them?) launched a drive to protect forests (remember them?) from being destroyed by chocolate and other intensive crops. Two-minute read 3. Can music help to forge a young nation? Two-and-a-half-minute read 4. Five new uses for bacteria. One-minute read Lucky numbers Consumption of plant-based burgers is up 10% year on year. People who adhere to plant-based diets are much less likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Low-carbon energy was used to generate more than half of the electricity used in the UK for the first time last year. And in Germany, renewable energy comprised almost 50% of grid electricity in the first six months of 2019. And some blue-sky thinking: if only refugees (particularly women) were allowed to work they would increase global GDP by hundreds of billions of dollars. What we liked The US depression treatment, borrowed from … Zimbabwe, courtesy Tina Rosenberg at the New York Times. And a timely piece from Positive News about a supercrop for our environmentally challenged times. Finally, CNN’s story about what happened when only one person RSVPd to an autistic boy’s birthday party invitation. What we heard A great initiative from Daisy Jacobs: I hugely admire the work of the Upside in profiling inspiring and innovative solutions to some of the world’s most pressing issues. Our social enterprise, Routes, matches women from businesses across London with refugee and asylum-seeking women for four months of mentoring. Mentors help their mentees to get back into work, find volunteering, apply to university or develop new skills, all whilst working on their own communication and leadership techniques. Some advice from Phillip Hunt. Do let us know if you agree: Please display better the articles you are inviting the reader to follow. As a newsletter page the highlighting of the articles have to be read top, bottom, left, right and centre. I personally find the style of presentation distracting in spite of my having signed up, in having looked forward to your title in my inbox. It may just be that this bugbear is mine alone. If so, ignore my discomfort. And something pithy from Bill Thompson: What to cover? Complexity And interesting to see our friends at the Daily Telegraph launching their own good news newsletter, the Bright Side. Where was the Upside? At silly competitions like the World Thumb Wrestling Championships, the Fortnite World Cup, and the Splashdiving World Championships, all taking place this weekend. Also, outdoors, in the warm weather. Who doesn’t love a heatwave? The Upside newsletter is taking a short summer break. Back soon. Do keep the ideas coming to theupside@theguardian.com.

    "date": "2019-07-26",
    "transcript": "In the UK it is almost obligatory for a culture minister never to have attended an opera. In Latvia, a small country that takes these things very seriously, the newly installed culture minister hasn’t just seen plenty of operas, he’s starred in them. Nauris Puntulis a tenor who also had a successful pop career in his 20s, but is now the craggy, grey-haired minister-from-central-casting in the country’s centre-right coalition government. Latvia is proud of its musical traditions. Like Finland on the other side of the Baltic Sea, it produces a remarkable number of leading conductors and classical musicians for so small a country. This summer it is launching an annual music festival at the capital’s seaside resort, Jūrmala, designed to be more than just a moment of high culture but something of a rallying point for a country with a delicate historical and geo-political backdrop. “When we founded our state [after the first world war], culture was a central element,” says Puntulis, “more important in a way than political structures. The only way for us to exist was to nurture our culture.” Latvia and the other Baltic states had spent centuries as playthings of empires – Swedish, Polish, German and Russian. All it had to sustain itself was its language and a Lutheran choral tradition that remains vibrant and culminates every five years in a huge song and dance festival in Riga at which the combined choir numbered 17,000. The Latvian state lasted only 20 years before the country was occupied successively by the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union once again after the second world war. Latvia has only been independent again since 1991. “It was our folk art culture that kept us alive under the Soviet occupation,” says Puntulis. There was, though, one beneficial byproduct of that almost 50-year Soviet occupation – the network of free music schools that have helped a country of just 2 million people to produce a battery of international classical music stars: conductors Mariss Jansons and Andris Nelsons; opera singers Elīna Garanča and Kristine Opolais; violinists Gidon Kremer and Baiba Skride; and cellist Mischa Maisky. Grafting Soviet pedagogy on to Latvia’s choral tradition has produced a potent musical mix. In the UK, music education now relies on parents stumping up for private lessons. But Latvia has a network of 120 music schools, not just in the cities but in the countryside too, and one in 12 children attend them, usually between 3pm and 6pm after their general schooling is over. “The accessibility of the music schools is the pride of our nation,” says Puntulis. “A third of the culture budget goes into education.” Critics argue that it is too expensive and that the system should prioritise excellence over mass participation, but Puntulis is unconvinced. “We’re educating listeners as well as performers.” The new festival hopes to tap into that audience – in Latvia opera and classical concert prices tend to be lower than in the west and audiences younger – as well as attract music lovers from other countries. “The aim is to put Latvia on the map,” says the festival’s director Zane Čulkstēna, who also founded and still runs the contemporary art centre in Riga. “We want to get across the message that music has a special place here, and we are not from forests where we spend all our time picking mushrooms”, although mushrooms are indeed a national obsession in heavily forested Latvia. The festival is largely privately funded by a group of business people based in Latvia or who are part of the large Latvian diaspora that resulted from the tragedies of the 20th century. The chairman of the trustees is Petr Aven, a Russian businessman whose father was half-Latvian. Aven is worth an estimated $5.2bn so he can afford the logistical and financial burden of bringing four internationally renowned symphony orchestras and an array of soloists to Riga and Jūrmala on four weekends in July and August. But in future years, when the festival hopes to add extra weekends, he is looking for greater state support. “We are doing this for Latvia,” he tells me during the interval of the second of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra’s two concerts at Riga’s opera house. “Latvia is potentially a great country. It lost a lot of people during the second world war and in Soviet times, but it has a great environment and a great musical culture. We wanted to do something to distinguish Latvia from the rest of the world, but at some stage we hope the Latvian state will come in. If you want it to be sustainable, you need the state to participate.” Aven, eager to get back to the second half of the concert, is coy when I ask him why music matters so much to Latvians. “Why do they play football in Brazil? Why in France are there so many painters?” he says. But the new president, Egils Levits, a judge at the European Court of Justice, who attends the festival’s gala opening, is happy to spell out its central role. Culture, he explains, was central to the survival of Latvian identity during the occupation and is just as important now in a digital age that threatens to atomise the population. “The choral movement has a big social role,” he says, “especially in the countryside, with people coming together over a period of years to prepare for the song festival.” The fact that the anti-Soviet movement of 1987-91 that led to the independence of Latvia and the other Baltic states was called the Singing Revolution underlines the social and political importance of the choir tradition. Like many politicians across Europe, Levits is worried about globalisation. He says the decline of solidarity and a shared identity – complicated in Latvia by the presence of both Latvian- and Russian-speaking populations – feeds alienation and social breakdown. Keeping musical and cultural traditions alive, making sure, as Puntulis says, that the concert hall is not entirely supplanted by the shopping mall, is accorded a significance unthinkable in the west. “In America, culture is something for the elite,” says Levits. “In Latvia it’s for everyone.” He realises that an emphasis on protecting the nation’s traditions can become nativist if taken too far, but says he is determined to guard against that. “It is possible to be introverted, to reflect about ourselves, but at the same time to be open to the world,” he insists. The ambition is to strike a balance between modernity and tradition, cutting-edge digital technology and vast choirs in national costume, though the number of audience members using their state-of-the-art mobile phones during concerts at the festival’s opening weekend suggests some misunderstand the nature of that balance. The determination to sustain the country’s musical life is not, however, just about the search for social solidarity. Levits, who hopes that in future years the government will be able to forge a partnership with the festival’s private backers, sees it as a statement of what the still young state of Latvia, a member of the EU since 2004 and now firmly western facing, can achieve. “In culture there are no [automatic] small countries and big countries,” he says. “In music Latvia is a big country.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "The EU has taken a “pivotal step” towards addressing the deforestation caused by its consumption of soy, chocolate, meat and other products, environmental campaigners have said. The EU said this week it had set out a new plan to protect and restore the world’s forests, which involves working with governments to promote better use of land and resources, managing supply chains, and carrying out research. A possible new regulation to “minimise the impact of EU consumption on deforestation and forest degradation” will also be assessed under the plan. The EU accounts for as much as 36% of all global imports of crop and livestock products associated with deforestation, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature. However, it is actions rather than words that will determine how serious it is about tackling its impact on forests, said a spokeswoman for Fern, an organisation that works to protect forests and the people depending on them. “We desperately need new laws that require companies to demonstrate that goods they put on the EU market are not tainted with deforestation or human rights abuses,” Hannah Mowat told Ursula von der Leyen, the new EU commission president. Frans Timmermans, her deputy, said: “We will not meet our climate targets without protecting the world’s forests. The EU does not host the world’s major primary forests on its territory, but our actions as individuals and our policy choices have a major impact.” About 80% of forest loss worldwide happens because trees are cut down to make way for agriculture or pasture. Deforestation in Ghana increased by 60% last year, mostly driven by cocoa production. Europe is home to the world’s biggest chocolate consumers, led by Britain, Switzerland and Germany, where people eat more than 8kg of chocolate a year on average. “Addressing deforestation is not possible without addressing the EU’s demand for the goods which drive it. But it also requires getting to the root cause of forest loss in forested countries,” said Obed Owusu-Addai, a campaigner at EcoCare, a Ghanaian organisation working on community rights and forests. “As it did in fighting illegal timber, the EU must use its market leverage to start discussions in producer countries about forest governance and concession allocation.” In 2017, a Guardian investigation showed that the chocolate industry was driving deforestation in Ivory Coast, with “dirty” beans from deforested national parks tainting big companies’ supply chains. Later, the cocoa industry pledged to stop deforestation in west Africa and eliminate these dirty beans, but environmental campaigners have said they are failing to meet this promise, and are still responsible for the deforestation of tens of thousands of hectares of land in what used to be countries covered in rainforest.",

    "date": "2019-07-21",
    "transcript": "Britain’s first climate assembly has agreed on 17 proposals for action to tackle the climate crisis, including installing solar panels on all available roofs and cutting fossil fuels out of local government developments. The assembly, convened by Camden council in north London, brought together more than 50 residents and a team of climate experts to develop proposals that could be taken up by the council to reduce carbon emissions and increase sustainability. The proposals focused on housing, transport and green space, and included a community energy scheme to remove fossil fuels from home heating, widespread cycle lanes and car-free zones, and programmes to ensure that all new homes in Camden are built carbon-neutral. The group also recommended that community input on the crisis become permanent, calling for a climate emergency group made up of experts and residents to be set up to oversee the shift to eco-friendly initiatives. Suggestions came from across the community, with local businesses and institutions such as the Roundhouse, British Museum and University College Hospital collaborating to address Camden’s carbon footprint. Residents, workers and commuters contributed more than 600 ideas through an online platform. Tim Hughes, the director of Involve, a public participation charity that facilitated the event, said demand for citizens assemblies had surged in the past year. “They’re really good processes for dealing with conflict and contested opinions on issues, and really help to bridge some of the divides we’re seeing in democracy and politics at the moment,” he said. Last month the House of Commons announced plans to hold its own climate assembly to inform government policymaking. A representative from the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, Chris Shaw, attended the Camden event to learn about the process and its potential for Westminster. Farhana Yamin, who as a board member of Greenpeace UK and a Camden resident was observing proceedings, said: “Many of the problems that we’ve had on the climate and issues such as Brexit are because decision-making has been too remote and citizens haven’t had enough of a say. “It’s ironic that the theme of Brexit was ‘take back control’ but actually this is what taking back control really looks like in practice – it’s citizens being given the information and being asked to decide.” Members of the assembly were broadly positive about the process. Anna Pick, 23, a researcher, said: “The process of engaging people with the council, making people feel that they’re a bit more empowered at the community level, making people get together and talk to each other, I think those are all really powerful things.I feel much more optimistic about Camden council’s power to do things and my ability to shape what they do.” Climate Emergency Camden, a group of residents, called on the council to take meaningful action on the proposals, warning that some residents were cynical about the impact of the process. Their concern was echoed by many members of the assembly. “There will be a lot of very good ideas suggested by people, but the crucial thing is that these ideas will be acted upon rather than be forgotten. It’s very important that they’re followed up and put into practice,” said Hamid Reza Aghaei, an Iranian refugee living in Camden. The council leader, Georgia Gould, emphasised her commitment to doing so. “We declared a climate emergency and that can’t just be a statement or a piece of paper, it has to be real action,” she said.",

    "date": "2019-07-20",
    "transcript": "Britain’s first climate “citizens assembly” opened its final session on Saturday morning at which more than 50 Londoners will decide on carbon-cutting measures they want their district to enact in order to confront climate change. Camden’s Citizens Assembly, convened to interrogate what locals, neighbourhoods and the council can do for the environment, is deliberating action that would reduce fossil fuel usage in homes and public buildings and on roads. The wishlist will be considered by the council as it draws up an environment action plan for 2020. The outcome of the assembly will be closely watched by other councils planning to follow suit this year, and by Westminster which will hold its own national climate assembly in the autumn. Council officials say there is a clear intention to implement at least some of the recommendations. “I hope there will be some concrete action that we can take forward as a council,” said Georgia Gould, the council leader. “That’s the idea of it being an open process – you are letting go of that control. Our climate is in a crisis and we need to act in radical new ways and this assembly is part of developing those new ideas.” Ideas being considered include community energy projects such as solar panels on schools, GP surgeries and public buildings, a revolution in heating buildings that favours air source heat pumps over old-style gas boilers, better insulation and urban greening. Anti-car measures are also being considered, though motorists produce only 13% of emissions in the district, with the rest generated by energy use in buildings. “I’m keen that they should ban all cars. They should ban all gas boilers in newbuilds now. They should retrofit old buildings,” said Rupert Cruise, one of the participants. But the assembly is diverse in age, ethnicity and outlook. Another juror, Neil Chappell, said: “I’m here to defend the motorist. Camden always hammers the motorist but only 10% of emissions is down to cars.” By the end of Saturday’s deliberations, participants will have spent 12 hours in three separate sessions listening to briefings, asking questions, debating with each other and coming up with solutions. They were recruited randomly via a street and door-knocking campaign. A shortlist was winnowed down to assure the final composition was demographically (but not necessarily politically) representative. The participants are being paid £150 in vouchers for their time. Some participants said that although they were keen to do something, they felt the real scope for action lay with the national government. After all, aircraft do not take off in Camden, there are no large power plants, and container ships do not pass through. “Most people are informed and there is consensus, but people feel that individuals can’t do much,” said Khalil Miah. “It’s up to national government to set the goalposts and the deadlines.” Others said the process itself was a breath of fresh air, helping to address not just the crisis in the environment but the crisis in democracy too. “It is absolutely great,” said Merve Öner, a student on the assembly. “It’s a diverse community and it’s delightful to involve them all. I think it should be implemented in lots of other countries.”",

    "date": "2019-07-19",
    "transcript": "In an airless library in north London, 56 people are trying to help fix not one global crisis but two. There are students and builders, a civil servant, an entrepreneur, a restaurateur, a support worker. There are immigrants and retirees and even a retired immigrant. This is Britain’s first climate assembly, a randomly selected panel of local people convened by the London borough of Camden to consider what can be done to confront the climate emergency. The jurors have been assembled to listen to briefings, pose questions, assess facts, debate and discuss, and then ultimately recommend action to Camden council. The big question before them is what action the district can take to limit global heating and its impact. The hope is that the series of deliberations this summer will have a bearing not just on the climate crisis but on the crisis in democracy too. A national climate assembly is planned for Westminster this autumn and Camden is being closely watched for the dos and don’ts of this relatively new form of public engagement. “I am interested in the idea of citizens assemblies and not just for climate change,” said the local MP Keir Starmer, a Labour frontbencher. “I think they might turn out to be a way to have a different kind of political dialogue to avoid the shouty tribalism of the last few years.” Things take a while to get going. The opening session, something of a factfinding exercise, is held on a muggy summer night in the semi-basement rotunda of Swiss Cottage public library. The room swelters, as if to make a point. A woman wafts a fan. Facilitators urge brevity, inquiry, civility. One helpful juror draws a smiley face on a paper cup to keep a restless child amused. Climate experts such as Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, set out the indisputable science of the climate emergency. Participants have yellow and red cards to slow him down or stop him if they get lost. (“It’s the first time I’ve ever been red-carded during a presentation,” he says later.) Not everyone finds it easy. One young woman is on the verge of walking out because progress is slow. For others it’s all a bit fast. And one juror, Neil Chappell, who works in construction, wonders who chose the experts and how they chose the facts. “The people they had talking were good at getting their agenda over but didn’t give us enough information to make informed decisions,” he said. A gulf in knowledge between jurors is exposed when they are invited to pose questions. One wondered: “How many people in Camden die from air pollution each year?”. Another asked: “Can wind farms change the direction of the wind?” But council officials are enthusiastic about the process and adamant they will act on its recommendations in a new environmental plan to be drawn up for 2020. Georgia Gould, the council leader, said she hoped the outcome would be “some concrete action that we can take forward as a council. That’s the idea of it being an open process – you are letting go of that control. There has been a complete breakdown in trust in our political system, we need to create new democratic mechanisms to break through that and this is it.” What is to be done? After an initial fact-finding phase, the 56 panellists get into the nitty-gritty. What is to be done? What works? A pair of local trailblazers talk through their own personal carbon “hygiene” measures: an electric car for their horticultural business; rail travel for holidays; meat as a treat, not a staple; double glazing, solar panels, and – perhaps less convincingly – “warm” wallpaper. They even approach idling cars on the street and tell drivers to switch off their engines. “Most people respond politely,” Stephen Evans tells the audience. Campaigners and experts lay out the pros and cons of certain measures. Refitting all Camden’s buildings with greener heating such as air source heat pumps and insulation would cost at least £1.3bn. Is that a bargain or a burden? Who would pay? What about pedestrianising streets, a zero-emissions motoring zone, greening driveways, grasscrete – would that make enough of a difference? And is there any space to plant more trees? (Answer: not really.) “I think it’s very interesting but I’ve been wondering quite a bit about where it’s going to lead,” said Chris Dunham, the director of Carbon Descent, an eco-consultancy, who spoke as an expert at the sessions. “My concerns are that in the age of austerity it’s a real challenge for councils which don’t have the money or power to do the things that are needed to complete the piece.” Panel action Citizens’ assemblies have been rising to prominence since an Irish experiment in 2016 to convene randomly selected laypeople to thrash out the abortion issue broke the deadlock and paved the way for a national referendum in 2018. Camden has debated social care and its 2025 borough plan. Its climate assembly will be followed by similar exercises in Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Lambeth, Devon and Hertfordshire this autumn, and a national climate assembly is also scheduled to take place. Scotland will debate its future in a citizens assembly. “In the last six months the interest in the idea has risen exponentially,” said Tim Hughes, who helped to facilitate the Camden exercise. As the director of Involve, a public participation charity, Hughes has worked on a range of assemblies. What makes them work well? “You want a good range of expertise, time and space for assembly members to reflect and reach recommendations,” he said. “You are not looking for complete consensus because that could be false consensus. You also want a good sense of where people disagree.” Debate at the six tables in the library rotunda produces plenty of disagreement but participants say it is good-natured. Rupert Cruise, who is originally from Johannesburg and has lived in Camden since 2001, said: “I think it’s fantastic. The only surprise we’ve had is that there are no climate change deniers. There are differing views on where we should focus but it’s done in a respectful tone.” Some have suggested participation in such assemblies could be made mandatory in the same way that jury service is. Simon Burall, an expert in public participation who also helped to facilitate the Camden assembly, said that may be some way off. “There is significant distrust in government already, and if you force people to be here and don’t listen to them you will alienate them even further,” he said. “If you tell them they have to come to learn how to be better citizens, they’ll feel patronised.” Still, the scope for more citizens assemblies on divisive issues seems broad enough. Indeed, a rigorously instituted panel to discuss the pros and cons of leaving the EU might have been useful in the run-up to the 2016 referendum. Perhaps it might still be useful as a tool to elevate debate, restore the primacy of indisputable fact and return civility and respect to political dialogue. “For the past few years we have had two or more groups of people talking past each other, whether on Brexit or climate change,” said Starmer. “I’m supportive of the idea.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/vienna-trials-perfumed-subway-trains-passengers-incensed-austria-u-bahn",
    "date": "2019-07-19",
    "transcript": "The rush-hour subway train glides into the station, the doors snap open and passengers move forward to board. As they enter the crowded carriage, they are met not with a musty mix of human odours, but with the subtle aroma of citrus fruit. A select few trains on Vienna’s U-bahn are trialling perfumed carriages following complaints that the city’s subway system was unpleasant during the summer, despite widespread air conditioning. According to Wiener Linien (Vienna Lines), the city’s public transport operator, feedback has been “mixed”. But the fact that Vienna’s biggest public transport debate this summer is over perfumed carriages is evidence of a broader success story. A dense constellation of trams, buses, trains and subway cars, Vienna’s system is widely regarded as one of the best in the world. And it is remarkably cheap for residents: just a euro a day for those who buy the €365 (£328) annual pass. For comparison, a similar pass is €761 in Berlin, or £2,020 for London zones 1-4. Berlin is one of a number of German cities looking at copying Vienna’s pricing policy, as municipalities across Europe look for innovative policies that will lower emissions and get more people on to public transport. The euro-a-day ticket was the brainchild of the former Green deputy mayor of Vienna, Maria Vassilakou, who ran for office in 2010 promising €100 season tickets. Most other politicians thought this was crazy, pointing out that the existing €449 ticket was already cheap by European standards. After a long negotiation, a compromise price of €365 was agreed and launched in 2013. The effects have been considerable. “For people with modest incomes the saving really made a difference, and for well-off people it became something you buy it to have it just in case,” said Vassilakou. Sales of annual tickets are up from 321,000 in 2011 to 822,000 this year. When children and students, eligible for cheaper passes, are added to the total, around 1.1 million of Vienna’s 1.9 million population has a long-term pass. The extra ticket sales meant that the already generous city funding for transport infrastructure did not have to be increased too much to meet the shortfall. Wiener Linien receives around €700m a year in subsidies. There are no plans to raise the annual ticket price, which has remained static since 2013, even as short-term ticket prices creep up – a daily pass now costs €8. Using Vienna’s transport system is easy, with short interchanges, minimal distances between stations, and trains or buses that arrive at regular intervals. “Time as we experience it is not about minutes, it’s about our feelings. People say in Vienna it’s quick. It’s not, it’s just clever,” said Hermann Knoflacher, a professor and urban planning expert who has worked on the city’s transport infrastructure since 1963. The network is a mix of old and new, and ancient infrastructure forms part of a very modern system. The city’s U-bahn system only began operating in the late 1970s, but still uses the ornate Jugendstil entrance pavilions and sleek platforms – designed by the architect Otto Wagner – that were part of an overground railway network constructed in the late 19th century. The 71 tram that rolls along the famous Ringstrasse before a half-hour ride out to Vienna’s vast main cemetery has been operational since it was horse-drawnand coffins were pulled along the tracks at night. “He’s taken the 71” is still a slang term akin to “kick the bucket”. Now, it carries commuters from the suburbs and shuttles groups of tourists between the multiple historical landmarks on the Ring. But much of the infrastructure is more recent and new stations and routes are still being added. All the U-bahn stations and most of the buses and trams have disabled access. Knoflacher, who has taught a generation of urban planners, said that for years he has made his students spend a day getting around Vienna in a wheelchair. “They never forget that,” he said. Almost everyone in Vienna lives within a five-minute walk of a public transport stop or station, and a bus or train will be along within three to five minutes, meaning door to ride almost never takes more than 10 minutes, and usually much less. David Lansky, who works at EY, formerly Ernst &amp; Young, has one of the longest commutes in Vienna, requiring a bus and two U-bahn trains, but he enjoys the 45-minute journey twice a day. “I like to read, or listen to podcasts; it’s me time,” he said. In two years of regular commuting, he did not recall a delay of more than a couple of minutes. The love of the Viennese for their public transport system is so great that branded merchandise made by the operator has become the latest fashion trend in the city. “I see a lot of Wiener Linien apparel around the university and at parties. Somehow they’ve managed to hype their brand name and make it part of the youth culture here,” said Sophie Spiegelberger, a 20-year-old politics and maths student at the University of Vienna. The key to the success, said Knoflacher, lies not only in the impressive public transport infrastructure, but in making life more difficult for drivers as well, something Vienna has done gradually over recent decades. “Cars are like water, they fill any space you give them,” he said. “It’s great that the Germans want to introduce the cheap subway fares, but it’s only part of the solution. If you don’t really go after the cars, it will never work.” Additional reporting by Adam Urosevic",

    "transcript": "Mushrooms in Russia In Russia, mushroom picking is called the “quiet hunt” and it has a ritual all its own. From late spring through to autumn, the high season for mycophiles, Russians fan out into the forests in search of fresh air, solitude and fungi to fill their wicker baskets. Should you see Ladas and Range Rovers abandoned roadside after a downpour, do not be alarmed: it is just mushroom season, not the zombie apocalypse. The prey depends on the season: morels in spring, then pine boletes, broad milkcaps, orange chanterelles and the prized boroviki, the porcinis or penny buns that crown the season before the first snowfalls. Yes, Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy wrote about mushroom hunts. But for a more hallucinogenic offering, turn to the Bolshevik functionary Alexander Tolstoy, who wrote a fairytale about talking mushrooms complaining how painful it is to be eaten, trampling a poisonous mukhomor and then shoving their way into the mouths of two children with the cry “All right, kids, open up!” Soviet labour unions sometimes rented out buses to send factory workers off for a day of mushroom picking as a kind of teambuilding exercise. But the quiet hunt is really about leaving everything behind – our troubles, our devices, and often our loved ones – and communing with forests of birch and pine until we emerge again, our burden a little lighter. Well, most of us emerge. Each year, dozens of Russians go missing and only stumble out weeks later in a kind of trance state. Others become so hopelessly lost that they are never found at all. • Andrew Roth in Moscow The langar in India Indians are born negotiators, and everything in Delhi has a price. But twice a day, tens of thousands of people file into the city’s largest Sikh temple, take their place on their floor and eat a simple meal of vegetables, daal and roti – without paying anything. The langar, or communal kitchen, is a pillar of the Sikh religion. At the Bangla Sahib gurudwara in Delhi, an estimated 35,000 people are fed each day in a ritual symbolising the faith’s commitment to equality and eradicating hunger. “For everyone who comes it is free of cost,” says Harbhej Singh, who runs the langar. “It doesn’t divide anyone by caste, creed or culture. It’s for everyone.” In a culture that has traditionally been riven by the caste system, an intricate south Asian social hierarchy whose rules include who can and cannot prepare food or eat together, the 500-year-old langar tradition is still a radical statement. “The main motive is to remove these class differences,” Singh says. “Whether it’s a foreigner, a minister, or anyone, they all sit together. A beggar might be sitting next to you, but you both eat.” Preparing the meal involves thousands of volunteers as well as staggering quantities of food. On an average day, the kitchens prepare 450kg of lentils, 1,800kg of flour, 300kg or rice and 900kg of vegetables, most of it garnered through donations. And will the temple ever start charging? Singh is emphatic. “It will never happen.” • Michael Safi in Delhi Public transport in Estonia When the initiative to make public transport free for residents in Estonia’s capital Tallinn was introduced six years ago, it was seen as something of a throwback to the communist era. No matter. It’s predictably popular. Across ages, genders, mother tongues and ideologies, free public transport has become something that residents expect and value. The scheme has encouraged people to sign on as residents of Tallinn with the city’s population registry. This has increased the tax base and improved revenues. Proponents of free public transportation in Tallinn have pointed to gains in the city’s income that far outweigh the loss of fares. “I couldn’t do without it,” says Mari-Liis Kade, 20, a barista at the coffee chain Reval Café in Tallinn’s old town who commutes in from a suburb 10km away. “Young people generally don’t earn much in Estonia by EU standards,” she adds. “If you take home €300-€400 a month, which is common in the service industry, you can see why a free mode of transport is a great benefit.” A ride on the bus or tram in Tallinn is €2 for non-residents. “But it’s not just the money,” she continues. “It’s as much about convenience. It’s great to just jump on the 1A bus, ping my (Tallinn Transport) card and not have to worry about the fare. I definitely use the bus more because it is convenient in my community but also for getting to other places. Tourists think of Tallinn as just the Old Town and centre but it’s actually quite a spread-out city.” And is free public transport alleviating traffic snarls? “Well, the people of Tallinn are addicted to driving. I don’t know how much it has helped with that. But for those of us without cars, free public transportation is a godsend. It definitely encourages my friends and I to go into the city more often.” • Michael Amundsen in Tallinn Open-air workouts in Senegal A hazy dusk descends on Dakar’s coastal strip as hundreds of men and women work out, undeterred by the heady blend of harmattan dust and diesel fumes. Recently, China gave Senegal an improbable number of outdoor fitness machines – a vast row of glinting seafront metal. Surely there are not enough fitness freaks to necessitate even a quarter of the pull-up bars, pec decks and leg-swinging contraptions that interrupt the view? But by evening, they are full. Dakarois take fitness seriously. Packs of men jog up and down the city’s chinks of beach, turning shoal-like every 50 metres to cover the same ground hundreds of times. Other groups do aerobics, play football or wrestle as the traffic splutters past. The most creativity is brought to bear on elaborate synchronised press-up routines: with legs crossed one way then the other, elbows in then splayed out, then holding each other’s legs aloft. On a recent weekday evening on Yoff beach, a group did frog jumps en masse, first forwards, then back. Wrestling is equally popular, and you will often find a ring of spectators egging on two skimpily-dressed but deadly serious men circling each other before launching themselves at each other’s waists. At Dakar’s biggest and most prestigious gym, the Olympique Club, staff confide that some of the country’s most famous wrestlers often come to work out – but add that they preen a little more than they train. Senegalese boys are as likely to tell you that they want to be wrestlers as footballers, which goes some way to explain the citywide pursuit of “musculation”. Often sensible of gifts that are likely to be popular, China has cottoned onto that too – their donation of a large wrestling arena was inaugurated in Dakar last summer. • Ruth Maclean in Dakar Amber fishing in Germany Amber fishing is a popular pastime for visitors to the Baltic Sea coast. I’ve been doing it in the islands off northern Germany with my children ever since they were babies. Requirements are: the immediate aftermath of good storm, coupled with an onshore wind, after which you should make your way to the beach in the early morning to beat the other “Bernstein Fischer” (amber anglers). Take a scoop net – known as a kescher – to drag over the sea bed, and if you’re really serious, a pair of waders, or waterproofs that reach as far as your oxters and enable you to walk through the breakers, and possibly even a rope fastened to the shore to stop you being swept out to sea. Still keen? The idea is that a storm loosens the amber nuggets – believed to be around 44m years old – from the sea bed, and once it’s relatively calm again, the “golden tears of the Baltic”, as they are typically referred to, are either to be found floating among the concentration of disturbed shells, seaweed and driftwood or, if you’re lucky, washed up on the beach. The most likely time of the year is between November and March, when storms are most common. The sea must be cold. Patience and luck is required to find the best gems, and the most magical finds include pieces with insects encased in them, or the rarer green moss amber, and sometimes even blue chunks. But we have always been thrilled by the tiniest find – some little bigger than a pinhead. Other orangey-coloured stones on the beach can easily be mistaken for amber. But its lightness, hollowness and softness (tapping them against your teeth and biting into them helps to identify the real stuff) helps distinguish them from stones and pebbles. Polished them up is as easy as using a duster dipped in dry washing powder, and rubbing it over the nugget. Make a hole in it (local amber shops are usually happy to do this for a small fee), insert a thread, and you have the perfect unique holiday souvenir. • Kate Connolly in Berlin Visual treats in Tokyo Now that the dawn tuna auctions at Tsukiji fish market have moved to more clinical surroundings, arguably the best possible early start to a day in Tokyo is a visit to a sumo stable. Several heya allow visitors to sit in on training sessions, although reservations are recommended to guarantee getting close enough to take in the slapping of sweaty flesh and the sweet scent of the wrestlers’ bintsuke hair oil. The Arashio stable has an English-language page on its website, but restricts visitors to watching the action through a window. Keirin is the best cycling sport you’ve probably never heard of. The world’s first keirin races were held in the southern Japanese city of Kokura (now Kitakyushu) more than seven decades ago, with betting receipts used to fund the country’s postwar reconstruction. Its popularity among older men who enjoy a punt has saddled it with an image problem, but make no mistake, this is track cycling at its most brutal, with huge sums in prize money at stake for the best riders. Keirin tracks dot the suburbs of major cities, and admission is often free. Even when it isn’t, it never costs more than 100 yen [74p] to pass through the turnstiles. And if the keirin gods are smiling, there is even the prospect of leaving the velodrome with a profit. Visitors arriving in Japan in the next few weeks will have to be incredibly unlucky not to catch a glimpse of the springtime sakura – or cherry blossoms – whose pale pink petals appear at different intervals the length of the archipelago. The blossoms’ ubiquity means you are never far from a park or riverbank to indulge in a spot of hanami flower viewing and ponder the ephemeral nature of life as the petals float to the ground, not to be seen for another year. A Japanese picnic and a plentiful supply of beer and sake are optional, but recommended. • Justin McCurry in Tokyo Generous grannies in Spain They move with a stealth and speed that belies their years, materialising suddenly at pedestrian crossings, on cafe terraces and in tube carriages. They carry sweets, gooey compliments and, above all, centuries of accumulated wisdom and opinion. They are the grandmothers of Spain, and they are not shy. Undoubtedly the most assiduous worshippers of children in a country where kids possess semi-divine status no matter how infernal their true natures, the abuelas are always keen to talk, ruffle hair and magic up tissues for snotty young noses. Their chief function, however, is the imparting of parenting advice – whether solicited or not. God help the mother or father who dares to venture out without wrapping their offspring in at least two more layers than is strictly necessary. Being a guiri (foreigner) will not serve as mitigation. There is something wonderful about these daily displays of affection and about the way old and young communicate in Spain. To be a child here is to be seen, to be heard and to be engaged with. And, obviously, to be fussed over relentlessly. I sometimes wonder whether the children and the grannies don’t share some secret signal long lost to the eyes and ears of the generation that sits between them. Perhaps it is something learned, forgotten and then rediscovered over the course of a life. Perhaps it’s just the smell of sweets. • Sam Jones in Madrid The phallic shrine in Bangkok Shrines are scattered across Bangkok, dedicated to deities, gods, ghosts and spirits. In a city where the luxury mall is king, they serve as a spiritual counterbalance to the ever growing number of Louis Vuitton boutiques and on days when Bangkok feels overwhelmingly urban, I go and seek out some of the weirder and more wonderful ones. And the Chao Mae Tubtim shrine is certainly weird, and certainly wonderful. The modest shrine, tucked away in a park in the hectic centre of Bangkok, is dedicated to the Chinese fertility goddess Tubtim, and since 1920 has been where women hoping to conceive have come with a phallic offering – mostly in the form of a penis sculpture. It is a shrine dedicated to the power of the female and there is something both so endearing and so defiant about seeing the image of a goddess with hundreds of penises – big and small; hot pink, red, black, brown and ornately decorated; some piled up on a gold platter, laid out before her like a phallic congregation standing to attention. Another favourite is the shrine dedicated to Mae Nak, one of Thailand’s most famous ghosts. As the myth goes, she was so in love with her husband that when she died in childbirth she returned to the world and pretended to him she was still alive – until unfortunately he noticed she could walk through solid objects. Then there is Trimurti shrine, known as the lovers’ shrine and always strewn with red roses: a joy to encounter in the midst of a crowded, polluted Bangkok junction. In a city of chaos, the shrines offer a moment of stillness. And whether I’m sitting in the company of a lovesick ghost or in a sea of phalluses, they offer a window into the spiritual side of Thai society that can otherwise be easy to miss. • Hannah Ellis-Petersen in Bangkok Festivals in France From summer outdoor cinema in deckchairs in northern Paris to December’s monumental, nocturnal light creations in central Lyon, France has a vast array of free festivals all year long. The Atlantide international book festival held in the western city of Nantes in early spring each year – and currently run by the acclaimed Congolese novelist Alain Mabanckou – is among the best literary festivals in Europe, attracting top writers. And it doesn’t cost a cent to attend. Local festivals such as the Fêtes d’Arvor in Vannes, southern Brittany, are about celebrating regional traditions and culture. Others such as the Techno Parade in Paris each September are more about hundreds of thousands of fans taking over the city centre in a giant, free street party. The Parc de la Villette in northern Paris stages a summer free open-air cinema where people can bring their own picnics and watch films from Yellow Submarine to La La Land. In October, Paris also stages its Nuit Blanche nocturnal art trail, where people roam the city into the early hours looking at art installations in buildings and courtyards that they might not otherwise have access to. Even France’s more than 16,000 public libraries – over four times the number of libraries in the UK – regularly stage their own free events, such as the Paris libraries which decamp to parks on certain days in summer. Many of the most popular festivals are in smaller locations, like Saint-Louis on the Swiss border, well known for its free summer open-air music festival, Conç-Air. Lyon’s December Festival of Lights – one of the region’s key tourism events – sees top artists create giant, cutting-edge light projections and installations in the city centre. It is completely free. • Angelique Chrisafis in Paris What is your favourite freebie? Get in touch and let us know at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "transcript": "The UN’s key global poverty index has identified that conditions for the world’s poorest 40% are improving more quickly than for those just above them. The positive trend has been identified in the latest assessment of world poverty collected by the UN Development Programme, which quantifies relative impoverishment across the globe by multiple factors. “We looked at data for a group of 10 middle- and low-income countries and we found encouraging news that the bottom 40% were moving faster than the rest,” said Sabina Alkire, director at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, which drew up the report with UNDP. “Within these 10 countries, data show that 270 million people moved out of multidimensional poverty from one survey to the next.” According to the report, the progress was largely driven by south Asia. In India there were 271 million fewer people in poverty in 2016 than in 2006, while in Bangladesh the number dropped by 19 million between 2004 and 2014. Figures for those living in the most extreme poverty, however, tend to be complex, representing a group who move in and out of the most deprived conditions. The new snapshot of global poverty identified 1.3 billion people across the globe that it categorised as “multidimensionally poor”, with more than two-thirds of them – 886 million – living in middle-income countries. revealing vast inequalities among countries and among the poor themselves. “To fight poverty, one needs to know where poor people live. They are not evenly spread across a country, not even within a household,” said UNDP administrator Achim Steiner. The aim of the multidimensional poverty index, published by UNDP on Thursday, is to go beyond using income as the sole indicator for poverty by highlighting other ways in which people experience deprivation. Health, education and standard of living were among the areas investigated with the aim of identifying wide disparities in poverty, even within single households. In south Asia, said the report, almost a quarter of under-fives live in households where at least one child is malnourished and at least one child is not. “We need – even among those living in poverty – to understand people’s different experiences of deprivation. Are they malnourished? Can they go to school? Only then will poverty reduction policies be both efficient and effective,” said Pedro Conceição, director of the UNDP’s human development report office. Results also showed that children suffer poverty more intensely than adults and are more likely to be deprived in all 10 of the study’s indicators, lacking essentials such as clean water, sanitation, adequate nutrition or primary education. Even more staggeringly, one in three children worldwide was found to be multidimensionally poor, compared with one in six adults. That means that nearly half of the people living in multidimensional poverty – 663 million – are children, with the youngest children bearing the greatest burden.",

    "transcript": "Three years ago, Arjun Patel (not his real name) found it almost impossible to leave his room. Patel, in his 30s, was using drugs including sedatives and spice to help cope with severe mental health problems, and spent most of his days in a comatose state. “Part of me was like, ‘I’m developing a serious addiction,’ but the drug told me: “It’s fine, don’t worry about it,’” he remembers. When his mum caught him buying cannabis and realised he had a problem, she took him to the local drug and alcohol service in his area of London. Patel says: “I was glad, because it meant I could finally deal with this.” With a lot of help and determination, Patel stopped taking drugs, but would only leave the house to go to the service. He found himself very isolated. “You tend to see that in a lot of people, because many of their friends are using drugs and they have to cut them off,” he says. “Once you get into that world, you think you might as well keep using.” He wasn’t working and didn’t have a lot of money, so opportunities were limited. His situation dramatically changed when he was offered the chance to be part of a new loyalty scheme that rewarded him for attending recovery services. Patel was given a Capital card, which would allow him to accrue points for every session he attended. Once he had saved enough points, he could spend them at pop-up shops selling toiletries and clothes, the cinema, restaurants and more. Although he was sceptical at first, he now believes the card can change lives. He says: “These things allow you to have a bit of fun. It sparks something in your brain and you remember there are other ways to have fun. You start to develop an identity of being round people and that’s a massive step.” The Capital card was launched by the charity WDP in April 2017. It is now used in nine London boroughs and in Cheshire West and Chester. Since its launch, 5,400 service users have benefitted from the scheme. The charity has built relationships with 35 different organisations including Nando’s, City Lit, MOD Pizza, Middlesex cricket club, local gyms and others, offering more than 50 different activities, services and products. More than 990,000 points have been earned – for every intervention you gain 10 points – and more than 155,000 points have been spent. Analysis carried out by London South Bank University has shown that the Capital card was associated with a 50% increased likelihood of service users successfully completing treatment. There is also a free Capital card app. According to Manish Nanda, joint chief executive officer at WDP, the card allows service users to enjoy things they may not have been able to previously and get out and about. He says: “That’s the crux of the Capital card– to give people an opportunity to experience things we take for granted or they may have lost a connection with.” Nanda came up with the idea nine years ago, when he was working at the WDP service in Hackney. Prisoners released from Pentonville used to come into the service on Friday when they were released. “That’s one of the riskiest points in someone’s treatment journey,” says Nanda. “If, on the day of release, they’re on an opiate prescription and they don’t come into the service, there’s a huge risk of potential overdose and death.” It was a chance conversation with the local barber that sparked the idea of incentivising people to attend the service. While Nanda was talking about the challenges of his work, the barber asked if he could help. Nanda took up his offer and started telling prisoners due for release that if they came to the service on the day of release, they would get their repeat prescription, advice and support, as well as a free haircut. “We started getting more and more people coming in. That was the genesis of the card.” Since then, the scheme has taken on a life of its own, although not without challenges along the way. Stigma still plays a huge part in getting partners on board. Holly Price, Capital card manager, says: “As soon as you mention it’s for people with drugs and alcohol issues, people don’t want to open their business up, though I do feel that’s changing.” It’s also hard to get enough activities, services and products to meet every service user’s needs, which is why there is now a dedicated member of staff approaching potential partners. The team, which now comprises four full-time staff as well as volunteers, are still developing the Capital card, and consult service users regularly to get feedback and suggestions. The team noticed that some people wouldn’t spend their points, instead amassing as many as possible to show family and peers how well they were doing. The next update on the app will show how many points have been earned overall, as well your current balance and how many you’ve spent. For people who don’t feel ready to use their points to attend places like the gym or the cinema on their own, the charity now runs group outings. The aim is to support people using the five ways to wellbeing to meet all their needs and encourage them back into society, while the plan in the future is to provide employment opportunities. The card comes at a time when treatment budgets are being cut. Nanda says: “There’s less resource to deliver these services. It’s really troubling. In respect to austerity biting, the generosity [from people and businesses] is enabling us to think as creatively as we’re able to and harness what’s really good in a community.” There are many who have benefitted. “Even though I’ve managed to get to a good point in the last year, it’s still taken a long time to get my anxiety levels back to the point where I can do things like go on the train,” says Patel. “Going to meals [at Nando’s] was the first time I had been able to go out for a meal in public in a long time. It’s been amazing in helping me personally.” He adds: “It gives people hope. That’s a big part of it.”",

    "transcript": "When Mohamad Rahimeh arrived in the Calais refugee camp that was nicknamed “the Jungle”, cooking was the last thing on his mind. He was a political scientist from Syria with a journey from hell behind him. Food was just a means to an end. But when a close friend fell sick, he rustled up a meal of eggs. A hidden talent was uncovered. “He loved my food and after he got better I made everyone a big feast from one pan, and everyone had my ‘Jungle eggs’ – people loved it,” Rahimeh says. Rahimeh is one of almost 14,000 Syrian refugees who have arrived in the UK since 2015, and a growing number of chefs bringing Syrian cuisine to the country’s food scene. His recipe, using simple ingredients such as tinned tomatoes that were donated to the camp by charities, is still a big hit three years later, served to customers at his popup Syrian brunch in Archway, north London. With the help of some Syrian friends and British volunteers that Rahimeh met in the now-cleared camp, he turned his culinary talents into a viable business by setting up Mo’s Eggs. Customers sit at communal tables, taking it in turns to dip in to the colourful selection of homemade hummus dishes, while he wanders through the restaurant chatting about his recipes and his home country. “That’s where the idea of Mo’s Eggs came from – sharing food from one pan and giving people the love we had in ‘the Jungle’,” Rahimeh says. Asylum Eggs have also been added to the menu since then – a new recipe that came to him during his stay in a detention centre while seeking asylum in the UK. “Whenever I make something new I always try to have a story behind it.” Rahimeh buys most of his ingredients from the market, having grown up in the mountain town of Ain al-Fijah surrounded by fresh fruit and vegetables. Research has shown that the majority of Syrian refugees in the UK are now in work or study, but unemployment rates remain high. A report from the University of Glasgow found that for 18- to 32-year-old Syrian refugees, 35% are studying and just over a quarter are in paid work. However, 19% are looking for work, almost five times the national unemployment rate of 3.9%. The report also found that many of the young Syrian refugees settled in the UK are highly qualified – a quarter have a university degree. But many are working in jobs they are overqualified for, and only 57% of those in professional or highly technical roles in their home country have found similar work in the UK. As more arrive, the popularity of Syrian food is on the rise, not only in London but in other areas that have large concentrations of immigrants and refugees. A number of restaurants and bakeries have popped up in Scotland, for instance, where nearly a fifth of Syrian refugees have settled since coming to the UK. Juliette Lyons, who met Rahimeh in the Calais refugee camp while working for an NGO and now helps run Mo’s Eggs, said: “For a lot of customers who come, it’s their first interaction with Syrian culture and it’s opening people’s eyes to a little part of Syria here that they hadn’t ever been exposed to before. It’s highlighting Syria in a completely positive light, rather than just in the context of war.” While his popup continues, he hopes to set up shop permanently with a street food stall and add his specially made Syrian ice-cream to the menu. But not only has Rahimeh brought his Syrian cuisine to the UK, he’s also been introduced to classic British food dishes too. “The first English dish I tried was roast potatoes, and I love them. It was Christmas time [when I first arrived in the UK] and everyone was making roast potatoes and roast chicken. It’s my favourite.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "date": "2019-07-10",
    "transcript": "Wreathed in barbecue smoke, Vetjaera Haakuria gestures at the men butchering meat and cooking it over hot coals behind his back. “What have you learned about the risks of eating this?” he asks his young audience, spotless in their white lab coats. “It might contain drug residues, right? And what about diseases?” It’s nearly noon in Windhoek, Namibia’s capital, and the market is preparing grilled meat – known locally as kapana – for the lunchtime rush. Everyone comes here, from construction workers to members of parliament. Namibians love to eat meat, and he is no exception: his tribe, the Herero, traditionally eat nothing else. But regulation is patchy and the meat being sold at this market could contain anything from antibiotics to parasites, Haakuria says. Diseases that pass from livestock to humans are rife in the country’s rural north. Animals that die from unknown causes are eaten, no questions asked. Last year more than 50 people were hospitalised in north-western Namibia after contracting anthrax, a deadly disease that had probably entered a goat flock from infected wildlife. In those areas, people live cheek by jowl with their livestock, Haakuria says. “You go straight from the cattle kraal into the house, where babies crawl around on the floor.” While most small-scale farmers are able to access basic veterinary drugs such as antibiotics and dewormers over the counter at agri-stores or human pharmacies, few are told how to administer them safely. That is why Haakuria has brought his second-year pharmacy students from the University of Namibia to this market: to teach them about the interface between human and animal health. He is the country’s only specialist veterinary pharmacist. But not for long – or so he hopes. The University of Namibia teaches all its pharmacy students a bit of veterinary pharmacy. But starting next year, it will offer a postgraduate specialist course on the subject. It is only the second such course in the world. The first opened its doors at the UK’s Harper Adams University a decade ago. “Part of the training will be around animal health and husbandry,” says Alison Pyatt, who runs Harper Adams’s postgraduate course, and who is helping to set up its Namibian counterpart. Graduates from these courses do not replace vets, she explains. But they are able to go out into farming communities and advise people on how to keep their animals, and themselves, healthy. In Namibia, that means teaching people about naturally occurring diseases such as brucellosis, a bacterial infection passed from animals through milk, meat or even close contact, which can cause miscarriages in humans. Haakuria and Pyatt both believe pharmacists are ideally placed to supplement veterinary health services in rural areas. The medicines used to treat humans and animals are often the same, he says, and pharmacists are experts on how to give drugs safely and effectively. This is something vets don’t always know how to do. And anyway, in northern Namibia vets are in short supply. But most towns have a pharmacist. Veterinary pharmacists would provide drugs, advice and information to rural communities, Haakuria explains. But they could also help curb drug resistance. Overuse of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics in agriculture is one of the main culprits driving the development of superbugs around the world. So if stores that dispense them in rural parts of the country are required to have specially trained staff, that would be a big step forward, he says. It doesn’t have to stop with Namibia, he adds. “If it works here it needs only a little bit of tweaking to work in, say, Botswana.” Speaking to the students, it seems at least some of them are keen to follow in Haakuria’s footsteps. Nearly all of them grew up around animals and have seen the issues Haakuria describes with their own eyes. One of them, Venomuinjo Kasaona from Opuwo, a town near the border with Angola, remembers eating meat as a child from an animal that he realises now had probably died of foot and mouth disease. “I realise I can help people back home,” he says.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/09/device-bring-both-solar-power-clean-water-to-millions",
    "date": "2019-07-09",
    "transcript": "A device that can produce electricity from sunlight while simultaneously purifying water has been produced by researchers, an invention they say could solve two problems in one stroke. The researchers say the device is not only a source of green energy but also offers an alternative to current technologies for purifying water. These, they add, often consume large amounts of electricity and require infrastructure beyond the reach of many communities that lack basic access to safe drinking water – a situation thought to affect more than 780 million people worldwide. “These people spend a collective 200m hours a day fetching water from distant sources,” said Prof Peng Wang, a co-author of the research from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. With solar farms often located in arid regions, the device could provide clean water where it is needed most. What is more, the team say it could be used in a backyard or on an industrial scale. “Having a significant amount of freshwater produced continuously on a daily basis [means] many challenging tasks can then be easily achievable,” said Wang. “The generated clean water can be used [for] cleaning solar panels to remove dust particles; it can be use to irrigate plants and crops, making desert agriculture possible.” Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Wang and colleagues reveal how they constructed the device. On the top is a horizontal commercial silicon solar cell and beneath this are several tiers through which saline, brackish or contaminated surface water is run. Waste heat from the solar cell warms the saline water passing immediately beneath it – the water evaporates, passes through a membrane and condenses to yield clean water, releasing heat in the process that warms the saline water in the tier below that – the process is then repeated for the next tier. The purified water flows out of the device and is collected. The team found the device can be used to purify saltwater as well as seawater contaminated with heavy metals, with the water collected containing levels of lead, copper, sodium, calcium and magnesium all below the levels deemed safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization. While the team outline various versions of the device, they reveal that under conditions on a par with a bright, cloudless day the energy efficiency of the solar cell was about 11% – a figure they say is on a par with what would be expected without the distillation section attached, and higher than previously reported by others working on such devices. The device was also able to produce clean water from seawater at a rate they say is higher than conventional solar stills. The device, while not the first to make use of solar distillation, has a particular advantage: by combining two types of device that typically each require a large land area, and mounting systems, the approach is relatively compact. Wang said the device turned the traditional link between water and electricity on its head: conventionally, electricity is produced by heating water to produce steam that is then used to turn turbines. While he said the team was still working on scaling up the device and reducing costs, they are optimistic. “It is our hope that we move quickly to push this technology towards its large-scale adoption,” he said.",

    "transcript": "In the vast Indian interior, it is not unusual to see shoeless infants – whether walking barefoot to school or hopping around on makeshift sports pitches. Injuries are common and lead to infections such as hookworm and elephantiasis. More than 250 million Indians live below the poverty line and footwear is usually a luxury. Tens of millions of children have no shoes. (By contrast, roughly 300m pairs of shoes are discarded in the US every year). Now, two young athletes in Mumbai have come together to convert old shoes into new footwear for unshod schoolchildren in small villages. Green Sole has teamed up with schools and colleges to distribute remade footwear across states such as Odisha, Assam, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. So far they have provided more than 150,000 pairs of flip-flops and slippers. “We have also started retailing our recycled footwear through stores and online portals,” said one of the founders, Shriyans Bhandari. “Besides making footwear and distributing it, we are very proud of having set up a skill centre in Jharkhand, to train tribal women in recycling footwear.” The duo is working with large companies such as Adidas, Sketchers and H&amp;M to collect old shoes, and absorb the cost of converting them into new slippers for children. A donation of 200 rupees (£2.30) is enough to recycle one shoe. Shriyans says that his “ambitious mission is now to make sure that every person in the country has a pair of shoes by 2023.” The hope is that footwear will encourage school attendance. Some children initially did not wear the flip-flops, storing them safely in a cupboard because they were precious. But more typical is the story of one 14-year-old girl called Radha. Her daily walk to school was a 4km round trip. In the summer heat, it was sometimes impossible to walk barefoot and her schooling suffered. Her new shoes have improved her attendance. A proliferation of companies and social enterprises in India are working to repurpose and recycle old materials into new products and items of clothing, from Goonj, which revives garments and distributes to the needy, to HelpUsGreen which converts old flowers from temples and mosques into incense sticks, organic fertilisers and insulation. Code, started in 2016 by friends Vishal Kanet and Naman Gupta, is India’s first cigarette waste management company, turning butts into manure, and stuffing for cushions and toys. Pune based Aarohana Ecosocial started by Nandan Bhat and Amita Deshpande, in 2015, is converting plastic waste into fabric and then making handbags, accessories and home décor from it, employing local tribal people. “For Indians recycling and upcycling are not new concepts,” says Shriyans. “Generations of Indians have converted old saris and bed sheets into quilts and dresses, repaired old radios and transistors and reused oil cans as planters. But then consumerism took over and the old tenets were forgotten.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "Thirteen young adults who were paralysed in sporting or traffic accidents have had movement in their hands restored through pioneering nerve transfer surgery, enabling them to feed themselves, hold a drink, write and in some cases return to work. Natasha van Zyl, the Melbourne-based surgeon who leads a research programme that has given some people their lives back, said the patients were able to use their hands and extend their arms from the elbow. “Extending your elbow allows you to push a wheelchair better, helps you to transfer in and out of a car, reach out and do something in space in front of you, shake someone’s hand. “It allows you to reach above your head, which you need to be able to do because the world is designed for standing-up people. So you can switch a light off, you can get something off a shelf. Hand function is everything you use your hand for. You would just need to tape your hands up for five minutes to experience how frustrating life would be without your hands, without your fingers.” The team at Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia, have been using combinations of tendon transfers, which result in greater strength for the muscle, and nerve transfers, which improve dexterity. Their findings from their work on 13 patients are reported reported in the Lancet medical journal. Van Zyl says she hopes they will encourage the thousands of people who become tetraplegic (also known as quadriplegic) by losing the function of all four limbs to seek surgery which could help them live more normal lives. Nerve transfers are not new, she says, but had not been successful in spinal cord injuries. Van Zyl had been using nerve transplants in brachial plexus injuries, where neck and shoulder nerves have been pulled out of the spinal cord, and wondered why they did not try them to restore function in patients who had been paralysed. In 2014, she and her team designed a triple nerve transplant. The first patient had “really fabulous results from the surgery”, she said. “Word got out and we were fairly inundated with people wanting nerve transfers.” They set up a structured project to track everything they did and all the outcomes, which has resulted in the Lancet paper. They recruited 16 young adult patients who had become tetraplegic after motor accidents, falls, sports or diving. Two of them did not continue with the programme and one died, unconnected to the surgery. Nerves were taken from shoulders and transplanted into paralysed muscles in the arm so that they bypassed the injury and connected back up to the spinal cord. Ten of the patients had nerve transfers to one arm and tendon transplants in the other. Four nerve transplants in three patients failed, but the team say tendon transplant is then available as a backup. Two years on from surgery, the patients have significant improvements in their hand function, particularly enough pinch and grasp strength to carry out most tasks of daily living. Van Zyl says she gets strength and inspiration from her patients. She tells of one who had been “a very high-functioning individual. He was in a boating accident – he was thrown out of a boat. He was the CEO of three different companies he’d set up and he was working seven days a week and he went from that to a head on a stick, as he described himself. “He told me, after he’d had his surgery and had enough of a result from it, that he had decided that he would try this surgery but if it didn’t work he was going to exit. He didn’t want to live any more. His was a very high level of injury but he got enough out of what we did for him, which was a combination of tendon and nerve transfers, for him to start to work again at home, to be able to take a young family member out to the movies independently and handle the money, get the tickets, get the popcorn.” One time Van Zyl video-called him and saw people milling about in the room. She asked if his carer could do something for her. “He said: ‘That’s not my carer – that’s my assistant. I’m working. These are people working for me.’ “In his case it was life-saving, not just life-changing.” She and her team have now done about 160 nerve transfers. Between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year have a spinal injury, more than half of whom become tetraplegic. There are surgeons who could help at least some of them, says Van Zyl. “We are all dedicated to this cause and absolutely love this work. All around the world there are surgeons – we all know each other – some of them waiting for patients, frustrated that they don’t get enough.” They cannot do anything for someone as badly paralysed as Christopher Reeve was, but they can help the most common spinal injuries that cause tetraplegia, called C5 and C6 – damage to the fifth and sixth cervical (neck) vertebrae. She hopes the published paper will encourage rehabilitation teams to suggest surgery and patients to seek it out. In a commentary published with the paper, Dr Ida Fox from Washington University in the USA writes: “Stem cells and neuroprostheses could change the landscape of regenerative medicine in the future. For now, nerve transfers are a cost-effective way to harness the body’s innate capability to restore movement in a paralysed limb.” Case study: ‘I wouldn’t hesitate to do it again’ Paul Robinson, 34, from Australia’s Gold Coast, said the surgery had been “life-changing”. Robinson fractured his C6 vertebra in a dirt bike accident in early 2015, a month before his 30th birthday. It left him a tetraplegic. He lost function in his hands, and was only able to manage a slight grip. Picking up objects like a cup to drink required squeezing two hands together. “Even something light like an empty can would really be a struggle for me to grab with one hand because all I had was slight tenodesis grip, which is when you pull your wrist back and your fingers automatically close,” Robinson said. After a few months in the spinal unit at Brisbane’s Princess Alexandra hospital, one of his health workers mentioned the research being done by Dr Van Zyl into tendon and nerve transfers. In December 2015, he received a nerve and tendon transfer on his right side and nerve transfer on his left side. Recovering from the surgery was difficult, both physically and emotionally, because it erased progress he had made toward rehabilitation. But once he started rehab again, he forgot about the setback. “You spend so much time in rehab learning to do things with what you have got … and then all of a sudden you go almost back to the start,” he said. “I think I was four weeks [post surgery], not being able to move my arms, so it was back to ‘Can someone give me a drink of water, can someone change the channel?’ I was more or less bedridden for a while. “It was probably about six months and I started really noticing the results, and then after about eight months it was like: ‘Oh wow, I didn’t even notice I was doing that.’ “I was picking stuff up and I couldn’t have done that previously. It is a slow healing process but I wouldn’t hesitate to do it again if I was in the same position. The amount of difference it’s made to my daily life makes that recovery beyond comparison.” Robinson can now lift up to 9kg with his right hand and 4kg with his left. The restored grip function means he is able to live independently and has recently moved out of his parents’ home. “It means I am able to pull apart and put my wheelchair in and out of the car, pick things up off the ground, hold a drink with one hand,” he said. Using his wheelchair is also easier now he can rely on his increased strength to manoeuvre on uneven ground. He travels to Brisbane several times a week to play wheelchair rugby and regularly meets other people who have received similar injuries who might benefit from the same surgery. “There might be someone else out there who doesn’t see that this is an option,” he said. “It has made such a big change to my life; hopefully it can help someone else too. It’s really a life-changing thing.”",

    "transcript": "It’s the great injustice of festival life. While men don’t have to think twice about it, for women the question of when and where to pee is always there. Do you brave a long queue and risk losing your friends, or are you drunk enough to relieve yourself in a more informal setting? Gina Périer, a French architect living in Copenhagen, thinks she has the answer. In a boost for “pee-quality”, her company is rolling out Lapee, which she claims is the world’s first industrially-produced female urinal, at this week’s Roskilde festival in Denmark. “When we were here on Saturday and Sunday, it was only used by girls and they were so happy,” she said, as she inspected her 48 pink plastic spiral designs. “We were spammed by Instagram messages. They were all saying ‘finally, something for us’, because it’s so degrading for women, the situation of urination.” The concept is fairly simple. The Lapee takes the idea of a single moulded urinal unit with built-in storage tank and adapts it for women by extending the divider to screen the user off, lifting it up and raising the hole into which you pee to make it easy to hit. A spiral design assures privacy. Périer, 25, founded the company last year with her Danish friend Alexander Egebjerg after both had worked for the festival as student architect volunteers. “We wanted to create the female version of a product which exists all over the world,” she explained. “I don’t think it’s that complicated to make a urinal for women. I just think it was something which was designed by men and they only thought about themselves.” With three women able to visit at a time and no door, they claim it takes just 30 seconds to spend a penny, compared to three minutes for a standard cabin toilet, making it six times more efficient. The platform where women stand or crouch is raised so that passers-by can’t peer in and the user can look around. “Actually, it’s not safer to have a door, it’s the opposite,” Périer said. “With Lapee, you are in a way better position to defend yourself than if you are locked in a cabin with someone.” There was a mixed reaction from festival-goers, with some units overflowing and doubts over the lack of a door. “You need to be a little bit drunk to do it if you ask me,” said Ida Blomberg, 18. But her friend Sol Grum, 19, approved. “You know, when you’re drinking you have to pee all the time, and last year all the girls had to pee in front of everyone or wait for half an hour, so it’s very nice,” she said. “Also they are pink, so that’s also a little bit cool.” Lapee is not the first innovation in female urination. Travel devices include the Shewee, which has been around for two decades. Périer believes Lapee has already reduced the noxious smells for which Roskilde is notorious. “When you’re a girl and you go to toilets at festivals they are usually covered in shit, so to have a place where you know it’s only going to be pee sounds like the most luxurious thing in the world.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to problems.

    "date": "2019-07-03",
    "transcript": "Hit hard, flat, true and with a whip-crack report, the ball is still gathering pace as it thuds against the back wall of the training centre. Heads nod amid whoops of approval and excitement at what this talent could bring to England’s cricket team. Not the bunch currently scrapping in the World Cup, or the team that will face Australia later this summer, but the gaggle of richly talented amateurs united by two powerful things they have in common: sport and disability. “Our most improved player over the last couple of years,” says Liam Thomas, the vice-captain of England’s physical disability side, of the ball hitter, Matt Askin. Ditching his prosthetic arm has liberated Askin. He now flourishes his bat like a cheerleader’s baton, larruping the ball further and faster than ever. “Hitting sixes with one hand, eh?” adds Thomas. “Amazing.” Teachers, tilers, students, water workers and biscuit exporters by day, the men gathered here for a weekend training session are the elite among 60,000 people with disabilities playing cricket at one level or another. There is a burgeoning range of sports for people with disabilities: the Paralympics is just the tip of the iceberg. From football – there are varieties for both frames and powerchairs – to wheelchair rugby, or blind and visually impaired tennis, disability sport is enjoying something of a boom. There is even table cricket: a specially adapted version of the game requiring no little skill, the national title of which was contested by more than 300 schools. Roughly one in five people in the UK report a disability and, according to a Sport England study in 2015-16, those who do are more than twice as likely to be physically inactive. “A 26-year-old lad got in touch,” said Neil Bradshaw, the operations manager for England disability cricket. “He was injured in service, is registered disabled and used to play for the army cricket team. He’s not been confident enough to reach out previously. He’s coming for a trial in August.” At the training session at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, everyone has a backstory – teenage bone cancer, amputation, club feet, missing limbs – but sympathy is neither sought nor required. Respect and a stage to perform on: that’ll do. That’s why they’re here. That and the chance to inspire the next generation to get involved. Joining the physically disabled elite at the weekend training camp are their counterparts from England’s deaf squad. This innovative joint residential jaunt has been designed to bring together four sides – those with physical disability (PD), deafness, learning disability and visual impairment – under the overall disability umbrella. Sizing each other up in open-net sessions lends proceedings a keen edge on the cusp of a pivotal season, for the PD group in particular. Later this summer, England stages the first physical disability world cricket series, duking it out with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe across nine days of T20 action in the West Midlands. The hope is that exposure, and the seeing-is-believing nature of disability cricket, will help achieve what the likes of Anya Shrubsole and Steph Houghton have done for women’s sport. There are, as yet unconfirmed, plans to stream the games live. Millions would watch on the subcontinent. India’s involvement, backed by the all-powerful cricket authorities there, could be a gamechanger. “The number of blind cricketers alone in India would drown the number of visually impaired athletes in Paralympic programmes across the world,” says Ian Martin, the head of disability cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board. “And I think people often miss cricket’s appeal to people with all disabilities – we aim to include, not exclude. At grassroots level, we can be proud to say we welcome anyone.” Martin appreciates the game’s potential reach so keenly because the story is also autobiographical. A lifelong and passionate club cricketer diagnosed with the muscle- and nerve-wasting condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, he has singlemindedly pushed the disabled game forward over the past decade. “When I pull on my suit and look at the three lions on it, I’m able to think back to the dreams that I had as a kid about representing England at cricket and realise that I’ve achieved the dream and then some, just not in the way that I planned.” This summer is a watershed for Martin and Bradshaw, both backroom veterans. Martin brokered the first PD international, between England and Pakistan in 2012. Bradshaw, who knits logistics together across the board, finally gave up his Matalan warehouse shift manager’s gig to go full-time last year. His initial involvement, a decade back in Cheshire, was done as a favour. “I got into it simply because I fancied a pint at a cricket club,” he chuckles. “I saw 10-12 disabled kids running their own warm-up, so just started helping out.” Martin and Bradshaw are a tight partnership despite a bitter footballing rivalry (one is Everton, the other Liverpool). They have hundreds of shared miles under their belts building patiently for this moment. As Bradshaw sees it, fate just dealt these cricketers a different path: his remit is to push the envelope in search of validity. “That’s where our frustration lies,” he says. “This isn’t a sympathy setup because these lads can’t get access to their cricket anywhere else. The standard’s really high. “It’s educating people – getting away from the ‘oh, bless them, isn’t that nice?’ attitude. People don’t understand the game until they’ve seen the game.” Watching the training underscores his point: there is serious ability here, as evidenced when left-hander Thomas nails a succession of sweet shots against a bowling machine, deploying immaculate footwork. (His right leg ends just below the knee.) The coaching staff comprises ex-England Test cricketers Ian Salisbury and James Kirtley. The performance analyst, Chris Highton, is on hand to crunch the numbers and go through footage. Muscles and tweaks are tended by Scott Gormley and Richard Olejar, the latter physio a quietly spoken Slovakian taekwondo international known as “the assassin” for reasons that later become clear. After a couple of hours power-hitting in front of the bowling machines, there is a performance analysis seminar with Highton, who urges the players to embrace the data and make it work for them. “It’s about making strengths super-strengths and weaknesses strengths,” he says. Then it’s down to the nitty gritty: batters v bowlers in a series of T20 scenarios. Fielding and catching drills complete the afternoon’s work.” The competitive instinct kicks in when the different teams come together to test out their skills. There is an eye-catching exchange when deaf fast bowler George Greenway, capable of whistling it down at almost 80mph, takes on Liam O’Brien, who is not given to taking backward steps. “Make sure you say he didn’t get me out,” he says of the tussle. He’s only half joking. Honesty, friendship and integrity, winning on and off the pitch: these are constantly recurring themes across the weekend. Saturday evening is spent at the campus bar enjoying a couple of well-earned drinks, during which the squads start to mingle. Salisbury doesn’t bang the drum about curfews. He doesn’t have to: several of the players retreat to their digs before last orders. Sunday morning brings the opportunity to discover first-hand why Olejar has his nickname. Breakfast is at 7.45am. At 9am sharp, both squads – and, at Salisbury’s insistence, your 50-year-old correspondent – warm up with Olejar. For 45 minutes, we are put through a series of hops and/or leaps up one, two, and then three steps. The theme to Rocky blares out as we pound the concrete. Then it’s rigorous stretching inside before getting down to work again. By about 4pm we are done. Everyone goes their separate ways, back to the day jobs. There is a wistful, end-of-school-term air as the players drift off. Liam O’Brien and spinner Fred Bridges plot their podcast listening on the journey back to Sussex. Dan Hamm, joker in the pack, alights upon Askin’s discarded prosthesis. “Look!” he says, waving it like a triumphant detective cracking a case, “we’ve found this – which must mean… there’s a body somewhere!” Askin, clearly familiar with this sketch, smiles and shrugs his shoulders. I mention that time has raced by: 48 hours gone in five minutes. “Yeah,” Askin concurs, smiling broadly. “I never want to go home.” • A version of this article appeared in Wisden cricket monthly",

    "transcript": "If we only produced a newspaper every 50 years what would we put in it? Well, despite today’s mood of crisis, pessimism, alarm and antagonism, the semicentennial 2019 edition would probably be pretty upbeat. In the 50 years since we landed on the moon (and since I was born) progress down here on Earth has been stellar. We’ve made remarkable advances in tackling poverty and child mortality, as the world’s economy has grown more than thirtyfold since the giant leap for mankind. When it comes to public health, we’ve either eradicated (smallpox) or driven back (guinea worm, polio, malaria, sleeping sickness) a whole textbook of diseases, and fought back strongly against some of the most deadliest of all, including HIV and cancer. (This week, Sarah Boseley discovered great hope for the battle against cervical cancer). We have more people in work than ever – and despite current pangs, democracy is still winning as a numbers game, with more people voting in elections in 2019 than at any point in history. And while we’re comparing 2019 with 1969, the festival scene has come a long way since Woodstock, and is now probably greener than ever. Of course there are challenges. There always have been. Humanity has doubled in number since 1969 (when I was born there were 3.528 billion people alive – check your number here.) We are overusing resources, leading to big environmental and biodiversity crises. Yet since 1969 we have learned to harness energy from sun, moon and wind. (This week, Oliver Milman reported that the US generated more electricity from renewables than from coal for the first time). We are an ageing species – more than 1 billion of us are over 60. But we are ingenious too, for ever thinking up new ways to face down this challenge. Of course, there’s still Trump, Brexit, Iran, Johnson, Hong Kong, Putin, austerity. But will we still be writing about them in 50 years’ time? Lucky numbers Still playing with the rather arbitrary 50-year theme, air pollution may be a serious health hazard in parts of the world today, but in many places it’s actually better than it was. In the UK, you’re far less likely to die because of nasty stuff in the air than you were in 1970. What we liked The family spending a year volunteering in Europe, as reported by our friends at Positive News. Also this piece examining how the green new deal might change the US’s built space. What we heard Mary Bomford wrote to us on the theme of waste and recycling: Lots of bad news about how recycling goes nowhere. Check out how it is done in Canada in the province of British Columbia. Alan Robertshaw, meanwhile, sees potential for an ancient technology to make a big comeback: I would like to suggest a subject ie the reintroduction of sail into commercial shipping. The latter is currently a large contributor to the climate emergency as well as being a serious polluter of the oceans, issues which need to be addressed. Whilst initially a return to sail may seem retrograde and old school, this is not actually the case. We’ve had a go at this subject before, but perhaps it is worth a second look.

    "date": "2019-06-26",
    "transcript": "It’s 11.30am on a midweek June morning in Helsinki, Finland. Duvi Leineberg, a remote care nurse, is doing the lunch rounds. But instead of jumping in a car and visiting each person one by one, she is sitting in an office looking at a large computer screen where she can see into seven people’s homes. Most are sitting at a table preparing to tuck into some food. This is a virtual lunch group, set up to make sure older people receiving home care services in the city eat regularly and at the right time. Leineberg runs the session. She starts by checking everyone has their food and that it is warmed up. Some have soup, others have pre-prepared meals that have been delivered by home care services. People also sip coffee. One screen shows an empty backdrop and she calls the home to check her client is all right. He walks past the screen but says he isn’t hungry and doesn’t want to eat right now. Leineberg then asks everyone if they have any plans for the afternoon. A few reply that they will go out for a walk. A former hospital nurse, Leineberg sees the value of such groups. “Firstly, the client feels like they are a part of a bigger thing. It’s also guaranteed that they eat properly. If I spot anything that seems out of the ordinary, I can call the home care nurses who will pay them a visit if necessary.” Her clients are also fans of the lunch group. Riitta Koskinen, 80, says through a translator: “I’m old and living alone and it’s nice to have the company. We eat at the same time – food tastes better when you’re with others – and I’ve really enjoyed it. It makes me eat and it’s good to see other people.” Finland has a rapidly ageing population and recruitment problems in health and care. By 2070, one in three Finns is expected to be over 65. At the same time there has been a huge decline in the birth rate and the number of Finns of working age is expected to fall by around 200,000 by 2050. As a result, the demand for and cost of care services are growing while tax revenues are decreasing, leading politicians to warn that the Nordic model of highly state-funded cradle-to-grave social care will no longer be affordable. Taina Mantyranta, a medical counsellor at the Finnish ministry of social affairs and health, admits: “Finland is facing economic constraints. We have been trying to reform our social and healthcare system for several decades. The need to develop more integrated social and health services has been clearly recognised also from a cost containment perspective. ICT and digitalisation are integral parts of the reform.” The virtual lunch group is one aspect of Helsinki’s remote care – where clients have a tablet that links up with remote care nurses in a service centre. Remote care appointments are set up to check on clients throughout the day and to make sure they take the relevant medication. There are 800 home care clients, and nurses carry out 24,000 remote care visits a month. By the end of 2019, the service hopes to cater for 1,100 clients. The potential savings are eye-watering. Whereas a physical home visit costs the equivalent of around £40, a remote care visit is just £4.50. Over the course of one shift, a remote care nurse can carry out over 50 visits – which works out almost 90% cheaper than if they had knocked on each of their client’s doors. Little wonder that the city’s service centre is hoping to start a remote dinner group soon as well as other sessions. They already take clients virtually to concerts and shows. Hanna Hämäläinen, who works as a planner at the service, remembers when she took 64 clients virtually to a carol concert. A screen was placed on the front row and the priest greeted them while they watched at home on their tablets. She remembers: “The funny thing is that even if some had memory problems, they knew all the lyrics. That is the power of music and made me see that if there’s a concert, we should be there.” Neighbouring city Espoo is also exploring remote care. By 2027, 8% of its population will be over 75. Roope Leppänen, medical director of Espoo hospital, admits that there aren’t the resources to deal with the increase. “We see remote care as a possibility. We are only starting but will expand these services quite rapidly in the coming years,” he says. However, he maintains that remote care will never fully replace physical care but that, with advancing technology and future generations that are used to digital life, it will become more and more important. But he doesn’t expect it to totally replace physical care services. “People will need physical visits as well. It’s my belief that [remote care] can’t completely replace that, but tech will make [things] even easier in 10 years time.” Both the staff and patients I meet seem to like it. Tiina Kosonen, a remote care nurse, says she is able to build close relationships with her clients. “I like it and the patients get a lot from it. It’s really intensive this contact. We look into each other’s eyes and talk together face to face.” One of her clients, 86-year-old Raimo Uimonen, who has epilepsy and lives alone says: “I get a feeling of security from this service. I also like to talk. This video contact is really important as I get this face-to-face contact and the opportunity to discuss things.” Leppänen adds: “I’ve been on home care visits. You come into a person’s house, take your coat off and sort of intrude. Of course there are some instances where you need to be there, but if we can increase contact with the patient [surely that’s a good thing]?” So could this type of service take off in the UK, where the number of people aged 65 and over is set to increase by more than 40% over the next 20 years? Claire Turner, director of evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better, believes so. “If you can remotely check in on somebody, see how they are, remind them of medication, that feels like a good and practical solution [as it] enables more time for home visits for people who need physical support,” she says. She adds: “Social contact is the stuff of life. That’s what is important to us as human beings and it doesn’t change as we get older. If part of the goal of this is to encourage people to have more contact with others who share interests or values, than that’s a good thing.” Sarah Johnson’s visit to Helsinki was supported by Business Finland",

    "transcript": "A teenage poet from Nigeria, a reggae singer from Sierra Leona and a Colombian dancer were among those competing in Sicily this weekend in a UN-backed talent show aimed at reshaping the narrative around migrants. Refugees Got Talent, the first event of its kind to be held on an international level, featured dozens of people seeking shelter from war-torn countries, as well as victims of human trafficking. This weekend, 13 finalists showed off their skills in Catania, performing songs, music, art and theatre in front of a judging panel that included the British actor Douglas Booth. “This is more than just a talent show,” said Marco Rotunno, a press officer in Sicily for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), which supported the event alongside 20 other aid groups. “The things we need to thrive in life – confidence, pride, friends, community and hope – are all experienced by the contestants and all those involved.” The winner was an 18-year-old Nigerian poet, Hannah Imordi, who read a work titled The Journey, dedicated to those who doubt refugees have justified reasons for leaving their home countries. “I am so happy”, she said. “Making it to the finals was not as important to me as having the opportunity to state in poetry that millions of people are forced to leave their countries because of war, poverty or religion. We need to help these people attain their dreams or simply reach a happy ending in their lives. We need to embrace them, not cast them away. Before we change the world, we should begin to change ourselves.” Her poem included the lines: “In this different city, I look for protection. In this different world, I look for acceptance. In this different culture, am trying to adapt to, I seek help. What does tomorrow holds for me?” Among the finalists were a 23-year-old reggae singer from Sierra Leone, whose stage name is Mr 705 and who arrived in Sicily from Libya, and a 37-year-old professional dancer from Colombia, Darwin Medrano, who is one of Colombia’s 8 million displaced people. “Seeing the talent here is a powerful reminder that refugees are people like all others – unique and talented with a lot to offer the world,” Rotunno said. All of the performing artists have lived through traumatic experiences. Many of them arrived in Italy as minors via Libya, where they suffered torture, abuse and violence. Others are victims of human trafficking, lured into leaving their homes with the promise of dignified work and then forced into prostitution or slavery. “All of them have experienced terrible trauma,” said Rotunno. “But we wanted to avoid dwelling on that for this event. This is precisely the point of this contest: to show that refugees, despite their dramatic stories, are men and women like the rest of us, each one with a talent that can enrich our world. “Art and music helps all humans express themselves all over the world. For refugees – who have lost so much – it’s no different. The opportunity to sing, dance and perform can be a welcome escape from reality and help confront difficult emotions.” Francesco Patanè, the event’s artistic director, said: “We wanted to show that migrants and refugees are skilled and talented people who are contributing to make our countries a better place as much as the Italians did or still do when they moved to other countries.” From dance parties to food festivals and urban hikes, millions of people around the world have taken part in events over the weekend to celebrate Thursday’s World Refugee Day, at a time when record numbers of children, women and men have been uprooted by war and persecution. This week, the UNHCR published its annual global trends report, which showed the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide had risen to more than 70 million by the end of 2018, the highest in the organisation’s history. In a video address, the UN refugee chief, Filippo Grandi, said restrictions introduced by some countries had limited access to asylum and hindered efforts to rescue drowning refugees. The Italian and Maltese governments have closed seaports to NGO rescue vessels. According to data from the UN and the International Organization for Migration, about 3,200 people have reached Italy and Malta from north Africa since the beginning of 2019, and almost 350 have died en route.",

    "transcript": "In May we asked you: what are the alternatives to endless economic growth? Dozens of you got in touch with tips and suggestions. And so we persuaded the Guardian economics correspondent Richard Partington to try to make sense of it all by taking a good hard look at GDP and the alternatives. His conclusion: GDP is an anachronism, but it’ll take a major systemic upheaval to shift over to a more nuanced measure of progress. Coincidentally, the alternatives to GDP were also the subject of the latest Reasons to be Cheerful podcast by Ed Miliband and Geoff Lloyd. Perhaps a better metric would be the number of trees planted annually. It’s a figure in the billions, as Patrick Barkham discovered, and a number that is also growing strongly. Will it be enough? After all, trees are not just good for the environment, they are good for mental health too, as Harriet Sherwood learned. Lucky numbers Alcohol sales in Scotland have fallen to their lowest level in 25 years. Alcohol-free beers are among the fastest-growing beverages in Germany. Among the world’s poorest communities, more than 2 billion people gained access to a decent toilet in the first two decades of this century. And among the richest, Americans gave almost half a trillion dollars to charity in 2018. What we liked In stories about ageing, these glorious centenarians, featured by Positive News, are an example to us all. We also loved this Atlantic article on how to deal with life after you’ve peaked professionally, particularly because it includes the great quote: “Unhappy is he who depends on success to be happy.” What we heard Kostas Karoubas emailed in from Greece to share his experience with reforesting in arid terrains. Reforestation in tropical climates is “easy” (relatively)! Planting and rehabilitating arid zones becomes more difficult. Here is my experience over the last 16 years, and I hope it will be helpful. Aminul Hoque Chowdhury got in touch from Bangladesh. We are the Green Ukhiya Star Team, a team of volunteers gathered as part of relief operations during the Rohingya influx in Cox’s Bazar. To compensate the great disaster and protect the environment we are planting 1 million trees. It is essential to gradually bring back vegetation cover in this area for an adaptable living condition for the displaced Rohingya people while they stay in their temporary shelters and also for the local host people. We need your kind consideration to promote our initiative towards a global audience.

    "transcript": "When Clare Dubois’s car skidded on an icy road in Stroud, Gloucestershire, a tree prevented her vehicle tumbling into a ravine. It was, she says, a sign. Humanity is nearing a precipice. Trees can stop us going over the edge. This calling was so strong that Dubois, a business life coach, founded TreeSisters with a friend, Bernadette Ryder, to take on a daunting mission: to reforest the tropics within a decade. In 2014, their new charity funded its first 12,000 trees by encouraging western women to make small monthly donations to reforestation projects in the tropics. Today TreeSisters is planting 2.2m trees (average cost: 33p a tree) each year across Madagascar, India, Kenya, Nepal, Brazil and Cameroon. “We have to make it as natural to give back to nature as it is to take nature for granted,” Dubois says, musing on the need to “shift from a consumer species to a restorer species”. She is not alone. The global elite is embracing tree-hugging rhetoric. It is as if the world has suddenly woken up to the restorative powers of plants. Forests can stop runaway global heating, encourage rainfall, guarantee clean water, reduce air pollution, and provide livelihoods for local people and reserves for rare wildlife. Politicians are waking up to the potential of “natural climate solutions” – reforestation and other ecological restoration – to capture carbon and tackle the climate crisis. Such solutions could provide 37% of the greenhouse gas mitigation required to provide a good chance of stabilising global heating below the critical 2C threshold. In March the United Nations announced a Decade of Ecosystem Restoration and has set a target to restore 350m hectares – an area bigger than India – by 2030. India itself has pledged to plant 13m hectares of forest by 2020, Latin America is aiming at 20m hectares and African countries 100m hectares by 2030. China’s aspiration is to plant an area of forest as large as Ireland every year. Trees are increasingly hailed as a solution for climate-stressed cities too, preventing overheating and reducing air pollution. In England, more than 130,000 trees are to be planted in towns and cities over the next two years. But it isn’t as simple as just grabbing seeds and saplings and sticking them in the ground. Non-native plantations can cause problems for biodiversity, local livelihoods – or both. Grand pledges aren’t always met. Dubois is only “vaguely heartened” by the new mood. She points out that a 2014 UN declaration pledged to halve deforestation by 2020. Instead, record deforestation ensued and in 2018 an area of primary forest the size of Belgium was lost, the third-highest annual depletion since records began in 2001. Technology – such as tree-planting by drone – is often hailed as a game changer, but it can be hit-and-miss. “Everybody thinks that smarter technology is going to save us,” says Dubois. “A significant amount of the materials required to be mined for that smarter technology are under the last remaining old-growth forests.” TreeSisters refuses to use drones, “because we’re all about the relationship between people and trees”, says Dubois. “It’s the disconnect between people and trees that drives deforestation. We need people connected with forests.” TreeSisters’ philosophy is different: local, community-based reforestation with native trees in the tropics. “The tropical forest belt provides cooling and rainfall,” says Dubois. “It’s part of the delivery system for a habitable climate for all of us.” In Madagascar, the charity is helping Eden Reforestation Projects replant lost mangrove and dry deciduous forests on the north-west coast. Mangroves are a wonder-tree for local and global ecosystem services; they protect human communities from coastal floods but also filterriver flows out to sea and prevent soil washing into the ocean and destroying coral reefs. They are also crucial nurseries for juvenile fish. Most importantly, perhaps, studies suggest they can sequester four times more carbon than rainforest. Between 2000 and 2015, the equivalent of Brazil’s annual carbon emissions was released by the destruction of mangrove forests. Eden employs local people to gather and plant mature propagules from mangroves. These seedlings usually fall from the tree and stick straight in the mud or float away until they reach another shore and grow. The mangrove-planters also clear debris from the forest because logs and debris shifted by the currents can destroy seedlings. (The debris is piled in particular spots so it creates wildlife habitat.) At most planting sites, the two-week tide cycle contains a six-day window when planters can canoe into the mangroves, plant propagules and catch the outgoing tide before they get stranded on the mudflats at low tide. “Our goal is twofold: reforestation and poverty alleviation,” says Jamie Shattenberg, international director of Eden Reforestation Projects, Madagascar. “If you’re going to do reforestation and you ignore the human issue – poverty – it’s difficult to find success, because the forest is what people turn to last if they have no other sustainable livelihood.” In the project’s first year, eight people planted 100,000 mangroves. Now Eden employs more than 1,000 people to plant trees, with 225m new mangrove trees planted since 2006. Some Malagasy planters were enslaved to local fish barons because they owed money for using their fishing equipment; tree-planting income has enabled them to repay their debts and escape this bondage. Restoring coastal mangroves is not simple. Eden plants mainly on government and community land along the coast, with the support of local villages. Most mangrove is no-man’s land but people still claim rights to establish shrimp farms or raid forests for timber for building and charcoal. “The thing that’s really now destroying them is charcoal,” says Shattenberg. “Once a mangrove forest is cut down it takes generations to refill, the mud starts eroding and kills the reef and a negative cycle starts. We’ve had areas tree-poached, and we’ve put guards in. Charcoal is a constant problem, and you can’t change it overnight because so much of Madagascar relies on charcoal for their cooking. It’s like telling England and France ‘no more gas’. You have to find a different source of fuel and make it affordable.” Then there is a “charcoal mafia”: “You get in the way of charcoal directly and you’re in the way of people’s money and people don’t like that.” Shattenberg is optimistic, however, about visible changes to the environment – and consciousness. “Massive areas are starting to come back and the Malagasy are seeing changes in the fish, crab and wildlife populations. We’re seeing a change in how people feel about the forest. They recognise they can protect it. It’s for Madagascar, for the Malagasy people and it’s for the future of our world.” A similar emphasis on reforestation for local people is driving the restoration of deforested Mount Kenya. TreeSisters is working with the International Tree Foundation (ITF), a charity founded in 1924 by a visionary forester in colonial Kenya called Richard St Barbe Baker. The charity was originally called Men of the Trees. Now it is supporting reforestation led by local women. “One of the very clear learnings we’ve had is that the more you can work with local organisations that are women-led or driven by women, the better your results,” says Paul Laird, programmes manager at the ITF. “It is the women’s groups that really drive and motivate, and men are often pleased to have women running it.” Kenya is water-stressed, and dependent on seasonal rains for its water supply. Forest cover can influence rainfall and local humidity and temperature, as well as filter water. The country’s current forest cover is a meagre 7% at best; Kenya’s constitution commits to increasing it to 10%. Kenya has also signed the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) commitment to restore 5.1m hectares of degraded land in Kenya. But such targets are not yet creating much traction on the ground, according to Laird. Below Mount Kenya is a circle of humid montane forest. Google Earth reveals it is decidedly patchy. “What happened to the forest? The 20th century happened to the forest,” says Laird. The colonial regime harvested native forest and replaced it with eucalyptus and pine plantations – non-native monocultures that are “a killer in terms of biodiversity”, according to Laird. After independence, commercial gangs took timber and both rich and poor turned forest into farmland. The ITF is supporting local charities such as Mount Kenya Environmental Conservation to work with local women to establish small nurseries of native trees at the forest fringe. The sales of these tree seedlings provide the groups with an income, which is then distributed as loans to help women’s farms and businesses. Native trees are planted directly into deforested areas, while a new scheme enables local people to temporarily grow potatoes in reforested areas, the cultivation helping native trees grow free of weeds for their first few years. The women also grow high-value grafted trees such as avocado and macadamia nut on their own burgeoning agro-forestry farms. “Women are the primary caretakers of the household and know their reliance on a healthy forest,” says the Nairobi-based Teresa Gitonga of the ITF. “They are the people who look for firewood, they are the people who cook so they also look for water. Women are change agents. The only thing they need is to unlock their potential and know that planting trees will make their lives better.” According to Anastacia Njoki, a member of a tree-planting group close to Mount Kenya, she and her fellow agro-foresters share experiences, as well as sing together. “We are doing it because we are the ones who have to collect the firewood. Instead of cutting a large tree, we are collecting dead wood,” she says. But she recognises the wider benefits of trees to the region and Kenya itself. “The trees that we are planting are indigenous and we as a community are benefiting in one way or another to conserve our ecosystem and maintain the areas where our water is coming from,” she says. Mount Kenya’s forests, she says, make it their “water tower”. In western countries, TreeSisters continues to raise awareness of a feminine way of responding to ecological crises and climate change, and the need to balance consumption with restoration. Dubois wants to embed restoration into every financial transaction: in other words, everything we buy must also include “a kickback to nature”. “Extinction Rebellion has blasted through collective denial and there’s suddenly a longing for solutions,” says Dubois. “We’re saying: ‘Let’s not wait for the government, we the people are the solution and can drive massive change.’ We’re talking about how we can move from rebellion to restoration.” It may be difficult to measure how awareness is raised, but perhaps it can be guided by the straightforward measurement that is planting trees. As Dubois puts it: “It’s tangible, it’s simple, it’s life-giving.” • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/germans-thirsty-for-alcohol-free-beer-as-brewers-boost-taste",
    "date": "2019-06-14",
    "transcript": "During last year’s sweltering summer in Europe, workers of the Störtebeker beer brewery stood at the doors of the bottle depot eagerly awaiting the empty returns so they could be washed and refilled as quickly as possible. A bottle shortage swept the country due to the rate at which beer was being consumed to quench the overheated nation’s thirst. But it wasn’t the demand for their classic range of beers that surprised the brewery bosses most, rather the rate at which its alcohol-free varieties were being drunk. “Sales were 40% up on the previous year,” says Elisa Raus of Störtebeker. “We literally could not produce it as fast as it was being drunk.” Founded in 1827, Störtebeker, which is in the northern port city of Stralsund on Germany’s Baltic coast and built its reputation as a purveyor to holidaying royals, boasts no fewer than three non-alcoholic varieties among its considerable range of beers. Bernstein, a wheat beer, came out in 2007, then followed Frei, an isotonic pils, and the most recent, Atlantic Ale, last August. Its brewers are working on a fourth in their subterranean testing lab, but the details of that are secret. According to the German Association of Brewers (DBB), now as many as one in 15 beers of the estimated annual 6.2 million hectolitres consumed in Germany contains no alcohol. This is being put down to an increase in health awareness as well as an improvement in the quality of a beverage with a reputation for being flat and tasteless, typically drunk only out of necessity. “It’s no longer considered shameful to ask for an alcohol-free beer,” says Marc Oliver Huhnholz of the DBB. “On the contrary, it seems it’s even becoming something of an accepted lifestyle drink and the stigma is more or less gone.” Germany’s 1,500 breweries, he says, now produce between 400 to 500 alcohol-free varieties of beer, with new ones emerging all the time as the brands compete to improve taste, head and consistency. The growth in their popularity has even gone some way to stem a year-on-year fall in standard beer sales. Improvements in both taste and variety and the fact that most bars in Germany will stock at least one type, says Huhnholz, “means that people are increasing enjoying alcohol-free beers out of choice”. Alcohol-free types contain, like conventional beer, water, malt, hops and yeast and are brewed according to Germany’s 16th century purity law. The two most widely recognised brewing methods are an arrested or limited fermentation process and vacuum distillation. In the first, the fermentation process is stopped with a cold shock before the alcohol content is able to rise above 0.5%. This is how Störtebeker’s Bernstein is produced. In the second, which applies to the Frei and Atlantic, after the completed fermentation process, the beer flows through a closed system and evaporates, with vacuum enabling the ethanol to boil off at a lower temperature. The flavour from the alcohol vapour is added back into the beer to retain its hoppy flavour. Christopher Puttnies, chief brewer at Störtebeker, proudly shows off his gleaming Entalkoholisierungsanlage or de-alcoholisation facility, a 500-metre sea of twisting stainless steel pipes. It’s part of the brewery’s recent multimillion-euro investment programme and, says Puttnies, a reflection of its long-term commitment to alcohol-free varieties, which now make up one in 10 of the brewery’s sales. “We evaporate it as slowly as possible so as to retain the taste as best we can – there’s a lot of technical fine-tuning involved,” he says. This way just 10 hectolitres of beer can be produced an hour, compared to 100 hectolitres for conventional beer. The factory turns out 50,000 half litre bottles of alcohol-free beer a day in addition to 450,000 bottles of its other beers. Factory workers are allowed to drink the non-alcoholic beers as a refreshment during working hours. Increasingly, says Puttnies, the younger ones in particular even drink it off-duty at home. “It’s a far cry from the days when you wouldn’t be seen dead drinking a non-alcoholic beer,” he adds, recalling the first of its kind which was invented in communist East Germany in the early 1970s by a Berlin brewer. It was called AuBi (Auto Bier). “It was like dish water,” Puttnies says. The number of German bars that are increasingly stocking one or more types of alcohol-free beer is on the rise. Only in Spain is the interest in it as high as in Germany. Though not everyone is convinced. On Stralsund’s market square, where children seek relief from the mid-afternoon heat in a fountain, Peter Röscher sips a 5% ABV Weizen or wheat beer. The pensioner admits he has never been interested in trying new types of alcohol-free beer, having only ever drunk it “now and then” over the past two decades, “out of necessity, when I had to drive somewhere or had to get up early for work. I’ve always found it pretty thin and tasteless”. His wife, Ellen, wonders what the point is. “You might as well drink water if you’re not going to drink the real thing,” she says. But Rachel Hundt, sitting outside Cafe am Markt drawing on a non-alcoholic pils from a Bavarian brewery, says: “It’s just what I want in this heat. I like the slightly bitter taste and it might be psychological, but I get a buzz. I suppose it’s from the hops.” Bianca Kison, a waiter, says: “I’d estimate that every fourth beer I sell these days is non-alcoholic. That’s a big change even from two, three years ago. Men, women, young, old, even kids like to sip it. There’s no typical customer.”",

There are, of course, dozens of countries where these civilised rules do not apply, so it was heartening to note a small flurry of cases this week in which individual freedom defeated social oppression. First, Russia, a country where it is easy to find justice spiralling away from you if you fall foul of the wrong people. The journalist Ivan Golunov looked like becoming the latest victim – until a rare national outpouring of solidarity reminded the authorities that injustice can be dangerous for those who mete it out too. Botswana has little in common with Russia, apart from a lot of diamonds and a lingering prejudice against homosexuality. But this week, as Jason Burke reported, judges ruled that laws criminalising same-sex relations should be struck down. And while we are talking about LGBT rights, Ecuador legalised same-sex marriage, and Amrit Dhillon caught up with the inspiring Indian Olympian blazing a trail for homosexuality in a conservative country. It is not all plain sailing, however, as the situations in Hong Kong, Hungary, Sudan and Ethiopia demonstrated this week … Lucky numbers There were more encouraging environment statistics showing the UK used less fossil fuel than ever to power its energy grid this winter. And a big Thomson Reuters report found growing numbers of people are moving to trustworthy news brands because of concerns about information bandits, charlatans and fakers. What we liked The marathon runner saved by strangers on the finishing line. And also on the subject of rescuing people, the simple school multiple choice questionnaire that saved vulnerable children. What we heard There was a flurry of responses to Stephen Burgen’s article about the Spanish restaurant served exclusively by people with disabilities. Leslie Yerington pointed out the work of the Lucy Foundation, a social enterprise – named after a false leg - that tries to empower and include people with all kinds of disabilities. Georgie Cottini wrote about the work of Beresford Street Kitchen in Jersey, which provides training and employment for people with learning disabilities and autism.

    "transcript": "Buses, coaches, trams and trains will be a bit chattier than usual on Friday as a day-long experiment to encourage travellers to talk to strangers is rolled out on Britain’s transport network. Commuters on West Coast Virgin trains will find every coach C is designated a “chat carriage”, while bus company Arriva is placing “conversation starter” cards on vehicles servicing their UK network. Transport for London, Greater Anglia and the Go Ahead Group are also all taking part, with posters at three London tube stations encouraging people to talk to staff. Counsellors trained by the charity Relate will ply London buses as part of an initiative with Greener Journeys, encouraging passengers to open up. National Express said it would invite people to take part in “some stimulating activities” on Birmingham’s number 11 route, the longest urban bus route in Europe. The series of initiatives, orchestrated by a BBC team focused on solutions journalism, is designed to combat two of the most toxic issues of the age: polarisation and isolation. Emily Kasriel, a BBC editor behind the project, said the aim was “to encourage people who are up for it to get out of their comfort zone and emerge from their screens to interact with the adult sitting next to them”. “Many people are reluctant to talk to strangers, but perhaps someone is battling loneliness and an exchange could provide a meaningful moment that changes their day,” said Kasriel, the head of the BBC’s Crossing Divides season, which seeks to combat antagonism through conversation. “Everyone has an interesting story to tell. These chance encounters can provoke a new way of looking at the world, and an opportunity to understand someone else’s story.” Though typical commuter behaviour these days might involve inserting earbuds and avoiding all and any interaction with fellow travellers, research indicates that those who do open up to strangers tend to feel happier as a result. In a 2014 study led by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago, the authors wrote: “Connecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other.” In a blogpost for the BBC, Epley wrote that one reason why a sudden conversation might improve a day is that “the experience of talking with others and hearing a stranger’s voice makes us realise they have a rich inner life of thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences, just like us”. He added: “These brief connections with strangers are not likely to turn a life of misery into one of bliss. However, they can change unpleasant moments – like the grind of a daily commute – into something more pleasant.” Not everyone agrees.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/ingredient-changing-fortunes-alaska-seaweed-kelp",
    "date": "2019-06-11",
    "transcript": "While farmers in much of the US spend the late spring patiently waiting for their crops to mature, a small band of sea farmers have taken to the cold ocean waters of Alaska to harvest the state’s newest cash crop: kelp. Huge demand for seaweed, hauled up in slimy green bunches from the Pacific Ocean, has kickstarted an industry that existed as a mere fantasy only five years ago. “There’s lot of interest in sustainability,” says Beau Perry, head of Blue Evolution, a California-based company at the centre of Alaska’s nascent seaweed boom. “As we deal with climate change and the movement towards plant-based diets, all of those trends play towards seaweed being a new sort of star ingredient.” In recent years, farmers in Alaska have begun growing sugar kelp and ribbon kelp – two species that occur naturally in the ecosystem of remote communities like Kodiak and Ketchikan. With a $6bn (£4.7bn) global market for seaweed, residents are hopeful that kelp farming is a sustainable way to cultivate – and harvest – the coveted aquatic plant. “There’s huge potential in Alaska. There’s so much space and it really fills an interesting niche,” says Alf Pryor, co-owner of Kodiak Kelp Company. “There’s a lot of potential for tons of different kinds of products … [I] see it taking off pretty quickly.” A career salmon fisherman, Pryor along with his wife, Lexa Meyer, were drawn into the kelp business recently as a way to supplement their income. But interest in kelp farming is now so intense that Pryor believes a new farmer might have to wait up to three years for the necessary permits. Unlike in other parts of the world, where wild kelp is harvested by ships, Alaska’s aquatic plants are grown by farmers in a months-long process, which begins in the dead of winter. After Pryor and Meyer find roughly 50 plants they consider ideal for breeding, the wild kelp samples are sent to a facility run by Blue Evolution. The company extracts spores from the kelp and grows seedlings on pieces of string known as “seed pipes”. These pipes are given to farmers, who then wind the string along long ropes, which dangle from a free-floating frame in the ocean. Over a six-month period, the spores mature before they are harvested in late spring. Pryor’s experience as a gill-net fisherman helped him to switch to mariculture, including redesigning a 25ft skiff to harvest kelp more efficiently. Even with his technical knowledge, he’s found that farming requires constant vigilance, including a sharp eye for drifting rafts of bull kelp, rogue groupings of wild seaweed that can crash into the ropes of young kelp and tangle into the plants. “It’s kind of a constant battle, trying to keep stuff out of the farm,” says Pryor, who monitors the young plants once a week over the winter with his team. In early May, the couple harvested nearly 200,000 pounds of kelp from their operation, which spans 18 acres and uses nearly 50,000 feet of rope – one of the largest hauls of kelp in the history of Alaska. Blue Evolution hopes to buy “at least 50 tonnes” of seaweed from farmers like Pryor and Meyer, says Perry – a five-fold increase on the company’s purchase last year, and a figure he hopes to double next year. The plant is of particular interest as studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of seaweed in animal feed as a way of reducing methane emissions. It is also being tested for properties that can mimic fossil fuels or plastics. In coastal towns like Kodiak, where the fishing industry is the main employer and incomes are seasonal, the burgeoning kelp farming industry is seen as a way for families to find work during slow periods. “For small coastal communities, [seaweed farming] could be a big deal,” says Pryor. “Just from the farm that we did this year, we put between 30 and 40 people to work.” Alaska’s experiment with kelp is nothing new: each year, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of seaweed are harvested around the world, with China and Japan leading global exports. But in recent months, the harvesting of wild plants has been dogged by controversy. In summer 2018, the proposed wide-scale harvest of wild kelp led to a fierce row in Scotland, where environmental groups say the dredging of kelp forests could cause irreparable harm to marine life off the coastline because the plants play such a crucial role in preserving a healthy ecosystem. In Alaska, companies are required to follow strict government rules on cultivation: strains of seaweed crops, taken from wild plants, must be grown within 50km of the source plant. This ensures genetic strength and diversity are maintained, says Perry, with salmon hatcheries in the state following similarly strict guidelines. On the whole, any environmental damage from the cultivation of farmed seaweed – which requires wild plants be picked for spore extraction – appears to be “minimal”, says Matthew Bracken, an associate professor of biology at the University of California Irvine. “Kelp have major benefits for the environment both naturally growing and growing in these cultures,” says Bracken. “When the sun is shining, [kelp plants] are going to absorb carbon dioxide from the water … And given increases in [carbon dioxide] concentrations in the ocean generally, this is a good thing.” Because seaweed is seen as a tool for mitigating the damaging impacts of ocean acidification, Perry believes the product is good for the environment – and for business. But for Bracken, the surge in cultivation also highlights major advances in understanding the life cycle of a kelp, which has long mystified researchers. “It’s not like plants where you just put seeds in the ground. They have a complex life. You have to really understand that well and be able to then magnify it,” says Bracken. “It can teach us a lot about how life works.”",

    "transcript": "The first thing that strikes you is the calm, the light, the modern art on the walls – and then of course the food. It’s only later that you realise there is something different, and a little special, about Universo Santi, a restaurant in the southern Spanish city of Jerez. “People don’t come here because the staff are disabled but because it’s the best restaurant in the area. Whatever reason they came for, the talking is about the food,” says Antonio Vila. Vila is the president of the Fundación Universo Accesible, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to helping people with disabilities join the mainstream workforce. He has also been the driving force behind Universo Santi, the haute cuisine restaurant whose 20 employees all have some form of disability. “I always wanted to show what people with disabilities, given the right training, were capable of,” says Vila, who is a senior manager at DKV insurance. “They were not represented in the world of haute cuisine. Universo Santi has broken through that barrier.” The 20 staff, whose ages range from 22 to 62, were recruited from an original list of 1,500. To qualify, applicants had to be unemployed and have more than 35% disability. “I feel really lucky to be part of this,” says Gloria Bazán, head of human resources, who has cerebral palsy. “It’s difficult to work when society just sees you as someone with a handicap. This has given me the opportunity to be independent and to participate like any other human being.” Alejandro Giménez, 23, has Down’s syndrome and is a commis chef. “It’s given me the chance to become independent doing something I’ve loved since I was a kid,” says Giménez, who lived with his mother until he was recruited. “Working here has transformed my life. So many things I used to ask my mother to do, I do myself. I didn’t even know how to take a train by myself because I’d just miss my stop.” A recent guest chef was Joan Roca of El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world. Giménez said he was not daunted at coming under Roca’s orders. “I’m not afraid of anything. The only thing I’m afraid of is not knowing something. I always want to learn and here I’m learning from the very best.” Universo Santi may soon have a star in the Michelin firmament as the Michelin Guide people have already sampled the menu which, at €60 (£53), is less than half the price of a typical menú de degustación. “Of course they didn’t introduce themselves but we knew who they were,” says Almudena Merlo, the maître d’. While few are as gastronomically ambitious as Universo Santi, there are several other projects across Europe where catering is giving disabled people a new lease of life. One is La Fourchette de Collserola in Barcelona, which is staffed by 20 people with a range of physical and mental disabilities. The cuisine is Mediterranean, with vegan and kosher options. In 2010 Brownies&amp;downieS launched in the Dutch town of Veghel as a café run by people with Down’s syndrome and other disabilities. It was so successful that the venture became a franchise, with 53 branches in the Netherlands, Belgium and South Africa. Another similar project is the One Eighty Restaurant in Portadown, Northern Ireland, which was established in 2011 and trains 16- to 22-year-olds with learning difficulties to work in the hospitality business. The Jerez restaurant takes its name from Santi Santamaria, chef at the Michelin three-star Can Fabes in Catalonia until his sudden death in 2011. Can Fabes closed shortly afterwards but his family wanted to carry on his name and culinary tradition and were keen to support the Jerez project. The family’s enthusiasm attracted the attention of Spain’s top chefs, among them Martín Berasategui, Roca and Ángel León, all of whom have contributed recipes and their time as guest chefs at the restaurant. Disciples of Santamaria helped establish the kitchen, whose equipment was transferred in its entirely from Can Fabes, and several of the dishes on the menu de degustación are Santamaria originals. Since it opened in October 2017, Universo Santi continues to win plaudits for its cuisine. Speaking at the restaurant, Roca said cooking was about humanity and was a way of integrating people. “It gives me great satisfaction to see it realised in a project such as this,” he said.

    "title": "Eiffel Tower revamp to turn roads into garden in heart of Paris",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/eiffel-tower-revamp-to-turn-roads-into-garden-in-heart-of-paris",
    "date": "2019-06-07",
    "transcript": "A garden stretches for a mile, free of cars with one of the world’s most recognisable monuments at its centre. Crossing the river on a tree-lined and lawned bridge, the roar of traffic has been replaced by the sound of water from fountains. Such is the vision for the Eiffel Tower, which is at the centre of a major makeover project to transform one of Paris’s most visited districts. At the heart of the revamp is a pedestrian-friendly plan to create the city’s largest garden. The landscape design, drawn up by a London-based company, will also turn a nearby bridge, the Pont d’Iéna, into a grassy, tree-lined walkway linking riverside gardens either side of the Seine with pools, fountains and mini-parks. The first stage of the project, financed by the company that operates the Eiffel Tower, should be completed by 2024 in time for the Olympics. It is the latest element in a concerted campaign led by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to reduce the number of vehicles in the French capital. Hidalgo, who faces re-election in 2020, has already closed long stretches of both riverside highways to vehicles. She has also revamped seven of the city’s major squares, restricting roads and giving more space to pedestrians, cyclists and scooters. She says she wants Paris to become a city “where you can let go of your child’s hand”. “We’re really aiming for a high pedestrian target. We’re going to have a splendid garden where we can hear the birds sing,” she said when she announced the Eiffel Tower project last month. “It’s a place that will become a space for walking, strolling and breathing … Nature will take its place once more alongside this exceptional heritage.” Mary Bowman, of Gustafson Porter + Bowman, which won a competition to redesign the area around the Eiffel Tower, said the aim was to unify the site from the Trocadéro to the École Militaire via the Palais de Chaillot, the Pont d’Iéna and the Champ de Mars to create a “biodiverse corridor”. “This is a fantastic project to be working on as a landscape architect. The iconic nature of the site make it a once-in-a-lifetime chance for us, and an honour and privilege,” Bowman told the Guardian. The Eiffel Tower has about 7 million visitors a year, though many millions more go to stand and look at the Dame de Fer, one of the most recognisable symbols in the world and an object of engineering beauty. The area around it, however, is less inspiring, comprising busy highways and the neat but soulless Champ de Mars, which has never quite shaken off its former use as a military parade ground. The project plans to surround the tower with a mix of picturesque gardens and what the designers call “hard plazas” that could be used for a variety of public events throughout the year. “Paris is the name of the climate agreement and to have a 54-hectare site in the middle of it that can show how one can begin to create a more green space in the heart of a major city and have it available and accessible to everyone, not just millions of tourists, is fantastic,” Bowman said. “One of the things Anne Hidalgo mentioned about four of the shortlisted schemes was that they reinforced the idea of creating a pedestrian site so you could have this connection between the right and left banks. There is a phased approach. Creating pedestrian areas was a very strong part of our project. “We would like to restrict private cars and turn it back to nature, but we are just beginning to enter into a period of discussions with the city and the traffic people about how that can be done.” The Pont d’Iéna would be covered with lawns and the pavements either side would be turned into passages for public transport and emergency vehicles. The project includes the creation of facilities for tourists to drop off luggage in front of the Eiffel Tower. The second stage, which will begin after the 2024 Olympics, is expected to be completed by 2030. A public consultation has opened into the €72m (£64m) project and work is due to start at the end of next year or the beginning of 2021. The lobby group 40 Million Motorists, however, has accused Hidalgo of wanting to turn Paris into a “museum city” after she announced plans to turn the four central arrondissements into a “restricted zone” for cars. “Paris is not a museum. It is an economic heartland, where millions of people come, sometimes from far away, to work every day and need to do so easily … where will the mayor’s obsession with eradicating cars end?” it said in a statement. It said the pedestrianisation of swathes of the city did not improve air quality but pushed pollution elsewhere. “All of this is just ideology,” it added. Jean-Louis Missika, a Paris deputy mayor, said that city hall was determined to press ahead with schemes to reduce road traffic. He said cars took up half the public space, but only 13% of journeys were made in them and most spent 95% of their time in garages or parking spaces. “All we’re doing is rebalancing the public space given to cars,” he said. Missika said the city was working on introducing a car-sharing scheme following on from its pioneering bike rental scheme, Vélib’, and more recently, electric scooters. “We have a lack of green spaces in Paris, which is a very dense city,” he said, adding that city hall aimed to create more public spaces from tens of thousands of square metres currently used for parking. He said initial public reactions to the Eiffel Tower project were encouraging. “People seem to like it. A lot.” Bowman added: “It’s a fantastic project also for raising the profile of landscape architects who should be leading the climate debate.”",

    "date": "2019-06-05",
    "transcript": "By the time the teenage boy was standing in front of Bernice Bornmai, feverish and delirious, it was already too late. It wasn’t just the malaria that was killing the 17-year-old, it was the time he’d wasted taking fake medicine. The antimalarials did nothing to stop the disease marching through the young Ghanaian’s body: his organs were already shutting down. “He died waiting to be taken to a larger teaching hospital for dialysis,” Dr Bornmai told the Guardian, from the small hospital in Accra where she works as a senior medical officer. “It was one of my saddest cases, but I have lost other patients who would have survived because of fake medicines too.” It’s not just ineffective malaria medication that can prove fatal. Bornmai’s patients have sometimes taken counterfeit antibiotics that not only don’t fight the illness but also increase bacterial resistance to effective medicines. “Sometimes I just throw up my hands when I see the results showing which antibiotics have a chance of working – often they will be not readily available or too expensive,” the doctor says. “It makes my work frustrating, and it means patients have to stay here longer while I investigate.” When it comes to trying to stop fake medicines getting into the hands of sick patients, experts describe a difficult task where they are constantly trying to stay one step ahead of counterfeiters. Law enforcement and legislation is needed, strong pharmaceutical regulation has to be in place and well-trained healthcare professionals are essential, explains Cynthia Genolet, an Africa policy expert at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. “You can’t focus on one specific dimension to be successful in this fight – it has to be a holistic effort,” she says. Genolet is a member of Fight the Fakes, a campaign group launched in 2010 to raise awareness of the problem among pharmacists and industry. One tool campaigners hope will have an impact is the harnessing of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, which have the potential to help in dealing with the complexity of the task at hand. A handful of new startups are focusing on tracing medications on blockchain-type technologies, as well as arming consumers with instant information about what they’ve bought. The Nigerian start-up RxAll, for instance, has created a handheld scanner that can assess the compound of a drug in real time. The device connects to a cloud-based database of information of what the drugs should contain, which then feeds back that information. “The information collected is a spectral signature of the drug, and once checked, the database sends back information to an app on your phone,” explains Adebayo Alonge, one of the co-founders. The vast information database is updated using an artificial intelligence algorithm. “The app also shows you the other parts of your city that the drug has been tested in, meaning you can see where bad patches and bad suppliers are,” says Alonge. Alonge and his colleagues launched Rxall last October and have been rolling it out in countries including Ghana, Cambodia and Kenya. It has been in use commercially in Myanmar and has been sold to a large Nigerian teaching hospital and to Nigeria’s National Agency for Food &amp; Drug Administration and Control, whose officials have started training to use it. It’s a personal cause for Alonge, who nearly died at the age of 15 after taking what turned out to be fake Ventolin for his asthma. The toxic tablets put him in a coma for 21 days, and it took six months for him to completely recover. That experience motivated him to train as a pharmacist himself before starting RxAll. Similarly, Raja Sharif, the chief executive of the UK-based data company FarmaTrust was also motivated by personal experience. He began researching the problem after he found out a relative had taken fake medicines. FarmaTrust offers a way to trace data about medicine moving through the supply chain on blockchain, a technology originally created for the purpose of buying and selling bitcoin without going through a server belonging to a bank or government that could be hacked. Sharif explains: “The issue with fake medicines is that they usually enter the middle of the supply chain, not at the top at the point of manufacturing, and the useful thing about blockchain is that it creates an incorruptible record; once you’ve made a record, you can’t make it again or alter it.” Another benefit of this technology, he says, is that information can be shared between pharmaceutical companies about what is going on in their supply chains on a need to know basis. As they are siloed and competing with each other, vital information that could root out fakes might not be shared. Oksana Pyzik, a senior lecturer at UCL’s school of pharmacy and Fight the Fakes campaigner, says blockchain looks as though it can become an effective tool. “I think based on the fact the FDA is already piloting blockchain in the pharma supply chain in the US suggests it’s a way forward to get the highest quality track and trace, and the cost is not as prohibitive as it was once,” says Pyzik, who organised a panel on the topic of technology and fake medicines at the WHO’s most recent annual health assembly in May. “Technology alone is not enough, however, it’s a very effective tool. But we also still need to talk about human behaviour and corruption,” Pyzik adds. A much simpler tech solution pioneered by Ghanaian company mPedigree offers a different approach. The company founders began by placing serial numbers under scratchcard surfaces on medicine bottles at the point of manufacture, and consumers can then check the text to see if it matches their database before taking it. “The company has grown because the counterfeiters grew,” says Selorm Branttie, who co-founded the company with social entrepreneur Bright Simmons. “We’ve studied where breaches in the supply chain happen, and we counteract it.” The company now has offices in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and India, and has branched out into tackling counterfeiting in the food supply chain too. “Happily, from when we began to now, the prevalence of counterfeiting has dropped from the estimated 30% of the Nigerian pharmaceutical sector to less than 10% today,” Branttie says. “We are now looking into ways we can use blockchain too – blockchain helps to demonstrate that we are ourselves trustworthy because its a permanent public ledger and therefore can show the data we have collected,” says Branttie. The need for any solution being developed to have a global reach is clear. In 2011, Interpol seized 2.4m fake and illicit pills, and that number jumped to 20.7m seized in 2015. A large quantity is produced in China, but India, Pakistan, Paraguay and the UK are also among the top sources for fakes. An estimated 116,000 people die from malaria from ineffective anti-malarial drugs in subSaharan Africa, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The WHO estimates that between 72,000 and 169,000 children may be dying each year from pneumonia due to “substandard and falsified antibiotics”. Counterfeited medicine, thought to be the most lucrative of illegally copied goods trades, ends up all over the world. But developing countries, where spending on medicine means being out of pocket for the majority of people, are the most vulnerable to conterfeits. Most of the cases (42%) reported by the WHO between 2013 and 2017 were found in subSaharan Africa. In 2018 the EU rolled out its track and trace directive to combat falsified medicines in Europe. The same year, the African Union voted unanimously for the adoption of an African medicines agency, something that has been welcomed as a move that would help strengthen regulation across the continent. Meanwhile, organisations such as the Safe Medicines Foundation in Nigeria, which launched earlier this year, have sprung up. The foundation hopes its medical professionals can help pharmacists recognise the signs of fake logos and store medicines correctly. Slowly, the fightback is taking shape, but it is still a mammoth task. Dr Bornmai says that she has noticed her patients have asked her more questions about fake medicines recently. “People are getting to know about fake medicines; they ask me if I’ve heard of a certain drug, or whether its safe to take,” she says. She says that technology can help speed up the process of checking something – saving days or weeks that could be lost to laboratory testing. But consumers ultimately still need quality medicine to reach their local markets. “An individual could scan a medicine and find that it is fake, then go to the next shop, scan again, and find it’s fake again,” she says. But most importantly, it’s informing and educating the public that can save lives, she says. “Giving individuals more power, through education and the right information to choose the medication that isn’t harmful, is the most important thing that I want to see. It is a universal right to choose medicine that won’t harm you.” • Helen Lock is a freelance journalist",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/big-issue-founder-john-bird-launches-magazine-to-tackle-illiteracy",
    "date": "2019-06-04",
    "transcript": "Almost 30 years after founding the Big Issue, John Bird is launching a new magazine that aims to do for illiteracy what his first publication did for homelessness. The peer, who only learned to read while in prison as a teenager, says Britain needs to become a “cognitive democracy”, and that a “revolution in reading” is the best way to bring this about. Chapter Catcher comprises “dozens and dozens of chapters” of a wide range of works of fiction and non-fiction, Bird explains: “You decide which to read. Think of it as road testing your reading. The idea is that you broaden out what you read.” The first issue puts that conceit firmly to the test. Excerpts lurch from Franz Kafka and Oscar Wilde to Max Porter and Stephen Fry. There’s even a short essay about jail life by an inmate who Bird met on a recent prison visit (“Jail either drives you mad or it drives you patient.”) Editorially, the contents page looks as if it were compiled by an arbitrary drunk let loose in a municipal library. But such apparent randomness, Bird insists, is the whole point. We neither learn by reading what we already know, nor do we grow by reading what makes us comfortable. If we are to solve the big issues of today – climate change, immigration, poverty, social inequality, his list goes on – then we need to start thinking differently. And thinking differently, Bird argues, starts with reading differently. “The world is becoming really, really difficult. We’re all going to have to be experts in ways that we never expected. Our children, in particular, will have deeper knowledge, and that requires a revolution in reading,” he says. Baron Bird of Notting Hill credits Brexit with bringing him to this realisation. Perplexed as to whether to vote leave or remain (he lumped for remain in the end), the 2016 referendum persuaded him of his failure to “ever read deep”. “After the vote I thought: ‘Why didn’t I take this more seriously by reading deep so I could go and argue with people to stay or to leave?’ I just felt that I needed to develop a mechanism where people can learn in their own way to broaden and deepen their reading.” Enter the idea for Chapter Catcher. The index is not quite as randomly assembled as might initially appear. The chapters are loosely broken into five sections: contemporary, rediscovered, classics, non-fiction and ‘in process’. The last section is one of those that Bird is particularly excited about. He hopes that published and unpublished writers will be inspired to submit unfinished work for consideration. “I want to encourage the growth of writing and break down the world of publishing and magazines. It’s the beginning, in my opinion, of a new way of encountering writing and a new way of encountering reading,” he said. At the heart of the venture is a desire to connect readers and writers more directly. Just as the Protestant reformers of the 16th century sought to open a direct channel to God by bypassing priests, he says, he wants to “take out the middleman” in publishing. As with the Big Issue, which is sold by and for the homeless, Chapter Catcher is set up as a social enterprise. Copies of the magazine, which retails at £4.99, will be sent free to every prison in the country. Charities that stock the magazine also get a 50/50 split on all sales. Bird hopes that it will be sold “almost as a community bag”, with non-profit vendors including their own leaflets and materials in the envelope in which the magazine is marketed. Another lesson that Bird has taken from the Big Issue is to play down the seriousness of his intent. So expect plenty of artwork, white space and, as the blurb on the cover states, “no wise advice, no clever analysis, no acute insights”. It is necessary to “sugar the pill”, Bird explains. “The worst thing on earth is to be an enthusiast. If you are really, really enthusiastic about climate change, then you are probably incredibly boring.” Bird is nothing if not enthused about his new publishing venture – his first since launching the Big Issue back in 1991. He has plans for a junior version, a bimonthly edition (it is launching as a quarterly), email lists with one-off stories, an interactive reader-friendly website, a national network of reading groups, and much else besides. Before all that, however, he needs to wean us off our screens and get our noses into stories and essays that we are not necessarily predisposed to read. And that is no easy task – especially with government cuts to public libraries, these great gateways to “the unknown unknown”, as the author and etymologist Mark Forsyth puts it. As Bird reflects: “If you really want to screw up the world, then you close your libraries tomorrow. You close the future. You say: ‘Bollocks to knowledge.’” Chapter Catcher isn’t about to replace libraries, but, in a small way, it does capture what libraries (and bookshops) do best: presenting us with thought-provoking literature that we would not otherwise come across. Whether the readers share his excitement is uncertain, but this one-time butcher’s boy isn’t about to say “Bollocks to knowledge.” Learning to read, he says, “made me into the posh geezer I am now”. He is only half joking. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "date": "2019-05-31",
    "transcript": "He is a Peruvian banker who encourages schoolchildren to save, and offers his 2,000 customers cash for recycling plastic waste. But the really remarkable thing about José Adolfo Quisocala is that he is still a child himself. When many of his peers dreamed of becoming professional footballers, firefighters or cumbía music stars, José Adolfo had his sights set on the world of finance from an early age. By the age of seven, attending a state school in the Peruvian city of Arequipa, he decided he wanted to create a bank for children. He was motivated by seeing his peers skipping lunch because they had spent the little money they had on sweets or football cards. What drove him even more was the poverty he saw among children who were not attending his primary school. “Seeing children living in poverty, seeing many children working in the streets, at the traffic lights selling sweets, begging … made me think, why can’t these children go to a normal school,” he told the Guardian. “One of the reasons why those kids were working was because there was no money at home. Why can’t I teach them to save?” The Bartselana student bank he founded then now has more than 2,000 clients between the ages of 10 and 18 and offers loans, microinsurance and other financial services. The children can withdraw money from the cashpoints of several banks and building societies using personal bank cards, which no one else can use, and monitor their balances online. He also set savings goals his clients had to reach in order to withdraw money. Seven years ago, José Adolfo managed to convince a handful of teachers and pupils that his idea could work. Then a student prize from his local town hall helped him get the support of a local cooperative to formally register his bank. Since then he has won awards nationally, then internationally and he has not looked back. From winning Unicef’s Child and Youth Finance International Award in 2014 to the Children’s Climate Prize in 2018 and more recent accolades, José Adolfo has combined financial and environmental services. The student bank really took off when he came up with an innovative way for the children to earn money by collecting recyclable plastic or paper waste. “The children would sometimes bring savings of a few cents and I had promised that they could buy a bicycle, a computer or a laptop but with that amount of money it would take a long time,” he says. “I thought there must be a way they can earn money and I thought about rubbish; we all generate rubbish and I decided that was the solution.” The children bring plastic bottles, used school exercise books and old newspapers to a kiosk at their school where it is weighed and their bank accounts are credited with the corresponding amount of money. José Adolfo struck deals with local recycling companies to pay his bank’s clients a slightly higher price than normal; for example 0.80 Peruvian Soles (0.19 GBP) a kilogram of plastic or white paper. “We don’t want them to be in the street collecting rubbish but at home stopping the rubbish from reaching the street. So in their homes, they put out boxes for cardboard, paper, bottles – they start collecting and it becomes valuable,” José Adolfo explains. His efforts have not gone unnoticed by Peru’s environment ministry, which has made home recycling one of its principal campaigns. The country has introduced a law to tackle its estimated 18,000 tonnes of solid waste a day, half of which is not disposed of in landfills and ends up on streets, beaches and in rivers. “He’s making an incredible change in financial structuring and financial education that perhaps many adults could not have come up with,” said Peru’s environment minister, Lucía Ruiz, as she joined José Adolfo at a recent event in Arequipa. “By joining that with recycling and the handling of waste, a serious problem in our country, he’s scoring a double goal because he’s not just designing a financial opportunity for children and teenagers but also helping to reduce the amount of waste in the country.” “It’s a very hectic life for a 14-year-old,” José Adolfo says. “Even so, I’m passionate about what I do and I always tell people they should do what they like rather than what others believe they should do.” The bank recycles about four tonnes of material a month and has kiosks in seven schools in Arequipa; more are on a waiting list. Increasingly the model is in demand in the rest of Peru and abroad. Meanwhile, José Adolfo is studying online as he no longer has time to attend school. “He’s given up many childhood things – games, activities, what normal children do – but he too is a normal child, he just sees things differently and thinks in another way,” says his father, Herbert Quisocala, who left his job a year ago to help his son. “If he wants to cry, I’m here to help him understand that life is like that and you have to learn to accept the good with the bad.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-05-28",
    "transcript": "Javier Larragoiti was 18 when his father was diagnosed with diabetes. The teenager had just started a degree in chemical engineering in Mexico City. So he dedicated his studies to a side project: creating an acceptable alternative to help his father and millions of Mexicans like him avoid sugar. “It’s only when you know someone with this sickness that you realise how common it is and how sugar intake plays a huge role,” he says. “My dad tried to use stevia and sucralose, just hated the taste, and kept cheating on his diet.” The young chemist started dabbling with xylitol, a sweet-tasting alcohol commonly extracted from birch wood and used in products such as chewing gum. “It has so many good properties for human health, and the same flavour as sugar, but the problem was that producing it was so expensive,” he says. “So I decided to start working on a cheaper process to make it accessible to everyone.” Ten years later, Larragoiti has patented a fermentation-based process to turn wasted corn cobs from Mexico’s 27.5m-tonne annual crop into xylitol. It is thereby solving a second problem: what to do with all that agricultural waste that otherwise might be burned, adding greenhouse gases to the overladen atmosphere. His business, Xilinat (pronounced Hill-Ee-Natt), buys waste from 13 local farmers, producing 1 tonne of the product a year. This month his invention was awarded a prestigious $310,000 Chivas Venture prize award, which will enable him to industrialise production and scale up production tenfold. Obesity is one of the fastest-growing global health problems. One in seven people are obese and about 10% have type 2 diabetes. Since 1980 the rate of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries. Larragoiti says that sugary diets are a real problem in Coca-Cola-loving Mexico, which has the world’s second-highest rate of obesity and has successfully taxed sugary drinks to try to combat a main source of the issue. Paradoxically, another corn byproduct – fructose – is part of the problem, used to make corn syrup that has been linked to increasing obesity in the US. “It’s kind of ironic,” Larragoiti says. “High fructose corn syrup is just a bomb of carbs and concentrated sugar that makes a high peak of insulin. It’s many times sweeter than regular glucose. Companies use and pay less and that’s the issue.” Reusing agricultural waste is rapidly emerging as a promising sector for social entrepreneurs keen to tackle global heating and make useful things at the same time. “One corn stalk has 70% to 80% waste by weight when you get down to it,” says Stefan Mühlbauer, of Cormo USA Inc. His company has a pilot plant in Alsace, France, and is building another in Indiana, US, to turn corn waste into a peat moss substitute and a super-absorbent foam for filters or soil. “Farmers are excited as it gives them something that extends their harvest season and they see another source of revenue,” he adds. In Mexico, agricultural waste is often burned, releasing greenhouse gases and creating one of the country’s highest sources of dioxin emissions. “Burning the residue is cheap and quick and may suppress pests and diseases,” says Dr Wolter Elbersen, a crop production expert at Wageningen University &amp; Research. “The disadvantages such as air pollution, loss of organic matter and nutrients are less appreciated apparently. Removing the material for feed or compost, or added value products such as paper pulp or fuels is often not cost-effective, or no labour is available to do all the work in a short window of time.” But thinking in a different way about “waste products” is essential if we are going to conserve scarce resources and feed a growing population, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “We need to think about the principles in the past, where we had to do much with little, and at the same time apply the technology we have at hand nowadays to succeed in the challenge of feeding the world,” says Clementine Schouteden, who leads the global initiative on the circular economy for food at the campaigning organisation. “There’s definitely a sense of urgency in making sure that we farm in a way that is regenerative, preventing waste but also [creating value from] the waste that is currently not edible, with a food industry making the right options for consumers and for the planet.” Xilinat’s idea has huge potential, according to Sonal Shah, the founding executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, and a Chivas Venture judge. “It’s not just that he’s building a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar but that it’s going to become scalable so every company that uses sugar in its food has the opportunity to rethink what kind of substitute they use,” she said. Ebersen added, though, that “you do, however, need a solution for using the leftovers after the xylose has been extracted and the demand for xylitol is small [currently] compared with the amount of residue”. Meanwhile, what about Javier’s father? “My dad is super-happy,” Larragoiti says. “He uses my product every day and he’s willing not to cheat on his diet any more!” • Readers have pointed out that xylitol is highly toxic for dogs and even small amounts can be fatal.

    "transcript": "Here in the UK, tens of thousands of teens sat the most important exam of their young lives this week – Maths GCSE. As a tribute to them, this week’s newsletter comes to you in the form of a maths exam. Please turn over your papers. Do not confer, or scratch. You have five minutes. Answer ALL questions. Then read ALL solutions. Q1. Millions of parents around the world work office hours – until 5pm on average. Their kids leave school at 3pm. If there are 200 school days a year, how many times a year will the average parent say to him/herself “crap, I’m late.” Solution Q2. Aviation generates about 2% of global carbon emissions. If the number of passenger flights doubled from 2005-17, how hot will it be in 2085? Solution Q3. A three-tin pack of tuna typically costs £2. In an unscrupulous New Zealand truck shop manned by outrageous scammers, poor people are charged £15. How many packs must be sold for the chiselling little crooks to make £1m out of others’ misfortune? Solution Q4. In 2008, Ljubljana recycled just 30% of its waste. If that figure is 68% today, and the average per capita waste produced is 115kg, how much more stuff do we really need? Solution Q5. Since the start of the war in Yemen, Britain has contributed £770m in aid, and £4.7bn-worth of arms licences to Saudi forces leading the bombing. Plot this on a graph with profits on the x-axis and pride in being British on the y-axis. How would you expect Yemenis to respond to this injustice? Solution Lucky numbers Off at a tangent we go, to inspect a list of the best countries in the world for attracting and retaining top talent. In a world of steadily mounting protectionist barriers and domestic chauvinism, this list tells a story. Also, the number of deaths from strokes have halved in the UK over the past 10 years. That silver lining does however come with a cloud attached: more people are surviving and enduring severe disability as a result. What we liked The Covering Climate Now project, led by the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation, which aims to galvanise media coverage of “the most urgent story of our time”. Also this NBC piece on dealing with adverse childhood experience, which nicely complemented the Upside’s own recent piece on this vital issue. What we heard Congratulations on your series of positive solutions, and long may they continue. Can I suggest you cover the role of cooperatives in providing housing, looking at Zurich and perhaps other German-speaking cities. You also may want to cover the potential for electric bikes of all kinds, as they offer a serious alternative for taming the car. Nicholas Falk, via email Re (GDP alternatives) I’m sure you’re aware of the Social Progress Index, that looks for more telling metrics about wellbeing. Lee Mannion, via email In NZ we have had a number of schools adopt a mentoring programme, where senior students volunteer and are trained to mentor younger students. It’s proven particularly effective for potentially vulnerable students who might be from single parent/financially stressed/marginalised/migrant ... families and where [there] is a real need for role modelling, having a confident and an ‘older sister’ or ‘older brother’ in the school / community environment. One programme was instigated in Nelson, started at Nelson college by groundbreaking social worker the late Celia Lashlie. I have seen first-hand how these mentoring programmes really do assist both younger and older student and work to break down age and social silo barriers and prejudices. Now, our small rural Golden Bay high school, where there are numerous rural community related stresses for students, is implementing a programme in peer support. Jude Gillies from Takaka, New Zealand, via email Where was the Upside? In Mulhouse, eastern France, which is showing how to reinvent a town centre. Also, in Argentina and Algeria, which became the 37th and 38th countries to be declared malaria-free. Did you check out all the solutions? If so, congratulations – you have passed your Upside GCSE. Next week: the man who reinvented sugar. Do get in touch with suggestions, ideas, technologies, even good jokes at theupside@theguardian.com. Who knows, you might feature in next week’s edition.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/22/how-stockholm-became-the-city-of-work-life-balance",
    "date": "2019-05-22",
    "transcript": "It is 3.30pm, and the first workers begin to trickle out of the curved glass headquarters of the Stockholm IT giant Ericsson. John Langared, a 30-year-old programmer, is hurrying to pick up his daughter from school. He has her at home every other week, so tends to alternate short hours one week with long hours the next. Sai Kumar, originally from India, is leaving to pick up his daughter because his wife has a Swedish class. Ylva (who doesn’t want to give her surname) is “off to the gym to stay sane”, as is Sumeia Assenai, 30, who came in at 7am, so is allowed to leave early under her company’s “flex bank” system. Minutes after 4pm, the trickle turns into a stream of people tramping through the tunnel under the E4 motorway out of Stockholm’s tech district. The local traffic authorities mark the start of the city’s rush hour at 3pm, the time the first parents begin to leave work to pick up their children from school and kindergarten, and mark its end at past 6pm. Sweden’s flexible approach to working hours is one reason it was ranked best in the world for work-life balance in a recent HSBC survey. Only about 1.1% of the nation’s employees work very long hours, according to the OECD’s How’s Life survey, the second lowest share among the organisation’s 38 countries. Above all, it seems to have found an answer to a question that has vexed parents across the world for years: what do you do if school finishes at 3pm and work at 5pm? Langared says his colleagues and managers never make any comments on the days he leaves his desk shortly after 3pm: “They’re totally OK with it. Basically, I handle my time any way I want. They just rely on me to do the work, but which hours I do it in, it’s up to me.” If his daughter is ill, he sends an email in the morning saying he needs to vab, the Swedish term for taking a day off to look after a sick child, although now she is a bit older he often works from home. According to Fredrik Lindstål, the city’s vice mayor for labour, the flexibility that Stockholm’s employers offer helps the city attract the highly educated workers its tech industries need. “The city is actively marketing Stockholm as a destination for starting a family while maintaining a high-level career,” he says. “They’ve been really good at promoting this as a go-to factor.” Robin Bagger-Sjöbäck, who works at Carnegie, Sweden’s leading investment bank, is one of those who’ve been attracted, or at least attracted back. He returned to Stockholm in 2014 after three years working 12- to 14-hour days at the French bank Crédit Agricole in London. Such moves are common among Scandinavian investment bankers, he says. “A lot of Nordic people start leaving London when they reach 30 and it comes to marriage and, sooner or later, kids,” he says. “A lot of people I knew have left London and now have families, either here in Stockholm, or in Copenhagen or Oslo.” He now drops off his son most days (often, he says, while simultaneously taking part in a conference call). And although he still occasionally puts in extremely long hours when completing transactions, he is sceptical of the hours that are common in London or New York. “I think that if you work those 18-hour days and 80- or 90-hour weeks, in the long run you’re not getting that much more out of it,” he says. “Those last five or six hours a day, I think they’re just marginal. I don’t think the brain works that well if you do that for a longer period of time.” Johanna Lundin, chief executive of Equalate, which advises companies on promoting gender equality, says Stockholm’s work-life balance is rooted in Sweden’s 50-year push for equal treatment of men and women. “Creating a social norm where both men and women take an equal role in childcare is a very important element,” she says. “This enables women to make and have a career, and it allows men to take part in their children’s lives.” Most companies in Stockholm allow workers to do flexible hours, only requiring them to be in the office between 9am and 4pm, or sometimes 10am and 3pm. Under Swedish law, employees have the right to take the day off to look after a sick child, with the state reimbursing them for 80% of any salary lost. But perhaps the most important element is the system of parental leave, with a generous 480 days of paid leave granted for each child – almost two years of working days in total – which can be shared as the parents wish. To encourage men to take more leave, there are three so-called daddy months, which can only be used by one partner and are lost if not taken. Bagger-Sjöbäck spent two months at home looking after his daughter, and says other male bankers at Carnegie have taken five to six months without doing any damage to their careers. “I have a colleague who was away for the whole fall, I guess five months,” he says. “He is well respected at the firm, both before and after, and as far as I know no one has mentioned anything.” About 100 of the 300 staff at the bank’s Stockholm office have taken some parental leave over the last three years, 60 of whom were men. This is not to say, however, that combining a challenging career with small children is easy, even in Stockholm. “It’s hard when you have one child in school and the other in daycare,” admits Martin Vogel, stage manager at Stockholm’s Royal Dramatic Theatre, as he walks with his two children past a school in the fashionable district of Södermalm at 7.45am. “It’s a battle, it’s a constant battle,” groans Jakob Lagander, COO of the Nordic IT company Pedab, as he rushes from the school to the nearest underground station. Lagander’s wife is a banker, and he says it is not really socially acceptable in Stockholm to employ a nanny, as a similarly high-earning couple would in London. But he says employers in Sweden are also much more understanding of the challenges of being a parent than they are in Dublin, where he spent three years working for the US IT company IBM. “I didn’t feel that parents could leave before 4pm in Dublin,” he says. “I get the feeling that it’s much more relaxed here.” But, he adds, Swedish executives do somehow manage to get at least the same amount of work done, with much less time spent chatting or messing around with colleagues. Indeed, one of the main complaints of British people working in Sweden is the lack of office banter and the rarity of after-work socialising. “I think we are much more efficient during the day,” Lagander says. “There’s so much more lazing around, especially in the United States. They put in a lot of work hours, but they’re so inefficient.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/20/from-bleak-to-bustling-how-one-french-town-beat-the-high-street-blues-mulhouse",
    "date": "2019-05-20",
    "transcript": "On a lane in what was once considered eastern France’s grimmest town, a street artist is up a ladder finishing a mural, the independent bookshop has a queue at the till, the organic cooperative is full of customers and Séverine Liebold’s arty independent tea shop is doing a brisk trade. When Liebold opened Tilvist in Mulhouse three years ago, in a space that had been vacant for years, friends tried to persuade her against it. “They said: ‘Not Mulhouse, look elsewhere,’” she recalls. “But I stuck with my instinct, and I was right.” Just over a decade ago, Mulhouse, a town of 110,000 people near the German and Swiss borders, was a symbol of the death of the European high street. One of the poorest towns of its size in France, this former hub of the textile industry had long ago been clobbered by factory closures and industrial decline. It had high rates of poverty and youth unemployment, a shrinking population, and more than 100 shops empty or boarded up. The centre had become associated with gangs. “We had every possible cliche thrown at us: grey, grim, austere and unsafe,” one local official says. Today, Mulhouse is known for the staggering transformation of its thriving centre, bucking the national trend for high street closures. In the past eight years, more than 470 shops and businesses have opened here. Mulhouse is unique in that 75% of new openings are independents, from comic book stores to microbreweries and organic grocers. It is one of the only places in France with as many independents as franchises. And it is one of very few places in France where more shops are opening than closing. The town’s blue-collar history, its old factory buildings, the 136 nationalities living here and its very young population are now seen as desirable. Once overshadowed by its more famous Alsace neighbours, the city of Strasbourg or chocolate-box pretty Colmar, Mulhouse is now sought after by brands seeking retail premises. “People say, ‘Wow, this place has changed,’” says Sabine Muck, a high school teacher. “The independents make the place a joy, culture is booming.” French political powers woke up late to the problem of dying town centres. Outside the Paris region, an average of 11% of high street premises lie empty, similar to the UK. But France, which has a powerful hypermarket industry and lobby, has for decades hastened town centre decline by allowing out-of-town superstores to mushroom over kilometres of dull grey hangars on the outskirts of towns. Leaders only recently turned to the issue, fearing boarded up shopfronts and vanishing services could help usher in Donald Trump-style populists. Polls showed that in small French towns, the fewer the services on offer – notably post offices – the higher the vote for the far right. Mulhouse has shown it takes at least a decade to turn things around. The town, under its former rightwing mayor Jean Rottner, decided boarded up shops were just the most visible symptom of deeper rooted problems. The city’s €36m (£31.5m) investment plan over six years tackled several issues at once, including housing. Town centre residents were among the poorest as higher earners moved to houses on the outskirts, leaving properties vacant and run down. Mulhouse set out to rebalance the housing mix. Generous subsidies for the renovation of building fronts expedited a facelift of more than 170 buildings. Security and community policing were stepped up. Transport was key – with a new tram system, bike schemes, shuttle buses and cheap parking. But making the town’s public spaces attractive was just as important, with wider pavements, dozens of benches, and what officials deemed a “colossal budget” for tree planting and maintenance, gardening and green space. Local associations, community groups and residents’ committees were crucial to the efforts. A town centre manager was appointed to support independents and high-street franchises setting up. Geography played a key role. While the town itself was poor, the surrounding area, close to Switzerland and Germany, had cross-border workers on an income far higher than the French average. Offering original shops that didn’t exist elsewhere was seen as a way of drawing them in. This was when local independents such as Liebold and her tea shop came along. Having worked in the supermarket business, Liebold understood people wanted a smaller scale experience rather than “walking for kilometres with a trolley in a hangar where you didn’t see a single leaf on a tree”. She says: “The idea was to create somewhere where people feel good, to re-appropriate our town centre as a kind of agora, the place where everyone can meet.” Marie Zeugmann, a former teacher, opened her independent clothes shop, Confidence(s), in Mulhouse last month, stocking designers prominent on Instagram and not normally found outside Paris or the Côte d’Azur. Like all Mulhouse independents, her shop is as much about providing a social space as it is about retail. Zeugmann is renovating the second floor into a champagne bar for independent producers. “It’s about offering something different that you can’t find anywhere else,” she says. “In a few years, Mulhouse became really attractive with an array of little shops. People are very proud – we’ve made a huge effort to change the town’s image.” Last month, Charlotte Nass and Sophie Erhart opened Le Nid, an urban cafe with a village feel on a cobbled street. They met at school in Mulhouse and had already opened a fashion franchise. “In Mulhouse, everyone just rolls up their sleeves to work for it, we’ve got no complexes,” Nass says. “It’s a very young town. That’s good for dynamism and for the new arts scene.” In her town hall office, the mayor, Michèle Lutz, who once ran a hair salon in Mulhouse, says the town must now move into a second phase where the vibrancy of the centre extends to the surrounding neighbourhoods. “The town centre is buzzing now, but we can’t just concentrate on the small central perimeter, nor simply on shops – there has to be a vision of the town as a whole,” she says. She feels greenery and nature are key “to making people feel good and at ease in the town”. Mulhouse was once known as a “little Manchester” for its canals used by the textile industry, but many were later concreted over. Lutz is leading a drive to renovate neglected canalsides that run through various neighbourhoods. The focus is on the fine detail, including improved lighting – important in a town where winter nights come early. Frédéric Marquet, the town centre manager, is examining his database of empty premises to match them to new businesses. “Mulhouse currently has two shop openings for every closure,” he says. “No other town in France can say all these brands have opened premises in the last five years.” Olivier Razemon, the author of a recent study called How France Killed Its Towns, says town centres should be seen as a theatrical backdrop to life’s encounters, with the understanding that: “People don’t go to the town centre just for shops, but because it’s pleasant, because they want to meet up.” Geneviève Pilnard, an 89-year-old widow, takes a taxi every Friday from her village outside Mulhouse into the town centre, where she goes to the hairdresser, the market, the cheesemonger and the independent bookshop. “I like to keep the habit of coming in, because I don’t want to live like a recluse,” Pilnard says. “After all, a bustling town centre represents life.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "date": "2019-05-20",
    "transcript": "Painted bright purple and crammed full of everyday essentials, the Salvation Army’s Good Shop is hard to miss as it cruises the back streets of south Auckland. Frequenting deprived suburbs that are targeted by predatory lenders, the Good Shop aims to beat the bad guys at their own game. Jodi Hoare is the Good Shop project coordinator for the Salvation Army and first remembers seeing truck shops driving around her south Auckland suburb 30 years ago. Loaded with electronics, linen, food and entertainment items, truck shops ply the poorest areas, selling goods at vastly inflated prices to people who can ill-afford them, and charging interest of up to 800% on loans. People with disabilities or a lack of transport are commonly targeted, Hoare says, as are those with poor financial literacy, or for whom buying on credit is an attractive – or the only – option. Prices on truck shops include a three-pack of tuna for NZ$30 (£15) and $59 for a 3kg bag of chicken drumsticks. The Good Shop aims to deliver the same doorstep service but without the high interest and exploitative practices. It sells its wares at similar prices to traditional shops, and requires its customers to undergo a financial background check and interview with a social worker before it will sell to them. Despite the comparative rigmarole, the Good Shop is proving a hit in south Auckland, with the Salvation Army receiving requests from other parts of the country to expand. “For some people, shopping from a truck is their expected norm. It might be what they have been doing for years and what they’ve seen the neighbourhood doing, or their parents,” says Hoare. Although online shopping is the norm in many western societies, Hoare says about a third of houses in some parts of south Auckland don’t have the internet “so running an online service wouldn’t fully meet their needs”. Larayne, a single mother from south Auckland, first heard about the Good Shop via a community Facebook page, and describes the service as “awesome”. She bought a mobile phone to help her stay in touch with family. “I think it was a lot easier for me to be in my home and have them come to me. Not a lot of people have cars or transport round here. A single mum with kids that doesn’t have transport will find it difficult to get to a shop, so it’s so much easier,” Larayne says. “My credit isn’t the flashest. I have been turned away from a lot of places … if the Salvation Army wouldn’t take me, no one else would.” Most of the usual truck shop goods are available on the Good Shop, but some items, such as video games, are not. A social worker and a credit loan approver work together, helping customers choose items they need and be able to afford. “We have taken that array of stuff we know is offered on trucks and refined it in terms of what we think is ethical to be providing credit for,” Hoare says. “Rather than getting into debt for a Playstation, we think you should come up with a savings plan and buy it once you have the cash.” Last year, the Labour coalition government led by Jacinda Ardern announced a crackdown on loan sharks and money lenders, in what the Salvation Army hopes will be an ongoing tightening of the industry. The government now requires all mobile traders to pass the “fit and proper person” test before they are able to sell goods on credit, and it increased fines for sellers who break the law – they can now pay up to NZ$600,000. Hoare and her team are in the process of evaluating the Good Shop’s success but have plans to expand to other cities later this year.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/19/yemeni-poetry-thrives-despite-trauma-of-civil-war",
    "date": "2019-05-19",
    "transcript": "A story is often told to illustrate how central poetry is to Yemeni culture: that of the visit of a famous lute player from Baghdad. He was invited to play in Sana’a, where he performed enchanting and technically brilliant music for an hour. But when he stopped, the audience waited for the musician to start talking. Without any poetry, they thought, the entertainment could not possibly be over yet. Sung and recited poetry is loved all over the Arab world, but especially so in Yemen. It is important for special occasions such as weddings and historical events, but also has a function in everyday life as part of dispute mediations between tribes and as a form of political and social commentary. The millennia-old tradition is still thriving. In the 2011 Arab spring protests, ancient and new compositions were chanted in the streets of Sana’a. Even now, four years into Yemen’s civil war, established poets and emerging young writers are exploring how the art form can unite people on different sides of the war’s many fault lines. “We have to say what we feel and what life is like in war, and what life was like before it. That’s what poetry is for,” said 20-year-old Aisha al-Jaedy, a student from Hadramaut who writes on the themes of women and peace. “It’s our job to give this message to the world.” Jaedy volunteered for a recent project called In the Land of Shattered Windows, which involved nine young poets from different parts of Yemen writing in the tradition of balah, long poems composed and performed competitively or as part of a dialogue. None of the participants had met, but they were connected in pairs in order to communicate what life was like for people on opposite sides of the conflict, exchanging audio recordings of original poems via WhatsApp. The result was deeply moving portraits of young Yemenis’ lives. I have always told you: You must be brave to say you are scared, And scared enough to look brave. From ‘Over a Bridge of Fears’ by Aisha al-Jaedy, translated by Hamdan Dammaj Seven of the nine participants were able to travel to Sana’a to meet in person and perform together in February this year. “We wanted to update the poetic tradition, make it younger and cooler,” said organiser Ibi Ibrahim, the founder of the Romooz Foundation, a new independent non-profit based in Sana’a dedicated to promoting and developing Yemeni art and culture. “When I moved back to Yemen last year, it was astonishing for me to really see and internalise how life goes on despite the war. Outsiders think of Yemen as death and war and conflict. That is absolutely true. But what we are aiming to do is create another narrative that shows our humanity and resilience.” Creating art in times of war is not without its obstacles. In Yemen, the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the Saudi-backed coalition have both imprisoned and tortured activists, journalists and intellectuals. Many people are afraid to express themselves truthfully - and political poetry, by its very nature, can inflame existing tensions. “Poetry is given a lot more value and honour in Yemen [than in the west],” said 27-year-old British-Yemeni poet Sana Uqba and author of War &amp; Love. “So when writing my book, I knew it had to serve a purpose – a peacemaker but also an unconventional newspaper to inform readers of what is happening in Yemen in a more artistic and creative way. I’m a firm believer in art being a form of resistance.” Poetry, for Uqba, is also a way of processing collective trauma. One of her performance poems, What do you know about Yemen?, was shared thousands of times on social media by Yemenis and the diaspora community keen to draw attention to their country’s rich history and cultural contributions to the world. “[The collection is] designed to humanise what has quite obviously become a dehumanised war,” she said. “Beyond the headlines and death tolls, humans have bore the brunt of this unnecessary and devastating war.” The sun rose and pushed them one by one Onto the ageing bus Fresh bread, a little butter And some cheese That’s all it took - Oh and some tea A whole lot of singing And laughter; that’s a perfect day At the beach Untitled poem from ‘War &amp; Love’ by Sana Uqba Ibrahim’s team at the Ramooz Foundation is planning to nurture new literary talent in Sana’a with a new project called Kitabat, hosting a creative writing workshop in Sana’a in the summer and crowdsourcing funds for a writer in residence programme in the city. “I feel lucky to witness the artistic energy in Yemen at the moment,” Ibrahim said. “It’s such an active scene in literature, visual arts, filmmaking. It deserves support. “There’s a social responsibility to avoid the destruction of our culture and heritage and seeing how these young artists grow more confident in their talents when they get to share their work is amazing.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Here in the UK, it’s been Mental Health Awareness Week. These awareness bandwagons can get a bit much (International Talk Like a Pirate Day, anyone?) but mental health affects us all – and mental disorders are still poorly understood, even by scientists. So it was an opportune moment for Guardian journalists to look at some of the new approaches to confronting this scourge of our times, from school experiments, and new carer roles to the emergence of “recovery colleges”. You can download the entire mental health supplement here. The key message, which we hardly need to spell out, is that disability – mental or physical – really does not have to mean the end to productive life. David Harewood’s work since a psychotic episode 30 years ago amply demonstrates this, as does Jon Powton’s experience as a physically disabled man who has nonetheless revelled in becoming a foster parent. Lucky numbers The number of people attempting the treacherous journey to Europe across the Mediterranean appears to have fallen sharply, and the death toll is also on course to be lower than in previous years. Though before celebrating, we should be careful to examine why. What we liked Get out your headphones, for this is such a lovely story of youth, daring and espionage, all set to a 1980s soundtrack, that you will listen to the end. We also admired people who mend clothes, and don’t just dump them in the bin, courtesy of PositiveNews. Also, a simple tweet from Ola Rosling… What we heard Thank you for all your emails about alternatives to GDP/growth. We are going to pull this together into a big piece in June. Herewith a flavour of what you said – but first, check out how New Zealand plans to shift its economic focus towards wellbeing and away from growth for growth’s sake. What if we questioned the existence of Growth? GDP, an invention of the 20th-century world war economies with historical predecessors, is criticized for its narrow and discriminating view of what constitutes a state’s social and economic wealth. It lost its raison d’être with the end of wars between nation states on a global scale. Alternative systems emerge already. New Zealand’s “well-being budget” is an attempt to add another dimension. Janina Priebe, from Umeå, Sweden, via email Infinite growth on a finite planet is a liberal economist fantasy around which we have erroneously based the core assumptions which guide our teaching of economics. Policymakers, analysts, consultants and financial actors all go through this same quasi-religious indoctrination in their introductory economics courses which treat a narrow view of economics as gospel, and is rightfully being challenged by groups like Rethinking Economics and Exploring Economics. Until a pluralistic approach to economics is the norm, it should come as no surprise that our economies are steering us down the path to extinction. Hamish Forbes (@HsimahForbes) via email I believe we are not going to sort of the problems of the world until we change our economic system to one called a Resource Based Economy (RBE). Phil Smart, via email We seem to think as long as we reach enough economic growth that would automatically solve all our problems like unemployment and poverty. De-growth is the flipside of this thinking; since our environmental problems are caused by economic growth, de-growth will automatically solve them. Instead we should start from thinking what we want to achieve. Personally, I would suggest happiness and a good life for all, including both present and future generation. Whether the path towards this goal would result to growth or de-growth is not essential. Jan Kunnas, from Jyväskylä, Finland, via email Thanks for picking up this topic. It’s brilliant! Please don’t leave it as a one-off. I’ve come across VOLT in Germany where I am eligible to vote. It is very much a fringe Party and not well-known, probably due to its lack of funding.

    "transcript": "Jon Powton might not fit the image of a typical foster carer. The 44-year-old is a former engineer and has a mild form of muscular dystrophy. But for the last eight years, he and his wife Denise, 60, have provided a loving home for children who need it in Burnley. It wasn’t an easy start. When Powton first looked into fostering in 2011, his local authority and an agency rebuffed him. “They thought I was too disabled and my wife was too old,” he explains. But after approaching the National Fostering Agency, he was encouraged to apply. Four days after he was approved as a foster carer, he was assigned his first placement – a teenager – to care for. Soon afterwards, Powton and his wife started fostering other children. He says he’s never looked back . Powton beams: “It’s the best thing that I’ve done with my life.” His own positive experience has led him to question why there aren’t more disabled foster carers like him. “I watched an ad campaign about a general shortage of foster carers a few years ago,” he tells me. “It said ‘you can do it if you’re LGBT or black and minority ethnic. The only one that wasn’t mentioned was disability.” Concerned, Powton began to investigate whether anywhere in the country was actively aiming to recruit disabled people into fostering – and nowhere was. “I mean, literally nowhere,” he says. The University of Worcester has launched groundbreaking research into the nationwide shortfall of disabled foster carers. It aims to discover what barriers stop disabled people from applying to become foster carers, and how these can be overcome. Initial findings from the research, which is funded by the Drill programme (Disability Research on Independent Living and Learning) and the National Lottery, have identified attitudes, fear of benefit loss, wording used by foster agencies, and lack of role models as barriers to disabled people fostering. “There’s a stigma attached to disability that determines how agencies view disabled people who might apply to be foster carers,” says Peter Unwin, principal lecturer in social work at the University of Worcester and the project’s lead researcher. “They tend to see only the disability and what you can’t do. It’s a very negative mindset that is robbing children of a caring environment and a potential new home.” Overcoming these barriers is all the more pressing in light of the current shortfall in foster carers. Latest figures from the Fostering Network show that 8,500 more foster carers are needed across the UK. Yet when the University of Worcester surveyed almost 500 foster agencies to ask if they had any disabled foster carers on their books, only six responded, of whom only a couple had limited experience of working with disabled people. The deficit in disabled foster carers reflects the wider exclusion of disabled people from society, not least from employment. Just under half of disabled people aged 16 to 64 are in work, compared with more than 80% of non-disabled people. This gets even worse for some disabilities: just 16% of people with autism are in full-time paid work, while less than 6% of learning-disabled people are in full-time employment. A recent ComRes survey found one in four UK employers are less likely to hire someone with a disability. Powton knows this all too well. After being made redundant, he was repeatedly rejected for jobs, despite being a qualified engineer. “As soon as the word disability is mentioned, you can hear doors closing,” he says. Fostering was his way into gaining employment but it evolved into something more. “It isn’t just a job,” he says. “It’s a vocation.” Jennifer Luton, from Shropshire, who has been a foster carer for almost 20 years, feels the same: “They end up as part of the family. Some call us ‘mum and dad.’” Luton (who uses a pseudonym to protect her foster children) has a rare form of arthritis, which means she uses a crutch to walk, but it was a damaged spine following a car crash in 2000 that meant she needed to leave her physically demanding job as a social worker. One young boy she was helping at the time inspired what she did next: she retrained as a foster carer to look after him. He’s now 32 and Luton is still in contact with him. Luton now works full time as a lecturer and is looking after a 14-year-old, as well as an 18-year-old (she doesn’t receive funding for him but keeps a room for him). “He can come home whenever he wants,” she says. Far from inhibiting her role as a foster carer, she believes her arthritis helps – from teaching children the ups and downs of life (“Regardless of who you are, we all have bad days,” she says) to empathy for other people. Sometimes the children will do extra chores for her during a flare-up of her arthritis. “And it bonds us as a family,” she explains. This empathy works both ways: disabled people often know what it is to struggle and are well placed to understand children who are going through their own difficulties, adds Luton. She remembers a 15-year-old boy with learning disabilities who she fostered who was upset he couldn’t be an astronaut when he grew up. “‘I’m going to be a ballerina!’ I said to him. He thought this was hilarious with my crutch. It helped me talk about that fact that, we can’t all do everything, but to ask, what can we do?’” Her experience neatly demonstrates that having more disabled people fostering can be a win-win situation, from finding an as yet untapped pool of foster carers to helping challenge perceptions of disability and creating positive role models for fostered children. As Luton puts it: “There are lots of young people who desperately need care. And there are lots of disabled people who have a lot to offer.” Back in Burnley, Powton is hopeful some progress is being made. His agency has moved the training venue for his area to a more local and accessible venue for him (foster carers are required to have continual training), and he knows of 15 other disabled people in the group. Responding to the new figures on the shortfall in foster families, Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, says: “We encourage everyone who’d like to find out more [about fostering] to get in touch with their local council”. Powton stresses the maths: there are more than 13 million disabled people in the UK, meaning that “recruiting 0.01% of us” could more than solve the problem of the national shortfall in foster carers. First, he says, we are all going to have to start talking openly about disability – whether that’s in foster caring or any other walk of life. “The only way this is ever going to change is a frank conversation about how society treats disabled people and what disabled people can do to change things.” • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "At 240 hectares, the neighbourhood of Aspern, Vienna, is one of the largest urban developments in Europe. By the time it is complete in 2028, it is due to be home to 20,000 people, plus another 20,000 workplaces, and with an explicitly family-oriented design. Centred on an artificial lake and with half of the entire area devoted to public space, it is billed as “Vienna’s Urban Lakeside”: a model city-within-a-city, in a place that already has the one of the highest qualities of life of any city in the world. When Christina Atta moved to Aspern four years ago, she was one of its rare single women. “I was alone with my cats, and everybody had children,” she says. Now she is pregnant with her second child, however, Atta, 35, can better appreciate its design. Her only complaint is that the bus to the city can’t accommodate all the young children. But Aspern isn’t just about families. It was deliberately planned with a brand identity, one that might elsewhere be considered political: all the streets and public spaces are named for women. There are Hannah Arendt Platz, Janis Joplin Promenade, Ada Lovelace Strasse, Madame d’Ora Park and more, chosen by 30 experts. As an official brochure setting out these women’s achievements puts it, “Aspern has a female face” – a small counter to traditional Vienna, where 3,750 streets are named after men. It is symbolic, yes, but makes a clear statement: Aspern specifically takes in to account women and their needs. In this way it embodies a unique approach to urban planning that began shaping Vienna 30 years ago. “Gender mainstreaming” is the practice of ensuring women and men are accounted for equally in policy, legislation and resource allocation. Proposed in 1985, it was enshrined as the UN’s global strategy for gender equality in 1995, but Vienna had adopted it years earlier. The city has since conducted about 60 gender-sensitive pilot projects and assessed another 1,000. As the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Vassilakou, wrote in 2013, gender mainstreaming ensures “fair shares in the city” for all by forcing planning to be approached from different perspectives. But how do pavement widths and bench design relate to gender? And if mainstreaming aims to promote equality, does Vienna’s example prove that it works? “The argument is, you get a fairer society,” says Eva Kail of the city’s strategic planning unit. “As a public administration, to offer good service for the people – to have better quality of life – you have to take care of gender equality.” Kail, one of the world’s pre-eminent experts in gender mainstreaming, was previously the head of Vienna’s first women’s office. Initially called the Frauenburo, the department was established after Kail, then a junior district planner, co-organised a photography exhibition in September 1991 that documented a day in the lives of eight different women and girls – from a young child, to a wheelchair user, to an active retiree. It was a simple concept that showed a side to the city that was rarely considered. Like most European cities then and now, Vienna was being designed by male planners for men like them: going between home and work, by car or public transport, at mostly set times. There was no accounting for unpaid labour such as childcare or shopping, carried out mostly by women, in many short journeys on foot during the day. Sabina Riss, an architect and lecturer at Vienna University of Technology’s Department of Housing, says this male-dominated thinking was evident in most large European cities after the second world war: “They designed cities like there would be no other people than men going to work in the morning and coming back in the evening – everything else in between, they kind of had no idea. And because they are the people who design cities, they are in charge.” With no accounting for their movements, women were being left out of the city. Kail’s exhibition was a surprise hit, drawing 4,000 visitors and sparking public discussion of areas where women felt unsafe, how they got around, and – more broadly – who the city was for. Later, a follow-up postal survey by the women’s organisation of the governing Social Democratic party led to a breakthrough revelation: roughly two-thirds of car journeys were made by men, while two-thirds of those on foot were by women. “That was really an ‘a-ha’ moment,” says Kail. For the first time, she was able to prove that men and women’s experiences of city living were different – and women’s were being overlooked entirely. In April 1992, she was tasked with turning the momentum into concrete change as head of the Frauenburo, which Kail has called “a little bit of a feminist utopia”. At that time Vienna was in a period of rapid expansion. The Iron Curtain had been swept aside, and the government had set a target of building 10,000 new apartments each year. Architecture firms were awarded contracts – but in 30-odd rounds, no women had even been invited to pitch. “Only men were defining the new structure of the city,” says Kail. Her response was to invite only women architects – then just 6% of the profession – to submit proposals for a social housing project north of the city, with women’s everyday life an essential criterion of the design. It was clear that Vienna’s future was in high-density housing; Kail saw this inaugural pilot as an opportunity to prove that taking gender into account resulted in better outcomes for everyone. “I always said we can’t have special conditions, it can’t be more expensive – we have to prove in the mainstream that we produce higher quality,” she says. The result was Frauen-Werk-Stadt (Women-Work-City), a 357-unit complex made by women and completed in 1997. It was characterised by a woman’s perspective at every level: from pram storage on every floor and wide stairwells to encourage neighbourly interactions; to flexible flat layouts and high-quality secondary rooms; to the height of the building, low enough to ensure “eyes upon the street”. “They tried to think it all through, from how you get off the bus to get into your flat,” says Riss. The project was not without challenges. Some of the women brought on to the project were inexperienced, or did not hold feminist views: it was by no means only men who objected to gender mainstreaming in those early years. There was also resistance within the public service. Though the project had the backing of those at the top of the administration, at lower levels there was sometimes openly sexist objection. There were many cases where department heads who had not been against gender mainstreaming in principle revealed themselves to be less amenable to having to apply it themselves. Kail recalls being asked to moderate a cross-disciplinary working group for the traffic plan. “The first session was really horrible … [the men] didn’t accept me as leader of the game,” she says. Over the decades, she developed an arsenal of approaches. Some colleagues were won over by the promise of media attention or internal recognition for their pioneering work in gender mainstreaming; others could be engaged intellectually by the opportunities to learn from this cutting-edge discipline. Kail got very good, she says, at buttonholing influential people during the coffee breaks of meetings. Having shown it could be done with Frauen-Werk-Stadt, the next step was to gender-mainstream the city. Mariahilf, a densely populated central neighbourhood with about 28,000 residents, was designated as a pilot district. During 2002 to 2006, street lighting was improved in 26 areas identified in surveys as inducing anxiety; traffic lights were altered to prioritise pedestrians; and seating was installed in nine new locations. More than a kilometre of pavement was widened, and five areas were made entirely barrier-free, so as to better accommodate prams, wheelchair users and elderly people. The link between wider pavements, benches and gender might be obscure, but Kail says it is a question of ensuring equality of opportunity and access. For example, for an elderly person, a well-placed bench might make the difference between participating in the city and remaining at home. A neat example is the redesign of two parks in the Margareten district in July 1999 to encourage their use by girls, whose number was dropping off from the age of nine. The addition of volleyball and badminton facilities countered boys’ dominance over the caged basketball courts; those courts, meanwhile, were fitted with areas for groups of girls to sit, observe and chat. Improving lighting and footpaths added to their sense of security, encouraging them to linger. Four more parks were devised as pilot projects from 2000 and informed the gender-sensitivity guidelines applied to parks citywide since 2005. That process – of turning gender experts’ local knowledge into general guidelines for the whole municipality – has been described as ideal in terms of implementation of gender mainstreaming. In the absence of measures to ensure different users’ needs are taken into account, only those of the dominant group are served. Kail notes that transport planners had thought to devise standards for car parks, but not ramps for bikes or prams, “because they thought it didn’t matter”. When the women’s office opened nearly 30 years ago, transport planners were exclusively “white, middle-class men,” she says – “and car drivers in the city looked like them”. When the city is viewed only as though through a windscreen, women feel the absence of measures to benefit pedestrians in a way that men typically do not. As Kail has put it: “if you want to do something for women, do something for pedestrians”. “It is very political, what is regulated and what is neglected,” she says. Gender mainstreaming has been criticised as cementing traditional gender roles – for example, by equating childcare with women’s work – but she takes a pragmatic view. “You can’t influence the share of unpaid work by architecture, but you can support it. We would hope it would support 50% of men as well – but statistics show it is still more women doing that work.” Similarly, she betrays an uncharacteristic trace of frustration at the suggestion that attempting to make women more safe by installing lighting absolves would-be attackers of responsibility. Lighting may not prevent sexual assault, she says, but it can alleviate women’s feelings of anxiety, improving their access to the city – and when they are faced with a potential threat, lighting improves their ability to assess the situation. The line between feminist ideals of equality and practical steps to benefit the majority of women is one that gender mainstreaming sometimes straddles uneasily. Ursula Bauer, one of Kail’s first appointments, now heads the city’s cross-sectional gender mainstreaming department. “Our aim is to make sure that all the infrastructure and services of the city can be equally used by women and men … and contribute towards a more gender equal society.” Within the administration, it serves an intermediary role. “We try to translate feminist or gender equality to the departments who deal with the population,” says Bauer – but only, she and Kail agree, insofar as it is necessary to achieve their goal. In the early years, Bauer and Kail agree that they leaned too much on feminist ideals to make the case for gender-sensitive planning. Eventually, they realised it was counterproductive to their primary goal: not to wave the flag for feminism, but to make women’s lives in Vienna easier and more equal. Wolfgang Gerlich of the PlanSinn consultancy, which advised on the Aspern project, is sometimes called on to advocate for gender mainstreaming when a man’s voice is seen as more authoritative. He remembers hosting a workshop in the early 2000s that was attended by a German feminist planning expert and men from the city’s construction department. “It was a glorious, very valuable failure,” he says. “There was no effect except irritation. Then we completely changed the strategy.” One of the techniques in this new inclusive approach was to ask sceptics to think of what they’d wish for their daughter or niece, says Gerlich, “as a means of creating empathy and making it personal”. Another tool is “the four-R method”, asking “Who gets what and why, or why not?” to raise awareness of representation, resources, reality and rights. Gerlich says there is a segment of the Viennese population – mostly men who drive cars – who resent gender mainstreaming because they are fearful of loss: of quality of life in the city, but also of power. “Of course they are not happy,” he says. But any rumble of backlash against gender mainstreaming has struggled to gain traction when the message from the city’s highest offices has been one of unwavering support. Statements and symbols have helped to make that clear, such as the introduction of gender-sensitive language and titles to its corporate branding and, on the underground train network, posters to raise awareness of vulnerable passengers that represent men and women equally. Today gender mainstreaming principles are enshrined in policy, with sanctions for those who do not comply. “Gender budgeting”, for example, introduced in 2005, requires each department to report twice a year on how their expenditure has benefited men and women equally. New housing projects must meet gender sensitivity criteria to be subsidised – a sort of checklist to ensure that mainstreaming is not dependent on individual interest. This, Kail has written, is a greater achievement than she could ever have imagined back in 1991. After 26 years, it is now fairly common practice in Vienna to approach city living through a gender lens – and in 2008, the UN Human Settlements programme recognised Vienna’s urban planning strategy as best practice. It is striking that other cities are only lately looking to follow in its example, with Berlin, Barcelona and Copenhagen all beginning to incorporate gender mainstreaming into their urban design. In 2013 Stockholm began implementing gender-sensitive snow clearing, where the routes most used by women – such as footpaths around daycare centres – were cleared earlier in the day. But the fact that the policy was subsequently blamed for long delays (apparently without grounds) shows just how much scepticism there is about strategies to achieve gender equality – or even the need for them at all. But the more imminent threat to the city’s housing standards is growth. Vienna needs 130,000 new residential units by 2025, and stretched public resources could force compromises in quality, gender sensitivity among them. “I think it’s already in process,” says Riss. New private developments far short of the high standard set for social housing, she says. “They sell flats with really bad floor plans, they don’t care about stairwells that have daylight or communication between neighbours. All of these achievements that have been implemented – they don’t apply any more.” Gender must also now compete with other, sometimes conflicting, concerns – climate resilience, migration, the better-access lobby – for resources and attention. But after nearly 30 years, gender mainstreaming is nearly procedural, almost embedded in the municipality mentality. Aspern doesn’t feel like a “feminist utopia”, as Kail once described the women’s office. Rather, it comes across – in its cohesion, sense of established community and lively public spaces – as simply a very well-designed neighbourhood. Therein lies the importance of gender mainstreaming, says Kail, as well as the difficulty in arguing its case: “If it didn’t happen, we would feel it. But as long as it happens, we don’t see it. “If they’ve really accepted it, it becomes invisible.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "transcript": "There is a problem with European elections: they are not very European. When EU citizens go to the polls this month, they will vote under national electoral laws, for candidates representing national parties, campaigning on domestic issues. The “Europarties” the newly elected MEPs will join are not parties at all but loose, often fractious coalitions, so a vote for Germany’s Christian Democratic Union party also amounts to a vote for the far-right populists of Fidesz – unless the Hungarian nationalist party is finally expelled from the European centre-right group, EPP, to which both belong. More than 60 years of European union have, in short, signally failed to create anything that might reasonably be called a European political space. “European democracy is still, basically, the sum of the EU’s national democracies,” said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at the HEC business school in Paris who has been studying and advocating for truly transnational parties for more than two decades. “We don’t yet have a European politics – there’s no real pan-European public opinion, no transnational political debate or dialogue on the issues that affect our common interests as Europeans – unemployment, the environment, migration, data protection. But as the need increases, it’s starting to come.” Previous attempts at a cross-border European politics have made little progress. In the early 2000s, the Greens began working towards a pan-European network, fielding candidates outside their home countries. In 2009 the Newropeans, a short-lived mini-party, won a grand total of 36,871 votes in the Netherlands, Germany and France. The most recent transnational stirrings have come, paradoxically, from the far-right fringe: by building a common discourse, focusing on just one or two hot-button Europe-wide issues such as immigration, and consistently attacking the EU, rightwingers have “actually Europeanised Europe’s politics in a way no moderate national party has even attempted”, Alemanno said. But progressives are now trying too. Imagined the day after the Brexit referendum by Colombe Cahen-Salvador, now 25, a French human rights lawyer, her partner, Andrea Venzon, 27, an Italian consultant, and a German friend, Damian Boeselager, 30, a pro-European group called Volt hopes to become the first true pan-EU party to win seats in the parliament. National parties “completely fail” on the European level, said Venzon. “At any EU election meeting in any member state, the discussion will be 90% national issues and 10% how the EU must change to better serve national interests. National interests always come first, even in pro-European parties.” Entirely crowd-funded, Volt claims 25,000 members, aged from 14 to 92, in 32 countries. It is registered as a political party in 12 and will field candidates in eight, said Cahen-Salvador. Supporters spent 18 months debating its policies bottom-up, online and in meetups before agreeing a platform in Amsterdam late last year. Nothing if not ambitious, its goals include “fixing the EU” by allowing MEPs to propose laws and member states to decide by majority rather than unanimous vote, and ensuring the bloc’s funds are invested to make a palpable difference to ordinary Europeans’ lives – in education and infrastructure, to create jobs. Other groups are attempting similar exercises. The left-leaning European Spring, headed by Greece’s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, its lead candidate in Berlin, is a coalition of small, radical national parties rather than a single pan-European party but will nonetheless present a single reformist programme – a “New Deal for Europe” – to the EU electorate. Also standing on a common platform in more than one EU country is a rather different kind of group: Génération Identitaire, which bills itself as “a political movement for young people from all across Europe … fighting mass immigration and the Islamisation of Europe” and has made headlines staging anti-immigration stunts in the southern Alps and the Mediterranean. No matter how they fare, however, the energetic young activists behind Volt – who will do well to win more than a couple of seats – will have performed miracles by getting even as far as they have, because single pan-European parties are made all but impossible by the tangled web of differing national electoral law across the EU. In Italy, 150,000 signatures, including at least 3,000 in each region, are required to run in European elections, all authenticated on the spot by a notary. In France, a party must pass a 5% threshold to win seats – but even more dauntingly, it must pay the cost of printing its ballot papers: €800,000-€1m. In Denmark, 70,000-odd signatures must be collected no later than eight weeks before the election – but EU nationals can only register to vote 12 weeks before the date. Portugal may demand just 7,500 signatures, but all – along with the new party’s statutes and mission statement – must be approved by the constitutional court. And in Britain, where Volt managed a respectable 4.2% in Manchester local elections this month, Venzon is having to stand as an independent in London because, 10 weeks after filing its application, the movement still has not been formally recognised as a political party by the Electoral Commission. Despite determined attempts in more than a dozen countries, Volt is fielding candidates only in Sweden, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Flemish-speaking Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Bulgaria. “It’s crazy,” said Cahen-Salvador. “These laws are massive obstacles to a European democracy. They need to be harmonised.” The party is, however, likely to benefit from a civic society that is slowly but surely becoming more Europeanised. Springing up often over the past two or three years in the wake of Brexit and strong performances by far-right parties in elections in the Netherlands and France, initiatives such as Stand up for Europe and Pulse of Europe have mobilised large numbers in defence of the European project. “I’ve campaigned in 15 or 16 European countries and there’s no doubt people feel the cross-border fears, hopes and challenges are the same all over,” said Volt’s Venzon. “Jobs, the environment … the basis is so clearly there for a real, functioning European democracy – but the structure just isn’t. Not yet.” For Alemanno, we are “finally in at the birth of a European political space. It’s slow, it’s hesitant, it’s painful, it’s repeatedly being knocked back by national politics, nobody knows what form it will eventually take … And it will include anti-Europeans, for sure. But it is clearly developing.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "date": "2019-05-10",
    "transcript": "In his bridge-club cords and grandpa shoes, 80-year-old Yvon Chouinard doesn’t look the rock-star entrepreneur. And, when he speaks, he doesn’t sound much like one either. The founder of US outdoor apparel brand Patagonia believes stock market valuations are “absurd”, investing in shares is “buying blue sky” – and modern-day capitalism is destroying the planet. “I’d like to see an end to public corporations because we’re not going to revolutionise them, we’re not going to change them,” the self-confessed reluctant businessman told the Guardian. It is easy to dismiss such comments as sour grapes or market envy. As a private company (Chouinard remains sole owner), Patagonia lacks the investment clout of Nike or The North Face. Not that that has necessarily restricted the plucky Californian brand, which posted sales revenues of more than $1bn last year. A soft-spoken former climber hailed by some as the Steve Jobs of eco-conscious commerce, Chouinard is not your usual businessman. Based in the small Californian town of Ventura, he eschews publicity and prefers gardening to board meetings. He set up his first company – a small climbing equipment firm – more than 50 years ago only because no one was selling the kind of pitons he wanted. In 1973, he established Patagonia to help finance the low-margin equipment firm. Despite Patagonia’s exponential growth, Chouinard insists his company has sought to remain true to its eco-conscious origins. He cites the brand’s decision to use 100% organic cotton in its garments and to donate 10% of its profits (or 1% of sales – whichever is greater) to environmental charities by way of example. Patagonia is far from perfect, however. By his own admission, the idea of a fully sustainable business or product is impossible: “There is no such thing as sustainability. The best we can do is cause the least amount of harm.” Instead of “sustainable”, he prefers the term “responsible”, which, he argues, starts with companies treating nature not as a resource to be exploited but as a unique, life-giving entity on which we all – not least business – depend. Chouinard may have his acolytes among eco-conscious consumers, but he doubts mainstream companies are listening to his reforming message. “I used to think that if we could show that being a responsible business is good business, then others would follow. And some do, but they’re tiny little companies. But the public companies, they’re all green-washing. I have no hope that they’re going to change.” Nor does he hold out much hope for government to force big business to act more responsibly. Politicians are “pawns of corporations” says the man who, together with a coalition of indigenous North American tribes and grassroots groups, is currently suing the Trump administration for attempts to reduce the size of ancestral lands in Utah. Our best hope for change lies with consumers, Chouinard maintains: “You’ve got to change the consumers first and then the corporations will follow and then government will follow the corporations. They [governments] are last in line.” Hence, his recent appearance in New York, where Patagonia was premiering a new documentary at the Tribeca film festival about the dangers to wild salmon of fish hatcheries and open-net fish farms. The film, entitled Artifishal, is intentionally provocative, Chouinard admits. “People don’t read any more and they make decisions based on emotions, so I think film is the best way to elicit people’s emotions.” Eliciting consumers’ emotions is not without its risks, of course. One of the chief beneficiaries of salmon hatcheries are recreational anglers, a key consumer group for Patagonia. Chouinard says he couldn’t care less: if he loses business, so be it. “I absolutely don’t believe in doing … focus groups and all that shit. Proctor and Gamble-style, no risk. Just do it,” he says. The same thinking lay behind his decision in 2011 to run an ad campaign on Black Friday, the busiest day in the US retail calendar, with the tagline: ‘Don’t Buy This Jacket’. But 50 years of activism has seen Chouinard lose as many battles as he has won; high-profile campaigns against ocean pollution and genetically modified food are two notable cases in point. Failure, fortunately, doesn’t seem to dishearten him. “If you expect victories, then you’re in the wrong business. Evil never stops. And it’s just a matter of endless fighting … the fight is the important thing.” For all his talk of evil, it would be tempting to think Chouinard was religious. He is not. The money that is being spent on going to Mars “to see if God is up there”, he jokes, would be better spent on “doing some actual good”. As he enters his ninth decade, the appetite of this business pioneer to disrupt the status quo appears to be growing, not shrinking. Sparking his radicalism is the election of populist leaders, such as the US’s Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, whom he accuses of riding roughshod over nature. More important still is the looming threat of climate change and massive species loss. As he told the audience at Tribeca: “The polar bear is toast.” It’s time for brands to become more vocally political, he argues. Consumers, especially among the young, increasingly expect their favourite brands to speak out, he says. Chouinard, for one, leaves little doubt where his politics lie. When President Trump announced his decision to slash corporate taxes, for example, Patagonia announced it would give away the money saved. That added another $10m to its charitable outgoings, bringing to $105m (£80m) the total lifetime amount donated to environmental causes. Chouinard sees it as an act of “karma”: “After all, we don’t need it, we’re debt-free.” Similarly, plans are afoot to jazz up Patagonia’s political advertising. Rather than just call on the US public to vote for the environment, it now intends to specifically endorse pro-conservation candidates, says Chouinard. “We simply can’t pussyfoot around anymore. We have to just say, you know, this administration is evil and anybody who is denying climate change is evil.” Such moves will provoke controversy without doubt. Not that Chouinard cares. As he likes to advise graduating students, life is easier if you break the rules rather than conform to them. “Invent your own game and that way you can always be a winner.” • This article was updated on May 20 to remove an earlier inaccuracy which stated that Patagonia gained 600,000 new customers and year-on-year sales quadrupled as a result of its 2011 campaign Don’t Buy This Jacket.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/08/how-the-las-vegas-of-italy-is-kicking-its-gambling-addiction-pavia",
    "date": "2019-05-08",
    "transcript": "At the start of this year, Massimo was standing on a bridge “determined to jump off”. The 45-year-old had been struggling with gambling addiction since 2001. “I started to play slot machines and video poker after the death of my father and ended up spending €5,000 a day,” says the artisan fence-maker, from the city of Pavia in northern Italy. He was soon in debt to loan sharks and ended up stealing to fund his habit, including from his own mother, before considering suicide. Now Massimo (not his real name) lives in La Casa del Giovane, a unit that houses 100 patients suffering from addictions. Around half of the cases involve gambling – a symptom of an epidemic that has gripped Pavia for more than a decade. For centuries the city was best known as “Oxford on Ticino”: it hosts one of the country’s most prestigious universities, founded in 1361, and a beautiful medieval castle. Built about 25 miles south of Milan on the ancient Via Francigena pilgrim route running from France to Rome, its historic centre is currently a candidate to become a Unesco world heritage site. That reputation changed in 2013 when the city was identified as Italy’s “capital of gambling”, with a video or slot gambling machine for every 104 inhabitants. Although Italians never flocked there to gamble – Pavia is no Vegas or Atlantic City – local media nicknamed it “the Italian Las Vegas”. “We had realised something new was going on in 2004, when a 14-year-old boy brought in his father, who was showing clear signs of gambling addiction,” recalls Simone Feder, a psychologist heading the facility’s addiction programme. “Soon after, a very bourgeois-looking elderly couple asked for our help: the husband had gambled away all their money.” Since then Feder says he has treated patients of all ages and walks of life. Pavia was shocked to hit the headlines this way, but not everybody simply accepted the news: a small group of residents self-organised into a grassroots movement called SenzaSlot (“without slot machines”) to fight the addiction. Their efforts are finally bearing fruit. “One day I went into a bar and I could not hear the noise of the spoon with which I was mixing sugar in my coffee because of the noise of coins being inserted into slot machines,” says the group’s Pietro Pace, a computer scientist. “Inside there were people who were burning their entire salary.” Many residents blame the city’s problems on the shift it has experienced since the 1970s, when its mechanical goods industry hit troubled times and its population fell from a high of around 87,000 (it is currently 72,000). Now the main sources of employment are the hospital and the university, and Pavia has become a dormitory city for Milan, the industrial powerhouse to its north. “On a cultural level, there’s not much to do,” says Giulia Cavaliere, an editor and writer who has lived in Pavia all her life. “It’s a wealthy city but the mentality here is rather closed. There’s just one movie theatre. The university is the only thing that is keeping the city alive, ensuring a constant flow of young people.” SenzaSlot says these factors all came together to make Pavia particularly susceptible to gambling addiction. In the mid-2000s, after the national government removed restrictions, gaming machines began to spread through the city’s bars and cafes. Suddenly residents would stumble upon a gambling opportunity every time they bought a cappuccino. “The city filled with slots and video poker machines,” recalls Ludovica Cassetta, another SenzaSlot activist. “It took a few years, but it was a constant process. We reached the point where bars looked like they were all about gambling, as if regular costumers didn’t matter any more.” By 2013 Pavia had 647 slot machines and the highest per capita spending on gambling in Italy: €1,600 a year. SenzaSlot’s first project was a website to map the few bars and cafes in the city that did not have slot machines. It now also provides gambling-free bars with a window sticker to highlight their lack of machines and runs events to inform residents, especially schoolchildren, about the dangers of gambling. The group offers legal support to cafe owners who want to remove slot machines from their premises – which is not as straightforward as it might sound. Pubs and cafes don’t directly operate the machines, which are owned and managed by separate companies that give bar owners a share of revenues. Installing a new slot machine is easy, but removing one can be hard: there is the loss of income (around €500 to €750 a month per machine) and the likelihood that the bar will have to pay a penalty (typically around €8,000 per machine) for breaking a contract. “If you hold a pair of slot machines in your bar, they bring you €1,000 to €1,500 each month, which allows many to pay the rent,” says Riccardo Bernasconi, owner of Sottovento, a slot-free snack bar. He says many bar owners agree to host the machines because the companies that operate them throw in credit card payment systems free of charge. Bernasconi has vowed never to host gaming machines, because most of his customers are students who he feels are too young to understand the dangers. By contrast, Matteo Tacchinardi, owner of the century-old Bar Italia, has hosted gaming machines for more than a decade. He considered getting rid of them but says he could not afford the penalty. “I would have to pay €8,000 for every machine, and it’s too much for me,” he says. Nevertheless, upset at the sight of his customers “throwing away their money”, he refuses to change bills into coins if he knows they will be used in the machines. But the SenzaSlot movement has made inroads, and now has the local authorities on its side. The former mayor of Pavia, Massimo Depaoli, introduced restrictions limiting when the machines can operate to eight hours a day – from 10am to 1pm and 6pm to 11pm – in an effort to reduce use by vulnerable groups such as children and older people. The city council has also introduced a rule forbidding the opening of any new slot machines within 500 metres of a school, church or retirement community. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t touch the existing slot machines because we have to wait until the end of the contract,” says Depaoli, who stepped down last month. “But Pavia is not a very large city, so it is hard to find places that don’t fall in the restricted areas.” The municipality has barred slot machines from premises it owns, and offered slot-free bars and cafes longer opening hours on public holidays as an incentive to make the shift. The policies appear to be having an effect. By the end of last year, the number of gambling machines in Pavia had fallen from 642 to 547, with the per capita spend down 25% to €1,200. The SenzaSlot activists, meanwhile, welcome the latest moves but say the wider fight is not yet won. “True, our city is trying to limit slots,” says Cassetta, “but the fact is there are plenty of towns nearby that don’t have any anti-slot regulations. People can just go there to gamble.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "title": "A cold-water cure? My weekend with the ‘Ice Man’",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/08/wim-hof-cold-water-immersion-cure-ice-man-outdoor-swimming",

    "transcript": "“Look at this beautiful tree. An oak, Quercus robur. It’s yelling at us, ‘Helloooo!’” says Wim Hof, the doyen of cold endurance stunts, as we head across Hampstead Heath, north London, for a swim in one of the ponds. Soon he’s catapulting himself into a gaping hole in its trunk, peeping out excitedly like a child. “Here I am, talking to the tree,” he beams. “I see the tree has personality. I go in. We are one. It’s alive. We are alive. Is that crazy? Bloody crazy! Yes I am.” Best known for trying to scale Mount Everest in only a pair of shorts and hiking boots, Hof has broken more world records than even he can count. His feats include a near-fatal 57-metre swim under ice during which he went temporarily blind, and a barefoot half-marathon in the Arctic. He’s also immersed himself in a tub of ice for almost two hours, warmed only by the power of his mind and self-styled breathing techniques. Scientists have begun studying his methods to evaluate if they can offer universal benefits to people. “Live your body, stimulate your body,” he implores. “Arthritis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, depression – all of those diseases are a result of our neglected biochemistry. We need to be stimulated to help fight disease. Cold is a great stimulator.” Hof and I have come to the pond for what feels like a sort of graduation. A day earlier, I attended a “Wim Hof Method” workshop at London’s Roundhouse to learn about his breathing techniques and how regular cold immersion could boost my immune system and reduce chronic inflammation within my body. Today I’m testing my tolerance to nature’s elements. I’m not the only one. Cold-water swimming has enjoyed a huge surge in popularity in recent years, with the Outdoor Swimming Society growing from 300 followers in 2006 to 40,000 members this year. “It’s like a tribe,” says the society’s founder, Kate Rew. “It used to be an eccentric thing, people doing it once or twice as a dare, but now it has an entire identity. It gives you such a feeling of mental calmness and physical robustness that it turns people into missionaries. Everyone who tries it tells their friends and they bring another five people.” As I stand on the jetty looking out across the pond – the bright spring sunshine flaring off the water’s surface – I’m concerned about the water temperature. I was told by one enthusiast that between 0 and 5C is considered cold, “but if it gets up to six you’re not ice swimming”. I sheepishly turn towards the lifeguard’s hut to see today’s temperature scrawled on the chalkboard: “7C,” it says. “Is this cheating?” I ask Hof, who is already topless. “No, no, it’s still cold,” he assures me. Superhero ___________________________ It’s 24 hours earlier, and I am lying on a yoga mat at the nearby Roundhouse under a haze of purple lights, breathing intently. “Fully in, fully out. Fully in, fully out,” cries Hof from the stage, as more than 700 people hyperventilate in unison. Among them are yoga teachers, life coaches, cold-water swimmers, medical professionals and those, such as Tomasz Radecki from Poland, who have simply been inspired by Hof’s message of hope. “I first saw Wim on YouTube and he said, ‘anything inside us is within our reach’ and ‘whatever limitations we set ourselves, it’s all bullshit’,” Radecki recalls. “To me it was like being an ordinary person and suddenly realising that I can be a superhero, too.” Breathing is one of the three main pillars of the Wim Hof Method, alongside cold exposure and commitment. Over a period of 30 minutes, Hof instructs us to fill our lungs rapidly before emptying them passively, in a fashion developed from an ancient Tibetan technique, Tummo. Every so often we hold our breath for as long as we can. The idea is to mimic the natural gasping reflex we experience when we enter cold environments, thereby decreasing the amount of CO2 in our bodies. Nick (above) reacts during the breathing exercise at the Wim Hof Method event. Photographs by Jonny Weeks Soon the effect is so intoxicating that the muscles in my forearms contract, my arms raise involuntarily from my chest and my fingers curl into claws. Around me, people are writhing on their mats, some weeping or howling like wolves. “Release all trauma. Liberate. Your future. Your mind. Your soul. Who are you? What are you?” urges Hof, before stepping off-stage to attend to Wayne Sequoia, whose limbs are jerking so violently it rouses me from my stupor. “I left my body,” Sequoia tells me afterwards, his speech slow and slurred. “I had this intense feeling; I did a somersault over or through myself. It was a complete loss of control, death, I don’t know. It felt like a huge healing.” Another participant, Nick, is similarly delirious. “My wife gave birth to two children not long ago and I can really say I felt the birthing process in my gut,” he says. “I’m a physician and if somebody told me this would happen today I would think they’re crazy. It was completely amazing.” But not everyone is euphoric. “I just wanted to cry, to sob, but I couldn’t let it out,” says Karren Probyn. “It seemed like there was no end.” Fight or flight ___________________________ True to Hof’s eccentric character, the 60-year-old’s first experience of cold water was spontaneous. Aged 17 and wandering alongside a frozen canal in Amsterdam, he felt a sudden urge to jump in. “Sometimes you don’t know why but you feel attracted to do something,” he explains. For many years thereafter, Hof was a local oddity known as the “Ice Man”, a guy who would walk his children to school barefoot and do handstands and splits in the snow while the other parents looked at him perplexed. “They stood there smoking, saying, ‘Look at him, he’s crazy’,” he says. Over time, opinion slowly changed. Wim Hof at Hampstead Heath men’s pond. Photograph by Jonny Weeks The tragedy of his first wife’s suicide in 1995, as a consequence of her schizophrenia, fomented his belief that cold-water swimming – and his breathing techniques – are a panacea for inflammatory diseases. “We are estranged from our own deeper physiology because we are no longer in contact with nature,” he explains. “Instead, we are controlling nature with air pollution, heating, technology. But you have to know you have a depth within yourself which needs to be stimulated. If it doesn’t get stimulated it becomes weaker, like a muscle that’s not being used any more.” Hof claims his method activates the body’s “fight or flight” adrenal response, which in turn reduces chronic inflammation. What’s more, he claims he can regulate his immune response to stress – a feat previously considered impossible because the immune system is autonomic. Scientists have begun to pore over his theories. In one logic-defying experiment, he was able to maintain his core body temperature while encased in ice. In another he was injected with an E coli endotoxin that would ordinarily induce sickness, yet he showed no major symptoms. Accusations that he is simply a freak of nature were quashed when he taught a group of volunteers his methods and they, too, showed the same remarkable results. Professor Peter Pickkers, of Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, who conducted the E coli tests, told me: “We found that [his method] results in major changes in oxygen and CO2 levels and an increase in adrenaline to really high levels – higher than observed in people who bungee-jump for the first time. “Higher adrenaline results in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and this inhibits the inflammatory response. We were really surprised that we found these results. The fact that you can influence your immune response willingly with these techniques is of interest, especially for patients with autoimmune diseases.” However, he cautions: “We are very reluctant to say it may cure diseases because we have so little data. Assuming there is a beneficial effect, my guess would be that the effects can only be there as long as you practise the techniques – likely not longer than a day.” Watching Hof on stage, it’s clear that his desire to help others is genuine, even if his evangelical tone and occasional hyperbole could stoke a cultish faith among those seeking “wellness”. “Anybody is able to doubt me,” Hof says. “I say, ‘Come with your criticism to polish the diamond of the truth.’ People need to wake up to their own power. Everybody has this nature.” Feel-good factor ___________________________ Participants take an ice bath at the Wim Hof Method event. Photographs by Jonny Weeks Back at the Roundhouse, a line of half-naked people is snaking out into the car park for the day’s big challenge. Everyone is waiting to enter the four inflatable paddling pools, which are being filled with ice. The first participants gingerly lower themselves in, motivated by a combination of peer pressure and willpower. Two minutes – that’s their target. For some the experience is visibly excruciating; for others it’s a thrilling sensation. One woman buries her head face-down in the ice and emerges 10 seconds later with a broad smile. The man next to her seems put off by such showboating and quits after a minute. Catherine Girvan climbs out and begins performing the “horse stance” to warm up. “I was swimming in the pond at Hampstead Heath up until November last year when my husband passed away,” she tells me. “This is my first time [practising cold immersion] since then, and I got a bit of a shock, but I really enjoyed it. It’s all about the endorphins, the serotonin, the feel-good factor. I’m 73 and I’m not on a pill so something’s working.” Catherine Girvan (above) doing the ‘horse stance’ after her ice bath Exactly what is “working” remains a mystery, however. A 2017 review of past scientific studies, titled “Cold water immersion: kill or cure”, found a bounty of evidence dating back to the 16th century regarding the potential health implications of cold-water immersion. Its co-author, Michael Tipton, professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth, says: “I believe that cold-water immersion works for a lot of people but we can’t say precisely why. “There’s an absolute raft of anecdotal evidence but what it can’t tell you is whether the benefits are derived from going into the open air, being with friends, exercising, or being in the cold. There’s not yet been a study that has isolated the cold factor. “The closest we’ve come was a study of upper respiratory tract infections, where we found that people who go cold- and open-water swimming have fewer infections than their partners who are exposed to the same pathogens. However we also found that they don’t have fewer infections than people who go indoor swimming [in heated water]. So the jury is still out.” He adds: “It may be that cold-water swimming works for people because of a placebo effect. But so what? If it works for them and if it’s not harmful, and if it’s removing their dependency on drugs, then great.” After my turn in the ice bath, my body feels unexpectedly warm, so much so I don’t even rush to dry off or get dressed; I’m supercharged with adrenaline for at least an hour. Birthright ___________________________ On the jetty at Hampstead ponds the following morning, Hof is getting changed when Dermot Sullivan, a regular cold-water swimmer, requests a picture. “Do you know about the new documentary, The Ponds?” he asks. “Some of their stories really shook me up. People have had depression, cancer, they’re going through bereavement, and they come here. One woman said, ‘If you can cope with two-degree water, you can cope with anything.’” On a personal note, he adds: “For me it doesn’t resolve life’s problems, but it’s like momentum.” Jonny Weeks (above) after swimming at the men’s pond Hof offers encouragement before racing down the ladder into the water. As I hesitate, I’m reminded of his earlier words at the oak tree: “My mission is to bring happiness, strength and health to all. It’s a birthright,” he says. “But if you want to become strong, happy and healthy, you’d better do this shit.” • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-05-07",
    "transcript": "Governments need to ramp up investment in nature restoration and raise the tax burden on companies that degrade wildlife, according to recommendations made to the G7 group of rich nations. The proposals are part of a growing debate on how to radically change humanity’s relationship with nature in the wake of a new UN mega-report that showed an alarming decline in the Earth’s life-support systems. They were presented by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) at the meeting this weekend in Metz, France, of environment ministers from the G7 nations – the US, Germany, Japan, the UK, Canada, France and Italy – along with observers including India, Indonesia, Mexico and Egypt. The head of the OECD, Angel Gurría, told the gathering the world was heading for catastrophe as a result of the degradation of nature and needed a new culture that “respects nature and life”. He pointed out that environment-related taxes currently accounted for only 1.6% of global economic output. And only a hundredth of that fraction generated revenue for biodiversity. “It’s microscopic,” said Gurría. “So what our tax policies essentially tell us is that we do not care about biodiversity. There is potential to scale these up, while also protecting the poorest and most vulnerable from their effects.” The balance of incentives also needs to shift, according to the OECD report he unveiled, which found that finance flows for biodiversity may be as little as $50bn (£38bn) a year, which is just a tenth of the subsidies paid to fossil fuel companies and agribusiness, the main drivers for the climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse. A switch of priorities could redirect economic systems towards natural growth rather than material extraction, but it will be politically difficult. Many legislators rely on financial backing from energy companies and farm lobbies to win elections. The main stock indexes in London, New York and Tokyo are heavily dependent on mining and petroleum companies. Millions of jobs are at stake. But the potential economic benefits are far greater, according to both the OECD and the UN, especially when compared with the trillions of dollars that are already being lost each year as a result of climate instability, soil erosion, pollinator loss and water pollution. The primary lever for change is financial incentives and capacity building, according to the global assessment report that was launched on Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Ipbes). The authors said they had considered a variety of scenarios but the only one that was likely to have an effect was “transformative change”, which required new economic models, less reliance on GDP, a cross-governmental focus on the environment, and a review of values so that concepts of happiness were no longer associated so closely with material consumption. Unusually for UN reports – which depend on consensus – the study predicted a confrontation over remedial policies. “By its very nature, transformative change can expect opposition from those with interests vested in the status quo, but such opposition can be overcome for the broader public good,” it said. The recommended measures are by definition world-changing. They also include more ecological education and greater recognition of the rights of indigenous communities and other forest dwellers, who have proved the most effective defenders of nature. Public opinion has become more receptive of change in many countries. School strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests have raised the profile of the multiple environmental crises the world faces. Politicians in the US and Europe are pushing for green new deals that would create more jobs in renewables and nature restoration. Scientists are increasingly speaking out about the alarming trends. “Place the Ipbes report next to the IPCC 1.5C report and you have a full picture of a planetary emergency. Science cannot be more clear. The world needs to transform. Now,” tweeted the climate scientist Johan Rockström. Such messages are increasingly finding an audience among economists, financiers and bankers as the costs of inaction become clearer. The head of the UN’s biodiversity organisation, Cristiana Paşca Palmer, said she was encouraged by the growing debate, which comes ahead of a series of global meetings between now and a pivotal conference in Kunming, China, in 2020 that aims to reset international strategies for dealing with the climate and nature crises. “Loss of nature is fundamentally an economic problem,” said the former biologist. “Solutions and tools are available to avert the crisis but it requires scaled-up investment flows for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, as well as incentives to change the way we consume, produce and dispose of material goods. Above all, it requires a profound change in the fundamentals of growth models and development paradigms to recognise the value of natural capital.” But there is also a strong and growing argument that the concept of capital itself is at the root of the planet’s current problems because current economic models are predicated on endless growth, extraction and consumption – which are impossible on a finite planet. Instead of tallying the value of nature in dollars, which could simply lead to further commodification, many people believe nature should be recognised for its essential, incalculable role as the foundation of life. This flips the debate: instead of justifying nature in economic terms, it should be up to businesses to justify their activities in environmental terms. This is not yet on the table of most global conferences. But for the first time in many years, there is a high-level debate about the destructive nature of the current economic model. The next step, says scientists, is for the issue to be taken up by heads of state at this summer’s G7 summit in France and for people on the streets to continue pushing for a decisive move away from business as usual.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/07/reversing-the-brain-drain-how-plovdiv-lures-young-bulgarians-home",
    "date": "2019-05-07",
    "transcript": "In Plovdiv, Bulgaria, locals are taking long, leisurely walks along the main pedestrian street. Nearby is the Dzhumaya mosque with its mix of Byzantine and Old Bulgarian architectural styles. The unhurried atmosphere is typical of the laidback character of Plovdiv, one of Europe’s oldest continuously inhabited cities. It is this relaxed pace of life, combined with affordable living expenses and the city’s expanding IT sector, that is attracting a new type of citizen to the city: young Bulgarian returnees disillusioned with life abroad. Maria Stancheva, 25, moved with her mother to the UK in search of a better life. Ten years ago, Bulgarians abroad could support their families with one salary. Now, with political upheavals such as Brexit and changing financial markets, foreign capitals are no longer so attractive. This is certainly true for Stancheva, who studied international relations and human resources in Cardiff for four years. On graduation she found it impossible to get a job in her field. After visiting a career fair aimed at Bulgarians in the UK she realised her skills were needed – in Bulgaria. Now a recruitment specialist at the Plovdiv-based outsourcing company 60k, Stancheva says: “My salary is low, but my living standards here are better.” Reflecting on her decision to return, Stancheva points out that for Bulgarians, the grass is not always greener in another country. “We face challenges and uncertainty. With a potential Brexit it can get worse for Bulgarians in the UK.” Bulgaria has experienced a huge dip in its population over the past 20 years, falling from nearly 9 million to just over 7 million at the end of 2017, according to the National Statistical Institute (NSI). Current forecasts predict that by 2050 the population will have shrunk by another quarter. Emigration explains two-thirds of this loss (the remaining third is due to declining birth rates). In 2017, 31,586 Bulgarians changed their current address to one abroad. “We have an entire Bulgarian capital living abroad,” says Stancheva. It is not simply that huge numbers of Bulgarians are leaving: also, every second emigrant is young, in the 20-39 age bracket, according to the NSI. The most popular destinations for Bulgarians heading abroad are Germany (22%), the UK (16.3%) and Spain (12.2%). But in Plovdiv, Bulgaria’s second-largest city, newcomers outnumbered leavers in 2017, defying the national trend. Statistics from the office of the mayor, Ivan Totev, show a 7% increase in 20- to 29-year-olds in the city. “We are already reversing the brain drain, by offering young Bulgarians a lifestyle they could not afford abroad,” said Svetoslav Braykov, 60k’s regional manager, speaking from the company’s offices in a tall corporate building squeezed between old Soviet apartment blocks on the outskirts of town. “People are still leaving Bulgaria, but before they did not return.” The company employs 1,550 people in Sofia, Bulgaria’s capital, and Plovdiv and offers work to students and graduates in the early stages of their careers. It appears to target its recruitment strategy at those whose experience abroad did not live up to their expectations. Traditionally, Plovdiv’s largest employer has been the manufacturing sector, but since the city began to reinvent itself as a European hub for urban development in 2014, the IT sector and its higher-than-average wages has been at the forefront of the city’s image. Outsourcing companies are also keen to copy cities such as Tallinn in Estonia and add “digital nomad” to Plovdiv’s employment options. It is not just Brexit that has made returning home seem attractive. “We’ve benefited from the instability in Europe, and the economic crisis in other EU countries, such as Spain and Greece,” says Totev, the mayor. The city is small, with a current population of 345,000, which may work in its favour. Local business investors describe Sofia as overcrowded, with unwelcome competition from other companies. Indeed, in 2017 the labour market in Plovdiv and surrounding commuter towns increased by 38,000 people, more than any other region in the country, according to data provided by the mayor’s office. But not everyone is convinced the city is experiencing a renaissance. Critics claim the mayor’s office might have altered the statistics to present a more flattering picture. “The mayor built a hotel with our tax money,” said a 29-year-old business owner who wanted to remain anonymous. Such accusations are common, with many denouncing Totev as an oligarch and pointing to allegations and investigations into his financial dealings by various Bulgarian news outlets. Some are also disappointed with projects affiliated with the city’s trendy creative district, Kapana. Locals complain that instead of investing in the artists who made the district popular in the first place, authorities have instead supported commercial shops and bars to attract tourists, killing off the atmosphere and turning the district into a dead end. Meanwhile, life in the city goes on at the same calm pace. Drinking local wine in a downtown bar, 30-year-old Ivan Dzheferov, a community manager from the startup hub Trakia Tech, is joking about Plovdiv’s guiding philosophy, aylyak. In Turkish, the word means “idle”; for Bulgarians it means not to hurry pointlessly – if there is a job that needs to be done, it can be postponed. The city’s population might be increasing, but there is little sign the pace of life will change.

    "transcript": "It is not hard to scroll through a huge global opinion survey and find the outliers. They are many and compelling: vaccine-doubters, conspiracy theorists, arch-pessimists and even people who approve of Theresa May. The danger however is that these newspoints can give us a certain impression about the world: that outliers are the norm, that eccentrics are far more prevalent than they actually are. But the YouGov-Cambridge Globalism survey of more than 25,000 people in 23 countries, which the Guardian unveiled this week, is actually remarkable for the unremarkable things it points out. In this age of extremes and opposites, most people are pretty normal. They tend to like Italian food, watch American telly, travel a little abroad. If there is one word that captures (most people’s) politics, it is probably “moderate”. They tend to trust local media and television news but – not without justification – distrust social media and government officials. Most people think it’s bad for immigrants to come specifically to claim benefits in a new country. But most think it’s OK for them to come to flee war. Yes, many people – particularly in the developed world – are gloomy about future prospects for their own country and for the world itself. But when asked about their own prospects, there are more optimists than pessimists. Deep down people have not given up hope. Most people think the UN is OK; most are suspicious of banks and pharmaceutical companies. Conspiracy theories may be popular among populists, but overall relatively few people believe hoaxes about 9/11, aliens, the Holocaust or Aids. Most think that most jobs are equally suited to both genders. Most acknowledge that minorities and gay and transgender people still face discrimination. Most support abortion and gay sex. Whatever else this era is, it is not a throwback to the 1950s. Most feel a keen sense of belonging, both to their local community and their country – very high numbers are at least a little patriotic and say that buying local produce is important. Most are worried about climate change, and the direction of travel for both health and education. The vast majority do not see themselves as part of an elite, and believe it would be very hard to become so. Catholic countries are pretty positive towards Christianity. Muslim-majority countries tend to have a favourable impression of Islam. Each are rather uncomfortable with the other’s religion. A lot of the questions give people a sliding scale to record their answers, from one extreme (agree very strongly) to the other (disagree strongly). On a great many issues – from globalisation to ethical shopping, and from fashion to small business regulation – the majority cluster towards the centre ground in a classic bell curve. This is true even in places where we may have expected to find a yawning chasm – such as between Britain’s leavers and remainers, who have a surprising amount in common. The conclusion is that we are more similar than we think. It is only when forced into binary-choice boxes that it looks like we are all extremists, ranged against each other. Last year, the German newspaper Die Zeit ran a little experiment. The paper posted a rather simplistic questionnaire on its website, asking readers yes/no questions: should German borders be freely opened? Should cars be banned from cities? Is Trump bad for America? When thousands had answered, they then paired up hundreds of people who had answered yes to all the questions with people who had answered no. They challenged the pairings to find things they had in common. The upshot was remarkable. “You would expect a lot of clashes in their debates but when I heard from them, it really gave me goosebumps because it was the polar opposite,” said Bastian Berbner, a reporter on the project. “They all said after a couple of minutes that we realised we are not that far apart. “When you go into nuance and talk about what we really mean we found that we are not that far apart at all,” added Berbner, who is now writing a book called 180 Degrees: Stories Against Hate. “People have their stereotypes and as soon as they meet they fall apart and get replaced by the things we have in common.”",

    "transcript": "Who has the answers? The UN? Scientists? Entrepreneurs? Nation states? “Ordinary” people? There is another subset of power, agency, ideas and progress that often gets overlooked in the search for solutions to the world’s problems. There are estimated to be upwards of 4,000 cities around the world with more than 100,000 inhabitants. They are a burgeoning political, economic and social force, often able to implement change more deftly and decisively than national governments. Witness congestion charges, bike sharing, digital hubs, green energy solutions, even immigration protection. For this week’s Upside, journalists on our Cities desk have been scouting out great examples from Europe such as: The Swedish city that took a stand against neo-Nazism. The Berlin specialist stores breathing life back into retail. The Venetians trying to combat Europe’s worst tourist crisis. The Cities-Upside crossover will continue into next week. Watch this space for more great examples of urban renewal. Data A slew of opinion poll data published exclusively by the Guardian this week is worth reflecting on. It asked 25,000 people worldwide for views on globalisation, populism, immigration and nationhood. The results told us what we know deep down but often forget in the daily hurly-burly: most people are pretty moderate, sensible and conciliatory. (A lot are pessimistic though – and clearly need to sign up to the Upside.) They are also generally a bit less hostile to immigration than previously thought. What we liked This University of Washington article on what triggers compulsive smartphone use, and what we might do to keep our phone habits in check. Also this Huff Post piece about a teacher encouraging her pupils to be open about their mental health, with a “wall of feelings”. What we heard Poor health and social isolation is often due to GPs, the NHS (and the medical model) not opening up to community groups. The solution is for them to do so. Sam Goold, who argues by email that GPs should start pointing some patients towards the huge number of community groups and peer support networks. Do readers know of any doctors who do this? Let us know. Robert, my husband, and I really enjoy the Upside section of the Guardian, and the fact that although the Guardian is very urban, we can see there is an effort to cover rural issues, so thank you to Matthew Taylor for the article about conservation agriculture. Lydia Somerville, via email In your call for further articles to add to your series on populism, I would welcome one advising individuals what arguments and language they can use on a one-on-one and daily level to counter populist arguments put forward by those they know. I realise that getting organised/joining a movement (such as Libero) may be the most effective, but tactics to use individually would also help. Thanks – a great series. Martin Roach via email.

    "title": "'Hate is always local': the Swedish city that said no to neo-Nazis",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/01/hate-is-always-local-the-swedish-city-that-said-no-to-neo-nazis",
    "date": "2019-05-01",
    "transcript": "On an August afternoon in 1995, John Hron, a defiant anti-racist, was tortured and beaten to death by neo-Nazi skinheads beside a picturesque lake near his home town of Kode in Kungälv, Sweden. He was 14. Neo-Nazis were gaining a foothold in Kungälv, an industrial borough of 20,000 people on the west coast, for the first time since the second world war. Sweden’s economy had stuttered in the early 1990s after a financial crisis and its politics were in flux. Twenty-four years later, Sweden’s neo-Nazis are again targeting Muslims and Jews, buoyed by anti-immigrant sentiment in the country that has seen the radical nationalist Sweden Democrats make electoral gains. After terrorists attacked two mosques in New Zealand in March, killing 50, the massacre was hailed by members of the so-called Nordic Resistance Movement, an openly Nazi group. And today, 1 May, the group is marching in uniforms through Kungälv city, which it is targeting because of its historical links to Sweden’s war-time Nazis. But Kungälv has changed over the past two decades. Galvanised by Hron’s murder, the municipality has developed a quietly successful initiative to prevent recruitment of young people by racists. After the tragedy, Kungälv hired Christer Mattsson, a local teacher and researcher, to plan its response. He says the problem was not Kungälv as a whole, but small parts of it: “Hate is always local.” So he and his co-researchers created the Tolerance Project, starting with Ytterby, a large school where the neo-Nazis were very active. “Back then we had a big problem at the school, a lot of trouble with neo-Nazis in the neighbourhood,” says Therése Kraffke, the school’s headteacher. In 2001, Kraffke, Mattsson and other teachers started to hold workshops with a mixed group of girls aged 14 to 16, including those who hung out with the skinheads. “The skinhead core was mainly boys,” Kraffke says. “We reasoned that if the girls stopped supporting them, they wouldn’t have people around them.” The culmination of the project was a week-long trip to significant Holocaust sites in Poland for which students had to hand over their phones, ensuring their attention was concentrated on their experience and the group around them. The visit encouraged each student to think about who they were, what shaped their attitudes, and how to deal with emotions such as anger. Madeleine, who asked that her surname not be used, was one of the first girls to participate. Aged 14, Madeleine had started to shave her head and wear boots and a bomber jacket just like the neo-Nazis. She scrawled SS symbols around Kungälv and hung out with white supremacists, drinking and smoking. “It was just a cool thing, but it was starting to mean something,” she recalls. “I started yelling at people with dark skin, being really aggressive. “In my group, to be angry and hateful was seen as good thing – my identity was the hard girl who is angry all the time. The climate was so bad at the school against black people, Muslims and Jews. The white people were the ‘right’ people.” As part of the Tolerance Project, Madeleine started to mix with girls from other backgrounds. They talked about why people hate each other and learned about the Holocaust. During her six months on the project, she found herself for the first time among people who listened to her and respected her. “I think about what would have happened to me without that experience. I would probably be a Nazi’s girlfriend today,” says Madeleine, now 31 and a teaching assistant. “I didn’t have the network around me to get out of it.” The approach has become known as the “Kungälv model” for tackling racism among teenagers, and its techniques are practised in more than 60 schools in Sweden. In Kungälv itself, the programme has inoculated a generation of young people against right-wing extremism. Loa Ek took part in the Tolerance Project in 2012. She was 14 and by her own admission a difficult child who was skipping classes and failing exams. “It was hard for me to keep my mouth shut at first but I calmed down – nobody judged me,” says Ek, 21. “It was a safe space – it helped me to understand and control myself. We learned how easy it is to manipulate people through racism.” Ek’s outspoken nature now has other targets. “It irritates me so much when people don’t like immigrants,” she says. “I tell them to go read some books.” Breaking down the barriers between groups of school students is key to success, according to Maarten van Zalk, professor of developmental psychology at the University of Osnabrück in Germany, whose research has measured the impact of the Kungälv model on pupils’ outlook and opinions. “When you are part of a racist subculture, it is unlikely you will interact with immigrant students,” he says. “With the Tolerance Project they are strongly encouraged to engage, and with the engagement they break the circle. The more they break that circle, the higher the level of tolerance.” A 2013 study backed by diversity and anti-racism organisations estimated that the economic benefits of the project, measured in terms of preventing damage to society caused by neo-Nazi gangs, outweighed the investment required by a factor of 20. A 2018 study by a researcher at Birmingham University concluded that the project had led to “an increased sense of security, less vulnerability, and most important of all, less hatred”. Cristine Lysell, who is currently in charge of upper secondary school education for Kungälv council, saw for herself the changes at Ytterby school, where she was a teacher when the neo-Nazis were at their height. “The racism started to disappear – it became more calm and students started to react when they heard people express racist views,” Lysell says. “Everyone in the school was standing up for integration. Then we began to realise the hard work was paying off.” Today the neo-Nazis do not recruit from Ytterby school, Kraffke says. “They are strong here, their leader lives nearby. But they don’t target the school, they have nothing to get from us.” A student from a neighbouring school was so moved by her experience of the Tolerance Project that she and some friends organised a memorial concert for John Hron, 20 years after his death. Some 5,000 people took part. “We called it Together for Kungälv – instead of saying we hate the racists, we wanted a message that was positive and inclusive,” says Louise Eklund, now 21. “We wanted to show a society where everyone can feel safe and happy and live their lives, where we can understand that people are different.” In 2015 the project’s success led to the establishment of the Segerstedt Institute at Gothenburg University, with the aim of developing and spreading the Kungälv model. The institute trains teachers and social workers to apply the methodology in their own environments, tailoring it to the specifics of youth culture and style. “Doing so requires a highly complex, situated knowledge, the understanding of the local context – you have to be part of the fabric,” says Mattsson, who now runs the institute. Each year, more than 800 Swedish school students go through the Kungälv model. But nobody should be tempted to think the work has been done and the problem is retreating, Mattsson says. “If we stop doing this job, the racism will resurface in a different form in a year, five or 10 years, we don’t know,” he says. “Racism is not something you can get rid of – it is an ongoing battle.” For Madeleine, neo-Nazi marches such as today’s are not the only reason the Kungälv model remains so necessary. “When Notre Dame cathedral was burning, on Facebook [people] started blaming Muslims straight away,” she says. “Everyday racism is growing in the whole of Sweden.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "title": "Leeds becomes first UK city to lower its childhood obesity rate",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/01/leeds-becomes-first-uk-city-to-lower-its-childhood-obesity-rate",
    "date": "2019-05-01",
    "transcript": "Leeds has become the first city in the UK to report a drop in childhood obesity after introducing a programme to help parents set boundaries for their children and say no to sweets and junk food. Only a few cities in the world, notably Amsterdam, have managed to cut child obesity. Like Amsterdam, the decline in Leeds is most marked among families living in the most deprived areas, where the problem is worst and hardest to tackle. “The improvement in the most deprived children in Leeds is startling,” said Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at Oxford University, whose team has analysed the city’s data. Over four years, obesity has dropped from 11.5% to 10.5% and the trajectory is steadily downwards. Among the more affluent families, there was also a decline from 6.8% to 6%. Overall the drop was from 9.4% to 8.8%. The data comes from the national child measurement programme (NCMP), which requires all children to be weighed at the start and end of primary school. The biggest decline in obesity in Leeds is 6.4% in the reception class, at about the age of four. From 2016 to 2017, 625 fewer reception class children were obese. No such data has been reported elsewhere in the UK, where childhood obesity is a major concern. Almost a third (28%) of all children aged two to 15 in England are overweight or obese. The measurement programme shares the progress made in each city with those considered comparable. For Leeds, the 15 closest “neighbours” at the start of the study period in 2009 were Sheffield, Kirklees, Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne, Coventry, Bolton, Wakefield, Derby, Bradford, Dudley, Medway, Liverpool, Swindon, County Durham and Warrington. The obesity rates there and across the country have not shifted. “For England it’s absolutely flat,” said Jebb, who added that the dropping rate in Leeds appeared to be a trend. “This is four years, not one rogue data point,” she said at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow where she presented the research, also published in the journal Paediatric Obesity. “Everybody is going around saying Amsterdam is doing something amazing. Well, actually, Leeds is too.” Jebb, a former government adviser, says they cannot be sure what has turned the tide in Leeds – but it could involve a programme called Henry that the city introduced as the core of its obesity strategy in 2009, focusing particularly on the youngest children and poorest families. Henry (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young) supports parents in setting boundaries for their children and taking a firm stance on issues from healthy eating to bedtimes. Henry’s chief executive, Kim Roberts, said the drop in obesity in Leeds was “unprecedented … The indicators are that this isn’t happening in other cities.” The programme encourages authoritative rather than authoritarian parenting, she said. “Authoritarian parenting is when children are told what to eat and what to do, such as being banned from leaving the table until they have eaten their sprouts,” said Roberts. “Permissive parenting is asking children what they want to do. “But Henry encourages a third approach known as authoritative parenting, where parents make it clear they are in charge, but also respond to their children.” Instead of being asked what vegetable they want with dinner, children might be asked whether they would like carrots or broccoli. Instead of being told to go to bed, they are asked where they want to read their bedtime story. Instead of telling a child to stop watching television, a parent could ask whether they would like to turn the television off or whether the parent should do it. Lisa, who joined a Henry parenting course when her oldest daughter was two, is enthusiastic about her family’s experience of the programme. Her children now eat sweet potato and beetroot. She learned a lot about healthy eating, saved money by planning meals and lost two stone herself. “I think it made me a better parent because of all the parenting skills stuff. I was able to share some of the ideas with my partner and as a result the kids became calmer and happier, which helped us feel less stressed too,” she said. Kayleigh constantly argued with her daughter, who had just started school and was overweight. “Lexi had a very limited diet and whenever I tried to get her to try anything new she would reject it, so I stuck to what I knew she would eat,” she said. The programme inspired her to take Lexi to the park to chase the dog. She turned the television off at mealtimes and introduced healthy food choices. “My confidence as a parent was increasing as the weeks went by. I became more conscious about responding to Lexi’s needs while still remaining in charge, like understanding that she would act up sometimes because she needed some attention and balancing that with what I needed to do,” she said. Janice Burberry, the head of public health at Leeds city council, said the early years were a good time to intervene to support families. “Parents want to do the best for their children. During pregnancy they are more receptive to change, they want to give their children the best start,” she said. “We wanted to focus on prevention because it’s very, very difficult when obesity has taken hold to tackle it. “We understand that there is no magic bullet here. Parents are experts in their own lives and they know what they can and can’t achieve. The strategy of Henry is about sitting alongside parents and thinking through what’s right for them.” The public health minister, Seema Kennedy, was enthusiastic. “There are some fantastic pockets of work happening in early years already, and while still in the early phases, it is encouraging to see what can be achieved locally through interventions like this,” she said. “I know how hard it can be for busy parents to make healthy choices for their families, so anything that can make it easier is a real lifeline.” • This article was amended on 2 May 2019 to use a different chart type in order to add clarity to the presentation of data.

    "title": "Sinking city: how Venice is managing Europe's worst tourism crisis",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/apr/30/sinking-city-how-venice-is-managing-europes-worst-tourism-crisis",
    "date": "2019-04-30",
    "transcript": "Friday 15 March was a rare day in Venice: on the concourse in front of the Santa Lucia train station, Venetians outnumbered tourists. Young Venetians had skipped school to join the global youth climate strike, holding placards with statements such as “If climate was a bank, you’d save it.” The movement is especially relevant in Venice, since a 50cm rise in sea levels could see the city vanish beneath the waves. Critical as the climate crisis is, the city faces a more immediate risk: the rising tide of tourists, presently estimated at 25 million a year and projected to reach 38 million by 2025. Europe, already the world’s largest tourism market, received 713 million international visitors in 2018, an 8% increase on the previous year, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. But, in European cities, the increase is far greater: since 2008, overnight stays have jumped 57%. While tourism provides significant economic benefit – contributing €2bn annually in gross revenue to Venice alone – overtourism is causing cities like Barcelona, Amsterdam, Dubrovnik and others to make international headlines on issues ranging from housing affordability, environmental degradation and the destruction of local life. In 2016 in Dubrovnik, residents were outraged when the mayor asked them to stay home to avoid the dangerous levels of crowds disembarking from multiple cruise ships. The new mayor, Mato Frankovic, has since capped the number of cruise ships that can dock in the city at two per day, cut souvenir stalls by 80% and cut restaurant seating in public spaces by 30%. But similar issues of overcrowding in Palma de Mallorca, San Sebastián, Prague and Salzburg have brought locals out into the streets in increasingly impassioned protests. One of the most dramatic was Venice’s 2016 No Grandi Navi (“No Big Ships”) protest, when locals took to the Giudecca Canal in small fishing boats to block the passage of six colossal cruise ships. And, although plans have been announced this year to reroute the largest ships to a new dock in Marghera (still to be built), campaigners still argue for a dock outside the lagoon at the Lido, where heavy cargo ships historically unloaded. This is just one of the ways the Venetian Republic safeguarded the equilibrium of the lagoon and the complex system of commerce around it. In fact, the act of sustaining the lagoon for over a millennium is a singular human achievement, because a lagoon by definition is a temporary natural phenomenon. Venice’s lagoon would have silted in 500 years ago if it hadn’t been for careful environmental protection, sensitive technical intervention and strict commercial regulation – a historic blueprint that provides useful lessons for tourism. A new generation of concerned citizens and entrepreneurs is taking up that challenge, combining grassroots activism with socially sensitive, sustainable initiatives to save their island home. Consider waste. What comes into Venice must be removed again via a complex collection and recycling system. Every day an army of sanitation workers knocks on every door in the city, collecting waste to be ferried away on barges. The same rules and fines, however, do not apply to tourists – despite the fact that during high season the bins around Piazza San Marco have to be emptied every half an hour. Troubled by the plastic waste generated by their two boutique hotels – the Novecento and Hotel Flora – the Romanelli family have taken action, eliminating plastic bottles from their properties, and encouraging guests to use steel flasks at Venice’s historic water fountains, for which they supply a map. “We don’t pretend to be [Leonardo] DiCaprio, but through these small actions we hope to do something positive,” says the owner, Gioele Romanelli. With just 50 rooms and 40 members of staff, they calculate they save 36,000 plastic bottles a year. Multiply that by the estimated 40,000 guest beds in Venice – to say nothing of restaurants or the waste unloaded from cruise ships – and you could save hundreds of millions of plastic bottles a year. “Our children learn about these issues at school and all of them carry their own water flasks, so why not us?” concludes Romanelli’s wife, Heiby. Addressing the issue of waste is only the most tangible effort to create a more sustainable tourism in Venice.This June will see the launch of Fairbnb, a not-for-profit home-sharing site that only permits resident hosts; mandates one home per host; and contributes half of the 15% booking fee to social projects. Their launch is timely. Since 2015, Airbnb tourist rentals in Venice have tripled from 2,441 to 8,320, according to Airdna. Of those, 80% are entire home rentals, many are owned by agencies or foreign investors and a 2018 report by Centro Studi di Federalberghi Nazionale found the most prolific host in the city had 135 listings. Other European cities are responding to similar problems. Barcelona is prosecuting unlicensed apartments and has secured access to Airbnb’s host data in order to pursue offenders. In Madrid, home sharing is now only permitted in houses with their own entrances. Palma, meanwhile, has banned short-term tourist rentals completely in flats that are part of multi-family residential housing, although it is still possible to rent detached homes and villas, provided they are not in a protected area. “Without significant regulation of the rental market [in Italy], we saw the only way to change things was to provide a market alternative,” says Emanuele dal Carlo, a Venetian who is one of five co-founders of Fairbnb, which crowdfunded for its startup cash. “We’re not anti-Airbnb – we just want to show that it’s possible to create a tourism model that works for local communities as well as travellers.” On booking, Fairbnb renters decide which project to support and are invited to visit or participate: in Venice this could mean joining volunteers cleaning graffiti or helping turn a centuries-old squero (boat yard) into an educational centre. “We want to bring back the connection between tourists and locals that has been lost,” dal Carlo says. “Nowadays you can go to a place and virtually never meet a local. But this way you can join them in their real pursuits or even just share a drink together.” This loss of connection between locals and tourists is something that Valeria Duflot and Sebastian Fagarazzi are also concerned with. Their website Venezia Autentica directs tourists to Venice businesses that support a sustainable local economy – everything from printmakers to photographers, mosaicists to rowers. This is because too few of the city’s 25 million tourists frequent shops and restaurants owned by Venetians, they say. “Quality local businesses definitely need more customers, visitors included,” Duflot says. Across Europe, other grassroots groups are also fighting to preserve local cultures. In 2017, the social movement Morar em Lisboa, in conjunction with 30 local associations, wrote an open letter denouncing Lisbon’s excessive dependency on tourism and real estate speculation. And last May, 14 cities and islands – 10 of them Spanish, alongside Venice, Lisbon and Malta – joined forces to form the Network of Southern European Cities against Touristification, arguing that mass tourism causes high rents, pollution, the loss of local shops and the proliferation of low-wage jobs. This is what the European Parliament was referring to when, in 2015, it declared that “European tourism must make a transition from a model of quantitative growth to a qualitative model leading to steady and sustainable development.” To kick-start new thinking on the matter, they awarded the inaugural 2019 European Capital of Smart Tourism to Helsinki for the city’s locally-oriented tourism strategy, which is based on sustainability and the assumption that what makes a city attractive to residents will appeal to travellers, too. It is this focus on the liveability of a city that Venetian data scientist Fabio Carrera believes is the key to Venice’s future. Because if a city cannot retain its own populace, no amount of tourist tax will be able to avert its inevitable decline and death. As such, Carrera has dedicated 30 years of his academic life working on the Venice Project Centre, dividing his time between Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the prestigious Santa Fe Institute and Venice. During that time, he has supervised over 250 projects examining the city’s challenges: mapping every bridge, bell tower, well and water bus. The centre also tracks tourism flows, and has concluded that Venice’s maximum carrying capacity is 55,000 tourists per day, or 20 million per year if European safety standards are to be maintained. It’s not far from the current number of 25 million, he points out – it just needs to be managed better. A new wave of digital tools could offer some solutions. At the centre’s startup incubator SerenDPT, students are working on projects including smart transport apps, hybrid mortgage schemes that use tourism income to assist with repayments, and a Smart Control Room for the city council that they hope they can export to other cities. He believes these new business ideas, among others, would create the kind of high quality jobs that could refloat the local economy. No other city faces a bigger tourism challenge, says Carrera – but given Venice’s uniquely contained and complex character, nowhere is better equipped to meet the challenge of sustainable tourism. “Younger generations have been out in the world,” he says. “They see other possibilities and want to bring that back to Venice.” This article was edited on 1 May 2019 to clarify that Palma has not completely banned short term tourist rentals, just those in apartments in multi-family residential housing Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "title": "Are the hyper-specialist shops of Berlin the future of retail?",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/apr/29/are-the-hyper-specialist-shops-of-berlin-the-future-of-retail",
    "date": "2019-04-29",
    "transcript": "On the first floor of a nondescript 1,000 sq metre industrial unit in Berlin’s Steglitz district, four workers are cautiously placing pregnant queen ants into test tubes in order to dispatch them across Europe. This is Antstore, the world’s first specialist ant shop, a business with around two dozen employees, a glass-cutting workshop, plastic and plaster modelling studios and a full-time social media manager. It is just one of the surprisingly large number of shops in Berlin that sell only one thing, be it crawly insects, salty sweets, sticky tape or miniature string instruments. With online retail sales changing the face of high streets in cities around the world, many wonder if this hyper-specialisation could be more than an accidental side effect of the German capital’s tumultuous history, and also a blueprint for the high street of the future. Martin Sebesta started Antstore in 2003, frustrated that his city’s pet shops lacked either the expertise or enthusiasm to tell him how to build his own ant farm. Having survived cancer in his 20s, he chucked in a promising career at Siemens and rented a small shop from which he worked part-time to build and sell his own ant terrariums, which he calls “formicariums”, from the insect’s Latin name. ‘With ants I can see how they start small and build something big’ … Martin Sebesta of Antstore The majority of Antstore’s sales take place via the company’s website, but Sebesta reckons the shop itself is still key to its success. First-time customers can choose between anything from a €50 (£43) starter set containing the robust Lasius niger, or common garden ant, to a tripartite formicarium with the South American Atta cephalotes, a species of leafcutter ant, for a starting price of around €500. “Of course, you could get a goldfish and watch it swim from left to right all day,” says Sebesta as a trail of leafcutter workers diligently carries the remains of a wilted orchid through a glass skywalk over his head. “But with ants I can see how they start small and build something big.” He considered branching out into stick insects and terrariums for lizards, but soon realised teaching his staff the required expertise would stretch the company’s capacities. “These days, if you want to keep your head above the water as a medium-sized business, you can’t afford not to specialise.” Paul Knopf and his buttons at his shop in Kreuzberg ‘I have more buttons than I can sell before I die’ According to Nils Busch-Petersen, CEO of the Berlin-Brandenburg trade association, the high number of hyper-specialists is the result of historical chance. “Our city is home to these special kinds of shops not because of the senate’s efforts, but in spite of them,” he argues. Germany’s Mittelstand, roughly defined as businesses with between 50 and 500 employees, may be commonly hailed as the “hidden champions” of nation’s economic success, but in Berlin retail, medium-sized businesses have traditionally been less hidden than absent. Two-thirds of the city’s 9,000 Jewish-owned Mittelstand retail companies were lost in the wake of the Reichskristallnacht pogroms in 1938. In 1972, during the Cold War, East Germany nationalised even small businesses with more than 10 employees. In such a skewed retail landscape, many small shops found they could compete by specialising in goods neglected by generalist department stores, especially since retail space was cheap and in plentiful supply behind the Iron Curtain. ‘It’s one thing to take a typewriter apart’ … Bernd Moser in his typewriter store in Kreuzberg Bernd Moser’s shop on Kreuzberg’s Gneisenaustrasse 91 illustrates this tradition: aged 76, Moser, who proudly sports a white walrus moustache, has for over a quarter of a century only sold and repaired typewriters. Although already deep into retirement, Moser unlocks the glass door to his sparse premises from 11am until 4pm during the working week – mainly because demand remains high. After a 60-year career as an office machine mechanic, Moser owns boxes full of spare parts by long-bankrupt manufacturers and still has reams of instruction manuals stored away in his head. “It’s one thing to take a typewriter apart,” he says. “But I also know how to put them back together again.” ‘They don’t call the violin a cello for kids, do they?’ … Harald Truetsch in his ukulele shop A hundred metres around the corner, lies Paul Knopf, a shopping emporium spanning two shop fronts and several storage units. It is named after its owner, who is himself named after the only product he has sold over its counter for 32 years: buttons, millions of them, intricately filed by material, size and colour in drawers reaching up to the stuccoed ceiling. “I don’t know exactly how many buttons there are in this building in total,” says Knopf, “but I know there are more than I can sell before I die.” A short walk east, at Gneisenaustrasse 52, Harald Truetsch has for almost 10 years sold only miniature string instruments: ukuleles made of wood or metal, “banjoleles” with plastic membranes, mandolins, South American cavaquinhos and tiny bass guitars. “Big music shops often treat the ukulele as a second-rate instrument, as if it were just a guitar for children,” says Truetsch, his long white hair flowing as he picks up his own uke from behind the counter. “They don’t call the violin a cello for kids, do they?” Knopf, Moser and Truetsch have all survived the ongoing gentrification of their neighbourhoods in part because of lenient landlords. But they also run lean operations with low expenses – Knopf has three employees to help tackle his intricate filing system, while the other two are one-man shows. Germany’s strict laws around shop opening hours have allowed them to work solo without risking burnout: many hyper-specialists remain closed not just on Sundays but Mondays too. ‘One sausage gave birth to another’ … Silvia Wald in Aufschnitt Berlin, her textile meat shop in Friedrichshain And the threat online retailers pose to their business model is limited: Truetsch’s shop may be called Leleland.eu, but typing the url into a browser draws a blank page. When he tried selling his wares via an online shop he found the postal work overwhelming (“With instruments, people want to try before they buy”). Over the holidays, leleland.eu fills up with customers who have travelled from as far away as Argentina or Israel, and unlike with an adult-sized guitar, they know they will be able to take their purchases back on the plane. With the old guard of Berlin’s hyper-specialists proving surprisingly resilient, younger shop owners are taking a leaf out of their books. On Boxhagener Strasse in bustling Friedrichshain, the 38-year-old garment engineer Silvia Wald has set up shop in an old butcher’s store to sell the kind of wares older customers used to see behind the counter: legs of pork, chains of sausages, mortadella ham, bacon rashers – but all made of fabric, to be used as decorative cushions. The shop was borne out of a marketing gag for her textile company, Aufschnitt (“cold cuts”). “One sausage gave birth to another,” says Wald, who ironically has been a vegetarian since her teens. She soon realised the shopfront was an excellent showroom to advertise the made-to-commission work taking place in the studio part of her 70 sq metre unit. In the year of her business’s 10th anniversary, she is also realising that specialists can sometimes specialise too much. Recently, Wald was commissioned to make a giant cushion in the shape of a currywurst, Berlin’s famed street food snack. Her client, the German capital’s branch of Madame Tussauds, asked her if she knew a tailor who could make some fries to add as a side. “Of course I can make some fries, I told them. They literally thought I could only make cushions that look like meat.” ‘I have sticky tapes mere mortals would never dare to dream of’ Hyper-specialists usually make for popular neighbours because they add character to an area. Since Ilse Böge opened Kadó, Germany’s first specialist liquorice store, on Kreuzberg’s Gräfestrasse 20 years ago, she has seen the entire area blossom. Known as the Gräfekiez, the network of tree-lined cobbled streets has also attracted property investors from around the world, and some of the shop’s neighbours closed down when their landlord suddenly doubled the rent. “We made this area attractive, now we could be punished for it,” worries Böge. Katrin Lompscher, Berlin’s Die Linke (The Left) party senator for housing, has proposed extending the “milieu protection” measures, which currently protect low-income residents in select parts of the city from being pushed out by aggressive rent increases, to also apply to local shops. But Böge, who first started importing salty Dutch sweets for her personal cravings while studying economics, is in two minds. ‘What does the state know about how retail will develop in the next 10 years?’ … Ilse Böge in her liquorice store On the one hand, she says, milieu protection for shops would give small-business owners stability to plan their future. But the economist in her remains sceptical: “What does the state know about how retail will develop in the next 10 years? You would end up creating a parallel business system.” Instead, Böge and her husband, Frank, are putting in place measures for a post-shopfront future. Kadó looks old-fashioned: the 500-plus varieties of liquorice are stored in glass jars, arranged from sweet English allsorts via salty Finnish salmiakki to bitter Italian pure liquirizia sticks, and cash-only payments go through a vintage till. But the old-school look betrays a more modern business model. As much as 35% of the shop’s sales now take place online, and Kadó’s sticky confectionery is for sale in most of Berlin’s independent cinemas and even, wrapped in a designer box, in the luxury KaDeWe department store. ‘Specialists like us are the future’ … Tape art on the facade of Klebeland’s new building It is not unimaginable that Berlin’s first liquorice specialist could take the same route as Mohamad Ghouneim’s Klebeland. Ghouneim, a 40-year-old Palestinian German who has called Berlin his home since he was two, ran the city’s leading sticky-tape specialist from a store on Kreuzberg’s Ritterstrasse until rent increases forced him out of the premises. Instead of shutting up shop, Ghouneim relocated to humdrum Wittenau, a suburb of Berlin, and got some tape artists to decorate the facade of the new building. Footfall has naturally decreased, but 80% of his business comes from online sales and regular industrial clients, for whom Klebeband’s four employees cut and colour match tape of all varieties to order. “Imagine you are a stage technician and you need to tape a lamp that gets very hot to a pillar,” Ghouneim says. “If you go to [DIY store chain] Bauhaus, they wouldn’t know what to do. But I can tell you that you need a polyester film with a special type of silicon glue that can stand up to 300 degrees. I have sticky tapes in my store that mere mortals would never dare to dream of. “People who try to sell you everything are struggling more and more,” he adds with determination. “Specialists like us are the future.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/the-joys-of-springs-how-kenya-could-steam-beyond-fossil-fuel",
    "date": "2019-04-26",
    "transcript": "A faint smell of sulphur, a shrill hiss of gas and a Rift Valley panorama punctuated by 30 pillars of steam mark the frontline of renewable energy growth in Kenya. This is the boundary between Hell’s Gate national park and the geothermal plants that are increasingly powering one of east Africa’s fastest-growing economies. Giraffes wander close to the giant pipes that snake across the landscape, a reminder this is also a border between an old model of development reliant on foreign safaris and a new drive to leapfrog the fossil-fuel phase of growth. In recent years, Kenya has been a frontrunner in expanding access to electricity. Since 2010, the proportion of the 44 million population with power has reportedly surged from one in five to three in five. This is largely thanks largely to steam from the subterranean depths. Hell’s Gate is named after the sulphurous hot springs that bubble up in this part of the Rift Valley, a 3,500-mile fault line that is slowly pulling the African continent apart and bringing underground heat closer to the surface. Engineers tap the energy by drilling up to 5,000 metres into the earth, then injecting water that returns to the surface as steam to drive turbines. As long as the water is carefully recycled, the energy is virtually renewable. Emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases are released in the process, but the impact on the climate per kilowatt hour is between a fifth and a ninth that of burning fossil fuels. After a slow start, Kenya has embraced this technology with gusto. Engineers boast that the recently expanded Olkaria IV plant, on the edge of the national park, is now the biggest single-site geothermal facility in the world, with a capacity of 280 megawatts. Kenya is already the ninth biggest geothermal-producing nation in the world and will rise further when the new 165 MW Olkaria V facility opens in July. “By the end of next year, we will be one of the biggest geothermal producers in the world,” predicted Cyrus Karingithi, assistant manager at the Kenya Electricity Generating Company, KenGen. “We are transforming people’s lives like larvae into butterflies.” Geothermal generating capacity has grown 117% since 1999 thanks to investment of $1bn from the Kenyan government, with support from international financing bodies such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The country’s 302 geothermal wells now provide 400 megawatts of power, enough to power two cities the size of Nairobi, according to the company. Until now, hydropower has been the leading source of electricity production, but this is set to change. Over the next five years, the government plans to more than double capacity, mostly by opening enough geothermal wells to provide 49% of the power on the grid. This is considered a cheaper and more stable supply than dams, which are badly affected by drought. “Kenya is reducing its reliance on hydropower due to climate change. Currently when the dams are dry, they have to fill the energy supply gap with emergency imports of diesel fuel. That’s expensive. That’s why they want to have more geothermal,” said Geordie Colville, UN Environment climate change mitigation expert. Other African nations are set to follow. Last year, Ethiopia contracted an Icelandic firm to survey possible sites in its stretch of the Rift Valley. Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda are also reportedly exploring similar developments. But geothermal comes with a heavy cost to the local ecosystem. Environmentalists say the Olkaria complex has intruded on almost half of the Hell’s Gate national park, an important refuge for zebra, giraffes and eland. KenGen says this is an exaggeration and insists it has tried to minimise the impact, for example, by raising pipes on to stilts so animals can pass underneath. Even so, birds have died in collisions with power lines or been pushed from breeding sites. The future could be dirtier still. The company plans to bring steel and iron mills to the region, which would create a heavily polluting giant industrial complex on the edge of a protected area, with all that entails in terms of traffic, population and degradation of air and water quality. Overall, however, supporters argue geothermal is the lesser of evils. Over the next five years, coal and gas generation will also increase at a rapid rate as the government tries to supply a population that is expected to almost double by 2050. Some of the first investments in geothermal in Africa were approved by Inger Andersen, the incoming head of UN Environment, during her time at the World Bank. She recalls taking groups to Iceland 20 years ago so they could learn from the pioneering geothermal plants there. These days the visitors come to Kenya, which is set to overtake Iceland this year in generating capacity. The goal now, she says, is for regional economies to skip the dirty phase of fossil fuel-powered development and go straight to clean growth. “I totally believe in leapfrogging when I see the renewable resources that are available in Africa,” she tells the Guardian. “Kenya is sitting on huge geothermal resources and is blessed with incredible sunshine.” There is progress too in solar and wind power. According to the UN, 10% of 600 million people who live off-grid in Africa are already accessing renewable energy. Last September, Kenya opened sub-Saharan Africa’s largest windfarm: a 310-megawatt plant near the shores of Lake Turkana. Officials say the government has ordered the installation of 50MW of solar by 2024. But geothermal is leading the charge. After 31 years in the business, Karingithi says the investment conditions are finally ideal for the industry. “It’s much easier to secure financing now because international investors are more interested in renewable energy and the government is promoting this sector,” said Karingithi, who insists the target of providing half the nation’s energy from geothermal is achievable. “As long as you set a goal, the universe will conspire for you.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-04-25",
    "transcript": "Twelve million people in Ghana are set to benefit from the launch of the world’s largest drone medical delivery service. Up to 600 drone flights will be made each day, delivering vaccines, blood supplies and life-saving medicines to 2,000 health centres in remote areas around the country. The service will operate out of four hubs, each hosting 30 drones, designed by Zipline, a California-based robotics company. Ghana’s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, who officially inaugurated the new drone network at a ceremony in Omenako, said the service “represents a major step towards giving everyone in this country universal access to life-saving medicine”. “No one in Ghana should die because they can’t access the medicine they need in an emergency,” said Akufo-Addo. The new drone service was initially met with concern. Critics argued that in a country where, according to the BBC, 55 ambulances serve a population of 29 million people, money should instead be spent on improving current health facilities, including clinics and ambulances. The Ghana Medical Association called for the drone project to be suspended and tested on a trial basis first, claiming it would not help to tackle health service problems. But Ghana’s government granted Zipline $12m (£9.5 million) to run the project for four years after the initiative was approved in parliament by 102 votes to 58. Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, which is supporting Zipline’s work, said: “The ability of the government to supplement routine immunisation on demand will allow us to make sure that there will always be enough life-saving vaccines for every child in Ghana.” Zipline first introduced their drones in Rwanda in 2016, where they have since made 13,000 deliveries. One-third of these were to patients in a critical condition, when urgent access to supplies was a matter of life and death. A health centre can request supplies via text message, with packaging and delivery taking an average of 30 minutes, according to Zipline. Each drone can carry a load of 1.8kg, which it releases with a parachute once it descends to a safe height. The company’s engineers include aerospace veterans from SpaceX and Nasa. Following the opening of a second Rwanda distribution centre in 2018 and expansion into Ghana, the drone technology now serves 22 million people across the two countries.",

    "date": "2019-04-24",
    "transcript": "If you’ve ever felt a pang of pity for a starving bee struggling on the pavement in front of you, then help may soon be at hand. Or more precisely, in your wallet. A community development worker has invented a credit card-style reviver for bees containing three sachets of sugar solution, which can be placed beside the insect to feed it. Dan Harris, 40, is now crowdfunding to produce the “Bee Saviour” cards after the success of his prototype, with community groups and businesses in his local city of Norwich, including the Book Hive bookshop and a local pub, pledging to stock the £4 bee revivers. Each card contains three indentations containing a beekeepers’ formula, secured by foil-backed stickers which can be peeled off. “The first time you peel back the sticker and put the card down next to the bee, you think, what’s going to happen? When I first tested it, the bee walked calmly onto the card and started feeding,” Harris said. “It struck me that everyone who walks around a city will have walked past an exhausted bee. That means you’ve also walked past an opportunity to connect with nature.” Harris came up with the idea after learning about bees’ fast metabolism and how quickly they can run out of energy. He also wondered how people living in cities could engage with nature more frequently. “I was living in a flat without a garden and the most likely place I would come across a bee was walking around the city and I didn’t have a teaspoon of sugar solution to hand,” he said. Over four years, he has laboriously tested handmade prototypes, with advice about bees from his scientist father and beekeeper uncle. Now he has set up Bee Saviour Behaviour, a not-for-profit co-operative, to make the revivers, which he hopes to source from recycled plastic cards. If he hits his £8,000 crowdfunding target, he can commission a company to make the indentations, which he hand-fills with a sugar solution recommended by beekeepers. If he raises more funds, his co-op can mass – produce them. Richard Horne, a designer and illustrator, designed the cards free of charge after seeing his children use the prototype to save a bee. “I’ve tried reviving bees using sugar and water on a spoon and it’s never worked,” said Horne. “After we got the prototype, me and the kids found a bee that was struggling and they said, ‘Dad! Get the card!’ I fetched my wallet and the card worked a treat. I think it’s a genius idea.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "'It's a groundswell': the farmers fighting to save the Earth's soil",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/farmers-save-earths-soil-conservation-agriculture",
    "date": "2019-04-24",
    "transcript": "John Cherry bends down and takes a handful of soil in his hands, brings it up to his face and breathes deeply. “You can smell when it is good,” he says, poking it with a finger. “This smells of roots … there is a rich, organic quality to it. It is a good smell.” Cherry is one of a growing army of UK farmers who are turning their back on the plough – and centuries of farming tradition – in an effort to tackle a little-noticed but potentially devastating environmental crisis: the degradation of the Earth’s soil. The UN has warned that soils around the world are heading for exhaustion and depletion, with an estimated 60 harvests left before they are too barren to feed the planet. That message was backed up in the UK by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, who warned that the country is 30 to 40 years away from “the fundamental eradication of soil fertility”. He added: “Countries can withstand coups d’état, wars and conflict, even leaving the EU, but no country can withstand the loss of its soil and fertility.” The apocalyptic nature of the threat was underlined last month by a report that revealed that excessive use of pesticides had depleted the Earth’s soil and contributed to a drastic decline in insect numbers that threatened a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”. But on his 800-hectare (2,000-acre) farm outside Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Cherry says that he and farmers like him around the world are fighting back. The conservation agriculture movement he advocates means no ploughing or turning the soil, instead keeping the ground covered with crops all year round and growing a wide variety of plants. The method involves more planning, but the benefits its advocates claim are remarkable – from plummeting costs on machinery and labour to a drastic reduction in fertiliser and chemicals. This in turn leads to a huge increase in insects, birds and wildlife, as well as fewer floods and more resilient crops during droughts. Healthy soil can also absorb massive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions – playing a key role in the drive to tackle climate breakdown and the biodiversity crisis. As kites and skylarks fly above his fields, Cherry says he first became interested in conservation agriculture – or no-till farming – after speaking to others who were trying it. “I have always been interested in soil, which in the end is the most important thing about farming,” he says. “I went to see a farm where it was being done and when you see someone who is farming without moving the soil it is mind-blowing.” The movement, which began in the US, is now taking off around the world. Conservation agriculture (CA) is widespread in the Americas because of its water-retention properties in drought-prone and hot areas – healthier soil can hold and retain much more water. Some experts have sounded a note of caution, though. The Soil Association, which promotes organic farming, says it backs conservation but warns that it should not be seen as a silver bullet. A report written by Peter Melchett for the organisation , published in December shortly after his death, said that while CA minimised soil disturbance, reduced erosion and increased organic matter, by itself it was not guaranteed to increase biodiversity or the amount of atmospheric carbon that farmland can absorb and hold. It said farmers should also consider planting trees (agroforestry), introducing livestock on to arable farms, and having more diverse crop rotations bringing grassland into arable systems. Nonetheless, the movement is taking off in the UK. Three years ago, Cherry organised the Groundswell festival on his land to spread the word about the environmental and economic benefits of looking after the soil. He was amazed when 700 people turned up. Last year that number had jumped to 1,250, and this year, as word spreads to farms across the UK and Europe, he is worried the farm won’t be big enough to cope. “This whole thing is farmer-led,” says Cherry. “It is coming up from below, with farmers talking to each other and seeing the benefits, then adapting that to work on their own farms. It is a groundswell of farmers doing it – that is where we got the name.” Not ploughing avoids disrupting micro-organisms, including the fungal threads that drive the biological life of the soil. A mix of crops on the land increases the diversity and health of the bacteria in the soil, which in turn supports a wide variety of insects. Cherry says that one of the many benefits is that he no longer needs slug pellets, as the soil supports a lot of slugs’ natural predators. However, he does still use some sprays to clear the winter crops. Cherry says: “We are using fewer chemicals and less fertiliser year on year as the soil recovers. Our aim is to get to using no fertiliser or sprays at all. “There are guys in the US who have been doing this for 30 years and their soil is so fertile, they have got so much going on in the ground, that you do not need to apply anything.” Cherry, who works the farm with his brother Paul, turned to conservation agriculture eight years ago. The first few years they had their best ever returns as costs declined in terms of machinery, labour and pesticides but yields remained high. Cherry says there were “a few disappointing years as the soil adjusted, but our costs kept going down”. He adds: “After 15 years or so, what most people find is that your costs are right, right down and your yields are better then they were at the beginning. On top of that, you have a genuinely sustainable future ahead.” The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) produced a report last year backing conservation agriculture as one method of replenishing degraded soils. It warned that a combination of industrial farming practices and poor land management have resulted in dangerous levels of soil erosion, compaction and declining fertility, which costs around £1.2bn a year in England and Wales. Graeme Willis, the senior rural policy campaigner at the CPRE, says: “Soil is fundamental to delivering productive farming, a healthy countryside, and can play a key role in tackling climate change. But decades of neglect have degraded our soils to a point where much of this life-giving asset, which underpins the health of all living things, is no longer able to function as it should. “Through conservation agriculture, farmers can reduce costs, use fewer chemicals and rebuild biological life in the soil, making it healthier, more resilient to extreme weather and able to support more wildlife. It’s win-win for farmers, the people they feed and the environment.” Willis says there was a stark similarity between the human gut and soil in terms of planetary and human health. “Looking after the soil is much like looking after a healthy gut biome where variety is key: eat lots of different foods, especially plants, not too much wheat and cut back on the chemicals – for farming, pesticides and synthetic fertilisers, and for the gut, antibiotics and ultra-processed foods.” Back on his farm Cherry is examining the soil and the tangle of winter crops that cover his field. “The insects are the bottom of the food chain and there are so many things that eat them,” he says. “Since they have come back we have seen a huge increase in birds: skylarks, flocks of yellowhammers, kites, buzzards, and we are not doing anything special to attract them – they just love the fields, the system we have here.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-04-21",
    "transcript": "Dutch engineers are building what will be the world’s largest archipelago of islands made up of sun-tracking solar panels. Growing resistance to the construction of wind turbines or fields of solar panels on land has led the renewable energy industry to look for alternative options. Large islands of solar panels are under construction or already in place in reservoirs and lakes across the Netherlands, China, the UK and Japan. In a development that is to become the largest of its type in the world, construction will begin this year on 15 solar islands on the Andijk reservoir in north Holland. The islands, containing 73,500 panels, will have the sunflower-like ability to move to face the light. The first phase of the project, involving three islands, each of which will be 140 metres in diameter, is due to be finished by November, once the migratory season for birds has come to an end. Arnoud van Druten, the managing director of Floating Solar, a solar panel supplier, said: “We would like to have started earlier but because of the environmental issues regarding bird seasons, there is only a limited period in the year, these three months, that we can put anything in the water.” Along with a second project at Hoofddorp, near Amsterdam, which will involve static solar panels, the water company PWN, which owns the land on which the farms will be located, is expected to create enough energy to power 10,000 households. Van Druten said: “The sun-tracking system involves three buoys for anchoring with cable around it, which turns the island and at the same time keeps the island together. It ensures the island is turned towards the sun. “You can have two options: one is tracking automatically to the light. But because the position of the sun is not expected to change too much in the coming years, an algorithm can be easily programmed.” Another feature of the islands is that they can reposition themselves in extreme weather to minimise damage. “Andijk is a very severe environment,” Van Druten said. “So we have optimal solar tracking, which is generating extra energy, and weather risk management [WRM], which is a technology that makes sure that if an island is under severe pressure due to wind or storms, it moves itself automatically in a position so the wind and waves travel easily through the island. “We have already tested that the system can sustain, without WRM, wind speeds of around 60mph.” To avoid damaging the reservoir’s ecosystems, half its surface area will be covered by the islands. The added benefit of floating solar panels is that the water cools the electrical wiring. “There is a lot of pressure from pressure environmental groups about wind turbines, so the alternative to land is water. But what does it do to the water quality?” Van Druten said. “Our design has the least impact on the ecosystem as possible so the water quality remains almost the same. “At the same time, because the island is moving, we don’t have a fixed shadow shape.” Critics of floating solar farms say they are ugly and reflect the light, disturbing nearby communities. But Van Druten said the fusion of light on the water created a blurring effect that made the panels disappear from afar.",

    "transcript": "We are all doomed, it is said. Carbon dioxide is amassing in the atmosphere at levels not seen for millions of years when there were trees at the South Pole and Florida was under water. We have barely a decade to make amends. Protesters are on the streets. But huge numbers of people have not given up. Not yet. Call them the carbon cutters. They are companies and cities, niche groups and nations. They are commuters and communes, off-gridders and off-setters, investors and institutions – and countless individuals, cutting their meat intake, installing solar panels, eschewing gas guzzlers and long-haul flights. The Guardian’s Upside team heard from more than 200 carbon cutters in a callout to readers. We followed up their tips and showcase eight examples here, with many more in the comment thread. Their example in cutting carbon is a challenge to us all. The orchestra They are calling it “the world’s first sustainable season”, created by a Swedish orchestra so determined to cut its emissions that it has promised not to employ any musicians or conductors who travel by air. “We are convinced that we can get all we need in terms of talent and artistic energy from within Europe, and from people living in Europe who come from other parts of the world,” said Fredrik Österling, director of Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra. “You can’t hear if a conductor comes from Venezuela or from China or from England. The differences are very, very small.” Österling and his team are reaching out to artists, conductors and composers willing to make their way to the Swedish city by train, road or boat. Participants will be invited to suggest pieces or even whole programmes for the season, which will start in September 2020. Österling said that the idea for a no-flight season had come to him when the Swedish cellist Jakob Koranyi, who had travelled down from Stockholm by the night train, asked him what he was doing to compensate for the flights taken by other players. “Among the new generation of musicians, you often find this, that they choose to become vegans or vegetarians, and that they think about the CO2 footprint they have,” Österling said. “That’s why I’m convinced that we will find many others willing to support us.” On the day he announced the idea, he said he was contacted by an Armenian pianist living in Vienna who had offered to take the train up to Sweden to play. In a typical season he estimated that his concert hall generated roughly 100 flights. “It’s always been as if ‘art is above these issues’,” he said. “We are saying that we don’t believe that art is above the environment. The timeline is so short now, that we all have to contribute.” Richard Orange in Malmo The country Costa Rica has long been ahead of the crowd. Blessed with abundant hydropower, its emissions peaked in 1999 and in 2017 its power system ran for a record 300 days on clean sources. Now its president has vowed to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions totally by 2050, meaning it would produce no more emissions than it can offset through activities such as expanding forests. The country’s electricity, 98% of which is already derived from renewable sources, would be entirely clean by this point, while transport, which accounts for 40% of current emissions, would be transformed by requiring sales of new cars and trucks to be zero-emission only. The plan also targets the elimination of emissions from buildings, industry and waste disposal. Carlos Alvarado, the president of Costa Rica, said that the plan should be used as a blueprint for other governments to help meet the increasingly urgent task of cutting emissions to avoid disastrous climate change. “We have committed ourselves to be an international laboratory for decarbonisation and we are standing true to that commitment,” Alvarado told the Guardian. “We want to lead by example. Our strongest contribution is to demonstrate the possibilities. It’s not only possible but it’s necessary.” Alvarado, a 39-year-old who was elected in April 2018, said countries need not be deterred by US inaction on climate change. “Imagine humanity is in the middle of an electric car race to survive and let’s say one of the big vehicles instead of moving forward just parked in the road,” Alvarado said. “The rest of us could stop and stare or we can continue our journey. We will need everybody but we also need to keep moving forward because time is part of this equation. “In 2050, my son will be 37 and he will ask if I did enough for the planet and humanity to continue its existence. I better have a good answer. We need to do this because it’s the right thing to do.” Oliver Milman in New York The brewer AB InBev brews a lot of beer – about 3,000 pints a second. If that sounds like one gigantic hangover, consider this: to do that it requires about 6.6 terawatt hours of electricity each year – about the same as Latvia. Now it says it aims to generate that power solely through renewable means by 2025. For the most part, it will do so through so-called power purchasing arrangements – direct contracts with renewable suppliers. But it also plans to install its own solar and other generators on its sites. Already, it says, about half its power in the US comes from renewables – enough to brew about 10bn pints. “We believe climate change is real,” says Tony Milikin, the company’s chief sustainability officer. “We want other companies to jump on the flywheel that we’re on.” Mark Rice-Oxley The capital Wellington is getting greener. Literally. It’s been planting a tree every five minutes, on average, for the past 15 years – more than 1.5m in total. Native species such as Rata, Kowhai and Kanuka are being prioritised, with the aim of creating a ‘green corridor’ for native bird species that have already begun to spillover into locals gardens from their protected habitat at the Zelandia eco-sanctuary. Wellington mayor Justin Lester says the capital is New Zealand’s greenest city, and one of the few cities in the world where bio-diversity is increasing. Last month, it was named as the world’s least polluted capital, though that is also down to prevailing winds. “Wellingtonians are proud of this transformation and are acting on it,” he says. “The most common conservation activity is tree planting - about 40% of Wellington residents have planted a native tree at home.” The upshot is that although the city still has a battle on its hands to reduce emissions from traffic, the impact of all those leaves is starting to be felt. Trees act as a natural sink for carbon and about 40 percent of the city’s emissions are now mitigated by so-called land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities. According to the council almost half of the city’s urban area is now forested. By comparison’s 39% of Auckland is forested and 22% of Christchurch. The Wellington tree planting project will contribute to a central government plan to plant one billion trees by 2028, which forms part of New Zealand’s ambition to be carbon zero by 2050. Eleanor Ainge Roy in Auckland The flightless Aviation accounts for just over 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it is one of the fastest growing areas. Its real effect on warming is several times greater because the emissions have more impact at altitude. Growth is fuelled by globalisation and the rise of ultra-cheap flights. The airline industry has made gestures towards sustainability, but with little impact, and governments have shown great reluctance to rein in an industry seen as popular and strategic. Into this vacuum, individuals have started to bring their own actions. “We are in a climate emergency and need to radically reduce our emissions to avert climate breakdown,” says Anna Hughes, of the UK’s FlightFree campaign. “Aviation is the biggest contributor to an individual’s carbon footprint [if they fly], and people are often unwilling to change the way they live because individual action doesn’t seem to make a difference. But they are more likely to act if they can see others are acting too.” Inspired by a similar campaign in Sweden, FlightFree invites people to pledge not to take any flights in 2020, if enough other people are willing to do the same. Should 100,000 people sign up, the pledges will be triggered, giving an incentive to early adopters to encourage as many others to take part as they can, and potentially saving more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020. More than the carbon savings – which are hard to estimate in advance because some of the signatories may be frequent flyers while others may fly rarely – is the sense of moral action, that individuals can spur change even in huge and politically protected industries. An increasing number of short-haul flights are taken by better-off people in better-off countries taking advantage of cheap flights and low property prices to buy holiday homes in areas that not long ago would have been practically and economically inaccessible, according to research from the New Economics Foundation. That is unsustainable. But there are alternatives, from taking trains and the increasing distances that electric cars are capable of, to changing the tax regime so that instead of being charged taxes per flight – which blindly penalises those who rarely fly as much as those who jet off every other weekend – taxation could be based on an individual’s flight patterns over the course of a year, in order to truly reflect the social cost of our newfound habits. So far, in the few weeks of its operation, several hundred people have signed up to FlightFree. It will have succeeded if it makes people think more about how modern flying patterns have changed, and how the impacts of this can be managed equitably, without destroying the planet. The village It all started with full-page ads in the parish magazine, but the effort to get the villagers of Loddiswell, Devon to switch to a renewable energy provider now involves the printing of several hundred postcards. The man behind the plan is 65-year-old Plymouth city council worker Paul Vann: “I started a campaign to get villagers to switch to a green supplier like Bulb after finding out it offers 100% renewable energy. I was hoping to get a village-sized solar farm in the parish but unfortunately the power lines around here are at capacity.” The local parish has been supportive of the idea and Vann believes that if his village can make the change then the benefits to the environment would be great: “Even if only 100 households switch that would be equivalent to planting thousands of trees. Imagine if all villages could do it. “It’s all been done at a relatively low cost to me. The ads only cost a few tenners and the postcards around £75. I’ll be saving money too by delivering them myself. “I’ve gone out on a limb but my hope is that we will achieve at least 100 switches.” Rachel Obordo The theatre Showcasing some of the best folk productions in Ireland, the Siamsa Tíre National Folk Theatre is used to playing a pivotal role in the country’s cultural life. With the greening initiative it’s also having an impact on its carbon footprint by reducing the theatre’s energy usage by 41% since 2016. “Remarkably the election of Donald Trump spurred me into action,” said Catríona Fallon, CEO of the theatre. “We have 40 solar photovoltaic panels on the roof and replaced our oil-fired heating system with an air-to-heat pump which is run on electricity sourced from renewables. We’ve also halved our waste to landfill in the last year, which has saved us €1,000.” In terms of the future, Fallon is proposing to allow flexible working to reduce the theatre’s carbon footprint further: “We could look at closing the building on a Monday when there’s very little activity (October to April only) and allow most of the staff team to either work remotely or to rearrange their hours into four days rather than five. “I’m a bit of an environmental nerd in my private life. When Trump was elected I sensed that this was the moment when my colleagues began to understand some of the dangers facing us in terms of climate change and environmental degradation, so I grasped the nettle. They may have since regretted this!” Rachel Obordo The scientists If emissions of carbon dioxide are inevitable, can we avoid the effects on global warming by capturing, reusing or in some other way preventing the gas reaching the atmosphere and contributing to climate change? Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been mooted for more than two decades as a potential solution to climate change, but little progress has been made in that time. There are a handful of plants currently operating and no widespread plans for its adoption on a scale that would make the difference needed to stave off dangerous levels of warming. The Carbon Capture Machine (CCM), built by scientists from the University of Aberdeen, is a prototype capable of converting 200kg of carbon dioxide a day to liquid. The machine is now one of five technologies in the final for the NRG Cosia Carbon X Prize, and its grand prize of $7.5m (£5.7m). Inside the machine, the gases arising from coal combustion are “scrubbed”, which is done with a water solution of sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide. This process – which relates to techniques used a century ago to purify the air in submarines – separates carbon dioxide from other gases, such as water vapour and nitrogen, and produces stable dry solids, white in colour and harmless. Fred Glasser, emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of Aberdeen, says: “The expensive bit [of CCS] is that to pump carbon dioxide to the disposal site [usually offshore] it has to be liquid. To make a liquid requires separation of carbon dioxide from nitrogen and oxygen. The separation process is expensive and potentially polluting.” By solving this critical part of the CCS problem, Glasser believes the CCM – which will be tested at a site in Dry Fork, Wyoming, as part of the X Prize – provides a vital solution, and will be cheap as the components are off-the-shelf parts common in other industrial processes, and the dry byproducts can be sold. Glasser, with partners Zoe Morrison and MS Imbabi, has spun off CCM from Aberdeen University, and though the company is still small (“I also help to wash up the teacups,” notes Glasser) the partners are “aware of the transformational nature of the work we are doing and realise its potential impact on combatting climate change”. Yet the partners are unhappy that despite the international recognition of the X Prize, they have been “unable to get UK government support despite repeated applications and amicable discussions”. If the demonstration in Dry Fork is successful, the company expects to be about 12 to 18 months from commercial production of a scaled-up machine. When the large-scale capture and storage of carbon dioxide was mooted widely in the early 2000s as a solution for coal-fired power plants, coal was cheap and alternatives expensive. Since then, the price of renewable energy from wind and the sun has plunged. Expensive CCS on such a massive scale may no longer be needed if these trends continue. But there are chemical processes in vital industries that will continue to emit carbon dioxide even if the fuel used is renewable – cement is the classic example, as the breakdown of calcium carbonate it requires releases carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Removing and storing the carbon dioxide from concrete production is a potentially massive market where CCM is also applicable.

    "transcript": "John David, the master stonemason at York Minster, remembers the night of 9 July 1984 well. At about 2am, a lightning bolt hit the cathedral’s south transept and started a fire that raged through the building, collapsing the roof and causing millions of pounds’ worth of damage. “I remember some people coming to the building in tears,” he said. “I didn’t have that emotion. I was just thinking ‘let’s get it all cleared out and get it rebuilt’. There was no doubt in my mind that we could repair it, sympathetically, and in the same spirit that it was built.” On Monday night, David watched in horror as the 850-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris burned. But he remains optimistic that the building can be brought back to its former glory. “The roof’s completely gone and there is damage to the vaulting, which does concern me, but the rest of it is repairable,” he said. “There are people who can do it.” According to Prof Stefan Holzer, from the building archaeology and construction history group at the ETH Zürich university, the first priority needs to be the installation of a temporary roof to prevent further damage from “atmospheric influences” such as rain. He said scaffolding should be erected inside the building to check that the structure was secure. It is possible that water used to extinguish the fire has caused damage to plaster, masonry and furnishings, while the high temperatures during the fire may have made the stone work less solid. Of particular worry at Notre Dame were the rose windows, three immense round stained-glass windows that date back to the 13th century. On Tuesday afternoon, they were reported as saved. Sarah Brown, the director of York Glaziers Trust, which preserves and restores the stained glass at York Minster, said she had emailed her French counterparts to offer help and support. “Stained glass, of course, is made in heat,” she said. “The glass is manufactured in heat and the painted decoration is fused to the glass’s surface in a kiln so it can be surprisingly robust and resistant to fire.” In the case of the York Minster fire, the solder that holds the pieces of glass together melted, leaving the structure unsafe. The glass also suffered from thermal shock, in part because cold water had been sprayed on it by firefighters, said Brown. “This causes rapid cooling, so the combination of fire and the cooling effect of the water causes lots of little micro-cracks to form on the glass.” On 20 November 1992, a fire broke out in Windsor Castle – one of the official residences of the Queen. The blaze began in the Queen’s private chapel at 11.15am when a curtain was set alight by a spotlight pressed against it. It caused extensive damage to about an eighth of the castle, including the collapse of a number of ceilings. The restoration project cost £36.5m and was finally finished in 1997. Francis Maude, the director at Donald Insall Associates which managed the Windsor Castle restoration, said the speed of the Notre Dame project would depend not on the availability of materials, but on the availability of skilled craftspeople. He said it was too soon to estimate the cost, but pointed to plans for the restoration of the Palace of Westminster, which is estimated to be at least £3.5bn. Notre Dame was smaller, he said, but more thoroughly damaged. He said his work on the Windsor project had provoked a debate about the use of fire resistant materials in any reconstruction – some parts were rebuilt using wooden beams and others using steel. “I think there’s a discussion to be had about whether the roof should be rebuilt to entirely replicate the original,” he said. “There may be other voices out there who say that they can recreate the form of the roof using materials that people use today – in other words a steel structure that can’t catch light. Though with an effective fire suppression system, you can build in oak and have a thatched roof, like the Globe theatre in London.” David said he hoped that Notre Dame would be restored in the “traditional manner with traditional materials” and that “there was nothing wrong with the materials that the building has been built with”. “You can add fire precaution measures and things like this, but the expertise is there,” he said. “Buildings represent so much. They represent a history of a certain period of civilisation. And York Minster, like Notre Dame in Paris, represents the city.”",

    "title": "Is there a beautiful, briny solution to the world’s clean water crisis?",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/10/desalination-world-clean-water-crisis",
    "date": "2019-04-10",
    "transcript": "It’s tipped to be the key environmental challenge of the century – and there’s plenty of competition for that accolade. Water. The planet has plenty of it, but most of it is unusable, locked up in salty oceans. But demand is soaring and the strains are starting to show, from China to Latin America, India to California. Almost a billion people lack access to clean water, and the forecast is for this number to grow sharply in coming decades. Last year, Cape Town came dangerously close to running out of water. Even rainy England has been told: carry on like this and you’ll run out of the stuff in 25 years. There are no easy solutions – but one technology that has proved controversial in the past may be on the cusp of a new dawn. Call it desalination 2.0. Freshwater supplies are under increasing pressure across the world, with the 4 billion people currently living in water-scarce areas predicted to rise to 5 billion by mid-century. Climate change, growing populations and our consumption habits are all key factors, while the technology we use relies on groundwater being extracted at a faster rate than it can be naturally replenished, which just stores up problems for the future. The process of converting seawater to something less briny that could be used on farms and in homes has long been viewed as a last resort for meeting our water needs. The technology is expensive, energy-intensive and only suitable in some areas. It also generates a potent byproduct: highly salty brine, which is usually released back into the sea, and the process has the unfortunate effect of disrupting local fish populations by sucking them into the inflow. But could desalination be reformed enough to make it a viable solution to our water needs? David Binns of early-stage innovation company Epicuro believes that advances in renewable energy technology could make small-scale desalination units a revolutionary advance for poor communities in the developing world, particularly in hot countries. “It’s a life-saver,” he says. “It could make an enormous difference to a terrible problem.” In a prototype he co-invented with seed funding from the drinks and property tycoon Howard Raymond, Binns uses solar collectors which heat water to boiling point, then condense it separately from the salt or dirt that rendered it undrinkable. A small photovoltaic system is attached to power the processors necessary to regulate the machine. This method can be used not just for desalination, which requires the users to be near the coast or another source of saltwater, but also in areas where water is available but grossly contaminated, which involves a much bigger slice of the global water-stressed population. Binns is now seeking government and charitable partners to make the technology widely available, and estimates that between £2m and £3m would enable the company to start manufacture. He envisages the devices being used on a small, local scale, with each unit enough to supply the drinking-water needs of an average family. Other innovators are also exploring the possibilities of renewable energy, as one of the biggest handicaps for traditional desalination is its huge consumption of fossil fuels. For instance, US engineering and technology company Honeywell has supplied water stations (which clean water contaminated with fluorides, nitrates and salinity to 480,000 people) in India, where as much as 70% of water supplies are contaminated and 200,000 people die each year from lack of access to safe water. Along with Safe Water Network India, Honeywell has installed 150 stations that rely solely on solar energy. Newer technology is also coming to the assistance of desalination advocates. The wonder substance graphene is inevitably one avenue being explored. A graphene “sieve” was created two years ago at the University of Manchester which cleans salts from brine and, if it can be scaled up, could be used for cheap desalination. Reporting on the work in the peer-review journal Nature Nanotechnology, Professor Rahul Raveendran Nair said: “Realisation of scalable membranes with uniform pore size, down to the atomic scale, is a significant step forward and will open new possibilities for improving the efficiency of desalination technology.” Separately, the British company G20 is working on an alternative way of using graphene oxide filters for desalination, with a process used to apply a coating of graphene oxide to existing polymer-based water filtration membranes. More traditionally, the $1.75m XPrize Water Abundance was awarded last year to technology that uses distillation to take the water content out of humid air. Skywater machines use a distillation process to turn water vapour to liquid, then treat the water with ozone to prevent contamination with micro-organisms. The more humid the air, the more water can be extracted. However, the technology is still expensive, with prices of $18,000 (£14,000) to $28,000 for units that can process up to 300 gallons a day. For some large urban areas, desalination offers an urgent way out of an increasingly pressing problem. Cate Lamb, the director of water security at CDP, which measures companies’ environmental performance, points to the success of Cape Town, which last year managed to stave off the worst of its water crisis by investing in desalination, as well as restricting water use. Some businesses are also investing in the technology on a smaller scale to supply their operations in water-scarce regions. Lamb says: “Desalination is already having a role to play in aiding cities and companies to respond to water challenges. The deployment of the technology in Cape Town is one of the primary ways in which the city is aiming to enhance resilience.” A recent positive report by financial analysts at Moody’s Investor Service found that the success of Cape Town’s desalination, along with demand management and increased investment in water, was paying off in economic growth and stability, too. “A resilient water sector is critical for the health of Cape Town’s economy and the city’s fiscal position,” said Zoe Jankel, senior analyst. “New investment will enhance that resilience.” If Cape Town is the most recent prominent example of desalination being used to plug an urgent gap, Israel holds the crown for long-term investment in the technology as a strategic public service. The country is home to the world’s biggest reverse-osmosis desalination plant, and can now produce more water than it needs from desalination and water recycling. This could potentially allow for freshwater exports to the surrounding region, and more importantly for the export of “virtual water” – that is, agricultural goods from vegetables and grains to clothing fibres, and manufactured products – to boost its economy. As much as 80% of Israel’s drinking water comes from coastal desalination plants, depending on the time of year and the weather. This is proving so energy-intensive that the biggest plants operate mainly at night, to avoid overloading the power grid. Crucially, however, the country has also invested heavily over decades in the treatment of waste water, recycling nearly 90% of its waste water through sewage treatment plants which then redirect the treated water to irrigation. The sludge byproduct is also used as fertiliser and to generate biogas. This strategy highlights the need for desalination, as it is in Cape Town, to be integrated into an overall water management plan. There is no point in relying on such an expensive way of generating water while wasting the resource in other ways. But where desalination is used without renewables on a large scale, there are always accompanying problems. “It does come with a cost – a carbon cost,” says Lamb. “Further, there are risks associated with the discharge of the large quantities of salt generated. Finally, it’s important to realise that this is a technology that is really only applicable close to the sea. For those that don’t have this luxury, other interventions will be required.” The use of large-scale desalination plants is posing an increasing threat to the health of the seas, a recent report from the UN University found. For every litre of freshwater created from a conventional desalination plant, an average of 1.5 litres of brine is also made. Globally, desalination plants now discharge 142m cubic metres of highly salty brine every day, which is about 50% greater than previous estimates. In a year, that quantity would be enough to cover an area the size of Florida with 30cm of brine. The report’s authors warned that the outflows of brine were depleting the dissolved oxygen in the surrounding seas, with damaging effects on marine life. They called for investment in promising new technologies which could reduce the amount of effluent that is wasted, by converting the metal byproducts – such as sodium, magnesium, lithium, calcium and potassium – to a useful form, which is currently uneconomic to do. They also suggested the saline byproducts could be used in fish farms, where saltier water can result in bigger fish, and in the irrigation of salt-tolerant crops. Even with advances in desalination technology, there will still be drawbacks to its widespread use, not least issues of scaling up technology to the size of the water shortage problem. Virginia Newton-Lewis, senior policy analyst for water security at the charity WaterAid, says governments need to focus on myriad ways of providing the most fundamental service – clean water – to their populations, before becoming mired in what could be expensive and hi-tech desalination equipment. “What we need to see is universal provision of household drinking water to become a top political priority,” she says. “Lack of access to safe water supplies is often down to insufficient finance or political will to support basic services, rather than a physical absence of available water.” Even in areas where water is physically in short supply, there are alternatives that should be explored as a matter of urgency. “Improved water management that prioritises household water supplies could have a huge impact, with very low economic costs,” she says. “It’s a matter of prioritising communities’ clean water supplies ahead of industry and agriculture. Desalination is expensive, causes pollution and has a number of limitations. Therefore, although it definitely has a role to play in certain areas, there are often much more appropriate solutions available.” • Fiona Harvey is an environment correspondent for the Guardian • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "It sounds like something from the outer reaches of science fiction: battlefield robots waging constant war, algorithms that determine who to kill, face-recognition fighting machines that can ID a target and take it out before you have time to say “Geneva conventions”. This is no film script, however, but an ominous picture of future warfare that is moving ever closer. “Killer robots” is shorthand for a range of tech that has generals salivating and peace campaigners terrified at the ethical ramifications of warfare waged via digital proxies. Now, two women armed with nothing more than a Nobel prize, knowhow and a lot of conviction are standing in front of the march of deadly killer robots. They want them banned. And they’ve done this kind of thing before. Jody Williams won her Nobel for leading the long, global effort to get anti-personnel landmines banned. Mary Wareham was a prominent supporter in that campaign. “We were there at the Nobel peace prize ceremony,” Wareham recalls, “and I said to Jody, ‘This is how you finish your career, not start it! What are we going to do now?!’” The answer? Lethal autonomous weapon systems, also known as Laws. The women expect the struggle to be far harder. “In relative terms, landmines are chump change,” Williams says, pointing to the billions of dollars manufacturers could make selling AI-enhanced weapons. Artificial intelligence is already spreading rapidly through policing, healthcare, farming and social work. AI experts are cautioning that militaries will be next. The big question is: what would stop armies from deploying upgraded drone bots to search for, identify, and then take out every man in a village between the ages of 18 and 50? Or to send a killer drone to ID and assassinate a head of state? Weapons manufacturers are riding the same artificial intelligence wave as other industries. Militaries, eyeing each other in a quiet but fierce arms race, are funding some of the most cutting-edge trials. To some, the advantages are clear: killer robots would never fatigue like a human soldier. They could potentially stay out on the battlefield for months. They would never get angry or seek revenge. They would never defy an officer’s orders. They would remove the imperfect human from the equation. Algorithms would determine who to kill. But other military experts have expressed concerns. “There are not only legal and ethical concerns about lethal autonomy, but practical ones as well,” says Paul Scharre, a former US army ranger who wrote the Pentagon’s earliest policy statement on killer robots. “How does one control an autonomous weapon? What happens if there’s a glitch in the system or someone hacks it?” To Williams, the machines represent the very definition of cold-blooded slaughter. With killer robots, World War III would allow little space for what shred of humanity surfaces in wars. There will be no Christmas truce along the western front in any 21st century conflict. “It’s men getting hard-ons over new weapons,” seethes Williams. “They’re doing it simply because they can. They’re doing it because they want to see where it can go.” Israel already has some of the most advanced machines, including an armed ground robot that has patrolled the Gaza border and the Harpy, a missile that circles the skies until it finds its target. Marketed ostensibly to destroy enemy radars, no technical barriers exist to stop engineers in the industry from developing similar weapons that would one day attack people. In the valleys of central California, the US military is running drone swarm experiments. Russia has declared its desire to form an entire battalion of killer robots. And no one really knows what China is doing. No law governs this AI arms race. Countries currently face a free-for-all. Scientists have sounded the alarm, and more than 250 research and academic institutions and 3,000 prominent players in the field have called for a ban on killer robots. But beyond a petition, activists reckon the best way to stop this technology in its tracks is through the tedious, unheroic task of passing an international treaty. That is the strategy of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. More than 100 organisations in 54 countries have joined the coalition, with the aim of getting a deal by 2021. Williams is an idealist, but she is not naive. She has battled the military-industrial complex since her days protesting the Vietnam war. Sceptics had thought banning landmines would be impossible. “Anything is inevitable if you do nothing to stop it,” she says. “When they were drumming that at us — ‘it’s inevitable, it’s inevitable’ — the reason people do that is to disempower you.” In that campaign, Williams and others had lobbied the United Nations to pass an agreement. When that process flagged, they took negotiations outside the UN framework and began corralling countries on board, one by one, until a historic deal in Ottawa in 1997 when more than 120 nations committed to eradicating anti-personnel landmines. Today, the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is following a similar roadmap. The UN has held several rounds of talks in Geneva, including a session at the end of March. But the CSKR has lost faith in that process, and is now focusing on individual western states. Williams and Wareham hope Germany will take the lead. The country joined the UN security council at the start of the year, and its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, cares about the issue. He recently called killer robots “nothing less than an attack on humanity itself”. Behind the scenes, Berlin has reached out to other states to push for more progress. At least some politicians in Germany recognise it has the opportunity to be the first country to ban killer robots and if it does, other European states would follow suit. But the country has also, at times, acted with uncertainty on the matter, especially in its discourse at the UN. In part to put Germany on the spot, members of the CSKR came together in Berlin last month to drum up public support. Standing in front of the organisation’s own “friendly” robot mascot, Williams urged the crowd before her to reach out to their political representatives and to spread the word. “People freak out over the word ‘activism’,” Williams told them. “All it means is ‘to act.’” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "How do you beat rightwing populists? With pink socks, viral videos, condoms – and an iron determination not to let them decide what matters. That’s how Operation Libero are doing it anyway. As advancing nationalist parties prepare to meet in Milan on Monday to forge an alliance in the run-up to May’s European elections, anti-populist activists in Switzerland may have some lessons on halting – even reversing – the seemingly unstoppable rise of rightwing populists. “It’s about the political space, who’s defining and shaping it, who’s communicating strategically within it, who, basically, is holding it,” says Flavia Kleiner, 28, the group’s self-assured co-president, over tea in a Zurich bookshop and coffee house. “At the moment, in lots of places, it’s populists. Everywhere, the conversation’s about identity: who we are, where we’re from, the past. But that’s their turf. We have to go on the offensive – clear the fog, refocus attention, reframe the debate.” As the ground zero of postwar European populism, Switzerland is home to arguably Europe’s most consistently successful rightwing populist party, the Swiss People’s party (SVP). For 25 years, the SVP had been steadily building its electoral success through a series of increasingly nation-first, anti-immigration popular referendums. In February 2016, months after the SVP had scored its highest ever share of the vote, 29.4%, in national elections, with the political mainstream seemingly helpless to halt its advance, Switzerland went to the polls again, this time for an SPP-sponsored referendum demanding the automatic deportation of immigrants found guilty of even minor offences. Had the proposal passed, any of the country’s two million non-Swiss residents – a quarter of the population – caught, for example, speeding twice in any 10-year period, could have been automatically returned to their homeland, with judges barred from considering personal circumstances. It didn’t pass. Voters rejected it overwhelmingly by 59% to 41%, on a higher turnout – at nearly 64% – than for any popular referendum in years. “One moment we were talking about immigration and doing just fine,” the SVP’s leader said at the time. “The next, everyone was talking about rule of law. I don’t know what happened.” What happened was Operation Libero. The movement had just chalked up the first in an unbroken series of victories over popular referendums pushed by the SVP. The latest, on giving Swiss law precedence over international law, was defeated in November last year by 66% to 34%. In cantonal elections in Zurich last month, which are seen as a reliable indicator for October’s national elections, the biggest losers, by far, were the SVP, whose share of the vote plunged lower than at any time since 1995. “The populists don’t know what’s hit them, and they really don’t know how to deal with it,” says Constantin Seibt, one of the country’s most respected journalists and editor-in-chief of Republik, a record-breaking, crowdfunded news startup. “All they can manage is to bleat ‘It’s not fair. They’ve got all these young people, and somehow they keep turning everything we say against us’. Well, those young people have changed the dynamics of the country. The populists seem to be running out of steam. It’s pretty cool.” Operation Libero was formed by a handful of mainly student friends soon after the “political earthquake” of 2014, when the SVP narrowly won a potentially crippling referendum to curb EU immigration. “We had to fight because we did not want to live in a country like this,” says Kleiner. Also there at the beginning was communications director Silvan Gisler, 31, a former journalist. “It was just, ‘Fuck, this really has just happened,’” he says in the group’s offices, which are based in a slightly scruffy office block around the corner from Zurich’s red light district. “And had everyone done enough to stop it? No.” Operation Libero was a working title but it “kind of stuck”, Gisler said. “You know, in football there used to be a player called the ‘libero’ – the last defender, but also the one who gives the first pass to the attack. And ‘operation’ conveyed urgency. We are a movement, not a party. But above all, we’re about values and action.” From the outset, the group adopted a radically different approach. Its first, modest campaign was in late 2014, against another popular referendum, Ecopop, which envisaged “limiting the population to a level compatible with the preservation of the country’s natural resources” – notably, of course, by restricting immigration. Helped by small-scale crowdfunding, the group launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign. An army of young volunteers handed amused nightclubbers condoms in bright pink packaging, commanding them to “prevent disaster: have sex against Ecopop”. Soon after, it launched a campaign for same-sex marriage, which it is still pursuing (“It’s vital that we’re not just reactive. That we say what we’re really for, not just what we’re against,” says Gisler) with viral social media videos featuring cute same-sex couples on ski-lifts in wedding gear telling passersby they are “unhappily unmarried”. The breakthrough, though, came that day in February 2016. “It was clear that if we talked about criminal foreigners, we’d become the defenders of criminal foreigners,” says Kleiner. “We’d have lost before we started. “Instead, we set the terms of the debate by portraying the SVP’s proposal as an attack against fundamental Swiss values. Against the constitution as a pillar of our liberal democracy; the rule of law; equal justice for all. We were the patriots here, because this was an attack on things that every Swiss citizen holds dear.” She first thought they might win, Kleiner says, the day she heard two women talking about the upcoming referendum in a shop: “One said, ‘Can you imagine? It would mean a family man, a father, being deported, just like that, for driving a bit too fast.’ And the other said: ‘I wouldn’t want that happening to me. It’s not right.” Success brought money and the means to do more. Operation Libero has about 1,500 members paying a CHF50-100 (£38-£76) annual subscription; 10,000 donors, mostly giving sums less than CHF250; 5,000 volunteers on call and four regional sections. It employs seven part-time staff and is organised to a degree that is positively, well, Swiss. The office is all charts and whiteboards, with six campaigns – some, still secret – mapped across weekly timelines. Post-it notes and to-do lists cover walls and desks. At clockwork-smooth morning meetings plans are discussed, projects refined, ideas floated, timings decided, messages polished, responsibilities allocated. Of necessity, and because it works, much of the group’s work is online. Besides the viral videos, it enlists “online warriors”, more than 100 at any one time for major campaigns, to engage on social media platforms. These are not trolls, Kleiner insists. They use their own names, offer arguments rather than invective and are under orders to stay polite and never escalate. Fuschia pink, Operation Libero’s brand colour, vibrates everywhere. Merchandising, in the form of startlingly pink socks, sits in piles under desks. “Trump sucks, Wilders sucks, Le Pen sucks, Petry sucks,” says one video, from two years ago. “Populism sucks. Make 2017 great again. Buy Libero socks.” “You have to have fun,” says Gisler. But the group’s youthful enthusiasm – most Operation Libero staff are in their 20s or early 30s – is married to a campaign-hardened professionalism. The slogans, images and posters they devise themselves are as hard-hitting and attention-grabbing as those of their opponents, dreamt up by an expensive political advertising agency. “We spend so much time getting them right,” says Gisler. “It’s so important to have the right content, smart content. To frame the debate right. Content has to have substance, depth, rigour. But it’s also how to say it – the visuals and the message. It has to be short enough, catchy enough, popular enough, to really break through.” Kleiner wants eventually to see a new alliance of progressive, liberal democratic movements and parties across Europe, of which Operation Libero could be a part. “The SVP say they’re defending ordinary Swiss people against the state and a global elite but they’re actually weakening the structures and institutions that secure those very individuals’ freedoms,” she says. “It’s the populists who are on the attack!” Politics now, Kleiner believes, has moved far beyond the left-right divide, or even the progressive-conservative divide. “It’s increasingly, actually, about constructive versus destructive,” she says. “That’s really where we are.” Her top tips for combating rightwing populism? Reframe the debate, obviously. But beyond that, “You have to be accurate, honest, understandable. You have to be serious about what you’re doing, responsible – but at the same time keep it fun, light. That’s not always easy. It’s really hard sometimes, actually. And you have to be positive.” Underpinning everything, says Kleiner, is an ambition just to “change the mood. The thing that’s there but no one sees. To move away from the fear and pessimism the SVP have instilled in the Swiss mentality, change that narrative. We don’t want some defensive, inward-looking museum of a country. We’re looking forward, with hope, to a Switzerland we want to live in in 2050.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/03/bereaved-son-ryan-hart-family-killings-reported",
    "date": "2019-04-03",
    "transcript": "When Ryan Hart’s father killed his mother, Claire, and sister, Charlotte, three years ago, the family’s anguish was compounded by a slew of insensitive media coverage. Articles quoted neighbours saying Ryan’s father was “the nicest guy you could ever meet” and that his parents were the “loveliest couple”. In one instance, the domestic homicide was described as being “understandable”. “There was a rush to excuse our father’s actions in the media and to sympathise with him that showed a complete misunderstanding of coercively controlling men,” Ryan says. “They don’t abuse their neighbours, they target their abuse at the family and put a facade on to the outside world. We shouldn’t be surprised when murdering men appear to be normal men because that’s how they’ve kept their control of their family hidden for so long.” Now, after a year of campaigning, Hart is forcing a change to guidelines on media coverage that will encourage a greater accuracy in reporting domestic homicides. These guidelines will aim for journalists to place accountability solely on the killer, crack down on sensationalist language, and avoiding using trivialising imagery, with a greater sensitivity towards culture and religion. The hope is to end the posthumous exculpation of family killers, which Hart believes might actually have encouraged his father to kill. “Our father was Googling for many months about men who murdered their wives and children before he killed his own wife and daughter,” Ryan says. “He was looking to see what sort of response he would get, since men who murdered their wives are often quoted as ‘nice guys’ because they’ve put so much work into maintaining this false reputation. And that’s exactly what happened with him.” The guidelines will be published later this month by the journalism regulatory body , the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso). While they are an advisory resource for now, Hart hopes to make them part of Ipso’s editors’ code of practice, which member organisations must follow or face fines of up to £1m for breaching. Member organisations include the Sun, the Times, the Daily Mail, and the Sunday Telegraph. Created by feminist organisation Level Up, in consultation with survivors such as Ryan Hart and criminologist Dr Jane Monckton-Smith, these “dignity for dead women” guidelines not only aim to increase sensitivity around reporting on domestic violence cases but also act as a checklist for reporters writing about cases. Points to note include only using police-authorised images of the victim and including those of the perpetrator at the bottom, describing the perpetrator’s actions in an active voice, and refraining from using neighbours’ quotes in the absence of family members. The misrepresentation of abusive men is a phenomenon Carys Afoko, the executive director of Level Up, believes occurs throughout the media. “There’s a sense that some victims are more sympathetic than others,” Afoko says, “if you’re a nurse you might get sympathetic coverage, but if you left your partner for a woman, you’ll probably get ‘lesbian sex shame murder’. Some women are considered appropriate victims and others aren’t, while for the men there isn’t a culture of accountability.” “Our guidelines are focused on making sure that the reporting on women is responsible, and giving them the dignity that they’ve been denied in their deaths,” Afoko says. “Too often these things are reported as crimes of passion, like in the Sally Challen case, when actually they’re crimes of control. We need to dismantle these myths around domestic abuse.” Ipso’s head of standards, Charlotte Unwin, says that while it receives relatively few complaints about domestic violence reporting as an organisation, “this is a topic with significant social impact”. For Teresa Parker at the charity Women’s Aid, this social impact must also include the voices of those who have survived domestic abuse. “So much of the reporting on domestic homicide cases is court reporting, which means that often the prosecution’s words are presented as fact,” she says, “this leaves the victim with no voice, and so it’s important for her story to be included. This new guidance will help achieve that.” As well as providing a voice, ultimately Ryan Hart believes that better media representation could reframe the narrative of domestic abuse for potential perpetrators. “The men who commit these crimes don’t feel that they’re doing anything wrong,” he says, “so if we keep pushing these narratives through the media, the men will remain in an echo chamber.” Ryan and Level Up also have plans to begin newsroom training. “The Samaritans campaign to better report on suicide has been so successful and was implemented into the editors’ code, so we hope we can do the same with domestic homicide,” Ryan says, “we can’t let it become normalised, otherwise the media becomes complicit in murder.”",

    "date": "2019-04-02",
    "transcript": "Five young men who spent months languishing in the Calais refugee camp are to be rewarded in parliament for their efforts fighting Home Office mistreatment of child asylum seekers. Nisar, Naqeeb, Tariq, Wasim and Mohamad*, all travelled across Europe alone as minors before reaching the UK in 2016. The five, now aged between 18 and 22, all faced long delays to their asylum procedures but used the time to contact MPs and join campaigns to highlight failings in the system. On Tuesday, they will receive a Your UK Parliament community campaigner award. In February they hosted an event at parliament and invited the chief inspector of borders and immigration, David Bolt, to hear evidence about their experience in the asylum system. After hearing about the severe impact on young people’s mental health from delays of months and even years, Bolt decided to launch an inquiry into how the Home Office treats unaccompanied minors. Despite receiving an award from parliament, Naqeeb has been refused asylum after waiting nearly three years to have his case resolved. He told the Guardian that he will fight for a fairer system as long as he is in the UK. “The Home Office doesn’t believe the evidence I have given them about my case, which is upsetting as my life will be in danger if I am returned to my country,” said the Afghan national, who is 18. “However, I still believe in the UK and its values, and so I will keep contributing to this country and the people here. I believe we would all benefit hugely if people seeking sanctuary were given the chance to fully contribute to this country. So I will continue working as hard as I can for this. I know there is so much we can achieve together.” Elaine Ortiz is the leader of the Hummingbird Young Leaders group, which helped the young men. She told the Guardian: “We didn’t tell them to do this, we just gave them space to learn public speaking and how to bring about change and they ran with it. “They knew it wouldn’t help their own individual cases but they wanted to try and help others, that is what is beautiful about this.” Some refugees have had to wait as long as four years for their decisions. Ortiz says the impact on young people has been devastating, with suicide attempts and multiple hospitalisations. Despite facing his own problems, Naqeeb says the award means a lot to him. “This award gives me strength. It shows there are people listening to our stories.” * The men have asked for their surnames not to be given as some still have open asylum cases.",

    "transcript": "It’s morning in Majengo, a poor neighbourhood of Mombasa. The palm trees and swimming pools of the tourist resorts scattered around the coastal Kenyan city seem a world away from these narrow, rubbish-strewn streets and tin-roofed homes. In a small community centre, a small group sit on the battered wooden benches in the searing summer heat talking of extremism, police violence and gangs – and hope and courage. Majengo already had a bad reputation before Islamist militants killed 21 in an assault in January on a luxury hotel, office and restaurant complex in the capital Nairobi, 500km away. The neighbourhood has long been known as a fertile recruiting ground for al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist organisation based in neighbouring Somalia that is responsible for a bloody if intermittent terrorist campaign in Kenya. The suicide bomber who led the assault in Nairobi has been identified as Mahir Khalid Riziki, 25, from Majengo. Investigators are still trying to understand exactly howhe was recruited, trained and then returned to Kenya by al-Shabaab, an affiliate of al-Qaida. In Majengo, locals have a good idea how it might have happened. Rukiya, 27, describes how he came close to being recruited. With a group of friends, he attended local extremist mosques that were later shut down by authorities. “We felt [going to fight with al-Shabaab] was a religious duty. We were looking forward to being martyrs,” he said. “My mother did not want me to fight but my father was supportive. Many people I know went to Somalia, but I was lucky. I ended up in a religious school where a different teacher made me realise that my ideas about holy war were all wrong.” Rukiya is now part of an innovative £2.5m programme run by Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) , a thinktank in London. Most efforts to tackle extremism aim to “de-radicalise” existing militants but these have had only patchy success since they were first pioneered a decade or so ago. The Rusi programme is different. It has its origins in crime prevention and focuses instead on stopping people becoming drawn into extremism. Since 2016, it has funded dozens of mentors in Kenya who work with more than 200 people seen as vulnerable to recruitment efforts and dangerous ideologies. Thirty-two individuals have “graduated” from the programme. Along with extremism, Majengo also suffers from soaring levels of unemployment, drugs and gangs. Martine Zeuthen, the team leader, said a wide network of social workers, local clerics and teachers referred those thought to be at risk. There are several indicators: a close friend or relative who had joined al-Shabaab, actively advocating violent extremism in the community, membership of a gang or a recent incarceration. Coming from an abusive family, dropping out of school or converting to Islam were also risk factors, Zeuthen said, though of less relevance. The programme links the vulnerable with a mentor, often someone from the same neighbourhood who has overcome similar challenges, who can help them deal with any serious problems in their lives, support them emotionally and divert them from the “alternative community” offered by extremist groups. Zeuthen said the programme was prompting “a lot of interest in the US and Europe” and an approach of looking at terrorism as “just another serious crime”. Kenya has long suffered from extremism. A first wave of violence between 1998 and 2002 was directed by al-Qaida against foreign targets, including US embassies and Israeli tourists. It had ebbed by the middle of the last decade. But radicalism continued to grow among Kenya’s Muslim minority, fuelled by a sense of marginalisation, the impact of the US-led “war on terror” and a shift away from traditional moderate Islamic practices to more rigorous versions of the faith promoted by countries in the Gulf. “First we starting seeing signs of religious intolerance, and young men were disappearing. It was related to the world picture and the perception that the US and the western world were enemies of Islam, and in Kenya Muslims were feeling that they were second class citizens. We also started feeling the influence of the Gulf states which brought different views about non-believers,” said Sheik Yusuf Abu Hamza, a cleric in the sprawling and very poor Nairobi neighbourhood of Kibera. In 2013 gunmen from al-Shabaab stormed a shopping mall in Nairobi, killing 67 people. Then 148 people were shot dead at a university in Kenya’s north-east. Both attacks were launched from Somalia, where Kenyan troops are fighting the extremists as part of an African Union force, but drew attention to support networks within Kenya itself. Almost all the mentors – who are paid a small stipend by Rusi – and the mentees interviewed by the Guardian in Majengo complained of police harassment and brutality. “It is like a reflex action. Even if there is just a small incident, the patrols come through. After [the recent] Nairobi attack, most of us ended up being arrested, detained, questioned,” said Nolly, 35. Others allege bribes and mistreatment. Recruiters specifically target women, said Fatima, 27, who admitted to having once been “very close to getting involved” in extremism. “I was going to fight for Muslims. I wanted my revenge on people who judged me because I was a Muslim. I was crazy,” she said. “The youth just have unemployment, poverty. We don’t have an opportunity to express ourselves. There is a sense the government is targeting a certain community.” Local senior police officials say they make strenuous efforts to “win hearts and minds”. Recently, Kenyan authorities have faced a new wave of Islamist militants who are better educated, from a wider range of ethnic backgrounds and include more women. All those involved in January’s attack appear to have been born in Kenya, and one is the son of an army NCO from Kenya’s largest ethnic community, the Kikuyu. “As long as this kind of wrong religion is there, then radicalisation will not end… There are new teachers and new recruits among young people,” said Rukiya. He and others in the programme told the Guardian they know young people who have gone to Somalia recently. But many are optimistic. “There is a growing sense of belonging [in the Muslim community],” said Abu Hamza, the cleric. “This generation feel Kenyan and what to do something for the country.” In Majengo, Fatima, 25, said the mentor programme had taught her to believe in herself, to value the life she has and that revenge is not the answer. “I used to feel there was only me to face so many problems. I used to fear people but now I have courage”,” she said. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/27/appy-day-fix-mental-health-phone-global-crisis-solutions",
    "date": "2019-03-27",
    "transcript": "The world’s mounting mental health crisis isn’t just about the vast numbers of people falling ill. It’s about the tiny number of people available to treat them. Wherever you live, it’s highly probable that there simply are not nearly enough psychiatrists and psychotherapists. The overwhelming majority of countries have fewer than 200 psychiatrists for every million people. The result is often long waiting times, eye-watering fees for private attention and/or the overprescription of antidepressants by family doctors with few other options. Now, however, technology is seeking to fill the vacuum with a formidable dashboard of apps, chatbots, avatars and digital counsellors that promise everything from daily check-ins and mood tracking to cognitive behavioural therapy and preventive “mental health hygiene”. The big question is: are they any good? The majority of these platforms are for-profit businesses and, as such, the global mental health software market had an estimated value of $1.35bn in 2017. Some experts in the mental health field are cautiously optimistic. The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), the profession’s regulatory body, found in a recent survey of 1,987 members that 61% already use digital platforms in their therapeutic work, ranging from messaging to video conferencing. The deputy chair of the BACP, Fiona Ballantine Dykes, says that with text-based online platforms, “there are benefits to the anonymity, since sometimes it is really difficult to sit in front of a person and talk to them. If this is something that can encourage people to take a first step to counselling or help signpost them to other services, then that is fantastic.” Esther Schmidt, NHS children’s services commissioning lead in Swindon, says that these anonymised online services “seem to reach some people from BME [black and minority ethnic] and minority groups in a way that face-to-face services probably wouldn’t because of stigma around cultural assumptions of mental health”. She notes that these services “will become an increasing part of treatment, especially for places with geographical challenges”. Yet not everyone is a fan. Sarah Niblock, the chief executive of the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), the sector’s regulatory body, has her concerns. “While the immediacy and accessibility of online mental health platforms can be seen as a definite positive, the anonymity can be troubling,” she says. “There’s no evidence that these platforms can provide a lasting alternative to face-to-face therapy, since the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and client is what allows the person to confront issues which have been deeply buried.” It’s this confrontation that makes the therapist’s office a potentially daunting experience. By far the most popular of all these services are mindfulness apps. Drawing on meditative therapies, platforms such as Headspace have been valued at $250m, and its rival Calm has been downloaded more than 45m times. While these services mainly use the digital format as an accessible alternative to physical diaries or self-help guides, there has been a new spate of apps that offer counselling services and peer support groups via a digital platform. Perhaps the most popular of these, in the UK at least, is Kooth, a service targeted at 11- to 18-year-olds, allowing them to anonymously discuss their mental health experiences with peers, as well as take part in text-based counselling sessions with remote therapists. User numbers are expected to top 100,000 this year, from 20,000 in 2015, and 95% of users say they would recommend it to a friend. Co-founder Zoe Blake credits Kooth’s success to digital anonymity. “There’s a disinhibition factor associated with counselling via text, where young people feel the lack of eye contact or judging allows them to be themselves,” she says. “Over 86% of our users have said they prefer the online environment to face-to-face counselling.” Ben Griffiths, 16, has been using Kooth for the past 18 months. “There’s definitely less stigma around using Kooth,” he says. “When you go to a counselling session in school, it’s hard to be private about it because people can see where you are going – whereas with Kooth it’s anonymous, you can have as many sessions as you need, and it helps stop your small stresses from developing into something bigger, like depression.” Blake emphasises that Kooth is an early-intervention service, designed to address the exam-related stresses experienced by users such as Griffiths, rather than for crisis management. “We’re not replacing face-to-face counselling,” she says, “we’re getting the counsellors to do only the things they can do, without taking up unnecessary time on preliminaries.” While Kooth is facilitated by counsellors with a minimum of three years’ experience, other platforms integrate digital aspects further, using artificial intelligence to take the place of a trained human interface. Silicon Valley firms Woebot and X2AI, as well as Indian startup Wysa, all use scripted chatbots to engage with their users, scanning text to machine-learn cues that they then respond to. Wysa is operated by a penguin avatar that users can chat to, as if using WhatsApp, describing itself as “your life coach and friend”, while Woebot’s interface is more constructed. It conducts daily “check-ins” that monitor users’ moods (from “happy” to “angry”, “tired”, or “sad”) as well as allowing users to write “chat stories” to explore emotions in greater detail. For instance, on clicking that I was “sad” on one Woebot check-in, it recommended a “thought challenger” exercise to identify my negative thoughts and pick apart the reasons for their existence with a series of short responses. While the experience can feel forced and jarring at times (interspersing emojis with phrases such as “coinky-dink” and “cognitive dissonance”), these chatbots are extremely popular: Woebot receives an exchange of 2m messages a week, X2AI covers 4 million people in the US and Wysa has more than 600,000 users globally. Woebot co-founder Alison Darcy defines her platform not as a prediagnosis tool but instead one that “helps people at the point of the single encounter, changing the conversation away from the domain of the clinic towards the understanding that everyone has mental health, which has to be taken care of every day”. In this way, she believes that logging on and communicating with the app for just 10 minutes a day can have a more powerful effect than the “one-hour lecture” of a counselling session. Similarly, Wysa co-founder Ramakant Vempati says that “labelling and diagnosis is completely irrelevant to the lived experience of a condition. What people want is a safe space to be able to talk, an empathetic experience. So Wysa’s like having a journal which can write back to you.” Yet these complex and rapid technological developments have not always had positive results. A recent test conducted by the BBC found that both Wysa and Woebot failed to notice messages containing allegations of underage sexual abuse, responding in one case that the user should “rewrite your negative thought so that it’s more balanced”. But Niblock of UKCP points out: “People should be unafraid to work with psychotherapists, since you need the ability, no matter how ashamed or guilty you feel about something, to tell that to a person who then says, ‘I hear you’, and who isn’t judging. This is where therapy is transformational, and a chatbot cannot replace being supported by a human being.” If reliance on AI chatbots is a step too far, then perhaps digital interventions as part of a holistic treatment is the solution. In this vein, workplace mental health platform Unmind produces informational content, which is signposted to the user by AI, to create a combination of cognitive behavioural therapy and guided self-help. Clinical psychologist and Unmind co-founder Nick Taylor says without digital mental health treatment, the £34.9bn cost of mental ill health at work in the UK last year will only increase. “From a clinical perspective, it’s really frustrating that when you see someone for the first time, you think, ‘If only I’d met you six months before, I could’ve had much more of an impact’,” he says. “We wouldn’t leave a broken leg for six months without going to the doctor, but that’s what happens with mental health, and it’s incredibly damaging.” To remedy this, Unmind aims to remove the negative stigma around mental health. “Diagnostic assessment searches for problems, and you can’t use that for a population that is well,” Taylor says. “It’s not appropriate to ask someone who is well if they’re suicidal – it’ll put them off engaging with their mental health full-stop. So, our platform allows you to track your wellbeing and, while we’re not diagnostic, we can develop a good idea of how well someone is, based on how they interact with the platform, and that allows us to assign content or signpost to other services.” Unmind is only available through employers who have paid for access, and its current users include more than 100,000 employees of John Lewis and Yorkshire Building Society, but the company is in talks to expand into the US – where 65% of the population of non-metropolitan counties do not have access to a psychiatrist. Perhaps early digital engagement with our mental health could reduce the stigma of the therapist’s office, especially if it is not easily accessible. As digital incursions into our life become natural – none of the companies I spoke to reported concerns from their users on data usage – these mental wellbeing platforms could become as commonplace as Facebook or Twitter. “Mental health is the number one best thing about being a human being,” Taylor says, “so it’s frustrating that we always see it in a negative light – we need the right care at the right time and we shouldn’t be ashamed of it.” • Ammar Kalia is a Guardian journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursary • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

    "date": "2019-03-19",
    "transcript": "With a great heave, a young man pushes the ancient, three-wheeled rickshaw down a ramp and it splutters to a start. The driver, Sutino “Kinong” Hadi, laughs as he putters his tiny Bemo in a loop outside a preschool in Tanah Abang, in central Jakarta. It’s all the signal the children need; around 20 flood out to envelope the car, pulling at hangings, clambering into the front seat. It’s an exciting time: their library has arrived. Kinong is one of thousands of Indonesians who have opened their own library in their own communities. Estimates suggest there are thousands of such libraries in Indonesia, started by ordinary people with great initiative to address the lack of books in their area and funded by occasional donations. There is the Perahu Pustaka, a library boat that sails around West Sulawesi. There are libraries on the back of vegetable carts, shelves lugged around by horses in Serang and in West Papua. Across Banten, a 200-strong motorbike gang called the Komunitas Motor Literasi (Moli), brings books to homes from a box attached to their vehicles, delivered with the ease of a takeaway. All of them are run by inventive, ambitious, ordinary people much like Kinong, 59, who left school before he turned 10. Since 2013, he has parked his Bemo near schools in Tanah Abang, and let kids settle in to enjoy a book. He only sometimes allows them to take it home, with a stern promise to return it. “I’ve lost a lot of books that way,” he laughs. With 17,000 islands and a geography that almost spans the distance from London to Tehran, Indonesia has struggled to promote reading across the country. For every 100 students, just one quarter leave school meeting minimum standards of literacy and numeracy. Only 30% of villages have a library; some of the smallest only stock copies of the Quran. The government has attempted several initiatives, including a rule that children must read a book that isn’t a textbook at school for 15 minutes each morning; and on the 17th day of each month, individuals can post books, wherever they want in the country, for free. But the persistent myth that Indonesians aren’t interested in reading still pervades; last September, Jakarta governor, Anies Baswedan, told the Jakarta Post: “We are challenged to improve our reading interest, particularly in an era where people are far more interested in reading WhatsApp [chats] than in reading books … People nowadays prefer to skim rather than read.” But civilians argue that interest isn’t the problem, its the lack of infrastructure. “Reading appetite isn’t low in Indonesia, its just hard to get books,” says Laura Prinsloo, a publisher and chairperson of Indonesia’s national book committee, citing the millions now posting books on the 17th. “In Indonesia, if the government fails, the public does something – then they step up. A lot of the people operating these libraries don’t have an education, which makes it hard in a place where it’s about who you know. So if you don’t know anyone, you just do it yourself.” Like Andri Gunawan, a wiry young man who heads up the Komunitas Motor Literasi. He never had a library in any of his schools and only became a voracious reader as an adult. “Contrary to what a lot of people say, it’s not that there is no interest in reading, it is that there are no books,” he says. “We had to start there.” Or Kiswanti, a 52-year-old woman who started out delivering books door-to-door for free on her bicycle. Now, her library and school Warabal, found in Parung, Java, is 21 years old and houses 15,000 books, looked after by 25 volunteers for 1,700 members. Kiswanti, who prefers to use just the one name, only received a few years of elementary education and decades on, still cries at the memory of having to spy on lessons in a neighbouring school through slits in the bamboo wall. “My father apologised as he couldn’t send me on to further education,” she says. “But he told me, if I wanted to be smarter, I had to read – and if I did, I could achieve whatever dream I had.” Her dream was opening her own library – and she pursued it relentlessly. Her wages from shucking peanuts and harvesting rice went towards books. When she got a job as a domestic helper in Jakarta, she asked to be paid in books. When her husband proposed in 1987, she had rules – including the freedom to buy any books she wanted. When Kiswanti opened Warabal in 1997, she even began fasting 10 days each month to buy more. “I needed 3,000 rupiah (16p) to eat a day,” she explains. “If I didn’t eat, I can save 30,000 (£1.66) in 10 days – so I could take our best students by taking them to bookshops and buy them any book they want.” Health problems eventually stopped her from continuing this practice, but her resolve remains the same. “Reading transports me and introduces me to new worlds – I want to give children that.” Though they are applauded by the Indonesian government, community library owners like Andri, Kiswanti and Kinong all rely on donations from the public. Even President Joko Widodo has donated books to Kinong, who keeps a small photo of them shaking hands taped in pride of place on his Bemo. Not even Bemos being banned from the road last year has stopped Kinong’s resolve, though it ended his 40-year career as a taxi driver. He now sells drinks on the side of the road, and can only drive this library around the neighbourhood once or twice a week. “My life situation is a bit unstable right now,” he says. “If I could earn more, my family would be more stable and I could do this more. I just want children to read more than I did.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/18/buyer-beware-amsterdam-seeks-to-ban-buy-to-let-on-newbuild-homes",
    "date": "2019-03-18",
    "transcript": "Amsterdam has drawn up plans to ban the rental of new-build homes on city land, as part of a spate of policies to combat spiralling house prices, housing shortages and over-saturation of tourism. The plan from its housing chief states: “Investors are buying Amsterdam homes more and more frequently, intending to rent them out. This means that ‘normal’ house-buyers have less of a chance in the housing market, and Amsterdam is not happy with this.” The move comes at time of increasing alarm in the Dutch city and with the national government about three years of runaway house prices, a shortage of affordable homes and ever-growing tourism that some local residents and businesses say is destroying Amsterdam. An estimated one in five homes in the city is sold to investors, and last year about 10,000 foreign nationals moved to Amsterdam from January to the end of November, the same number of Dutch nationals left, while there was a natural increase of 5,000 residents. In the past week, the city housing chief, Laurens Ivens, announced policies to enforce maximum prices for newbuild owner-occupied homes for middle incomes, and a crackdown on the subletting of social houses, which is banned. The Airbnb-style short lets, which account for 12% of overnight tourist stays in the city are also being tackled: the Dutch home affairs minister, Kajsa Ollengren, announced plans for a national registration scheme and to make renting out a home via holiday rental platforms for more than annual maximum of days – in Amsterdam it is 30 – a financial crime with tough penalties. There “We don’t think we have the golden bullet but the city of Amsterdam does have a lot of different measures to improve the liveability of the city for our residents,” said a city spokeswoman. “The first point of a city is to live in, and the second is to visit.” Amsterdam has become a magnet for international business, especially with Brexit looming. In 2017, the city joined the UBS global real estate bubble index, and is now seventh after London and New York in terms of price-to-income ratio, with median sales price at a record €448,000 (£382,000) in the last quarter of 2018. Even though 39% of homes are social housing, there isn’t enough affordable housing, according to the Amsterdam Federation of Housing Associations (AFWC). “We regularly speak to people who are 31 and still living with their parents, or have three-generational houses – not through choice,” said Egbert de Vries, AFWC director. “The population is growing, with people living longer and positive net immigration for the last 50 years. Over the last 10 years we have built 60,000 fewer homes, and people who get a house have on average been on the waiting list for 15 years.” While housebuilding is the most essential action, he said, “it would help to make rules that people have to live in the house that they buy”. Dr David Wachsmuth, an expert in urban planning and governance at McGill University in Montreal, has studied how holiday rentals reduce housing stock. He said a buy-to-let ban could limit tourist rentals in problem cities like London, too. “The evidence is clear that a lot of new construction is heading directly into the short-term rental market, so trying to make sure these properties are occupied by long-term residents is sound public policy. “More importantly, it speaks to the challenges that Amsterdam and many other cities are facing in regulating short-term rentals … mostly because Airbnb and the other platforms consistently work to evade and undermine regulations which restrict their growth.” Others have concerns, though. Emile van Gelder of Amsterdam estate agents Peter Bruin, said the buy-to-live rule would be an “unacceptable infringement of the property right of ownership” and that build more homes was a better solution. The city’s plans are treating the symptoms rather than the disease, said Stephen Hodes of thinktank Amsterdam in Progress, adding: “What if parents buy a house for their children when they study in Amsterdam or I buy a house and am sent abroad for six months for work? The real problem is investors who buy up multiple houses for letting, and this regulation will affect them – but also the freedom of the ‘normal’ residents.” In a statement, Airbnb said it helped its 20,000 Amsterdam hosts comply with the rules and pay tax: “We have long supported the creation of a national registration system as a user-friendly tool that allows cities across the Netherlands to get the data they need and effectively discourages bad actors … We look forward to working together with policymakers on the implementation of a system that is fair, proportionate and in line with EU law.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Democracy is good for your heart, health and longevity, a major study of 170 countries has concluded, in a boost to a form of government that has faced significant setbacks around the world in recent years. Life expectancy improved more quickly in countries that switched to democracy over the past 50 years, the researchers discovered, and there were fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease, diseases such as cancer and cirrhosis, and even road traffic accidents. The study, published in the Lancet, said it was not just that democracies tended to be richer: the “democracy effect” was far stronger than any GDP effect. “Free and fair elections appear important for improving adult health … most likely by increasing government accountability and responsiveness,” the study said. “Democracies are more likely than autocracies to lead to health gains.” The report comes at a time when democracy is being challenged perhaps as never before. A majority of the world’s population lives in democracies, but more than 2 billion people live in countries where democracy has been on the back foot in recent years, such as India, Turkey, Brazil and the US. The rise of populism attests to disillusionment in much of the democratic world, and the relative success of autocracies from China to Rwanda, and Vietnam to Singapore, has raised questions as to whether political freedom is the best system of government for everyone. The study concludes that, as far as health is concerned, it is. Thomas Bollyky, the lead author, from the US Council on Foreign Relations, said: “This is good news at a time when the news around democracy has been fairly depressing. Health and elections are inevitably linked.” Researchers used existing measures of democratic experience compiled in the V-Dem database and plotted them against a range of metrics such as government health spending and disease outcomes. They then compared trends in countries that had transitioned from autocracy to democracy since 1970 with 55 states that had not. The impact of HIV was factored out, because the huge amount of foreign aid devoted to the virus would have skewed the findings. The conclusions were stark. Life expectancy at age 15 was 3% higher in countries 10 years after their transition to democracy than in counterparts that had not changed government type. Cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, transport injuries and non-communicable diseases also fell as democracy bedded in. These four health dangers cause a quarter of the total death and disability in people under 70 in low and middle-income countries. The implication for further democratisation across the autocratic world is clear. “We estimate that, between 1994 and 2014, the increases in democratic experience resulted in 16 million fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease globally,” said Bollyky. He added that if China had experienced the same democratic transition that a country such as Poland achieved over that period, it would have saved 10 million lives of people who died from that one illness. Researchers believe free societies achieve better outcomes not because of prosperity but public pressure. “Countries where government is not subject to free and fair democracy doesn’t have the same pressure from voters” to deliver better health services, Bollyky said. Dr Joseph Dieleman, a co-author of the paper, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said: “Efforts to improve the health of adults might benefit from funding programmes that help countries to strengthen their democratic processes.” The study is the biggest of its kind to make such a broad correlation between democracy and adult health: others have focused more narrowly on democracy’s impact on early years health. The work was conducted by the US Council on Foreign Relations and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. It was funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2019-03-13",
    "transcript": "If you try to contact Indy Cube, a provider of workspaces in Wales, after 5pm you receive an automatic message that would make a good manifesto for the fast-growing four-day week movement. “We’ll get back to you pretty quickly during working hours,” it says. “If you’re messaging us outside of these, we’re probably busy with other things, like horse-riding, karate, or good ole-fashioned sleep.” The firm is one of a growing number of employers giving their workers an extra day off for the same pay as a five-day week. There is emerging evidence that it can boost productivity for bosses and happiness for workers. Playgrounds, garden centres and gymnasiums are filling up on Fridays with people extending their leisure into a five-day working week that has been a staple of western culture since Henry Ford adopted it in 1926. And it is not just small businesses that might be spotting a chance to save a little money by turning the lights off one day a week. A marketing company in Glasgow, Pursuit Marketing, that switched 120 people to four days in late 2016 claims it has been instrumental in a 30% increase in productivity. Perpetual Guardian, a New Zealand trust business that supervises nearly NZ$200bn in assets, has switched its 240 employees to a four-day week and has reported a 20% increase in productivity. A string of small businesses in the UK have contacted the Guardian to enthuse about higher productivity, greater staff satisfaction – and even bigger profits. Talk of family lives reinvigorated and stress levels plunging abounds. In January, the Wellcome Trust became the biggest UK employer to join the trend when it announced it was exploring switching 800 head-office staff to a three-day weekend. Labour is flirting with how the idea could fit into its policy programme: the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has commissioned a leading economist, Professor Robert Skidelsky, to investigate. And yet, for all the excitement that we may finally be moving towards John Maynard Keynes’ 1930 vision that by now we would all work a 15-hour week and spend the rest at leisure, most people who want to work less simply can’t. Since the financial crisis, people in the UK have in fact been working longer, not shorter, hours, as stagnating wages have seen us try to take on more work to keep up with inflation. In 2011, decades of falling hours went into reverse and Britons started working longer again. If the trend for falling hours had continued, we would be enjoying the equivalent of an extra week and a half’s free time each year by now. Automation and artificial intelligence, billed as drivers of greater leisure, have been harnessed by the barons of the gig economy to the opposite effect for some workers. Many of the 1.1 million self-employed people who access work through online platforms including Deliveroo and Uber, as well as white-collar apps such as Upwork, are squeezing in more and more tasks to keep their earnings in line with the cost of living. They face periods at work – say waiting for a taxi fare, or for parcels to be collated before delivery – with no pay at all. “The economic fundamentals are going against the grain of the politics of hours reductions,” said Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. “Our object should be to get them on track.” A growing number of people are trying to do just that. Pursuit Marketing is in the hip west Glasgow area of Finnieston, and is a typical part of Britain’s service-driven economy. Pursuit’s 120 workers staff a call centre and digital marketing operation selling services on behalf of computer companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Sage. Since 2011 they have worked a regular week – 8.45am to 5pm Monday to Thursday, and a shorter day on Friday, ending at 3.30pm. But in September 2016, management wanted to increase workers’ productivity. They had noticed that workers on reduced hours, to fit in school runs or look after family dependents, were making around 17% more sales than the full-timers. Director Lorraine Gray said: “The time off was valued, so they wanted to make sure they could keep it and they would attack their day. They were clear in their focus and there was less small talk by the water cooler.” The firm took the decision to cut everyone’s working week to Monday to Thursday, without changing pay. She said staff responded with “a lot of noise, a lot of excitement” as the new working week took hold. In the first four weeks, sales spiked by 37%. “People thought: if we can make this work, we can keep it,” said Gray. The increased productivity has since stabilised and turnover is up 29.5% after two years, the majority of which Gray attributes to the switch to a four-day week. Gray said clients also appear to like the four-day week, because staff with whom they have built relations are less likely to leave (just two left in the last 12 months). Recognising that water-cooler chats are still an important part of work, the firm offers free pre-shift breakfasts so workers can spend a little time gossiping before business begins. Jon Freeman, 33, a travelling salesman for the firm, said it has given him more energy while at work, he gets to look after his boys aged two and five every Friday, and his wife Clare is free to take on more hours in her work as a pharmacy dispenser. “I am more focused and driven because I appreciate the extra time off,” he said. “I used to really watch the clock at the weekend because I never felt like I had long enough off, but now when I come back on Monday I really attack it.” One of the biggest organisations to make the switch is Perpetual Guardian, whose shift has generated huge global interest, with 400 organisations from around the world asking it for advice. “This week we have had people contact us from Japan, Canada, the UK, France, Switzerland,” said its founder and chief executive, Andrew Barnes. “The week before it was Bulgaria.” The day off that each worker takes varies, depending on the team’s needs at the time, but there has been a change in culture with “less time surfing on social media, fewer unnecessary meetings”, said Barnes. Staff have taken to putting flags in pots on their desks as “do not disturb” signs. “This is an idea whose time has come,” said Barnes, a four-day week evangelist who says he has spotted “a chance to change the world”. “We need to get more companies to give it a go. They will be surprised at the improvement in their company, their staff and in their wider community.” He said it helps level the playing field between women and men, partly by making it easier for mothers returning to work because they don’t need to commit to five days, and by making men more available for domestic duties. Research into what we might do with more time has produced some bracing results. A 2010 study by US economic psychologists investigated how 909 women would schedule a 16-hour day to maximise wellbeing. Only 36 minutes were allocated for work, compared with 106 minutes for “intimate relations”, 82 minutes for socialising and 56 minutes for shopping. Maybe more “intimate relations” would be good for the economy. Britons work on average 1,514 hours each annually, a full four weeks more than in Germany, but are less productive. Germans and Americans produce GDP worth $60.50 and $64.10 respectively for every hour, compared with $53.50 in the UK. “Productivity relies not just on the sheer amount of hours put in, but on the wellbeing, fatigue levels and overall health of the worker,” reported Autonomy, a new consultancy and thinktank examining the shorter working week, in February. Productivity drops after the 35th hour of weekly work, according to a 2014 study for the Institute for Labour Economics. A study of call centres found that calls were handled less efficiently the longer people worked. When they work shorter hours, people tend to be more relaxed – and more productive. But Bell, a former Treasury adviser under Labour, is one of those sceptical that productivity gains would be enjoyed across the economy. “It is very hard to assert that overall output will rise if you cut 20% of your hours across the economy as a whole,” he said. The talk-radio host Nick Ferrari put it more bluntly recently saying it was “an insane notion”. Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry, which represents major employers, is unmoved by a four-day week. “At a time when flexible working is becoming more essential than ever, rigid approaches feel like a step in the wrong direction,” a spokesman said. “Businesses are clear that politicians should work with them to avoid policies that work as a soundbite but not a solution.” Labour’s Skidelsky review is certainly finding it complicated. Rachel Kay, a researcher on the project, said working fewer hours for the same money could work in task-focused sectors where employers don’t need people available all the time, but is less likely in, for example, retail – the UK’s biggest employer – where presenteeism is required. “A common complaint after France’s move to the 35-hour week was that companies intensified work to an unpleasant degree, making work more stressful,” she said. “So whether a shorter working week without new hires would result in improved wellbeing for employees depends on the existing workloads in any given workplace.” “If we all shut up shop on Thursday, what do we do on the weekend?” said Kate Cooper, policy director at the Institute of Leadership and Management. “Unless, like the Swedes, we go and commune in the woods, we need other people to be working. So who is the four-day week for? I am desperately trying to see how this isn’t going to be for the privileged few. [In] anything that is customer-facing or involving a dynamic or volatile environment, you don’t have the luxury.” The reasons behind increases in productivity are not yet clear. Cooper said that “the Hawthorne effect” may be in play; that is, people change their behaviour simply because they feel they are being observed – in this case they feel that by being granted a four-day week they feel their bosses are interested in their work. “How sustainable is that?” Cooper asked. “Where does the lovely feelgood factor come from if everybody is doing it?” And she had reservations about what might be lost by the removal of the fifth day of the working week. “What is being pushed out? What was happening on that fifth day? Were people forming strong social bonds? Were they getting a sense of the company culture? If work is just about getting a job done, a list of tasks, then the sense of purpose and social bonding that comes from employment might not be there.” • Robert Booth is the Guardian’s social affairs correspondent This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "A string of small British firms have switched their workers over to a four-day week, the Guardian can reveal, amid mounting political interest in the idea that working less could deliver higher productivity and better balance between life and work. A lingerie manufacturer, a lighting design firm and a landscape architect are among a wave of employers experimenting with giving staff three days off per week, for no less pay. The Wellcome Trust, the largest employer in Britain to so far consider a four-day week, is thinking about doing a trial for its 800 staff. Growing calls for a shorter working week are being opposed by the Confederation of British Industry on the basis that more flexibility, not less, is needed. But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has commissioned a study into its value from the economist Robert Skidelsky, and the Scottish National party is due to debate a motion next month calling for a review which could lead to the introduction of the four-day week in Scotland. In the last six months, companies switching to a four-day week include Synergy Vision, a 45-employee medical communications agency, Elektra Lighting, a lighting design company, Lara Intimates, which makes underwear, and the Intrepid Camera company, which makes and exports photographic equipment. “It has been a beautiful six weeks of having a long weekend,” said Neil Knowles, a design consultant at Elektra, which switched its 10 staff to a shorter week in January. “Two days out of seven is just enough to recover from a stressful week. Three is enough to recover and have extra time to do something else. It almost feels as if work is interrupting the weekend rather than the other way round.” Maxim Grew, at Intrepid in Brighton, said the switch has ended “Friday afternoon fatigue” and increased morale and energy levels among staff with a feeling that every hour counts, leading to productivity boosts. He said people have quickly adjusted to using the extra time off. “I am learning French, Rocco has joined a theatre group, Hugo is spending more time doing carpentry and Sam is building a robot,” he said. Vanessa Ross, the owner of Arc Landscape in Surrey, said her team had used the time to volunteer, look after dependent family members and teach. The idea of a four-day week has shot to prominence in recent months, for economic, social, health and technological reasons. Overwork results in thousands succumbing to stress or depression each year, according to the Health and Safety Executive; long working hours make parenting and family care ever trickier to juggle; technology, meanwhile, threatens to transform the demand for labour over coming decades. Despite this, Britons work more hours a week on average than they did in 2011 – and research shows two-thirds would like to reduce the amount of time they spend in the office. One of the biggest experiments so far into the effect of the four-day week was carried out at Perpetual Guardian, a finance company in New Zealand. It claims productivity has increased. Its chief executive, Andrew Barnes, said: “This is an idea whose time has come. We need to get more companies to give it a go. They will be surprised at the improvement in their company, their staff and in their wider community.” He said it helps level the playing field between women and men, partly by making it easier for mothers returning to work because they don’t need to commit to five days and by making men more available for domestic duties. Billy Jenkins, a middle manager at Synergy Vision, said: “It has caused a little tension in the household, as my partner works five days a week and seems to come up with a wishlist of errands or chores that need doing on my day off. It’s also hard to shake off the feeling that I should be working, and it has taken time to feel more comfortable using the time as my own.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "On a small cricket field in a dusty village in India’s east, groups of boys run between wickets, shouting at each other in the searing heat. When practice is over they put down their bats and fall silent as they listen to a very different form of instruction. “I saw a guy harassing a girl on the street yesterday,” one player says solemnly. “Have you seen this too? What did you do to stop it?” The boys share their experiences. When Manish Sharma, 20, told his teammates about the countless times he had witnessed domestic violence, he realised he was not alone. He says discussing the issue with his fellow players emboldened him to tell a relative to stop abusing his wife. “They gave me strength to intervene,” he says. From cricket in India to rugby in Fiji and Georgia, sport is being used as an entry point to teaching young men about gender equality and developing healthy notions of masculinity. Efforts to reduce violence usually focus on strengthening laws or teaching women self-defence. But experts say educating teenagers in the context of a pastime they love, at a time when their attitudes about gender are forming, can have a lasting impact. After practice, coaches and players discuss how values universal to all sports, such as integrity, fairness and respect, can be applied to personal relationships. In Fiji, where rugby is the most popular sport, coaches are mentoring children in a series of pilot projects supported by UN Women and Oceania Rugby. At 10 schools, male and female coaches mentor small groups of boys and girls aged 10 to 14 about sports values and gender equality. One goal is to encourage players to think critically rather than lecturing them about what is right or wrong. During one session, coaches ask players to consider whether power is positive or negative and what they can do in situations when people use their power over them in ways that feel uncomfortable. “Going in and saying ‘violence is bad’ doesn’t work,” says Farrah Kelly, a technical specialist at UN Women in Fiji. “The kids have to reflect and understand their own attitudes and beliefs and how to take action in their own lives rather than have all this negative messaging.” Coaches and teachers who participated in the first pilot, which ran from October to December last year, say the mentoring has resulted in less absenteeism, bullying and discipline problems among players. By most estimates, India’s eastern state of Bihar has the country’s highest rates of violence against women. Approximately 56% of married women have reported some form of violence or abuse. For the cricket project in Bihar, which was started in 2013 by Population Council and which operates through government-run youth clubs, cricketers and coaches were trained to mentor teenage boys about sports values and social issues such as avoiding substance abuse and ending dowry. Many of the players had witnessed or experienced violence as children, and the mentors were trained to be empathic. A baseline and endline study showed that boys who participated in the programme were more likely to change specific beliefs such as thinking a man was sometimes justified in beating his girlfriend. Like Manish, many say the project empowered them to intervene when they witnessed harassment. Kundan Kumar, 21, says it motivated him to tell a group of boys in his village to stop harassing a classmate. Amit Kumar (no relation to Kundan), 21, says he and his mentors urged his neighbours to let their daughter finish school. Many claim they now do more housework and have set goals for their lives. “They were taking this information home with them,” says KG Santhya, a Population Council researcher who led the study. Another aim of these projects is to show boys that sport doesn’t have to reinforce aggression and other stereotypes about men. In Georgia, famous rugby players have visited boys in schools to discuss masculinity and rugby values such as treating other players fairly, an idea they say should be applied to women and girls. The Georgian Rugby Union now makes it mandatory for licensed coaches to teach players about gender equality, and so far a few hundred coaches have mentored about 3,000 boys in schools across Georgia. Sport-based interventions are not without obstacles. In Bihar, some boys admit they were only interested in the project for the cricket coaching. Mentors also had to convince some families about the value of letting their sons participate. Another challenge is funding. While representatives from Bihar’s state government have expressed interest in running more projects like this, it requires technical assistance from organisations with the means to train mentors. In Fiji, UN Women is designing a manual for other organisations to use. The cricket coaching in Bihar has ended, but Kundan Kumar and his fellow players still get together at youth club. They’ve moved on to playing football. “The guys keep asking when the project will start up again,” Kundan said on a recent afternoon. “And I always tell them, just keep teaching more people about what you learned.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/gender-pay-gap-figures-50-percent-made-progress",
    "date": "2019-03-07",
    "transcript": "Half of companies who have filed figures so far have managed to narrow their gender pay gap in the first year of reporting, a Guardian analysis has found. Since 2017, it has been compulsory for companies with more than 250 employees to report their gender pay gap figures by the end of every financial year. The first round of data, submitted by the deadline last year, showed men were paid more than women in 7,795 out of 10,016 companies and public bodies in Britain, based on the median hourly pay. Only one in five companies expected to report have filed figures for this year. Of the 1,510 companies who have reported to date for both years, 756 (50%) improved their gender pay gap. A further 5% (72 companies) made no progress on closing the gap, 39% (592 companies) reported a worse gap than last year, and 6% (90 companies) reported a 0% gap for both years. The most recent figures refer to the 2017/2018 financial year, while the previous year’s data covers 2016/2017. Among the companies to have reported the biggest improvements so far is Monzo, the digital bank. Its pay gap improved by 34%, from 48% last year – meaning women earned 52p for every pound men earned – to 14% this year. This compares with 17.9%, the average median pay gap for both full and part-time workers, according to the ONS. However, its top quartile of earners was still heavily male-dominated. The company reported just 20% of its highest paid employees were women. Tara Mansfield, the head of people at Monzo, said that among the reasons for the change was that the team had more than trebled in the past year, some women had been recruited to senior positions and others had been promoted internally. “We have committed to making roles at Monzo as attractive as possible to all kinds of people so we can have a representative workforce,” she said. “Some of the initiatives we’ve launched have been flexible working, a generous caregiver scheme and mentorship opportunities.” Svitzer Marine Ltd, a ship towage company, reported a 30% improvement in its gender pay gap, from 45% last year to 15% this year. Kasper Friis Nilaus, the managing director of Svitzer Europe, said the maritime industry was traditionally dominated by men, but that the company’s improved pay equality figures reflected the promotion of “more talented women” to management jobs. While the gap has narrowed, the company’s workforce is predominantly male and 96% of Svitzer’s top quartile of earners are men. Montsaye Community Learning Partnership, an academy trust in Northamptonshire, also reported a large improvement, from 51% to 21%. They said that, while they would like to take credit for the improvement, the main reason was the significant increase in pay for local government employees – 9% in some cases – set by the Local Government Association. “As we are a group of schools, our gender balance is heavily weighted towards female staff, the majority of which are part-time. This high pay rise in the lowest grades predominantly occupied by female employees therefore narrowed the gap without any proactive action from the trust,” they said. Banks have reported some of the worst gaps in the figures so far. Credit Suisse International reported a median gap of 45%, while Credit Suisse UK reported a gap of 29%. Barclays Bank plc reported a median gap of 44%. Multi-academy trusts also account for a significant proportion of the highest gaps so far. Nexus Education Schools Trust, a MAT made up of 10 schools in south London, reported a median gap of 58%. Charles Cotton of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said it was too early to draw conclusions from the gender pay gap figures that had been reported so far. He said there were few quick fixes for closing the gap. “You’ve got to look at what’s driving the difference,” he said. “Some gaps can be closed by employer action, such as, for instance, flexible working arrangements, for those who have care commitments. “But some of the gaps can’t be closed so easily because of things that happen outside the workplace, like the availability of low-cost, high-quality childcare or elderly care, or societal assumptions about who should be looking after the children or the elderly.” Hephzi Pemberton, CEO of the Equality Group, said that one of the most effective ways to close the gap was to get women into the highest paid positions. “That’s where the chasm really occurs,” she said. “There are quite a lot of statements around about junior and graduate intakes at various organisations and that’s very good, but it’s not going to move the numbers as quickly as getting more women into senior and more economically powerful positions.” She said she expected this year’s gender pay figures to see a marginal improvement. “I think there’s a huge amount of work for a lot of organisations to do and it isn’t work that happens within a year,” said Pemberton. “It’s cultural change, but also just practical ability to change the make up of senior executive leadership and that can take whole careers to shift.”",

    "date": "2019-03-02",
    "transcript": "Sophie Howe is a public servant with a particularly tricky constituency. The people she represents are remote and unresponsive and they never show up to voice an opinion or tell her if she’s doing a good job. They don’t even vote. That’s because they haven’t yet been born. Howe is the world’s first – and only – future generations commissioner with statutory powers. She’s there to represent the unborn citizens of Wales. There is no shortage of issues to champion. So many of today’s crises – climate, insects, water, population growth – threaten calamity not for the people currently on the planet but for their descendants. The political trope about “our children and our children’s children” has never felt so urgent. Other countries have also toyed with novel governance mechanisms that allow for the voice of future generations to be heard, with Israel, Hungary and Canada notable examples. Yet none have gone as far as Wales to enshrine in law the principle that future generations deserve a fair hearing in present political debates. “We have put it in statute … which means we have to ask how to translate it into the decisions that are made every day throughout government,” said Howe, 41, a former deputy police and crime commissioner who has five children. In the job since its creation in 2016, her mandate – on paper at least – is clear: to ensure that political decisions taken today don’t compromise the interests of Welsh citizens tomorrow. As commissioner, it is Howe’s job to advise the Welsh government and the wider public sector of what their statutory obligations entail. Much of her initial period in office has been spent helping the country’s principal public bodies put together formal action plans for meeting their new responsibilities. But the job is not all about hand-holding. Howe has shown she can play tough too. In recent months, for instance, her attention has been focused on a proposed £1.1bn relief road around Newport. The project’s supporters maintain the investment will boost economic growth. Howe, in contrast, argues it will destroy local biodiversity and saddle Wales’s unborn with a huge debt. Mark Drakeford, the country’s first minister, is due to give his verdict imminently. “It was almost a done deal before my intervention, but now there are serious considerations as to whether it’s in the interests of future generations,” she said. Another major project has been Wales’s new-look planning policy, which makes a big play of the idea of holistic wellbeing – a key concept within the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act of 2015, which established her office. Howe’s formal powers are limited, however. The commissioner’s role is more that of watchdog than judge. She can force policymakers to justify their decisions, for example but she can’t prevent those decisions from being made. Yet the mere act of asking difficult questions makes a difference, she insists. “Just having an institution that is there challenging the status quo is making people sit up and take notice.” Such notice extends beyond Wales, too. Lord Bird, founder of The Big Issue magazine, is reportedly considering a private member’s bill calling for a similar commissioner role for the UK as a whole. Further afield the New Zealand government recently sent a delegation to Cardiff bay to learn more about the innovative Welsh model. Later this month, Howe will be in Dubai sharing her experience with global policymakers at the World Government Summit. To all who ask, her overarching message is the same: talk is welcome, but cheap; to genuinely protect our future generations, concrete actions are needed now. It is not a popular argument, she concedes. The needs of today are numerous and competition for government resources is fierce all over the world. And much as politicians acknowledge future generations, they also know that the unborn don’t vote. Howe’s response is characteristically direct. “There’s no point in having these lofty ambitions for future generations if we’re not prepared to take difficult decisions,” she said. She isn’t naive. Wales still has a long way to go to fulfil the aspirations of its landmark legislation, she admits. Some policymakers struggle to conceptualise how to account for future needs in the present, while an old-school minority simply reject the whole idea. It is this battle to win the hearts and mind of those at all ranks of the policymaking process that Howe considers her biggest challenge. To aid this struggle, her office is advancing a new approach to policymaking. Instead of top-down managerialism, government decisions need to be guided by principles such as public involvement, preventative action and cross-government collaboration. “For me, this is the biggest cultural change programme that Wales has ever seen,” she said. “We need to really invest in how we go about changing that culture [so] people will start thinking more about the long term.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "They call them plyscrapers: the sudden emergence of tall buildings constructed almost entirely from timber. Vancouver, Vienna and Brumunddal in Norway have all claimed recently to have the tallest wooden building in the world, and now Tokyo has its own designs on the informal title. Making buildings from wood may seem like a rather medieval idea. But there is a very modern issue that is driving cities and architects to turn to treated timber as a resource: climate change. Concrete is the second most used substance in the global economy, after water – and one of the world’s biggest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The chemical process by which cement, the key ingredient of concrete, is created involves large quantities of carbon dioxide. The UN estimates that there will be 9.8 billion people living on the planet by mid-century. They will need somewhere to live. If concrete is the only answer to the construction of new cities, then carbon emissions will soar, aggravating global warming. And so scientists and builders have started innovating with other materials, in a scramble for alternatives to a universal commodity that has underpinned our modern life for centuries. Aggregate results The problem with replacing concrete is that it is so very good at what it does. Chris Cheeseman, professor of materials resources engineering at Imperial College London, says the key thing to consider is the vast extent to which concrete is used around the world, and is likely to continue to be used. “Concrete is not a high-carbon product. Cement is high-carbon, but concrete is not. But it is the scale on which it is used that makes it high carbon. The sheer scale of manufacture is so huge, that is the issue.” Not only are the raw materials for concrete available cheaply and in abundance in most places around the globe, but the stuff itself has marvellous properties: Portland cement, the vital component of concrete, is mouldable and pourable, but quickly sets hard. Cheeseman also notes another advantage: concrete and steel have similar thermal expansion properties, so steel can be used to reinforce concrete, making it far stronger and more flexible as a building material than it could be on its own. The steel used can be recycled, reducing its carbon impact, but Cheeseman says the combination of steel and concrete – giving enormous strength to buildings, while being mouldable and widely available – is hard to beat. “It is amazing stuff. Making anything with similar properties is going to be very difficult.” Using wood, for example, is not straightforward. Wood absorbs moisture from the air and is susceptible to rot and pests, not to mention fire. But treating wood and combining it with other materials can improve its properties. Cross-laminated timber is engineered wood, made from gluing layers of solid-sawn timber together, crosswise, to form building blocks. This material is lightweight but as strong as concrete and steel, and construction experts say it can be more versatile and faster to work with than concrete and steel – and even, it seems, quieter. Stora Enso is Europe’s biggest supplier of cross-laminated timber, and Markus Mannström, the executive vice-president for biomaterials, reports that the company is seeing increasing demand globally for building in wood, with climate change concerns the key driver. The Nordic countries, where Stora Enso is based, with their large forest resources, have been leading the way, but the company is seeing increasing demand across the world, including in Asia. It plants two or three trees for every tree used, which has contributed to Sweden doubling its rate of forest cover in the past century. Of course, using timber in a building also locks away the carbon that it has absorbed as it grew. Even treated wood, however, has limitations. In Norway, the Mjøstårnet building is planned to be the tallest in the world with a wooden frame. It will rise 88 metres tall, with 18 storeys, and will be used for offices, hotel rooms and apartments. Mjøstårnet may not hold its crown for long, if construction goes ahead on a project in Japan, the W350: that will reach 70 storeys, and be made of 90% wood. But it is still in the early stages of planning. Only when these concepts have been proven in practice will it be possible to see wood as a widespread alternative to concrete in constructing tall buildings. Concrete examples Fly ash is a possible alternative. It is a byproduct of coal-burning power plants – cinders, the unburnt parts of the coal that used to be allowed to disperse into the air, or fall to the bottom of power station chimneys, but in modern power plants are collected instead. It can be incorporated into concrete mixes to make up as much as 15% to 30% of the cement, without harming the strength or durability of the resulting mix. A byproduct of the iron-ore processing industry, ground granulated blast-furnace slag, can also be of use in a similar way. This is incorporated into concrete mixes, and has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But Anna Surgenor, senior sustainability adviser at the UK’s Green Building Council, which is currently engaged in educating its construction industry members on the availability of cement replacements, notes that although these waste products can save carbon in the concrete mix, their use is not always straightforward. “It is possible to replace the cement content in concrete with waste products – a built asset could also use alternative materials [such as timber] in construction to lower the overall carbon impact. But there are several calculations that need to be considered across the entire life cycle of the building – these include factoring in where these materials are being shipped from. If they are transported over long distances, using fossil fuels, the use of alternative materials might not make sense from an overall carbon reduction perspective.” Fly ash from coal and slag from iron ore are abundant in some of the areas where concrete is most needed, including rapidly developing countries such as China and India. But they are heavy and that means it is not only carbon-intensive to transport over long distances, but also expensive. Other mooted materials have pros and cons. Magnesium silicates are not as widely available as the building blocks of concrete, for instance, limiting their appeal. Calcite clays show promise, according to Cheeseman, but will reduce concrete emissions only by about a third – worth doing, but not a comprehensive solution. Carrots and sticks Research at Lancaster University has found that adding vegetable particles – yes, carrots or sugar beet – can strengthen concrete while reducing the volume of cement required. Similar work is being conducted with bamboo and other fibres. Graphene, a wonder material invented in the UK early this century, is also coming into play. Experts at the University of Exeter have used graphene in concrete construction to create a new composite material that is twice as strong as traditional concrete and four times more water-resistant. Monica Craciun, professor of nanoscience in the university’s engineering department, called the new material “an absolute game-changer”, and work is continuing on how to develop it further. Commercial introduction is still some way off. While these technologies are all promising ideas, they are either expensive, unproven or based on materials that are not abundant. Thinktank the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House produced an overview last year of innovation in the industry, which reached the gloomy conclusion: “Some novel cements have been discussed for more than a decade within the research community, without breaking through. At present, these alternatives are rarely as cost-effective as conventional cement, and they face raw-material shortages and resistance from customers.” Given the slow take-up of alternatives to concrete and their limitations, attention has turned to solutions such as capturing and storing, or even using, the carbon dioxide that results from its production. CarbonCure, a Canadian company, recycles carbon dioxide in its products. Liquefied carbon dioxide is captured from industrial processes and injected into concrete while it is being made, which helps with the process of cement incorporation. The company has so far reduced carbon emissions through its products roughly equivalent to taking about 5,000 cars off the road. But carbon-capture technology remains very expensive and only a handful of projects have been trying to innovate in this way to reduce the emissions from cement. • Fiona Harvey is an environment correspondent for the Guardian This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Berivan runs over to join in the dancing, her traditional gold dress catching the winter sunlight. The 15-year-old Yazidi clasps hands with her best friend and stands among the line of women stamping their feet to a Kurdish pop song. Berivan and her mother are from Sinjar in Iraq, the Yazidi homeland, but like thousands of other Yazidis they were kidnapped by Islamic State in 2014 when the group stormed across the border from Syria. Far from here, in the eastern desert, Isis has almost lost control of its last stronghold, Baghuz, but there are at least 3,000 Yazidi women and girls whose fate is unknown. During the genocide, Yazidi men were rounded up and shot then dumped in mass graves. The women were taken to be sold in Isis’s slave markets, many passed from fighter to fighter, who inflicted physical and sexual abuse. Yazidi children have been brainwashed and rights groups say suicide among captives is common. Even for those who manage to escape after years of enslavement and rape, many struggle to survive without an income or identity papers. Berivan and her mother have lost the other members of their family. But at a new women’s commune near Qamishli, in north-eastern Syria, they have had a chance to start over. “I like it here,” she says. “I love going to school, I love mathematics. And I’m going to be a hairdresser when I grow up.” Jinwar is a female-only community, set up by the women of the local Kurdish-run administration to create a space where women can live “free of the constraints of the oppressive power structures of patriarchy and capitalism”. It opened in November and 12 of its 30 adobe brick houses are home to Kurdish, Yazidi and Arab families. The women built their own houses, bake their own bread and tend to the livestock and farmland, cooking and eating together. On Saturday, people from the neighbouring villages have been invited to a graduation celebration for a group of local women who had attended a course on natural medicines at Jinwar’s education centre. Over chicken and rice, and later music and dancing, residents discuss how the newly planted apricot, pomegranate and olive trees are doing. “We built this place ourselves, brick by brick,” says 35-year-old Barwa Darwish, who came to Jinwar with her seven children after her village in Deir Ezzor province was freed from Isis and her husband, who joined the fight against the group, was killed in action. “Under Isis we were strangled and now we are free. But even before that, women stayed at home. We didn’t go out and work. In Jinwar, I’ve seen that women can stand alone.” Jinwar grew out of the democratic ideology that has fuelled the creation of Rojava, a Kurdish-run statelet in north-eastern Syria, since the civil war broke out in 2011. The area has largely thrived despite the presence of enemies on all sides: Isis, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s troops, and Turkey, which regards the Kurdish YPG fighters as a terrorist organisation. The women’s revolution, as it is known, is a significant part of Rojava’s philosophy. Angered by the atrocities committed by Isis, Kurdish women formed their own fighting units. Later, Arab and Yazidi recruits joined them on the front lines to liberate their sisters. But at home, many parts of Kurdish society are still deeply conservative. Some of the women now in Jinwar have left arranged marriages and domestic abuse. Those dynamics, as well as the legacy of Syria’s brutal eight-year war have to be unlearned at Jinwar. “When the families first arrived, the Arab children wouldn’t play with the Kurdish children,” says Nujin, one of the international volunteers working at the village. “But even in just two months you can see the change. The children are already so much happier.” Berivan’s mother, Darsim, was mute when she arrived at Jinwar, a side-effect of trauma. Little by little, she has started to form words again. “The village is the best rehabilitation for the things these families have suffered,” Nujin says. Jinwar is not finished yet: there are gardens to plant and an empty library waiting for books. The community is still coming up with ideas. Behind the education centre there is a swimming pool that will be filled with water in the summer. Most of the residents will get to use a pool – the reserve of only men in most of the Middle East – for the first time. The women have also voted for driving lessons and to start a sewing business. There are plans for a second commune in Deir Ezzor, an Arab province that is still the scene of fierce fighting to destroy Isis – but there is also a sense that what has been built at Jinwar is fragile and could be taken away. It is not clear what will happen when US troops leave the area in a few months. Renewed fighting is a possibility. “This place is peaceful and a refuge from the war,” Nujin says. “So how can we bring guns here if we needed to defend ourselves? I hope Jinwar never has to face that.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "The wooden blinds that lie crumpled in Peter Gasson’s laboratory in Kew Gardens are chipped and forlorn-looking. Their manufacturers had claimed they were made of pine but customs officers were wary. And their suspicions were well-founded. Gasson, Kew’s research leader on wood and timber, found the blinds were not made of pine but ramin. “All ramin trees, which grow in south-east Asia, are endangered and trade in their wood is illegal,” said Gasson. “On this occasion, we got lucky and stopped people profiting from this trade.” But elsewhere, illegal logging threatens to overwhelm the timber trade. It is estimated that almost 30% of sales are made up of illicitly sourced timber. More than 20,000 square miles of forest are being chopped down illegally every year, according to WWF, the wildlife charity, to provide furniture and flooring for people’s homes. The devastation is jeopardising the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide and is destroying the habitats of endangered animals including orangutans and tigers. As a result, researchers at Kew have joined conservationists, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), to set up the Global Timber Referencing Project to create a scheme to identify important forests and create a database for identifying timber sources. “A lot is being done to reduce illegal logging by setting up audit systems to certify timber supply chains,” said Roger Young of AgroIsoLab, another project partner. “But these efforts are compromised because paperwork systems are fallible, and until now there has been no way to verify the origin and species of timber once it has been harvested. The new project aims to put that right.” The project has two arms. First, scientists working at Kew will confirm the exact species of tree from samples sent to it, said Gasson. “The laboratory already has many thousands of timber samples in its vaults but these will be increased with new samples for the new identification project,” he added. Once this has been established, other reference collections will be set up in other countries. For example, Kew will receive more than 200 new samples, collected by the FSC, from commonly traded wood species in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Peru this year. The aim is to create a massive tree reference library at Kew, whose samples and expertise can then be distributed to other laboratories. “This is a unique opportunity to develop a library of geo-referenced wood samples,” said Michael Marus of the FSC. Being able to spot the species of tree is not sufficient to curtail illegal logging, however. The location of that wood’s growth is also crucial. “All ramin trade is illegal, so identifying the material in imported goods is sufficient to have them impounded, but other woods are more complex,” Young said. “It is different with teak. Trade from Thailand is allowed but the same wood from Myanmar is illegal. So we need to be able to spot where a sample of teak was grown.” AgroIsoLab scientists will use patterns of isotopes of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon that are found in wood to pinpoint their exact places of growth. “Soil in an area produces a specific isotopic signature that we can recognise,” he told the Observer. “We already use this technology to pinpoint sources of food, such as bacon. We can tell from a rasher’s isotopic signature whether it comes from Britain or from Denmark. “And that is important. Bacon from Denmark is cheaper because standards of pig care there are lower and so we can spot when cheap Danish bacon is being sold as the expensive UK variety.” The new project aims to do exactly the same for wood. “We want to be able to take a sample – oak from furniture, beech from flooring or pine from a table – and provide its true identity and place of growth,” said Young. “If we can do that, we have a chance to halt illegal timber sales.”",

    "transcript": "It’s a very singular irony that in a world populated like never before, loneliness has become the disease du jour. But you are not alone, if you don’t want to be. No matter who you are and where you are, there is a like-minded soul out there, a sympathetic voice, a support group, a project, a fellowship. That’s what young people in England found when it turned out medical interventions for mental illness in their region were inadequate. They formed a support group and helped each other. It’s also what struggling students from deprived communities have learned, thanks to an initiative that pairs them with successful professionals for a extra tuition. In a sense, the “you are not alone” message was also delivered live on television to the LGBTQ community by an international sports star, a bold act of principle that did more for his sport than any athletic prowess could. Loneliness has become such a big deal in the UK that Britain has rolled out a strategy to tackle it and appointed a dedicated minister. US researchers are even working on a pill for loneliness – though the Upside agrees with this article, which argues that solutions should probably be more sociological than pharmacological. And finally, after all that, if it’s really solitude you crave, it’s yours – for £1.1m. What we liked The fieriness of young people around the world, from Amsterdam’s new nine-year-old “cycle mayor” to the teenagers striking for climate action and the Silicon Valley students becoming increasingly sceptical of the ethics of big tech. Also, this BBC story about how Sweden benefits from rules that allow people to take a six-month leave of absence to do something entrepreneurial, academic or care-related. What we heard Digital technology could be a good reminder for the political class that they are at the service of the people and not the other way round. In a week, one would get a very good idea of whether the country wants to go to war with Iraq for example, and more questions would be asked before taking decisions that have heavy consequences.

    "transcript": "A petition in Bavaria on preserving species diversity, popularly known as the “save the bees” campaign, has garnered sufficient support to enforce significant changes to the state’s farming practices. The organisers reached their target of securing the signatures of 10% of eligible voters in the southern German state well before the Wednesday evening deadline. Environmental groups behind the push to radically change farming methods, including turning more grassland into meadow and ensuring a third of farms are organic over the next decade, are due to meet politicians to discuss the next stage in their drive. As part of the campaign, thousands of people have rallied in the streets dressed in bee costumes, as well as staging a mass buzz-in in an attempt to produce the loudest ever buzz in the world. The carnivalesque mood has helped secure popular support for the serious aims of the campaign to secure a long-term political commitment to safeguard the diversity of flora and fauna and improve the habitats of insects and birds, whose populations have plummeted in recent years. Among the demands are for 20% of land to be made bee-friendly within the next six years, and 30% by 2030. Environmental education in schools and businesses should also be increased. The fact that more than 1 million people had signed the petition by Wednesday evening means politicians will ignore its demands at their peril. The campaign was backed by the Greens, the Bavarian Ecological Democratic Party (ÖDP) and conservation groups. Ludwig Hartmann of the Greens said the more people signed the petition, the clearer the message was to Bavaria’s Christian Social Union government under the leadership of Markus Söder. “It’s time to turn the tide and set a new course for effective nature conservation in Bavaria,” he said. Some farmers have criticised the campaign, however, saying their efforts to embrace environmentally-friendly policies while the financial pressures on them increase have often been ignored. “We are already doing a lot, but often this is dismissed,” said Walter Heidl, the president of the Bavarian Farmers’ Association. The campaign also demands that farmers rescue hedges and trees and preserve habitat on stream and river banks. The state legislature is now obliged by law either to enact the petition or to propose alternative options. Negotiations must begin between its organisers and the CSU next week, and voters will have the final say on their outcome in a referendum later this year. Agnes Becker, the leader of the ÖDP, a very small force which initiated the poll, said that the bee was the symbol but represented a much bigger issue. “It’s not so much about the honey bee as it is about a very long and ever growing list of threatened species of animals and plants,” she told a heated televised debate on the campaign last week. “But the bee is our mascot, our symbol.” She said she and her colleagues would stick to the demands laid out in the petition, which had been compiled after extensive consultation with scientists and lawyers, calling them the minimum required to reverse the damaging effects of intensive farming and global warming. Recent German studies into species decline showed that the number of flying insects had dropped by almost 80% in nearly 30 years. More than 15% of songbirds were lost in the 10 years to 2009. Similar declines have been witnessed elsewhere in Europe and the world. The campaigners said ordinary citizens were also being called on to change their lifestyles, including by not covering garden lawns with wood and concrete.

    "date": "2019-02-13",
    "transcript": "It was the biggest decision in the party’s young life, a turning point that will define its reputation for years to come. But when Italy’s Five Star Movement (M5S) had to resolve whether or not to join the far-right Lega, or League, in a coalition government last May, it didn’t retreat into a conclave of party leaders. It asked members to vote online. An overwhelming 94% supported the move. The process was perhaps the most striking example of an emerging trend at the heart of 21st-century politics – the use of digital technology to bring people into the hearts of movements from Italy and Spain to France, Scandinavia to the UK. The digital world has taken a great deal of criticism for subverting open societies, but could it also be a motor for a democratic revival? Could these digital innovations – mostly confined to new, populist parties – help revitalise our liberal democracies? The pioneers of digital democracies were the pirate parties of northern Europe who first broke through in Sweden, Germany and Iceland about a decade ago, using an online decision-making platform called LiquidFeedback. One of its founders, Andreas Nitsche, said the idea was that “empowering the ordinary members would make these parties more responsive to the demands of society”. More recently, the fiercely anti-establishment M5S and the Spanish leftwing populist party Podemos have led the way. “Ordinary citizens will become protagonists, abandoning the current system of delegate democracy in the hands of politicians,” said the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, who masterminded the M5S digital strategy. Given the discredited status of Italy’s political class, this narrative appealed to many citizens. M5S made digital democracy its core creed, with its anthem proclaiming: “We are not a party, we are not a caste, one man, one vote, one man, one vote.” A variety of new parties have followed suit, to the point where digital democracy has now become a must for all new political movements that want to be seen as in sync with the times. The central innovation is the “participatory platform”. This is an online portal, often part of the official party website, that hosts a number of interactive features. These might include donations, training sessions, discussions on policy and online ballots for primaries, elections of party officers, or strategic decisions, for instance whether to enter an alliance or the position to take on a specific policy. The M5S platform is named Rousseau, after the Genevan political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Casaleggio liked to describe it as the “collective intelligence of the movement”. Podemos has a participation portal named Participa (“participate”). It comprises a voting area and a discussion system named Plaza Podemos (Podemos Square) that is similar to Reddit, with threaded discussions and upvote/downvote functionalities, which earned it the moniker of “Reddit party”. These sites closely mimic the logic of social media platforms, with discussions, votes, likes and other metrics to assess users’ views. For Miguel Ardanuy, a former participation coordinator of Podemos, the ultimate aim of this “platformisation of the party” is to “construct a different model of party, a party more open and responsive to society, where you do not need a membership card in order to participate”. “We live in an era of disintermediation, where we are bypassing the old middlemen, such as travel agencies,” said Roberto Fico, a M5S politician and the current president of the Italian parliament’s lower chamber, the Chamber of Deputies. “Digital democracy embodies the same tendency applied to politics, allowing people to have a say directly on important decisions without depending on their representatives.” The strategy has proven highly successful, enabling parties short of economic resources to achieve huge reach and scale. M5S is in government in Italy. Podemos rapidly surged to become Spain’s third largest political force, and underpins the present administration. There are few historical precedents of new political parties achieving comparable results in such a short time. This electoral prowess largely derives from an ability to recruit a large base of members. Podemos and the leftist French group La France Insoumise (France Defiant) boasted more than 500,000 members each at the start of 2019, putting them in Europe’s political major league. (M5S has fewer – about 150,000; some blame a cumbersome registration process for this.) Opting for a free membership system, similar to the free sign-up model of digital companies such as Facebook, Google or Twitter, has radically lowered the barrier to entry compared with traditional parties. “We built an open and flexible structure eliding the traditional separation between members and sympathisers,” said Guillaume Royer, who led the development of La France Insoumise’s own platform. The platforms enable parties to solicit ideas from members which can be evaluated by experts before being submitted to a wider online vote. M5S, Podemos and La France Insoumise have all crowdsourced ideas this way for their election manifestos. Yet in practice, most of the online voting tends to relate to the election of officials, or yes/no internal referendums. E-ballots have often been used more as a means of propaganda, to demonstrate the cohesion of party members, rather than as an opportunity for a genuine and pluralist internal debate. Online consultations have often returned highly anticipated super-majority results, with in some cases more than 80% of voters supporting the winning option that was almost invariably the option favoured by the party leadership. Out of more than 40 referendums carried out by M5S, there have been just two instances in which members have gone against the leadership’s will. Of the dozen online referendums held by Podemos since 2014, there has been not a single case of rank-and-file rebellion. For instance, when Podemos’s leader, Pablo Iglesias, was nominated as party candidate for prime minister in the next elections, he secured 90% of the votes. There was no competition. But barely one in 10 members took part in the ballot. According to M5S activist Davide Bono, this tendency towards unanimity stems from the fact that “activists share a strong collective identity and agree on many common points”. However, landslide results also hint at the strong control exercised by the party leadership over internal decision-making. There are a number of ways in which the leadership can influence internal consultations. The staff responsible for the management of digital platforms are often directly dependent on the party leadership, and therefore liable to pressure. Furthermore, apparently trivial things, such as the formulation of questions, the timing of votes or even the order of options on the ballot, can steer voters towards the preferred option. Finally, the leadership can create a mood conducive to its own will. David Puente, a former employee of Casaleggio, recounts how, in anticipation of important decisions, the employees and the all-important blog of party co-founder Beppe Grillo would adopt a certain line with the aim of influencing the decision. “It was enough for Grillo to say A, and the members would vote A.” Far from being the protagonists, party members are more akin to non-player characters, or NPCs, to use a term often used in digital subcultures. They are agents who can only respond to the stimuli coming from above, with little room for proactive intervention. “It’s a wasted opportunity,” said Yago Bermejo Abati, the project coordinator of Media Lab Prado in Madrid, who was originally involved in designing Podemos’s participation portal. “Given all the initial hope, this is a great disappointment.” Party members themselves seem to have become wary of digital democracy’s limits, as seen in the falling number of participants in the online consultations of Podemos and M5S. These failings may merely be teething problems of a new tendency that seems here to stay. A number of mainstream political parties have already integrated digital democracy functions. In the UK, the Labour party allowed members to vote online in the 2016 leadership election, and the leftwing, pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum has created its own participatory platform called MyMomentum. In Spain, the ruling socialist party, PSOE, used online voting in 2016, allowing members to express their opinion on a coalition government proposal. Local mayoralties in cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Reykjavik are carrying out online consultations and, since entering government, M5S has created a “ministry of direct democracy”. We may be only just starting to understand how digital democracy can help address the crisis of legitimacy that is affecting different levels of the political process.

    "date": "2019-02-13",
    "transcript": "It might be the first waste incinerator the neighbours actually want next door. The shop at the foot of the Amager Bakke waste-to-energy project in Copenhagen is packed with families desperate to be among the first to try its unique selling point: the ski slope on the roof. “I live so close by that I could follow the development,” says Ole Fredslund, who lives in neighbouring Amager, as he helped his sons Felix and Victor strap on their boots as the slope opened its lifts for the first time on Tuesday. “I guess 90% of the focus is on the fact that there’s a skiing hill coming, so in a way it’s very clever. Everybody talks about the ski hill to be, not the waste plant to be.” Ten minutes and three magic carpet lifts later, we are standing next to three short fir trees at the top of a blue run, an artificial slope consisting of green and turquoise bristles. Through the smoke from the next door Amagerværket power plant, Sweden is visible across the straits and to the other side a wide span of central Copenhagen. The idea of topping a municipal plant with an urban ski resort won a string of accolades for the Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) before the first shovel was even lifted. Time Magazine judged it one of the most innovative 50 ideas of 2011. Two years ago the architectural model went on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The building is wrapped in a facade of aluminium planters which will later drip with greenery. In the original plan, the chimney was to blow smoke rings, one for every tonne of CO2 generated. But turning BIG’s inspired architectural sketches into reality has been challenging, says Patrick Gustafsson, the project manager who was hired “to prove it is actually a sound idea and not just a fantastic idea”. “No one has ever done this before, and that’s maybe for a reason, I sometimes think,” he laughs. Above the carpet lifts, workers in fluorescent orange jackets are still finishing the landscaping on the steeper black and red runs and on the button lift that will serve them. “The roof is very steep, actually too steep for a ski slope. It has an incline of 45%,” Gustafsson explains. “You can’t just shovel earth up there, you need to find a way of anchoring it, and then you also have to anchor a ski surface, plants, trees. It starts to get complicated.” The ski resort alone has ended up costing 92m Danish kroner (£8m). The first day of skiing is more than a year late and it is only a two-day preview, with the slope now scheduled to be finished by May. The smoke ring mechanism has been put on hold, in part because Peter Madsen, the artist who helped design it, was sentenced to life in prison for murder. Christian Engels, the chief executive of Copenhill, as the ski facility is called, says he aims to provide a condensed version of a holiday in the Alps: “The full package, skiing, apres ski, everything, boiled down into a three- or four-hour experience.” People living in the enormous apartment complex 150 metres away were given advance notice of the two-day opening, so they had a chance to snap up the half-price tickets. But others have come from further afield. Behind me on the magic carpet lift is Ricardo Karam, a Brazilian who lectures at the University of Copenhagen. “You need to get used to it,” he says of the dry slope. “But after a couple of runs, it’s really fun and I can imagine that once the whole thing is finished, it will be even better.” A keen snowboarder, Karam has been looking forward to the centre opening since he arrived in the city five years ago. “The idea, it’s fantastic. I’ve been looking at this building and just waiting for years.” Once I round the slope’s first and only corner, I accelerate towards a small ridge, only to discover that it is covered in black silicon paste that stops my skis dead and catapults me hands first on to the lacerating bristles. “It’s like glue,” says Karam as he helps me up. “It’s supposed to help you slide better. When I saw you I thought: oh no, it’s already too late.” At the bottom, Fredslund and his sons seem excited but also slightly disappointed. “It’s fun, a little bit short of course,” he says. “But we are already improving after just three runs.”",

    "transcript": "“I used to think boys were just better at maths,” said Linah. “But now, it’s like, we go to the same school, we do the same subjects – so if you can do it, I can do it.” There’s a reason for the renewed confidence in the 15-year-old from Dagenham and it’s sitting next to her in a swanky office in the City of London. Elaine McLoughlin is a business control manager for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. She is also a volunteer tutor on a programme to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds and get more girls studying sciences at top universities. “[Maths] used to be one of my favourite subjects but over the years I’ve gone into autopilot,” said Linah, who lives with her two sisters, her mum, who works as a carer and her dad, who is between jobs. “I would freak out if I didn’t understand a topic in class but now I know we can go over it here.” Since last year, her predicted GCSE maths grade at Lister community school in Newham has jumped from a 4 (the equivalent of a C), to a 7 (equivalent to an A). “Practice makes perfect so it’s going back and looking back at those topics that she’s no longer studying in class,” said McLoughlin. In many ways, Linah is archetypal of her age group: she counts editing Instagram photos for friends among her hobbies and is relieved at getting to skip an extra physics class in order to be interviewed on a Friday evening. She has hopes, though, to attend one of the top-tier UK universities to study forensic psychology. Visiting McLoughlin’s office each week is a source of inspiration. Linah said: “I thought it was going to be really intimidating but you walk in and feel like you’re a different person. You see people who have their lives together and you’re like: ‘I’m so gonna be like that guy’, even if you don’t know what their job is.” Although the divide is steadily shrinking, there is still a gender gap within Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. Women make up 14.4% of people working in Stem professions in the UK, which falls far short of the country’s goal of 30%. On top of this, Britain’s booming private tuition sector, worth an estimated £2bn, is making the playing field even less level for disadvantaged children. Last July, an annual survey by The Sutton Trust revealed that 27% of secondary students in England and Wales have had home or private tuition. The figure rises to 41% in London. The Access Project, founded by teacher Alex Kelly in 2008, works to address this inequality in 28 schools. It has more than 1,000 tutors supporting 1,250 students across London and the Midlands. To Mcloughlin, who graduated with a maths and economics degree from University College Dublin and revises Linah’s topics over the weekend and offers her ad-hoc career guidance, diversifying the workforce is about more than equality. “Having more women on board and more diverse teams leads to more successful output,” she said, adding that her boss is a working mum who has “turned a lot of things around”. There is a stigma attached to Stem for women, according to Karishma Honap, 23, an assistant engineer at WSP and Access Project tutor in Birmingham. In the engineering sector, fewer than 9% of professionals are women. “When I applied to do engineering everyone was sort of like: ‘Oh, don’t guys do that? That’s rare for a girl,’” she said. But, according to her student, Melissa, a year 10 pupil at Wood Green Academy in Wednesbury, in the West Midlands, mindsets are already shifting. The 15-year-old says there’s a 50-50 split between boys and girls in her triple science class, despite the fact that the percentage of female A-level physics students has stagnated at about 21% for the past decade. Although she’s always enjoyed science at school, since starting physics mentoring with Honap in October, Melissa’s confidence has blossomed. “I know if I was falling back a bit, I’ve got someone who will support me and understand what I’m facing,” she said. Melissa, who lives in Wednesbury with her mum, a retail assistant, her younger brother and stepdad, wants to study at Oxford University. She will visit the campus with the charity next week. There’s still a way to go, including finishing her GCSEs and starting A-levels before she can apply but in some ways it feels like doors are already being opened to spaces she isn’t accustomed to. When she visits Honap at the Mailbox, an upmarket shopping and office development in Birmingham’s city centre, which she hasn’t visited since she was eight, she feels welcomed. “I was nervous to begin with but now I find it cool how the receptionist knows my name, knows who to contact and just tells me to carry on up to the office,” she added.

    "transcript": "Pity the poor tech billionaires. It’s a solid industry if you want to make obscene profits (Google racked up more than $1,000 a second in the last three months of 2018), but these days it’s a poor way to make friends. Big Tech has become as unpopular as a Brexiter in Brussels, as multiple issues pile up – from data privacy to fake news, election meddling and obnoxious content. But technology is still a formidable force for good, as Upside reporters pointed out this week. Example one: Senay Boztas, in Amsterdam, reported on how European police are using technology and the wisdom of crowds to identify potential crime scenes from images retrieved from the darkest corners of the web. More than 20,000 tipoffs have resulted. Example two: Kamala Thiagarajan wrote about how computers are now able to diagnose a serious eye condition because an algorithm has analysed thousands of previous cases and can recognise symptoms from images. And finally, a sliver of good news from Big Tech itself, as two companies took action to clean up toxic content on their platforms. WhatsApp said it was deleting 2m accounts each month to stop fake news spreading. Instagram said it would move to ban graphic self-harm content amid a furore in Britain over whether such images are exacerbating the distress of young people. Instagram’s Adam Mosseri said: “We are not where we need to be on self-harm and suicide, and we need to do more to protect the most vulnerable. We will get better and we are committed to finding and removing this content at scale.” It remains to be seen how this will be done. Every silver lining has a cloud. What we liked A lovely piece from the Boston Globe: when a Massachusetts family gave birth to a deaf child, the neighbours learned sign language so they could communicate with her. Also, this BBC World Hacks item about a Swedish mall where everything is a recycled product. Great to hear also that we have fellow travellers in Hull.

    "date": "2019-02-08",
    "transcript": "Dr Ramasamy Kim is looking at the inside of an eyeball. There is nothing particularly surprising about that: he is head of retina services at an eye hospital in southern India. The image on his computer screen shows the first blush of a condition linked to diabetes that affects millions of Indians – and can lead to blindness. The diagnosis was made not by him, or any other doctor, but by an algorithm. Over the past five years, Kim and his team at the Aravind eye hospital in Madurai have examined about 15,000 images from across the country showing the interior surface of the eyeball, known as the fundus. By grading each image, marking abnormal spots, lesions and indications of bleeding, they have contributed to a database of retinal images from all over the world, compiled by Google and its health tech subsidiary, Verily. The data has been assembled into an algorithm – a set of instructions built into a computer program to identify eye complications arising from diabetes. Kim is now checking to see whether the diagnosis the program has made is accurate. It is. He points to several yellow spots that look like pin-pricks of light emerging from the reddish-brown orb. Over time, when severe diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels of the retina, he says, it causes them to leak blood and cholesterol. In many cases, the patient does not even realise this is happening. There are no symptoms until retinal tissue begins to swell, vision becomes cloudy and eyesight begins to fail. At this point, it is difficult to treat and in some cases, irreversible. And today, Kim says, it is remarkable that a machine can be trained to identify even the earliest stages of the diabetic retinopathy and grade it with as much accuracy as a human doctor. “It’s been very exciting to watch this take shape,” says Dr Renu Rajan, a retinal surgeon also involved in the project. “When a machine is trained to be capable of identifying abnormal patterns in this way, it saves a doctor so much time in diagnosis; time that could be better spent helping the patient manage the condition and in aftercare.” “Big data” and artificial intelligence has come in for stinging criticism in recent years, over issues of privacy, fairness, accountability and transparency. But in healthcare, especially in developing countries, AI technology that employs data sets for machine learning is now expected to make rapid strides as an effective screening and diagnostic tool. In India, for example, it has the potential to save millions of lives. According to the National Health Profile report of 2017, the country has a little over 1 million doctors to treat its population of 1.3 billion people. Of these medics, only about 10% work in the public health sector. There is an acute shortage of healthcare providers and infrastructure in rural areas. In addition, diabetes is a growing problem in India, where an estimated 72 million people have the condition. Though eyecare may not seem like a priority for those with diabetes, as many as 10% could develop diabetic retinopathy, which can result in blindness. Since 2016, Aravind hospital has been involved in a pilot project to test the algorithm. At this stage, the results it generates is being checked against a manual grading process. “If there is a big difference between the results generated from the AI software and the manual diagnosis by an ophthalmologist, a senior retina specialist will make the final decision on the grading,” says Kim. These discrepancies are analysed, helping to improve and fine tune the data that will be fed into it. “With a 97.5% accuracy rate, it hasn’t been too far off the mark,” says Rajan. Two other major ophthalmic centres in India have been involved in building the algorithm – Narayana Nethralaya in Bengaluru and Shankara Nethralaya hospital in Chennai. Kim hopes the future could include AI-powered machines set up like vending booths across India’s remotest villages, capable of taking photographs of people’s inner eye and offering a digital diagnosis. “Think of it as a screening and referral tool, that could tell you with a great deal of precision whether you needed to see a specialist or not and if so, how urgently you needed to see one,” says Dr H Parida, a retina specialist. Parida assisted the team early on, helping to analyse retinal images to build the algorithm. AI algorithms in development have the potential to work with specialised attachments to ordinary smartphone cameras, making them cost-effective. “AI technology is exciting and has made considerable progress in eyecare possible, but there are areas where we need to exercise caution,” says Dr Rohit Shetty, corneal and refractive surgeon and vice-chairman of Narayana Nethralaya. The quality of the algorithm and how well it works will depend on the quality of the images that are being fed into it, he adds. Regulating the quality of these images as AI becomes mainstream and establishing accountability in case of errors then becomes critical. Google and Verily say they have addressed this issue in India by working with well-established eyecare centres to build the raw data that their algorithm needs. “By partnering with well-known institutions like Aravind eye hospital and Shankara Nethralaya, we can continue our research and pilot studies in implementing AI-powered screening technology, and then extend it to clinical practice,” says Dr Lily Peng, a Google product manager.",

    "transcript": "It looks like a normal bathroom tile. But when amateur internet sleuths managed to locate it, they found the missing piece in an international child abuse investigation. This was one of the clues that led to the arrest of a suspect and the identification of nine child abuse victims. There’s nothing new about the police asking for tips – think missing person posters or episodes of Crimewatch. But the Trace an Object crowdsourcing effort launched by Europol in 2017 asks individuals and collectives to find clues for unsolved child abuse investigations by identifying parts of digital images. It could be a slice of cheese that someone recognises as Belgian, a crumpled shopping bag or a brightly coloured child’s duvet cover: it just needs a moment of recognition – human or digital – to fill in the gaps that lead police to a suspect or a victim. The pictures Europol posts online are drawn from a grim stash of 30m images of child sexual exploitation, which are often circulating on the dark web. Steven Wilson, the head of the agency’s European cybercrime centre, said that some are linked to crimes happening now and others document abuse from decades ago. Wilson said: “In the cases we deal with here, we have done as much as we can with law enforcement and this is a final throw of the dice. “In most cases, we are trying to identify a location and the eyes of the world can look at something that you can’t possibly replicate, even by online analysis. If we can narrow it down to one country or an area, that’s a massive starting point.” The response has stunned investigators: 283 posted images have led to 22,000 emails. Investigative groups such as Bellingcat have set up a Check platform to organise the workflow, and a Reddit community has also got stuck in. “Bellingcat has done a huge amount of investigative work,” added Wilson. “We reached out to them and they have passed on some of their technical expertise to do particular things … We can’t stay doing the things we have been doing for many years because we’ll only get the same results – we have to try new ideas.” This pilot has been adopted as a longer-term initiative at Europol, which passes confirmed tips to local police forces to help get victims to safety and start the prosecution process. For one Europol officer, who has spent months studying unedited images of child abuse to build up leads, it is a eureka moment when a crowdsourced tip leads to an arrest. “It feels awesome,” said the officer, who did not want to be identified. “It’s an extremely motivating element for doing the job.” The officer works in an imposing building in The Hague, where the revolving security door is labelled a “tourniquet” and there is compulsory counselling to help process the effects of such work. Elsewhere in the Netherlands lives Bo, a moderator of the amateur investigative group Serendip. Bo, who would only be interviewed by email and would not give out any personal details, guides a team of 15 people who recently helped identify a rooftop in China for Europol. “We are pretty sure that we have found 40 images,” Bo wrote. “Europol doesn’t really ever reply. Sometimes it puts a ‘like’ on Twitter. That’s a shame. We mostly find the things they ask for quickly but we often don’t know what happens next.” Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, explains that people such as Bo use “weirdly basic” open-source techniques to reverse-search images on publicly shared archives. They look for clues related to lighting conditions or a season to identify a location. Higgins said: “Sometimes it’s just a matter of recognising shopping bag brands. Some of it’s more obscure. There was a photo taken of a hotel, which showed a whole room with two figures blurred out. Very rapidly someone said that they had been there, and it was in Mauritius. When we went to the website of the hotel, they had a photo that was the exact same angle, of a room that was almost identical. That just relies on someone seeing the tweet who knows what it is.” People may sometimes identify more than a simple item, Higgins added. “Sometimes we can find the images of the victims, clearly from the same photo set. There’s at least one case where it was possible to identify a likely suspect as well. That has big issues if that gets out in public and people decide to start tracking these people down themselves.” This also could alert a suspect to destroy potential evidence, said Bo. Getting amateurs involved in police work does have risks, according to Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius, a law professor at Radboud University Nijmegen and a fellow at the University of Amsterdam’s institute of information law. Borgesius said: “Criminal law contains rules that limit police power, to protect individuals suspected of some kind of crime against the state. We can generally assume the police force is trained on those rules: even though you are investigating crime, there are limits to what you can do. I’m afraid crowds don’t always know those rules and might become overly enthusiastic in their own online echo chamber. “In an extreme case, you could think there’s a risk of a lynch mob.” These are all hazards Europol takes seriously. “You have got to balance that risk with the huge potential,” said Wilson. “For the nine victims identified so far, this potentially has made a significant difference to their lives. On many occasions, people perpetrating this abuse are repeat offenders and if you can stop them, for me the most important thing is what future damage is prevented.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "And so to Groundhog Day. Again. In the 1993 film, the Bill Murray character Phil Connors ultimately comes to realise that ditching cynicism for more open-hearted enthusiasm breaks the loop of the same old story repeating itself day after day. In a world in which the same dismal stories have a tendency of repeating themselves day after day, a bit of the Connors approach might go a long way. Take Poland. Persistent reports of the populist, authoritarian government and its attempts to rein in the courts and the media have dominated international coverage over the past four years. You could be forgiven for thinking nothing much good is going on in the country. You’d be wrong. Then there are rising sea levels, the slow-motion consequence of global warming. A formidable threat, of course, and one to take very seriously. But not insuperable, as a group of Filipino islanders are proving. Electric cars are one of the technologies heralded in the fight against climate change. But even here the cynical view can prevail: they don’t have a long enough range, you can’t charge them easily or quickly, they won’t catch on. One Dutch driver sought to prove the naysayers wrong, as Naaman Zhou found out. So is that all we need – a little optimism to break the Brexit Groundhog Day loop? Or just a bit of humour? What we liked A gossamer-thin silver lining to the cloud that is Venezuela: the efforts made by neighbouring Colombia to deal with millions of people who have fled hunger and poverty has been exemplary, the Atlantic reports. At the other end of the scale, who could not be touched by the story of the Devon farmer so attached to his lambs that he drove them to a sanctuary, not an abattoir. What we heard The stories of how people have adapted and are now adapting should encourage us all to know that whatever the challenge, there will be those who will stand up to it and succeed. Colddebtmountain, in the comments under the rising sea levels article Where was the Upside? On Manus Island, where an asylum seeker who has been detained for almost six years won Australia’s most valuable literary prize.

    "transcript": "The water laps above her ankles, and flows through her home, sending bottles bobbing gently on the high tide. But Maria Saavedra is unworried, and unmoving. “I really like it here on the island because it is peaceful,” she says, sitting in the front room of her inundated home on Ubay Island, in the centre of the Philippines archipelago. The Cebu Strait quietly invades her house on the high tide for nearly four hours a day, more than 130 days a year. But Saavedra doesn’t want to leave the only home she’s known for an uncertain life on a larger island nearby. “We can eat fresh fish and pick up seashells. We can sell them right away to buy rice … we cook, we eat and then we go to sleep. “This is where we want to die. We really like this place.” The flooding was sparked by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in 2013 that caused the land to subside by up to a metre. Now researchers based in Japan, led by Laurice Jamero and Miguel Esteban, are using the islands to examine the environmental, social and economic impacts of extreme sea level rise. Their research, and the community’s efforts to adapt, are the subject of a documentary Racing the King Tide by Liverpool production house Hatch. The subsidence has in effect jumped these communities decades forward in time: offering a glimpse of what could happen when sea levels rise to overwhelm low-lying islands. By 2100, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts global mean sea levels will rise by between 26 and 98cm. The Philippines is a member of the 48-nation Climate Vulnerable Forum, which last month told the UN climate talks last month that islands, communities, even entire nations, faced “extinction” from rising seas. Adapt and flourish When the Philippine islands began to regularly and predictably flood on high tides, the Tubigon municipal government launched a relocation program, offering to build permanent houses for the island’s communities on the mainland island of Bohol. But Ubay islanders are fishers, and their connection to the place they call home is powerful. The water is central to the islanders’ way of life, and their view of the world. Every 24 June, they celebrate the feast of St John the Baptist – the prophet held to have baptised Jesus in the River Jordan – by taking to the sea. “We have been celebrating the feast of San Juan like our parents did,” retired fish vendor Servillana Mejares says at her home on Batasan Island. “They told us we should swim in the sea to be healed. “We don’t stop swimming just because of tidal floods. We are not afraid of box jellyfish. We still celebrate as much as we can. They say the tide will ebb anyway.” For reasons of economy, social cohesion, and fundamental identity, almost all residents have chosen to stay, for now. Life goes on: market vendors manage their stalls, domestic animals are moved to bamboo platforms, schoolbags are lifted from classroom floors. In houses that flood, furniture is modified with longer legs, and outdoor cooking fires are raised onto purpose-built scaffolds. Water – too much and too little – creates manifold problems. The saltwater kills garden vegetable plants, but there’s little that is fresh to drink. The islanders drink purified water and rely on rainwater for their homes, but it regularly runs out and supplies have to be sent from the mainland. Jamero, lead researcher from the University of Tokyo, said the dominant discussion about sea-level rise focuses on “people fleeing the sinking island, the ‘end-of-the-world’-type narrative”. “But when I went to these places, it’s completely different. People don’t want to leave their homes, they have found a way to live their lives, to adapt, even to enjoy the floods.” Jamero said staged relocations – where people move to larger islands for forecast major weather events, such a king tides coinciding with typhoons – was negotiated between the islanders and government officials. “What really struck me was how the government really listened and actually changed their approach,” Jamero said. The Tubigon government has focused on education, offering scholarships to high school and college students from the islands, in order to induce relocation more naturally, over two or three generations. Following the earthquake the government “was really pushing for … the islanders to be relocated to the mainland,” Tubigon municipal administrator Noel Mendana says. “But islanders think that they cannot survive on the mainland, as their livelihood depends on the sea. So what the government is doing is trying to help them to adapt.” ‘We eat seashells’ Those on the islands have, for the most part, learned to live with the regular inundation, but it does pose significant problems. They understand too, that while they have so far found ways to adapt, their futures, and those of their children, might ultimately lie elsewhere. In the meantime, the islanders make the best of it. Agnes Bulilan teaches at Bilangbilangan Elementary School, standing barefoot and calf-deep in water, her students perched on stools out of the sea. Classes cannot be cancelled: because the flooding is routine, too many days of school would be missed. “Whenever we teach and there’s high tide,” Bulilan says, “the attention of the kids is not here anymore, it’s with the sea … they are looking at you, but they are playing with the water with their feet. There is also dirt, it’s fine if it’s just fish that enter the classroom, but… human waste, also enters.” Nutritionist Amelita Sucano on Pangapasan island says regular inundation makes it harder to find fresh fruit and vegetables. Almost all of the communities’ gardens were completely washed away by Typhoon Queenie in 2014. “Vegetables are rare, we have to get them from the mainland. We usually eat fish and crab, but if there is no fish catch, we eat seashells [molluscs] ... but our biggest problem is tidal flooding, when the plants are splashed by seawater they wilt,” she says. Shooting on the tiny islands, film-maker Chris Chadwick from Hatch said he was struck by the islanders’ adaption to their new world. “When you arrive, there’s an initial shock at how drastic the experience is. The home we used as our base was someone’s front room, with all the seats and sideboards propped up. Within two-and-a-half hours the same room was filled with water, and a kid, 18 months or two years old, was swimming in it, with no fear at all, a little water baby.” Racing the King Tide is a a collaborative research project between Waseda University, The University of Tokyo, Liverpool John Moores University and production company Hatch. It is screening as part of the BFI’s Future Film Festival on the Southbank between February 21 and 24.",

    "date": "2019-01-30",
    "transcript": "Back when Anna Gryta and Elżbieta Wąs started a local campaign to preserve a town square in south-east Poland, they had no idea it would turn them into potent symbols of democratic revival. But almost 10 years since their success in Lubartów, the sisters have become figureheads for thousands of Poles determined to secure the clean, democratic governance promised to them in the wake of the collapse of communism 30 years ago. It’s a surprising revelation. Poland has become a byword for nationalist populism in recent years as the ruling Law and Justice party defies European democratic norms with its assault on the media and the courts. But away from the limelight, there is a flourishing grassroots movement against the flaws in the country’s democratic culture on which the populists feed. Tight groups of civic activists are notching up success after success across the country on a vast range of different issues – from sex education to air quality and the rule of law, from cycle lanes and public spaces to transparency and participation in local decision-making processes. “Something is happening, something has changed,” says Patryk Białas, an environmental campaigner recently elected to the city council in the south-western city of Katowice. In the eastern region of Podlasie, local activists recently ran a disciplined, sophisticated and ultimately successful campaign against illegal state-sanctioned logging in the Białowieża forest. In Silesia, Poland’s industrial south-west, residents forced the closure of a toxic coking plant last year. In Poznań, in the north-west, citizens are campaigning to publicise allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic church. In Warsaw, a group of parents are running a campaign to put pressure on local authorities to combat the city’s terrible air quality. In Gdańsk, Pawel Adamowicz presided over numerous civic innovations before his brutal murder earlier this month. In 2016, Gdańsk established Poland’s first “civic panel” in order to develop policies on flood prevention in the city, with 63 residents drawn at random from the local electoral register to “raise the level of civic engagement in the areas most challenging to the city”. Gdańsk also runs an “open data programme”, publishing daily data on its expenses. “Civil society is not about enlightened absolutism imposed from the top,” Adamowicz said at the time. “It takes place through the activism of different entrepreneurs and people of different professions and ideas, as well as through public disputes and conflicts. That is how civil society is created.” The rise of these movements is threatening to reshape the country’s politics. In urban areas, there has been a growth of so-called city movements, networks of campaigners challenging traditional political parties on questions of governance, corruption, planning and the environment. Some local authorities have responded to this growth in demand for accountability by introducing innovative new consultation mechanisms such as citizens’ panels, where groups of volunteers and randomly selected citizens participate in the city’s decision-making process, and participatory budgets, where citizens apply for financing for projects that they have drawn up themselves. In smaller towns across the country, long-entrenched local political leaders have found themselves under pressure or thrown out of office altogether by new candidates with no party-political affiliations. “In the 1990s and 2000s, the local mayor was like a kind of wizard, a kind of local god,” says Białas. “Just because he was elected, he had great wisdom, like a light from the sky, and he had no need to consult anyone because he knew better than the rest of society. “But nowadays we know that the citizens have expertise, that they often know much better than their leaders. Instead of being local prophets, politicians are learning that they need to build links with society – not to ‘manage’ the people, but to serve them.” Observers note the significance of these grassroots actions not just in the liberal opposition bastions of Poland’s larger cities, but in places like Lubartów, a small town of just over 20,000 people in the conservative heartland of the ruling Law and Justice party. Having killed off the council’s proposal to sell the town square to private developers in 2010, the following year Wąs and Gryta organised a town-wide opinion poll that forced the authorities to abandon a plan to build a waste-processing plant in a residential area near the centre of town. They soon came to realise, however, that protesting against individual decisions was insufficient. The authorities were making poor decisions because they were not consulting local residents, but they did not consult them because they appeared to be under no obligation or pressure to do so; even when the sisters were able to convince the council to hold a public consultation, they struggled to convince their neighbours to attend. Unless this lack of engagement could be addressed, this vicious circle – poor decisions, leading to anger and disillusionment, leading to lack of engagement in the decision-making process, leading to more poor decisions – would never be broken. “We realised that it isn’t just the fault of the authorities,” says Wąs. “If society doesn’t demand it, if they don’t participate in the consultation process, if they are not present when the decision is made, then the authorities will see no point in asking us in the first place.” The sisters started to shift their focus. Setting up a small local foundation, their activities range from submitting freedom of information requests, to a successful campaign for council sessions to be filmed and broadcast online, to pushing councillors to publish more information about their views and decisions. Ahead of October’s local elections, they set up a stall in the town centre where residents could peruse the election materials of all the different candidates, including from past elections, so as to be able to hold them to their promises. They also run civic engagement workshops and have an initiative monitoring and publicising whether councillors turn up to their scheduled consultation surgeries. Gryta and Wąs’s relentlessness has won them awards and admirers – all at a cost. Labelled as busybodies and troublemakers by their opponents, they have endured a form of social ostracism from those whose jobs depend on local authorities. “Many people don’t know they have the right to demand information, and those that do know are often afraid to do so because the authorities often perceive it as an attack,” says Wąs. A cancer survivor with a physical disability that makes driving difficult, for years she has commuted to work in a different town so as not to have to rely on the authorities she has been challenging. “It can be unforgiving work, because we still don’t have a culture of discussion. We will keep on drumming away because people need to know, people need to participate. But are we popular? No.” Activists argue that they are addressing fundamental flaws in Poland’s democratic transition that has facilitated the rise of populist authoritarianism. Decades after the institution of free and fair elections, the relationship between citizens and the authorities in many parts of Poland remains tarnished by a culture of secrecy and mutual suspicion, with important decisions at local level often made with little, if any, public consultation. Many fear crossing powerful local officials, who oversee vast investments of European development funds and enjoy extensive networks of patronage. “When you don’t know your rights, you would rather wait for orders from someone else, and assume that you can’t do something,” says Katarzyna Batko-Tołuć, director of Watchdog Polska, a Warsaw-based NGO. “People in Poland are free, but they don’t know they are free, they still don’t realise that they have the power to shape their own future. In my experience, once people start to know their rights, they start to be very self-confident.” These flaws in Poland’s democratic governance were overlooked by many as the economy boomed, creating jobs and a sharp rise in living standards. But as material conditions have improved, and as more and more Poles return from long spells living and working in western Europe, so expectations of public institutions to deliver on the promise of western European standards of living have grown. This shift in expectations was illustrated by last year’s massive environmental protests in Mielec, a town of 60,000 in the south-east ringed by factories that have been accused of polluting air and waterways with toxic discharge. “The city was able to grow economically, but it seemed like there was always a closed circle of people on the border of business and politics who dominated the council,” says Mikolaj Skrzypiec, who moved back to Mielec in 2010 after 10 years living in London. “We could see that what was happening wasn’t right and that the government was doing nothing, so we started to take photos and gathered samples for analysis by a scientist in Kraków in such a way that the evidence would be admissible in court. One of the carcinogenic substances in one of the samples we found was a million times – I mean literally, a million times – higher than the legally accepted level.” Public anger boiled over in March last year and 15,000 people – a quarter of the city – took to the streets, the biggest environmental protest in Poland since the disaster Chernobyl. “It was spontaneous, grassroots, organised over social media by people with no experience of campaigning. I was absolutely head over heels, really happy and proud at the number of people you could see there,” says Skrzypiec. “There were manual workers, middle-class people, leftwing people, rightwing people, football fans, families – even employees of the factory we were protesting against. I will never forget it.” In the capital, democracy activists are taking on very different threats. In southern Warsaw, Jan Lawrynowicz and Piotr Przytula set up a local activist group that uncovered digital skulduggery in which a spray of fake online accounts were used to cheerlead for local officials. “We saw at the micro-level of local politics the kinds of mechanisms that are going on at the geopolitical level around the world,” says Lawrynowicz. “It is really scary how easy it is to manipulate people using these tricks.” Activists said that while they are focused on a wide range of different issues and operate in very different parts of the country, each with their own set of challenges, some challenges are common to all of them. The first is the difficulty in bridging the gap between citizens and officialdom – especially at the local level – in a society that remains in the shadow of communist authoritarianism even decades after the fall of communism itself. “So much of local government still works in the same way as it did in the communist era – it is a Soviet style of social relations, where officials use their patronage to keep power, where only the obedient are rewarded,” says Lawrynowicz. “The only difference is the fact that we have elections – but when the elections are over, no one listens to the citizens.” The second is the personal cost endured by many activists. Almost all of them said that their work has led them to come under pressure either from local authorities, employers, or their neighbours – sometimes even all three. “A lot of people end up disappointed because despite their best intentions, other people can be suspicious of their activities and accuse them of being in it for themselves,” says Batko-Tołuć. “Someone who thinks differently, who asks questions, who has a different opinion, can feel isolated and unpopular. There is a lot of fear of upsetting the people in charge.” The third is that although they see themselves as compensating for the existing weaknesses in Poland’s democratic culture and state institutions, some activists note that they will not be able to realise their aims at the national and local levels if the populists in government get there first. Their campaigns rely on independent courts to defend their rights, prosecute corruption, and enforce freedom of information requests – none of which will be possible if the judiciary is fully subjugated to Poland’s ruling party. Some argue, however, that Law and Justice’s rightwing authoritarianism has only served to electrify the grassroots democracy movement, shaking Poland’s liberals and many others from their EU-induced complacency. In time, they say, the movement’s small victories have the potential not only to transform Polish democracy for the better, but also to inspire their counterparts in western Europe to take the fight to the populists in their own countries. “The irony is that with Law and Justice in power, people are starting to wake up to the importance of rights and functioning institutions, they understand how much is left to be done,” says Batko-Tołuć. “After we joined the EU, a lot of our problems started to be solved, and so we started to become complacent and passive. Now that people see that democracy is at risk, they realise how precious it is and what needs to be done to protect it I am actually very positive about what is going on in Poland.” “Overall, it is a positive story,” says Lawrynowicz. “We don’t win every battle, but we are making progress. People are becoming more aware, people are starting to fight. Eventually we will change this country.” “Maybe there is something in the Polish soul telling us to fight when we see bad things going on, even if we are in a losing position,” says Przytula. “We don’t want to raise the white flag, we won’t accept that we don’t have influence over the process.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Any idea how much is given to charitable causes every year? There are no hard and fast global numbers, but the best estimates put it north of $500bn (£382bn), or $16,000 a second. That seems like something worth celebrating in a week in which it was established that the 26 richest people own as much as the poorest 3.8 billion. Of course, charity cannot make up for inequality or social injustice. But it’s good to know there are millions of givers out there. Take Scott Wellenbach. He is a rather successful poker player, and as such, a man you might think more likely to take money off you than give anything back. You’d be wrong. Wellenbach is also a Buddhist. And this week, he gave a six-figure sum that he won at the tables to charity. Haroon Siddique found out more. Then there are the people who give up their time. A British survey published on Friday came up with surprising findings that four in 10 people say they have volunteered in one form or another over the past year. Some readers expressed scepticism at this. Others simply opened up on why volunteering makes you feel good, such as TheDudleyOmmer in the comment thread: As someone who has been a volunteer in supporting a scout camp in my area for more than 50 years, I can fully endorse the benefits it has given both myself and my family. In other news, we were mildly encouraged by the latest innovation to remove plastic from household products by expanding the idea of “refills” into the supply chain. And we liked the idea of endpaper, which will never change the world but makes it ever so slightly more beautiful. There were promising spots of data too this week. The number of young working Europeans earning so little that they are at risk of poverty fell to its lowest level since 2014. And surprisingly, particularly for French gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protesters, it emerged France devotes more of its wealth to social spending than any other rich country. And a report from Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre found worldwide terrorist attacks fell by one-third in 2018 compared with the previous year, to the lowest level since 2011. Matthew Henman, the head of Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, said: Over the course of 2018, JTIC recorded a worldwide total of 15,321 attacks by non-state armed groups, which resulted in a total of 13,483 non-militant fatalities. The attack figure represents a significant 33.2% decrease from the recorded number of attacks in 2017. What we liked This is a little old, but extremely noble: an attempt by Bastian Berbner of the German newspaper Die Zeit to get adversaries to simply sit down, talk to each other and find out what they have in common. It’s mostly in German, but some pages have been rendered into English. We also liked an important focus in Positive News on the destruction wrought by pornography – and the people taking it on.

    "transcript": "Almost four in 10 Britons volunteer, with the vast majority saying it benefits their mental health and acts as an antidote to loneliness, according to a survey of more than 10,000 people. The survey, conducted by YouGov on behalf of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), involved 10,103 people aged over 18, the largest poll on the subject in more than a decade. Of the respondents 77% said volunteering had improved their mental health, with just over half (53%) saying it had improved their physical health. Young people were most likely to say volunteering had helped combat isolation, with 77% of 18- to 24-year-olds agreeing with this, compared with 68% of all ages and 76% of 25– to 34-year-olds. “There is an emerging body of evidence that suggests volunteering can improve your mental health and the language I have read is that it can help with depression, life satisfaction and wellbeing,” said Karl Wilding, NCVO’s policy and volunteering director. “Broadly speaking, it helps as it is a social activity, and when you are doing things with others and groups that conviviality and connectedness is important,” he said, adding that it was most beneficial to people who didn’t have a partner or a job. A 2017 study into Wildlife Trust volunteers found more than half those who started out with low mental health had improved after 12 weeks. The NCVO survey found that 69% of respondents had volunteered at some point in their life, 38% having done so in the past year. Extrapolated over the entire adult population, this means more than 20 million people had given of their time at some point in the year. Older people were more likely to volunteer than younger people, and fully 90% of volunteers said they felt their contribution had made a difference. Wilding said that in the NCVO’s own research the one thing which surprised him about the findings was that a higher number of 18- to 24-year-olds found volunteering a good way of combatting isolation. “For me, that is at the heart of what do we do next. Essentially, if you have a cohort of the population who people feel concerned about in terms of connectedness … that strikes me as a real solution.” Colette Lane, 45, said volunteering had brought purpose back to her life after a spell of mental illness had forced her to stop teaching. She started with local groups and now volunteers with the Surrey and Borders mental health trust, counselling people who have suicidal thoughts. “Volunteering gave me a purpose back to my life, gave me my identity again and made me feel part of the community when I was feeling isolated,” she said. “It made me feel so proud that my son had a mum now who was keeping herself well and working. I am not well all the time, but now I can say I have the skills and support to help me get through those times.” Other findings in the NCVO report include indications that people from middle class backgrounds were nearly 50% more likely to have volunteered in the last 12 months than those from working class backgrounds (44% compared with 30%). “Those from lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to say they have never been involved in volunteering, and those who have are less likely to be in certain leadership or representative roles, like being a trustee. Research on volunteering, and on participation more broadly, consistently indicates that inequalities of resources and power means that some people are more likely to be excluded from certain activities,” the report notes. The poll also found 74% of people agreed that volunteering had given them more confidence, with the figure rising to 84% among 18- to 24-year-olds. In addition, 71% said they had gained new skills and experience, rising to 85% among 18- to 24-year-olds. And 96% said they were satisfied with their experience and 69% said they would recommend it to others. Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the NCVO, said: “Volunteering can be truly transformative for people’s lives. It reduces isolation, improves confidence, provides new experiences, improves employment prospects and fundamentally it’s deeply rewarding. But sadly, those who stand to benefit the most from volunteering are less likely to be involved.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "A Buddhist poker player has said he will give away more than $600,000 of his winnings to charity. Scott Wellenbach’s third place finish in the Bahamas scooped him $671,240 (£521,384), more than nine times his previous total. The Canadian player said the only way he could rationalise playing a game that could leave others in strife was to donate to those in need. He told PokerNews.com: “I hope that somehow a wise decision happens and the money goes to good purposes and certain human beings or other sentient beings, animals or whatever, beings with feelings, [so] that their lives are eased in some way.” The 67-year-old from Halifax, Nova Scotia, translates Buddhist teachings from Sanskrit and Tibetan when he is not at the poker table. He told the BBC that he reconciles the teachings of his faith with the adrenaline of a straight flush “with great difficulty”. His previous biggest win was $72,176 in 2017, which, like all of his winnings, went to charity. Beneficiaries of his generosity have included Buddhist nuns in Nepal and Tibet, Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders. Last year, he told CBC News: ““A significant amount of your money is won from people who are too addicted, too drunk, too unstudied or too masochistic to play well – and we all have those features within us. “In any case, I feel there’s a tension about winning money under those circumstances and I guess I rationalise my addiction by giving away the winnings, saying, ‘Well, at least I’m doing good things with it.’” Wellenbach said he did not travel to poker rooms unless he happened to be in the area for work or won an online qualifying tournament (as he did for the Bahamas). He revealed that he meditates for about an hour every day but more so during a tournament to retain his personal discipline.",

    "transcript": "The dark side of the moon may not actually be dark, but alas it’s not that hospitable. That much became clear this week when a seedling planted by the Chinese (which also gave us the headline of the week) on the far side of the moon failed to survive a lunar night. Hardly surprising really: night over there goes on for two weeks with temperatures as low as -170C. But back on planet Earth, thankfully there are green shoots aplenty if you know where to look. The UK has resettled more than 10,000 Syrian refugees since 2015, but 70% are unemployed or underemployed – a considerable waste given the advanced professional skills that many have. Enter a group of social entrepreneurs with the savvy and financial acumen to get people like doctors and dentists back into their chosen profession. The cliche of the post-doctoral physicist driving minicabs for a living might finally be put to bed.

    "transcript": "Hussam Allahham knows how to save a life on the operating table. He has done it many times in his home city of Damascus. He can fix broken limbs, amputate, remove tumours and replace organs. As a general surgeon he has had plenty of practice with a scalpel and stitches, both in Syria and while in a refugee camp in Italy. In short, he’d be a useful addition to a health service anywhere. Only, in his new adopted home of Cardiff, Allahham, 36, cannot practise. He has tried to regain his standing as a surgeon but prohibitively expensive language tests and requalification exams have prevented him. His story is one that is commonly retold in different forms among the refugee population: 38% of the 10,000-plus Syrian refugees in the UK have a university education, yet 70% of all refugees are unemployed and 20% have had to change their careers to take any available job. Theresa May’s government has pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020 – supposedly the largest single response to a humanitarian crisis by a British government. But a large section of this refugee population is being denied the ability to work to their full potential. Just as underemployment, the imbalance between skills and job roles, has reached double the rate of unemployment for British citizens, the same issues are affecting Britain’s refugees. And despite May’s stated intention being to prioritise immigration for the highly skilled after Brexit, here is an underutilised source of skilled people who are already in the country. Fortunately, a cluster of social enterprises have formed to help address these worrying statistics. With many based in London, and some even sharing the same co-working spaces, these startups help refugee talent move from unemployment or underemployment into meaningful work. “When I first arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker, I wasn’t allowed to work at all and it was very hard for me to accept benefits,” Allahham says. These benefits of £5 per day had to sustain Allahham for the four months it took for his application to be approved. “I used to be a doctor, with a high standing in Syria,” he continues, “so it was humiliating to go to the jobcentre and ask for money. They didn’t care that I am a doctor and can contribute to the country. I had to find any work.” Allahham took their advice. “Even cleaning was better than seeking benefits,” he says. After volunteering at a local community centre, Allahham secured a full-time role as a support worker for asylum seekers. With this stability, he could focus on passing the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam to requalify as a surgeon. Nine attempts and £3,500 in exam fees later, Allahham still works at the community centre. “The main problem is that I had to work full-time while studying for the language test,” he says, “and the free classes, which it took over an hour to walk to each day, weren’t going to help me to get the high scores I needed.” This high score of level 7.5 for medicine – where an average native speaker would likely reach 5 – requires intensive coaching, with one term costing upwards of £3,000. Trapped in this cycle, Allahham found help through the charity RefuAid. Started in 2015 by ex-law trainee Anna Jones and consultant Tamsyn Brewster, RefuAid provides free language courses at 74 partner schools in the UK, as well as interest-free loans of up to £10,000 for refugees to requalify. “Language is the absolute first step to integration,” Jones says, “and since we started we haven’t had a single default on the £215,000 we’ve loaned, while we’ve also placed 143 refugees into language schools.” Jones estimates it takes at least a year of full-time study to pass the IELTS, since “the level of language they need is absurd”. She says that means there are “thousands of qualified refugees available who are misjudged and misused”. With RefuAid’s help, Allahham is now focusing on passing a new language test, the medically focused Occupational English Test, and once he does he will apply for a loan to take the £2,500 exam to requalify as a surgeon. “It’s a long road ahead, but I’m sure I will work again as a doctor and help my community,” he says. Another refugee helped by RefuAid to requalify is Syrian dentist Mohammad Alhomsi. The 31-year-old was forced to apply for asylum in 2013 after his student visa expired and the Syrian embassy in the UK shut down, leaving him and his young family stranded. It then took two years for Alhomsi’s refugee status to be processed. “During that time I broke down,” he says. “I’m a strong man, but the way I was dealt with was undignified, like a criminal on probation. Me, my wife and my newborn baby had the bare minimum to survive on and we were scared that we would be deported. We lived an ongoing nightmare for two years.” Although Alhomsi already had his language qualification from having studied in the UK, the £4,000 cost to requalify as a dentist meant taking any job to save money, as with Allahham. “I had to work many different jobs on temporary contracts,” he says, “like for British Gas, and even selling secondhand books, since the jobcentre doesn’t care about you getting back to your career, just that you have some sort of employment.” Exhausted from the low pay and long hours, Alhomsi was persuaded by a Syrian friend to contact RefuAid. “Anna gave me hope in my life. She got me an interest-free loan that I used to pay for exam fees and preparations, which I’m forever grateful for,” he says. “RefuAid gave me a belief that I would be able to do what I’ve spent one third of my life learning, and be able to live again.” RefuAid is just one of a number of refugee startup charities that have flourished in the capital in the past three years. Staffed almost entirely by under-30s – Jones is 28 – they refer refugees to one another, based on their needs. Breaking Barriers, an organisation focused on refugee employment and reskilling, helped Syrian fashion merchandiser Ammar Alsaker, 23, to get back to university and gain employment at a high-street brand. “Breaking Barriers helped me kickstart my new life,” Alsaker says. “Thanks to them, I finished first in my class at university. I have never been the first at anything, and I’ve got to experience what that feels like despite all the challenges my family are going through and me being away from them for three years now.” Since its founding in 2015, Breaking Barriers has helped more than 600 refugees get back into the workplace. Chief executive officer Matthew Powell, 28, says: “Underemployment is perhaps a bigger issue than unemployment for refugees, as most don’t want to go on benefits, but they have families to support. The asylum process is also lengthy and you can’t work during that time, so combine the two and you have a big gap on your CV that is very hard to articulate to employers.” One organisation specifically targeting this asylum “gap” is Timepeace. An app designed to encourage skill-sharing among refugees and the public, it combats the isolation and dejection that Alhomsi found during his two-year asylum process. Co-founder Alexandra Simmons, 27, says: “We recognised that a lot of refugees were lonely once they arrived in the UK. They are dealing with a lot of trauma and being part of a community can have a hugely positive effect and help their language skills too.” Timepeace is a means for refugees to meet up with others in their local area to either teach skills or to learn them, and aims to place refugees on an equal footing with the rest of society. “One of the biggest challenges around the perception of refugees is that they don’t contribute, that they just want to take benefits,” says Simmons, “but a lot of people aren’t aware that they’re either not allowed to work or they don’t have the means to be adequately employed.” And if there are no adequate jobs available, the Entrepreneurial Refugee Network helps people start their own businesses. “We want to reclaim the negative connotations of the word ‘refugee’,” says co-founder Charlie Fraser, 25. “That’s why we kept the word ‘refugee’ in our name and combined it with entrepreneurship, which is such a positive concept. We want to launch 1,000 refugee businesses by 2025, since at the moment the majority of refugee entrepreneur talent is being lost because they’re in too vulnerable a position in terms of mindset, money and time.” Once they have requalified, Allahham and Alhomsi plan to stay in the UK. “I want to get back to the standing of the profession I had in Syria,” Allahham says. “Just as I helped those in the Red Cross who saved me, I want to give back to my community here. I will pass my language test soon, I know it.” As for Alhomsi and his family, he says: “This is home for us now. If you ask my little one, ‘Where are you from?’ she will say Britain. She knows no different. She loves it here and we love it too, even though both our best and worst times have been here. We will always keep our culture and heritage but we will also integrate into the UK – we’ll make it a richer place.” • Ammar Kalia is a Guardian journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursary",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/the-swedish-online-love-army-who-battle-below-the-line-comments",
    "date": "2019-01-15",
    "transcript": "When a young woman with rainbow hair and a reputation for hostility towards sexual predators won a Swedish lawyer of the year award late last year, the online reaction came in two waves. The first was unpleasant, a torrent of bile from people who objected to Linnéa Claeson’s looks, her feminist politics, her gender, her youth and her instagram account @assholesonline. The second was less familiar: a blizzard of positive messages – congratulations, praise for her bravery and for acting as a role model despite the abusive comments. The surge of support was orchestrated by an organisation called #jagärhär (#Iamhere), a Facebook group of about 75,000 people, most of them in Sweden. Fed up with the rude, confrontational nature of online conversation and the way that a few bad mouths can ruin a discussion, they have made it their business to turn bad threads good. Every day, the group aims to do what government and social media companies have failed to do: defend people being attacked online by trolls and push back against the spread of misinformation. #Jagärhär mobilises members to add positive notes on comment sections where hatred and misinformation is being spread. This, they believe, rebalances the discussion online and disrupts Facebook’s algorithm. “Of course, social media does not reflect the overall population, but when you read the comment field, you often get the sense that 80% of the population thinks that homosexuality is a disease, for example,” said Mina Dennert, #jagärhär’s founder. “We want the comment section to look more like society and the way to do this is enable people to speak and participate.” After #jagärhär intervened in the comment sections talking about Claeson, the tone of the conversation improved palpably. The daily Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet even began moderating comments on its Facebook page, deleting the worst examples of hate speech. “It’s so tiring that everything that has to do with me has such a negative connotation. Thank you for the love,” Claeson said in a Facebook post in the #jagärhär group. Dennert, a journalist, launched her initiative in 2016, after seeing more and more disturbing remarks on social media. “What made me want to do something was seeing people I didn’t expect this from starting to repost really racist things.” She created a small Facebook group which started out by asking those spreading misinformation for facts to back up their statements. The morning after Donald Trump was elected, Dennert was overwhelmed with requests from thousands of people to join her group. In the months that followed, #jagärhär would change its approach, espousing neutrality in how its members reacted, and in most cases, simply mobilising support for people who were being harassed online. Dennert has won several awards for her work, including the prestigious Anna Lindh prize in 2017 for supporting just and democratic ideals. The Swedish rock group, Kent, even donated the proceeds of a photo auction to the group. But the attention also brought a massive backlash. Dennert regularly receives death threats, and at one point her father received bullets in the post. Trolls also doxed Dennert and her husband, Magnus Dennert, also a journalist, publishing sensitive personal data which they said related to the pair. As the personal attacks mounted, Dennert saw a sharp decline in support. At the beginning, many companies wanted to collaborate. But that changed. “The first year, we were so loved and we won all these prizes, and everyone wanted to work with us. But once the attacks started, the people who wanted to collaborate with us, they completely stopped. They were scared.” Critics call #jagärhär censorship, but Dennert and the moderators on the group are quick to emphasise that #jagärhär never comes with an agenda. They don’t tell people what to say. They simply want to defend those who are being attacked online. Orla Vigsö is a professor in the journalism, media and communication department at the University of Gothenburg. He is skeptical that #jagärhär can actually have an influence on the social media algorithms because trolls and people on the far right are much more prolific and are very organised. He hopes that #jagärhär is reducing the amount of online hate speech and misinformation people see, but he adds that it is “extremely hard to measure” and it may be wishful thinking on his part. Roger Wiklander, one of 18 group administrators for #jagärhär, says that for him the group is about speaking up against hate and misinformation in a united way and giving others the courage to do the same. One comment really sticks out to Wiklander. On an article encouraging people to donate clothes to refugees, a person wrote “Ha-ha-ha, garbage for trash!” For him, it’s comments like this one that make him do this sort of work. Since 2016, the Swedish online love army has spread to other countries in Europe. Sister groups have been created and are now active across the continent, most notably in Germany and Slovakia, whose groups have 45,000 and 6,000 members respectively. The groups largely function independently. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "date": "2019-01-10",
    "transcript": "John Dalyop Dangyang hid in the toilet while the gunmen set fire to his house. As it burned down around him, he soaked his underwear in the toilet water to bind around his face against the smoke. He was trapped for seven hours before police came and broke the wall down. Two months later, homeless and traumatised, he was invited to meet the leaders of the group he blamed for his attempted murder. On the other side of the table was Idris Gidado, a powerful leader of Fulani herdsmen, the nomadic cowboys who have trodden the Sahelian countryside for centuries. At the dialogue, something extraordinary happened. After the two sides had had it out, Dangyang offered a rare commodity in this bitter feud: forgiveness. Attacks on cattle herders by farmers and vice versa may seem trifling alongside the problems of poverty, terrorism, corruption and climate change facing Africa. But a recent escalation in this centuries-old deadly conflict is causing massive social upheaval across west Africa. In Nigeria’s middle belt, it has claimed nearly 4,000 lives in the past three years – more, according to some tallies – than the deadly Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east. Both groups need land, but for very different reasons. Fulani herding families are always on the move, looking for food and water for their animals; they cannot and do not want to own the vast landscapes they pass through every year. For farmers, who live and work in one place, land ownership is essential. As families grow and grazing lands turn to fields of rice, ancient livestock migration routes close up and herders’ cattle trample farmers’ fields. Farmers kill the cattle, herdsmen take revenge; the reprisals go back and forth. Ethnicity, religion and political affiliation play into the divisions. Some of the suggestions to solve the crisis include fencing off fields, drilling more boreholes so cattle and humans do not have to share water, microchipping cattle to prevent rustling and mapping traditional cattle grazing routes. Cattle ranching is a more drastic route. It would necessitate a complete change in the nomadic Fulanis’ way of life, and one that requires specific expertise, expensive animal feed, access to enough water, and – that increasingly rare commodity – land. It would also mean the end of an ancient culture. Adamu Ibrahim’s family were pioneers. His father sold cows to buy land in the 1980s. These days, his family own around 10,000 cattle and he is a millionaire (though you wouldn’t know it from his well-worn sandals and plain robe) “I was so upset,” Ibrahim said. But now, with their former grazing lands off limits, his father’s foresight is obvious. “If our dad hadn’t done that, where would we be now?” The piece of land he bought is a safe place for the family to retreat to, but it has nowhere near enough grazing for their herds, and so the Ibrahims are thinking of taking their father’s approach even further. “We’re thinking of sending our children to school and selling some cows to buy more land,” he said. Not everyone can afford to buy land, and not every herder is ready to give up their way of life. In the meantime, the main approach for those trying to stop the killing is rather less complex: talking. Defusing tension has always required that herders and farmers build relationships, but the mistrust that the constant attacks have engendered in the past few years has made this extremely difficult. “It’s more about managing the conflict than solving it,” said Tog Gang, of Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation working to create peace in central Nigeria by organising meetings like the one Dangyang was persuaded to attend, to meet the men he held responsible for trying to kill him. At their meeting place, a hotel on neutral ground in Plateau state, the men and women began to take off their dark glasses, put down their mobiles, and talk. They discussed the theft of huge herds, sometimes with the involvement of outside criminals, the slaughter of women, children and older people, the recent abundance of guns, the problems of unemployment and drug abuse among the young and the lack of intermarriage between communities. Dangyang, an influential leader in the Berom community, often used to meet and talk with the herdsmen before the attack. Now, surrounded by those he considers his enemies, he stared at the table with a pronounced frown, fiddling with a toothpick. Gidado got up to speak. “We should learn to forgive each other. We have all suffered enough and can’t move forward. We need to put an end to this,” he said in Hausa. But then he began to blame the Beroms for the whole conflict. “You can’t discipline your children,” he said. A Berom leader got up and threw the blame back. “Whenever someone steals or kills a cow, you respond by killing a person.” Dangyang rose to his feet. He told the group how it had felt to be almost burned alive, and the indignity of losing everything. Then his tone suddenly changed. He said: “I forgive the people who did this to me.” Readiness to forgive is something Saleh Momale, the development geographer who was leading the dialogue, has often seen in his peace-building work between herder and farmer communities. “This is typical Nigerians. People forgive and forget very easily,” he said. “What is difficult to resolve is political malice and mismanagement.” Nigeria’s security forces are slow to respond to calls for help, so communities arm and defend themselves. President Muhammadu Buhari’s critics say that because he is an ethnic Fulani, he turns a blind eye to his marauding kinsmen, and with Nigeria’s presidential election looming in February, tensions are even higher than usual. Mercy Corps spends time getting to know the various players intimately to ensure they are inviting the right people to their meetings. The point is not to get the participants to sign agreements they are unlikely to stick to, but to make them sit next to each other, eat together, talk honestly about the killings and the factors behind them, and, ideally, take each others’ phone numbers and plan future meetings. “Small interventions like this have done a lot of good,” said Momale. “This is the best hope – building these community institutions. I see hope in these guys. I don’t think we can count on our technocrats.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "When the government forced all UK businesses over a certain size to publish their gender pay gap figures last year, many red-faced chief executives struggled to justify why the men they employed were earning so much more than the women. Not so at the ethical wholesaler Suma, which says it is the largest equal-pay co-operative in Europe. First, because it doesn’t have a CEO. And second, because all of Suma’s 190 employees, or “members” , earn exactly the same: £15.60 an hour, equating to £33,000 for a 35-hour, five-day week, plus bonuses and shares. From the 26-year-old newbie to the 65-year-old who has been with Suma since its birth as a co-op in 1977, there are no exceptions. In Suma’s home of Elland, a market town near Halifax in West Yorkshire, that salary can buy you a home (a three-bed apartment in a converted mill is currently on sale for £103,000), plus “a decent car, a good family life and a nice holiday”, according to Nathalie Spencer, 35, who has worked at Suma for 14 years. Her main job is in international sales – the business turned over £55m last year and exports 7,000 vegetarian products to 40 different countries – but like all Suma members, she multitasks, and can sometimes be seen driving a reach truck in the warehouse or loading up lorries. “It sounds a bit random, but l like the team spirit involved in loading lorries, that sense of achievement at the end of each day, rather than leaving scattered notes on your desk and forgetting half of them,” she says. When the Guardian visits, Paul Collins, the account manager for one of Suma’s national chain customers and the brand coordinator for Suma’s Ecoleaf household range, is serving up vegetarian pizza in the free staff canteen. Jenny Carlyle, 33, who is in charge of hiring (and, only very occasionally, firing) in the personnel department, likes to go off and spend an afternoon in the deep freezer when she needs to clear her head. “Sometimes it’s nice to put on the freezer suit and pick products at -20C,” she says, and anyway, it makes her better at her main job if she understands all aspects of the business. “Working in the freezer or warehouse might be looked down on at normal companies, but actually it is such an integral part of our business as a wholesaler that we all need to understand it, and so it makes sense that our warehouse workers are paid the same as everyone else.” When she first heard of Suma, she assumed there must be a catch, but she soon realised the benefits of equal pay. “Being all paid the same is liberating,” she says. “I think I was probably overpaid when I started and now, 11 years on, with all my experience and all the courses I have done, I am probably being underpaid. But it evens out. Overall I have probably been paid more than if I had climbed the ladder at a normal business. “It takes some of that career pressure off as well. One of the great things I love about Suma is that we all have times in our life when we can’t put 100% into our working life, and at Suma you can step back for a little bit when you need to and then step back up when you can and there is no penalty for that.” Though the co-op is understanding if members need to take time out – whether to have a baby, move house, care for a relative or, like Carlyle, get a master’s degree – they are all expected to engage in big strategic issues of the business. New hires are warned: “You’re not just a worker, you’re an owner … you can’t just coast along, you need to take responsibility, taking part in the democracy and putting yourself forward to make things happen.” Between 120 and 550 people apply each time Suma has a recruitment round, in which the co-op generally hires up to 12 members. Applicants are wildly varied, says Carlyle: “In one round we might have someone with 40 years’ experience in logistics and then someone in their early 20s straight out of university.” Regardless of experience, newcomers are put on probation and spend their first three months working in the warehouse or driving – proving their ability to work safely, quickly and accurately in the less glamorous side of Suma’s operation. For a further six months, they work in a variety of departments and complete various targets. Only then, after an exhausting round of feedback, is there a vote from everyone at Suma to decide if they should be allowed to join as a member. More than 90% make it through the process, says Carlyle, who at 23 found herself on Suma’s management committee, its version of a board. “That was an experience most 23-year-olds would never be able to have. It’s that mixture of freedom and opportunity as well as the flexibility to step back when you need to without losing your place that’s really wonderful, and that’s all enabled by equal pay,” she says. Isis Carrasco, 47, a former charity manager, took a pay cut when she moved to Suma to become a project manager three years ago. “Equal pay is equal opportunities in terms of opening horizons and being able to do jobs that you would not be able to do unless you change your career,” says the cheerful Spaniard. “For example, I like DIY a lot and now I have the opportunity not just to project manage but also put shelves up. I am getting the opportunity to develop these sort of skills at work, skills you’d normally have to change career to learn.” It can take a little time to adjust to co-op life, says Carlyle. “It can be stressful at first figuring out how it works where there’s no clear hierarchy for decision-making. At a normal company you might only need to have one conversation to get something done. Here you will have to have five or six, and sometimes the whole co-op votes. Sometime people come here thinking it is a real utopia, but people are flawed and they do make mistakes.” One of Suma’s six founders, Jim Crabtree, still works a few days a week at the co-op. Carlyle says she sat next to him in the canteen once and asked whether he ever regretted the decision to turn the business into a member-owned co-operative. “It’s a £50m business now, so he would have a one-sixth share in that rather than a one in 190 share. He stopped eating and said: ‘Never.’ I feel really grateful to those six people who decided to share the company back when I wasn’t even born. It was a really generous thing they did and I am very, very proud to carry on their work.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Tangible and competitively priced proof of one of the Lord’s more mysterious recent manoeuvres can be found in a church nestled in the foothills of the Sierra de Moncayo in north-eastern Spain. A familiar face, now known to the world as Monkey Christ, greets visitors to the Santuario de Misericordia, its blurred and startled features staring down from bottles, thimbles, bookmarks, teddy bears, pens, mugs, T-shirts, mousepads, badges, fridge magnets and keyrings. For centuries, the nearby town of Borja was best known for its wines and splendid 16th-century town hall. All that changed six years ago when a simple act of devotion was transmogrified into an object of ridicule, a meme and, eventually, a tourist attraction. In the summer of 2012, a devout parishioner, Cecilia Giménez, noticed that an already flaking and faded painting on the church’s wall was under threat from a leak. Giménez, then 81, decided that if she did not act, the face of Christ that the artist Elías García Martínez had painted almost a century earlier would disappear for ever. Pained at the idea of its loss – and keen to conserve the interior of the church in which she had been married – Giménez began work, applying thick blocks of colour on which she planned to retrace the divine countenance. Had she been able to finish the job, things might have turned out differently. But Giménez had to leave town on a trip and her incomplete efforts soon came to the attention of the local historical association, which indignantly posted before-and-after pictures of the painting. From there, the story and images went viral. Before long, García Martínez’s work had ceased to be known as Ecce Homo and, as Monkey Christ or Potato Jesus, has become an irresistible visual shorthand for anything tending towards the disastrous. The townsfolk were up in arms, the media descended and Giménez lost 17kg through stress, worry and the thought that she had made a laughing stock out of Christ’s suffering face. Then two things happened: the anger in Borja subsided when people found out who had undertaken the restoration. And the tourists began arriving. “As soon as people knew that it was Cecilia who had done it, everything changed,” says the mayor, Eduardo Arilla. “And this has become a social phenomenon and a pop art icon.” Between August and December 2012, 45,824 people visited the sanctuary. The numbers may have dropped off since then, but Borja still receives 16,000 visitors a year – more than four times the number who came before Giménez picked up her brushes. Not only has the picture’s fame provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum’s two caretakers, it also helps fund places at Borja’s care home for the elderly, a haven for those who would not otherwise be able to afford to live there. Arilla is careful not to condone the actions that put Borja on the map – and to point out that there is more to the town than just the Ecce Homo – but he welcomes the interest, the tourists and their euros. “It was a media phenomenon, but it’s also been a social phenomenon when it comes to helping people,” he says. “If it hadn’t happened, maybe Borja would have become famous for something else, like its wine. But we wouldn’t be as well known as we are now.” The media phenomenon has not been limited to Borja. In June this year, the overenthusiastic restoration of a 500-year-old statue of St George in a church in Estella, Navarre, elicited comparisons with Tintin, while the treatment meted out to a group of 15th-century wooden statues in Asturias left a professional restorer torn between tears and laughter. Estella’s mayor, Koldo Leoz, says the town has seen an increase in visitor numbers but adds that it predates the St George incident and is down to a concerted effort to restore the old Jewish quarter and attract pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago. Estella, he says, has no plans to capitalise on the botched restoration. “We don’t want to attract visitors because of the poor treatment of our heritage,” he says. “We haven’t publicised it and nor will we.” Ana Galán Pérez, the chair of Spain’s Professional Association of Restorers and Conservators (Acre), argues that such cases show that the country needs to do more to protect the myriad and often forgotten treasures of its past. “We seem to be rather indifferent when it comes to the heritage around us,” she says. “There’s still a long way to go and that’s why we need to educate society and public bodies so that they understand that every time someone without the right qualifications tries to restore a work, they run the risk of damaging or even destroying it.” Galán and others also dispute the notion that Spain is more prone to dodgy conservation than other countries. “When we talk to our colleagues from other European countries, they tell us that these things are happening but that they’re not picked up by the press.” Román Fernández-Baca Casares, director-general of fine arts at Spain’s culture ministry, describes the unfortunate restorations as “isolated cases” and says that almost all the country’s regional governments adhere to strict conservation rules. Giménez has come to terms with both her actions and the fame they have brought her and her town. As the mother of two disabled children, she is used to looking past the surface. When she looks at the Ecce Homo today, she sees “a handsome face; a face that I love”. She also insists that she would do the same thing again. “It was done with good intentions and despite what happened, it’s been a good thing for Borja,” she says. “People from all over the world are visiting the sanctuary now. That’s the best medicine. I used to cry a lot over all this but I don’t cry any more because I can see how much I’m loved.” But Giménez is aware that things could have ended less happily. What advice does she have for other amateur restorers? “Don’t do it. It turned out well in the end here, but it doesn’t always end well in Spain - and you’ll find yourself in the papers.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-12-24",
    "transcript": "With its winding cobbled streets around a stout 13th-century hilltop fortress, the small city of Jajce looks steeped in Bosnia-Herzegovina’s past. But there may be signs here of a new future for the beleaguered country. It was here that the local authorities planned to solidify ethnic divisions that have persisted since the 1992-95 war by creating two separate schools – one for Croats and one for Bosniaks. It was here that students fought back. “We know that divisions are not good, and that we would all lose by this plan,” says Nikolas Rimac, a 17-year-old student. “The way Trump divides America is very, very similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina; he wants to divide the US like Bosnia.” Schools in Bosnia tend to operate under ethnically-defined education systems, with each group being taught a separate syllabus. In many cases there is a “two schools under one roof” system, with, for example, Bosniaks attending a morning shift and Croats an afternoon one. When the plan was unveiled to go a step further and actually create a separate Bosniak school, many felt that it was a political gambit to win nationalist votes – and create jobs for party loyalists. Students from the school started a series of protests, including marches with the flags of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, and a demonstration outside the regional ministry of education. “I believed that we needed to keep a common space,” says Ivica Jukanović, one of the original leaders. “At school we all became family. I want to raise my children in a city that’s normal, and multi-ethnic.” Ju kanović and many of the other pupils and teachers credit the strength of their movement to years of work by the Nansen Dialogue Centre (NDC) Sarajevo, an NGO that works to strengthen inter-ethnic cooperation and communication. Strictly apolitical, the organisation is backed by – but independent from - the Nansen Centre for Peace and Dialogue, based in Lillehammer, Norway. “I truly believe that the protests were very much influenced by Nansen’s work,” says Mirjana Jelica, a teacher. “This may be a drop in the ocean, but if they help just 1% of the population become better people, they have achieved something.” NDC Sarajevo also operates in other towns and cities in the country that were among the most-affected by the war, including Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were massacred, and Bratunac, where dozens of Serb civilians were killed on Orthodox Christmas Day 1993. The organisation’s leaders, such as general manager Ljuljjeta Goranci Brkic, gradually established the trust and confidence of local people through months of work, including many nights staying in people’s houses, and a willingness to engage even hardliners, rather than merely talking to those already receptive to Nansen’s methods. Bosnia remains a society in which ethno-nationalist rhetoric and war memories permeate politics and public discourse. “When Nansen first came here in 2008, we said: ‘What the hell’s mediation?’” says English teacher Mirko Ljubez. “Things were pretty bad. Most parents were involved in the war, and that influences their children’s political beliefs. But meeting people beats prejudices.” Azra Keljalic, a pupil who made television appearances during the campaign to keep the school together, credits the organisation with helping pupils deal with the media, as well as providing space for them to work together and develop new skills. The NDC also organised activities with a school from across Bosnia’s internal border, which lies 11km away from Jajce. “Our kids are pretty open-minded, but don’t have so many opportunities to talk to people from other ethnic groups, or visit other parts of the country,” says Tarik Zjajo, who teaches German and led some of the joint activities. To the north, another Nansen Dialogue Centre, separate but loosely affiliated, operates from Prijedor, a city of 90,000 people in a mining region. Prijedor, a mixed city, saw some of the most vicious ethnic cleansing of the war, with thousands of Bosniaks and Croats killed. While many Bosniaks have returned to Prijedor and the region around, the wounds of war are still visible. One chilly mountain morning, a long crocodile of primary-school children winds up a large concrete staircase through the trees to the grassy summit of Mrakovica, a large meadow with the towering cylindrical Kozara Monument at its centre. Looking something like a modernist interpretation of the Tower of Pisa, it is built to commemorate the dead of an earlier war – the victims of fighting and ethnic cleansing in 1942. The children, local Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats, are attending a regular gathering organised by NDC Prijedor. They participate in group games, romping through the forest, on what is a rare opportunity for many of them to mix in large numbers with counterparts from different ethnic backgrounds. One aim is to develop an understanding of how much the children have in common, while also respecting their differences. “Nobody else is doing this, bringing them together,” says Faris Hasanbegović, mayor of Sanski Most, 30km from Prijedor in the Federation. “Before, it was missing. You have kids from Sanski Most, who have never been to Prijedor. Even if they don’t have a hostile opinion of others, they don’t think about them.” NDC Prijedor has been bringing together community leaders including teachers and politicians, some of whom are otherwise known as hardline nationalists. Rather than lecturing participants on the past, Nansen focused on allowing them to share views and experiences openly. The Nansen Centre for Peace and Dialogue brings mixed groups to Lillehammer every year, providing a remove from the charged political atmosphere of Bosnia. But at first, some of the exchanges were heated. “When we arrived, we had no mandate, no agenda,” says Steinar Bryn, a senior adviser at the Nansen Centre for Peace and Dialogue. “This isn’t The Hague. We invited people to discuss: why did it happen? Why was it so violent? But also it was social and cultural – we just went to watch jazz or basketball, or discussed problems at work.” This may not sound groundbreaking, but in the context of a shattered and embittered postwar Bosnia, it is very significant. Azra Alic-Pasic, a doctor from Prijedor, was forced to sign her property over to the Serb-run municipality before fleeing in a refugee convoy that was then attacked. Both her father and stepfather were killed. She worked for a while in a refugee camp in Croatia before returning after the war to Prijedor, where for a while she was the only Bosniak doctor working in the city. “In 2000, Priejdor was a black hole on the map of Europe because of what had happened,” she says. “I thought I’d never speak a word to a Serb after the war, that I wouldn’t be able to talk to anyone who wasn’t a fellow Bosniak. But NDC supported a space where we could discuss with our counterparts of other ethnicities. We saw that we could live together, we brought people together to become friends, to build bridges. We realised that this is the better way – the only way.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "The roads close to Tower Bridge in London are surprisingly quiet for the Saturday before Christmas, but turn the corner on to Tooley Street and it’s flooded with young people on bikes. Riders throw their front wheels into the air and wheelie their way across the road. Others stand to the side making last-minute fixes to their bikes and paste stickers on their frames that read “Stand up against knife crime”. This is not your typical mass cycle ride. It is BikeStormz, a biannual ride-out during which thousands of people from across the country bring central London to a halt as they ride together in protest against violent crime. “It’s about getting the kids together without fighting,” says the event’s co-founder Mac Ferrari, 35. “Together they can put down the knives, just for the day.” As many as 1,000 people joined the ride on Saturday to promote the message of “Bikes Up, Knives Down”. Since the first BikeStormz ride in 2014, more than 4,000 people – mainly teenagers, but also children as young as nine – have joined to protest against youth violence. The idea is to give young people an alternative to crime through bike riding. In the last four years, the movement has spread to cities across the UK from Birmingham to Liverpool, and to Paris and Amsterdam. The most skilled riders have become celebrities in the community. One of the founders, Jake100, has 100,000 followers on Instagram and a deal with Nike. “These are different kids from different postcodes, but the bike is the glue. It’s the connection between different areas,” Ferrari says. “No one cares where you’re from when you ride. No one cares about the colour of your skin, they just care about riding. The minute the wheel is in the air, it’s a total mind block of anything going on in your life.” The latest event comes at the end of a year during which the number of knife crimes has risen alarmingly. A 20-year-old man was stabbed to death in north London just hours before Saturday’s ride, taking the number of homicides in the capital to 132, the highest annual figure in a decade. Across England and Wales, the number of knife and offensive weapon offences rose to 21,381, its highest level since 2010. For the BikeStormz riders, the reality of knife and gun crime is painfully close to their lives. “I can’t ignore the dangers for young kids around me,” Ferrari says. “Most of these kids know someone who has been stabbed.” Jay Buttigieg, 13, sits on his yellow bike as others practise tricks around him. Wearing a black hoodie and gelled hair, his youthful face masks a sense of sadness. “My dad has been stabbed. It made me really upset, but when I ride I’m enjoying myself. When I’m here I feel safe.” He is here cycling alongside his father, so “it makes the ride even more important”. The BikeStormz community is a lifeline for many riders. “By doing this we’re giving kids another path rather than picking up a knife,” says Czar from west London. The 31-year-old witnessed his mother stabbed at the age of nine. “As a kid I was without direction, but riding helped. BikeStormz has changed a lot of people’s minds. It’s not going to stop knife crime. The mayor says it could take up to 10 years to stop it, but by doing this that 10 years can be cut into five, or even less than that.” Aggressive behaviour and fighting is not tolerated at BikeStormz, but it hasn’t always been perceived that way by outsiders. As part of a growing movement of bike crews that take to the streets stopping traffic and filming tricks to be shown on social media, riders have often been portrayed as “yobs” and regarded as a nuisance by some members of the public. BikeStormz only received official backing from the mayor of London and the Metropolitan police for the first time this year. “When people see everyone riding down the street they think we’re a nuisance or a gang,” says Clark Jones, 23. “But because they don’t know what it’s about, they don’t see the positive.” A spokesperson for Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “The number of violent deaths both in London and across the country is tragic, and events such as Bikestormz can bring together young Londoners and raise awareness that carrying a knife is not the answer. Serious violence devastates communities, and the mayor is taking drastic action to provide the Met with the resources they need to keep Londoners safe, including increasing council tax and committing an additional £95m next year to policing and tackling crime.” As more young riders fill the street, Ferrari climbs on to a wall and shouts over the mass of people. He says this year’s event is especially emotional as he recently lost a friend and fellow BikeStormz rider in a motorcycle accident. “We’re breaking the stereotype every single day. Today there is no beef, no knives, no guns, no robbery. I want you all to be proud of yourselves, no matter what anyone tells you.” The crowd shouts back: “BikeStormz.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/can-folk-music-save-the-honeybee",
    "date": "2018-12-20",
    "transcript": "Folk music has long gone hand in hand with political protest. From Pete Seeger’s 1959 rendition of the African American gospel We Shall Overcome, which became an anthem for the civil rights movement, to Dick Gaughan’s Ballad of ‘84, a clarion call for the Scottish miners’ strike, the combination of one singer and their guitar has had a potent effect on galvanising activists. Now, folk is turning its attention to the bees. Bees are responsible for pollinating around 80% of plantlife in the UK and over a third of crops globally, yet from 1985 to 2005 the number of honeybee colonies in the UK fell by 53% and wild honeybees are now thought to be almost extinct across Britain. This is due to a variety of reasons including climate change, infectious diseases, the use of harmful pesticides, and the reduction of natural habitats. These worrying developments have led some to claim that if the bees become extinct, humanity would only have four years left to survive. The stakes are high and 25-year-old fiddle player Rowan Piggott believes that folk is the answer. “The environmental crisis is one of the biggest issues of my generation,” he says. “All of our political and economic problems pale in comparison, since they tend to go in cycles, whereas we have done irreversible damage with climate change.” A waifish presence in a tweed jacket, Piggott is surprisingly optimistic about the future. “People’s knowledge of the crisis is very general,” he says, “and they often don’t know what they can do to effect a meaningful change, so that’s why I started the Songhive project, to give people chances to get involved with the bees.” Since Piggott’s father is an acclaimed traditional Irish folk musician and his mother is a beekeeper, the project seemed inevitable. Piggott noticed an accumulation of folksongs about the plight of the bees, such as Lau’s 2012 instrumental Save The Bees, and decided to create an online archive to raise awareness. “I thought it’d be a nice way of reminding people that for thousands of years we’ve had a healthy respect for bees as part of our life-cycle and now that people are more distanced from the process of producing food, we have forgotten that and bees have become a mild annoyance,” he says. With the archive up and running and the folk community responding, Piggott decided to up the ante. “I always had the idea for making a record,” he says, “although I initially thought it would be a compilation of already-recorded music from the archive.” Due to costly licensing fees, the record became a collection of 11 songs written and recorded especially for the project. Piggott invested £1,000 of his own money and raised a £2,000 grant from the English folk dance and song society to print the finished CDs. Featuring Piggott himself and some of the British folk scene’s young stars, such as Rosie Hodgson and Georgia Lewis, as well as more established acts such as singer Nancy Kerr and songwriter Nick Burbridge, the album combines traditional folk instrumentation with bee-themed lyrics in the service of this environmental cause. Even the bees themselves are almost present, as their buzz is imitated by a shruti drone on Burbidge’s Queen’s Dream of Lost Fields, while Kerr’s Dark Honey addresses the production of honey from the sugary remnants of discarded Coke cans. Since the CD was released in March, half of its 1,000 copies has been sold, raising £5,000 for a Friends of the Earth campaign, the Bee Cause. Piggott has also been encouraging his audience to learn and perform bee folksongs from the archive and sign petitions. One such petition, to ban the use of the harmful insecticide neonicotinoid, was successful and passed the EU in April. “The response has been great,” he enthuses, “all ages have gotten involved. The older fans buy the record and the younger ones are active in spreading the message.” Rosie Hodgson, 26, contributed two compositions to Songhive and believes folk is the perfect vehicle for the environmental message. “Folk music was mostly created and performed by those who were in positions of vulnerability,” she says, “injustice is a common theme and it harnesses the power of a personal story, so one well-placed tale will inspire sympathy for a cause in a way that talking about the cause as a whole will not. There’s a magic that binds people when they sing together, especially in times of hardship.” Another contributor, Nancy Kerr, has made environmental awareness an integral part of her writing in recent years, with her last album, Instar, comprising folksongs about nature and conservation. For Kerr, born to a family of traditional musicians involved in protest music, folk is an activist’s genre. “The act of relating a narrative that stems from the experiences of disenfranchised people is an act of protest,” she says, “and that makes me view folk music as intrinsically political.” With CD stock expecting to be sold out by the end of the year, Piggott is looking towards a second album, perhaps widening the scope beyond the bees. “It’s not just bees, it’s other pollinators like butterflies that are in danger – everything’s in trouble,” he says. For now, though, he is planning a Songhive tour with Rosie Hodgson and some of Songhive’s other musicians. They are currently booking venues that have links to conservation, even hoping to serenade the bees in a wildflower meadow. “Bees are the perfect species to drive meaningful action because we feel so positively towards them. They are a linchpin species,” Hodgson says. For Piggott, the bees are a vehicle for optimistic action and a means for folk to be refocused to its political roots. “Folk music here isn’t the people’s music anymore,” he says, “it’s become commercialised and the general public don’t know what it should sound like. This project is about tapping back into that heritage and aiming it towards a cause that people can actively change right now, today.”",

    "date": "2018-12-19",
    "transcript": "“I’ve been falling for years,” writes the Canadian author Katie Inglis in her memoir about grief and the death of her baby son, “scrambling up again, sorting out in fits and spurts, freshly sorted reasonings collapsing in on themselves to make space for new wrack”. The sense of loss she chronicles is both past and present. Grief is a continuum, recovering is continuous, with no identifiable moment of arrival. Is there ever? Elusive, intangible, magical, recovery is, at best, something to be hoped for, though not necessarily to be believed in. After all, you can’t see your recovery, you can’t touch it, as you can a healing wound. Recovery suggests that you can get back to where you were before, which is to say, back to your old self, your well self, your whole, unwounded self. As such, it is a dark word, as well as a magical one. It is the mythical tree in the fairytale forest that has the power to protect you, or crush you. Recovery is teamed with the verb “to recover”, and to recover means to retrieve your former self, to find what you have lost. But with recovery, you cannot go back. Instead, you need to let go of your old self or your old way of living, and to accept who, and what, you have become, and to live differently. To recover, you need to be able to see a future with you in it, you just as you are, however changed, damaged, flawed or fearful. This is what recovery looks like, and another word for it is hope. As well as hope, you need resilience because, as all the people I have spoken to have said again and again, you’re still on your own, and because the thing that took you down might come back. In order to understand how someone recovers – and the people I talked to are in recovery from alcoholism, cancer, loneliness, depression, penury and abuse – it is necessary to see what each has lost. For loss, along with an acute sense of isolation, is what takes each of them down. A sense of connection with others is what saves them. It is the key to being in recovery. Addiction Julie Powell, 58, never consciously swapped her family for alcohol. A sociable mother-of-two, she was brought up in a pub with a functioning alcoholic for a mother. She and her husband, Colin, a doctor, had a vibrant, party-filled social life themselves that “revolved around alcohol”. But when Colin secured a job in Australia in 1993, she had to give all that up. But the shock of being in an unfamiliar culture with no support network left her stranded, lonely and isolated. Having a husband and sons “wasn’t enough”, she recalls. “You have no history when you emigrate.” For the next six years, she numbed her acute homesickness with alcohol. “In the morning, I’d put the kettle on, get the milk from the fridge and have a swig of wine. Do another job. Have another swig. When it was an acceptable time to have a drink, I’d put the wine in a glass.” Acute homesickness has similar debilitating symptoms to depression. Panic attacks, grief, loss of motivation, and social withdrawal all dogged Powell, but anger, directed at her husband, was the only emotion she recognised. Her marriage unravelled. “I thought, do I stay for the sake of my husband’s job, or say what I want to say, which is: I can’t do this any more.” Her “very loving” husband agreed to return to the UK, but Powell, instead of reintegrating, became a carer to both her parents while struggling with a behaviourally challenging teenage son. Her sense of isolation intensified, and her self-esteem plummeted further. “The only thing that was there 24 hours a day when I needed it was alcohol. It became my partner. I didn’t know how to stop. I’d vomit up the wine, and have another drink straight away.” Then came the crisis point. “Vomiting blood,” she says, “was the start of my recovery. I thought, I don’t want to die like this, you know. I can’t have my children knowing that I died through doing something to myself.” A nurse told her about the Living Room, an addiction recovery centre in Cardiff. The empathy shown by her Living Room counsellor, a recovering alcoholic and “the most compassionate person ever”, was the next step in her recovery. “I was talking to someone who understood the hopelessness of my situation.” Attending group therapy corroborated this empowering sense of connection. “There was just this glimmer of hope, that yes, I can do this. I suddenly thought, I want what they’ve got.” Powell says her recovery isn’t over yet. “It is a process. You are never cured of this. The people who relapse tend to be the people who get complacent.” She attends regular group therapy and now volunteers as a receptionist one day a week for the Living Room. “For me, it is very important to connect with other people in recovery. It is a reminder that I still have to work at it. “To me, recovery means hope. It’s re-establishing my identity, a positive identity, and having meaning to my life – and taking responsibility for it.” Mental illness As an introverted only child, Jaabir Ramlugon saw his father as the centre of his universe. “We were always very close. I really looked up to him. My dad’s side of the family is Hindu. My dad converted to Islam when he met my mother, so they disowned him.” Ramlugon’s parents moved to north London, from Mauritius in 1981. Ramlugon was bullied at school, and it made him believe that he was not good enough. When he was 13, his father died. “I went back to school in the September and I was just very vulnerable, still in shock. My vulnerability must have been picked up. I became even more reserved, and I was singled out even more. “That’s when I started to feel suicidal.” A year after his father’s death, Ramlugon cracked: “I just want to kill myself, I screamed at my mum.” He was sent to a psychotherapist and put in a special unit at school for pupils with behavioural issues. “Most of my bullies were in there: I was closer to them than before.” By the time he was an adult, Ramlugon had become convinced he brought the suffering on himself. “I have an internal bully now,” he says. “I felt under attack, even though I was trying to work as hard as I could. My depressive episodes started getting more intense. I cried on my way to work.” Being passed over for a promotion in 2014 was, says Ramlugon, “the straw that broke the camel’s back”. The following Saturday, he attempted suicide. “I chatted to my friends so they wouldn’t suspect anything and then I drove to Beachy Head.” He was on the cliff edge, ready to jump when he heard a man’s voice behind him. “Please step away from the edge,” he said. “I just need to talk to you.” It was the expression of concern Ramlugon had been waiting for. “I thought, someone wants to talk to me,” says Ramlugon. “The spell was broken.” Ultimately he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. He did therapy, but has since settled on human connection and nature as his lifebuoys. He reaches out to fellow mental health sufferers via Elefriends, the mental health charity Mind’s online support forum, and is now in a relationship with someone he met via a mental health dating website. He also leads one of Mind’s walking support groups. “Socialising is very therapeutic,” says Ramlugon, “and trees, birds, rivers, they are a distraction for me. The connection with nature just feels good, so does the act of walking and talking, having a laugh and a joke. “My anger has gone. It’s strange. I almost try to empathise with my bullies. They were probably in a really bad place and what they did to me was their only way of coping. It doesn’t make it OK.” For him, recovery hinges on letting go of the past. “It doesn’t own me or define me. It has for a long time, but I am in a place where it doesn’t any longer. Talking about it reduces my own shame; it is empowering. “I say to my younger self, ‘There is nothing wrong with you. Nothing that happened to you is your fault.’ “I am proud to use the word recovery. I don’t see darkness all the time, and I have hope. Sometimes I am able to enjoy my life, and that’s a feeling I have not had since my father passed.” Bereavement When former RAF navigator John Hyde, 85, from Cambridgeshire, was growing up in south London in the 1930s, his father tuned into dance band star Victor Silvester on the radio and taught his sisters ballroom dancing. The young Hyde watched on. Some 70 years later, dancing would rescue him from acute loneliness following the sudden death of his wife on the eve of his 80th birthday in 2013. Hyde met Joan at an RAF flying course when he was 21. A year later, they married. Almost 60 years of marriage ensued, three children and a proper air force family life, sociable and lively. Retirement and civilian life came as a shock – “we met lots of people who wouldn’t invite you into their home” – and the sociable John and Joan gradually withdrew. “We had each other. We did most things together. We went shopping together, visiting the family together, weekends away together.” Three days before his 80th birthday, the couple picked up Hyde’s birthday cake – “Joan was so excited about it. It had a model of the Victor aircraft I once flew on.” They went out for lunch and as Joan reached for the dessert menu, she had a stroke. She died later that evening. Hyde’s family offered to stay with their father in the short term but, after 40 years in the RAF navigating in Canberras, Valiants and Victors, steeliness and self-reliance were part of his makeup. “I knew that I had to get over it myself. I said: ‘No one can cure the way I feel at the moment. Only I can do that.’” But he had not bargained for how the shock of his wife’s passing would manifest itself, and how the grief and the loneliness would play tricks on him. “I couldn’t remember her, my mind shut off, my body shut down. It was as if they were protecting me by saying, we are going to shut her out of your life now.” For the next months, Hyde says he existed in a vacuum. “Sometimes I’d stand in the kitchen, crying. It sounds crazy for a man of my age. I lost a lot of weight. I wasn’t eating properly. I’d make something and not fancy it. Joan and I used to take it in turns to cook. “The bed seemed big and empty. I’d get up and go into the kitchen, and say to her, shall I put the kettle on? Men can’t do loneliness,” he says. Then one day, 18 months after his wife’s death, Hyde thought: “I’ve got to do something because, well, you either go under or you survive.” He accepted an invitation to a dance class at the University of the Third Age (U3A). “Dancing again was the start of my recovery,” says Hyde, who was then further persuaded to take up an art class and singing at U3A. He now sings for two hours a week in a choir of fellow pensioners and they perform hits from musicals in a residential home. Gigi and Oklahoma are among his favourites. He is naturally outgoing, and he likes people. He has connected to his old self, even going for a flying lesson, but his recovery has come at a price. “I feel guilty because I am doing things that, had Joan been alive, I never would have done. I think, it’s not fair. If Joan came back tomorrow, I would give it all up.” He still finds himself talking to his late wife. “Sometimes I come in and I almost say: ‘I’m home.’ That’s when you expect to see her, and she’s not there.” For Hyde, being busy and having connections and commitments to others has given him a sense of purpose. He is now an ambassador for the charity Campaign to End Loneliness, and has recently started up a men’s dining club in the village. “We go to the pub and have a coke, about 10 of us. I think we should be able to talk about being on our own, about finding it hard. We should be able to help each other. The trouble is, the men who have joined are the outgoing ones; it’s the ones that haven’t you’ve got to get to.” Cancer Amy Carr has always pushed herself to her physical limits. “I was doing Olympic weightlifting at 15. Being a goalkeeper is all about power and speed, but I wanted to be endurance fit.” By the time she graduated in sports and fitness from Northern Illinois University as an overseas student in 2014, former goalkeeper Carr had played in the Fifa U17 Women’s World Cup in New Zealand in 2008 and played for Il Sandviken, Norway’s women’s squad. She decided to retrain as an American universities women’s football coach, securing a place on a graduate assistant football coaching programme at Hastings College, Nebraska, starting in 2015. But in February 2015 she had a seizure. An MRI scan revealed she had a benign brain tumour. She was 23. Pre-op surgery revealed a glioblastama, an invasive malignant tumour that affects the central nervous system. The surgery was delayed until July 2015. “I had to tell Nebraska I wasn’t coming. I was devastated.” Carr, who lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, trained hard for her 10-hour surgery. “They told me I was going to be paralysed, and it could last six months or it could be forever. I was awake at one stage during the surgery, for just a few seconds, and I heard the nurse say: “She’s not doing too good.” “When I woke up, I was paralysed down my right side. I couldn’t speak for eight days. My first movement was in my hand. It was probably the best feeling ever,” she says. “I took my first steps on day nine. I went home on day 12 and on day 13 my mum helped me on to my stationary road bike in my lounge. “I can’t go back to my training in the US now. I don’t know how I would get health insurance or travel insurance. I like to plan months and months in advance; I don’t like the unexpected. I’ve had to let go of everything I had planned.” But she still exercises intensively. “Today I am still not in control of the cancer – I exercise so much because I like to be in control. I would happily say I am addicted to exercise. Even if I am behind a desk, I sit on a Swiss ball; it is kind of an obsession.” This year she ran a marathon and is training for a triathlon. “The doctors told me not to do open-water swimming. I will prove them wrong, and prove to myself that I am fine.” Carr longs to recover her pre-cancer self or rather, a new one that is not defined by cancer. “I don’t know when it will stop being in my life. My doctors say I am technically cancer-free, but that I will have to go back for six-monthly tests for the rest of my life. I am always going to have this cloud over me. I am trying to live with it. “If recovery means being fitter than anyone else I train with and know, then yes, I am recovered, but mentally I don’t know if I have. There are two mes now, two extremes: upbeat me, and downer me. Cancer-me is not very sociable. If I’ve been on my own for a while, I slip into isolated, lonely me. I’m not very nice. I’m angry, frustrated. Cancer-me can appear anywhere. I will hide it for a while, and then I’ll take myself off – either to the gym or I’ll go to bed, depending on the time. The thoughts start swirling and go negative. Be sociable, Amy. Why are you on your own? I am disappointed in myself, annoyed. “I can’t say I’m not OK because I’ve just survived cancer, and how many people can say that? “People say, look at you, you’re strong, you’re fit, you’re healthy. I’ve got a good shape, but inside isn’t so great, inside I am not really healthy.” Carr now has a cancer rehab qualification and is working with people who have just been diagnosed or are in recovery. “Helping them helps me,” she says. Carr has written a book about her experiences, The Scars No One Sees: A professional footballer’s life changes when diagnosed with a brain tumour. “I want to get rid of that stigma surrounding recovery. I don’t even know what it means to be recovered. I don’t think you can be fully recovered, ever. Can you?” Debt For Pete Moss, the debt and depression that would one day drive him to a suicide attempt were linked to a series of changes in his employment status. Over four decades, he went from being an employee of British Rail, BA and Cunard Line to being on the minimum wage and then zero-hours contracts for various call centres. Along the way, Moss was passed over for promotion, suffered job losses and once was told he could keep his job but with an increased workload on the same pay, a proposition he rejected. It felt like a degradation, says Moss, from Solihull, West Midlands. “I felt worthless.” He said: “I’d always held down good, well-paid jobs, but I always spent more than I earned.” Credit cards bought holidays, clothes for his sons, and alcohol. “I got drunk every single night.” His Sunderland house fell into negative equity and, following his legal separation in 1999, his wife had custody of their two sons. He quickly became isolated. On sick leave for anxiety and depression from a call centre, he lived “in fear of bailiffs at the door”. If he wasn’t working, he watched TV all day and, every evening, spent five or six hours on Facebook. He had two contacts with the outside world: a weekly coffee morning and, on a Friday, a community dinner plus a choir group provided by his housing association. “I was outgoing, gregarious. No one knew how lonely I was. I felt like a prisoner in my own flat. I thought I would be better off dead – even though I’ve got two beautiful grandkids.” Moss had had cognitive behavioural therapy, which teaches techniques for managing destructive thought patterns, following a breakdown in 2012. “But when I was isolated, the last thing I was able to do was to turn negative things into positives,” says Moss. “Everything was black. I had no hope. “I thought, I can’t bear this any more. I haven’t been a good grandad, I don’t feel worthy of being a grandad. I’ve never been able to buy them anything, not even on their birthdays and Christmas. It doesn’t make it easier, when you see other kids getting lovely gifts from their grandparents.” In February 2016 he attempted to take his own life. “I thought, to hell with it. This is it.” The first step in his recovery was talking to a counsellor at the debt counselling charity Christians Against Poverty (CAP). “They showed me it would take me 16 years to repay my £11,500 debts.” On CAP’s advice, Moss took out a debt relief order. “It was a weight off my shoulders. Somebody cared. “My zero-hours contract dried up. I now haven’t worked since November 2016. But I started volunteering for CAP, visiting people who have been where I’ve been. I’ve found some value, and I’ve broadened my social horizons and started going for walks, too. “I was doing something other than being inside four walls. Interacting with others, outside of the flat – that was the big thing – and people from CAP visited me. ” CAP has taught him how to budget. “I live off £385 a month, and I live within my means. It’s difficult. I struggle every month. I was paid four days ago and I’m skint. “I’ve started to learn to put money aside – I’m saving to see the grandkids – and I’ve got a full cupboard of food for a month.” He has not managed to buy the grandchildren any presents yet. “My son says my company is the gift.” • Genevieve Fox is the author of Milkshakes and Morphine: A Memoir of Love and Life",

    "transcript": "Swedes will this week be treated to a new sight: a Swedish MP giving a speech in a hijab. Leila Ali Elmi, who arrived in the country aged two after her family fled civil war in Somalia, will make her parliamentary debut after winning a surprise victory in this autumn’s polls, promising a voice for people targeted by the groundswell of hostility to immigration. “My getting elected has caused a lot of reactions from the racists,” she says in the Green party offices in Stockholm. “They weren’t really ready for it, but here I am.” Ali Elmi, 30, represents the other side of an election that was dominated by the issue of immigration and had an increase in the far-right vote. She fought on the issues closest to residents of Angered, the disadvantaged, immigrant suburb that has been her home for the past 28 years – unemployment, overcrowding, exclusion and segregation. “The only people who were not surprised at my election victory are those who know that the suburb needs a voice. I speak for the suburb, not about it or to it,” she says. “If you have not lived there or spent a day in those people’s shoes, you cannot represent them.” Ethnic segregation in Sweden’s suburbs drew international attention in early 2013 when young people rioted in northern Stockholm, torching cars and schools and fighting with police. They said they were angry at police racism and felt like second-class citizens despite having been born in the country. There have been flare-ups since, most recently when masked youths armed with molotov cocktails set 80 cars ablaze in a Gothenburg suburb. Problems with gangs, shootings and even grenade attacks have led some politicians to claim the suburbs are ungovernable no-go zones. The far-right Sweden Democrats have been effective in linking these problems with immigration. The party won 17% of the vote in September’s poll, up from 12% in 2014, but not enough to push the Conservatives down to third place as had widely been expected. The party has also shifted the political mainstream to the right. Sweden has moved a long way from the years leading up to 2016 when it welcomed 370,000 asylum seekers – by far the largest number relative to population of any European country. For Ali Elmi, the issue is not immigration but rather the conditions in which most people with immigrant backgrounds live. “The Sweden Democrats say everything that is going wrong here is because of the immigrants, because Sweden is bringing too many people into the country, but this is a fiction. It is not true,” she says. “I am trying to say instead that this is a national issue. People don’t have jobs and they live in segregated areas, which puts them even further from becoming part of the society. People feel dignity when they feel part of something bigger. Criminality is due to social exclusion … we need more equality in this country, harder laws against discrimination and racism.” It is too soon to say precisely who voted for Ali Elmi, according to Jonas Hinnfors, a professor of politics at Gothenburg University. But the election of a young, liberal Muslim points to fundamental changes. “There is something stirring out there, a new trend,” he says. “She did not play the immigrant card. It was not: ‘We Muslims must stick together.’ Instead it was schools, segregation, jobs – all the issues that are important to people who live in the suburbs. And because she comes from there, Ali Elmi also embodies what she is talking about. That is unusual.” Ali Elmi worked as an interpreter, helping newly arrived immigrants and refugees to navigate the administrative process. Before her election to parliament, she was a city councillor for the Greens, campaigning on the party’s broad agenda of social and sexual equality, feminism and climate change. Her political inspiration is Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to the US Congress. Ali Elmi’s speech comes in the week that Sweden marks 100 years since its parliament voted for women’s suffrage. “I addressed all Gothenburgers who share my values and those of the Green party,” she says. “My election gives hope to people who recognise themselves in me, whether they are black, female, Jewish, Muslims or young people.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "The first night Sofia spent in a Dublin hostel, she was petrified. “You walk through this pathway surrounded by metal, like a jail, and then you’re in a warehouse with people staring at you like a pack of wolves.” Sofia ended up homeless more than two years ago, at the age of 30, after a relationship broke down. “I was in hospital for a month for my mental health after that breakup and when I left I’d nowhere to live,” she says. “Once you’re in a cycle you get stuck and I developed a very bad drinking problem.” The number of homeless people in Ireland has doubled in four years, reaching 5,000 in Dublin alone. Their physical and mental health is fragile. Life expectancy for homeless women in Dublin is 38. For men, it is 42. These challenges seem insurmountable. But Dr Clíona Ní Cheallaigh thinks otherwise. For her, a solution is to be found in a more joined-up medical approach designed to stop marginalised individuals bouncing around between hospitals and the streets with no single service “owning” their care. Ní Cheallaigh, who is a hospital consultant, heads up a service for socially excluded groups, including homeless people. The programme she has established at St James’s hospital is unique. And it looks like it is working. She has always had a strong sense of social justice. Both sets of her grandparents grew up in inner-city Dublin tenements. But the idea of this service grew during her training in HIV medicine. “If you take HIV tablets daily and come to clinic twice a year, you’ll have a normal life expectancy,” she says. “Yet there was a small cohort in their early 30s who just wouldn’t do either.” By the end of her first year all those patients were dead. There were practical reasons for missing appointments. They could not afford taxis, or had no family to bring them. Ní Cheallaigh set about rethinking how to do care for people are socially excluded. “You set up drop-in services, have people remind them to come, pay for taxis.” Then they can stay well, have relationships, look after their kids. The alternative: watch them die young. It is part of a broader approach called inclusion health which addresses health and social inequities among the most vulnerable and excluded (homeless people, individuals with severe mental health issues, drug users and prisoners, for example). Its foundation lies in the integration of health and social services. St James’s has the first hospital-led inclusion health team in the world. This is important because homeless people are five times more likely to attend A&amp;E but up to 40% leave without being seen. They are 3.2 times more likely to become inpatients with longer stays and more readmissions. When homeless patients arrive to A&amp;E, they are flagged up on the system so Ní Cheallaigh and her team are aware. These patients get pyjamas, socks, underwear, toothpaste and a toothbrush if they wish. “If you’re feeling shamed [about being unkempt], you’ll try to reassert status or you’ll leave.” Every one of these medical patients goes under her care. But care must go beyond patching people up and returning them to the streets. Further down the chain, a homeless and drugs charity by the river brings Ní Cheallaigh together with social workers, nurses, psychiatrists, accommodation providers, addiction workers, and GPs once a week. Here, a housing officer talks through options for Sofia. A keyworker has found a missing patient. The ideal is to prevent medical complications and indeed homelessness, but rough sleepers often flit between hospitals; without this meeting, they might fall through the gaps entirely. Ní Cheallaigh heads to her next stop of the day. “Funnily enough, it’s the old tradition of medicine,” says Dermot Murphy, who is a senior services manager for DePaul at Sundial House, a long-term accommodation unit for chronic street drinkers. “Bring the doctor to the patient, not the patient to the doctor.” This approach is distinctive, Murphy believes. “Being consultant-led – it gives a sense of gravitas and strength that’s changing the hospital’s focus. It couldn’t be done if it was GP-led because it’s a silo, that place. Beyond the hospital doors, you’re on their grounds.” Christy, 60, has benefited from the coordination of care. “Heart attacks, brain clots, fractured legs, a broken back. You name it, I’ve had it,” he recalls. Now, his nurse has a direct dial to the inclusion health team. His health issues have abated. He has stopped drinking. “I’ve an exercise bike and I do my best with that. I’m trying to lose the belly. I’ve cut down on the biscuits and chocolate. Maybe someday I’ll move out but not now. I’ve a beautiful life here.” One argument is that these patients are getting special treatment. But that’s the point. “NHS trusts, they’re like here – large entities of bureaucracy that are meant to work with the mean,” says Murphy. “We’re saying there are a significant number of outliers whose needs can’t be met with this traditional model. Asking someone with a chronic heroin or alcohol addiction to attend an appointment at a specific time is slightly ludicrous.” He adds: “Working with a consultant who is willing to walk out of the hospital and go ‘this man absolutely needs an appointment and I’ll make myself available when you can get them to the hospital’ – that’s the difference between saving that person’s life and that person dying.” Ní Cheallaigh’s service saved almost €1m (£904,000) in direct costs to the hospital and 3,066 bed days in a year-long pilot study. Yet finance for the service remains uncertain, with no promise of extension beyond a two-year funding round. Back at St James’s, Sofia recounts a previous visit to another hospital. “They left me sat in the waiting room, vomiting in front of people. They discharged me at 2am, a female on my own.” But St James’s was different. ‘The two times I’ve come here before, they’ve brought me straight through. I didn’t feel judged.” Since her latest hospital admission,she has detoxed fully and is being discharged to a residential recovery unit. The inclusion health team will keep tabs on her. “I’m going to get my life back,” she says. “I’m shocked I’ve lost everything the way I have but in my head if you’ve had it once you can have it again.” Her hospital team here looked beyond a bed for the night. And with that, they might just have given Sofia a new beginning. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "date": "2018-12-11",
    "transcript": "Like many urban Colombians, Nicolás Sánchez – a young journalist from the country’s capital, Bogotá – never saw the country’s civil war firsthand. Instead, he grew up watching it from afar, in television reports of massacres and gun battles deep in the countryside. Reporters would often only show the point of view of the military – the only group who could regularly grant them access to the battlefield. Rural Colombians, who bore the brunt of conflict, were often ignored; coverage instead focused on urban incidents such as kidnappings of public figures and attacks against government buildings. Media would also turn a blind eye to military atrocities. When members of the army in 2002 began abducting and murdering civilians in an effort to boost their body counts, it went largely unreported for six years. A peace deal signed with the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc) rebel group in late 2016 formally ended 52 years of bitter war that left 260,000 dead and more than 7 million displaced. But unrest continues, as other armed groups seek to muscle in on former Farc territory. Now, a project is seeking to change how the conflict is covered, taking reporters to far-flung corners of the country, and giving a voice to those caught in the crossfire. Colombia 2020, launched in early 2016 with funding from the European Union, aims not only to report on the transition from war to peace, but to educate a nation on what led its citizens to kill each other for generations. “It’s easy to think that Colombia is like a gringo movie with good guys and bad guys – that every guerrilla is a monster in the jungle,” Sánchez said in the newsroom of El Espectador, the country’s oldest newspaper. “But Colombia is a country where war is a way of life for children … we have ask ourselves, why is that the case?” As the scars of war are revealed in tribunals, Sánchez and his colleagues are documenting the successes and failures of the peace process – and shedding light on a conflict that was often far from the consciousness of many Colombians. “We can’t cover it all from the capital,” said Sánchez. “We have to go and talk to the people living there because if we don’t understand the dynamics of the war, we can’t get rid of the dynamics of war.” Reporting in Colombia still carries risks. Sánchez recently had to cancel a trip to Catatumbo, a lawless region on the border with Venezuela currently disputed by two smaller rebel groups, after local sources advised it would be too dangerous. Earlier, he had to run from a shootout that broke out in Tumaco, a Pacific coast city rife with drug traffickers. Gloria Castrillón, the project’s head, previously spent decades covering the war’s brutality. “I’ve seen the aftermath of massacres, heard the survivors speak of how they were abused and raped … while we journalists were smeared as being allied with the rebels,” she said. One of Colombia 2020’s goals has been to change the language used to report conflict, Castrillón said. “During the war, we would only have access to remote regions if we travelled with the military, and of course that would skew our perspective, down to the words we used to describe skirmishes and combatants,” she said. Colombia’s mainstream media would often downplay massacres carried out by state-aligned paramilitaries, referring to them simply as “murders”, she said. Another challenge has been building trust with local sources who have long been suspicious of major media companies in Colombia. “Building those links with people out in the field has been our biggest challenge,” said Natalia Herrera, the platform’s content editor. “But it’s also one of the things we are most proud of: giving a voice to these people.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "A group of progressive Europeans led by the economist and author Thomas Piketty has drawn up a bold new blueprint for a fairer Europe to address the division, disenchantment, inequality and rightwing populism sweeping the continent. The plan, crafted by more than 50 economists, historians and former politicians from half a dozen countries, includes huge levies on multinationals, millionaires and carbon emissions to generate funds to tackle the most urgent issues of the day, including poverty, migration, climate change and the EU’s so-called democratic deficit. Published as the British parliament is set for a climactic Brexit vote, the “manifesto for the democratisation of Europe” says EU institutions are stuck in “a technocratic impasse” that benefits the rich. “Following Brexit and the election of anti-European governments at the head of several member countries, it is no longer possible to continue as before,” says the document. “We cannot simply wait for the next departures or further dismantling without making fundamental changes to present-day Europe.” The move underlines the gulf between the preoccupations of the UK and those across the Channel. While the UK is consumed by its tortuous EU exit process, Europe’s pro-EU political forces are concerned with avoiding losses to anti-European populists in next May’s European elections. The left-leaning authors criticise movements dedicated to “hunting down foreigners and refugees”, but also parties espousing what they call “hardcore liberalism and the spread of competition to all”. Signatories include Italy’s former prime minister Massimo D’Alema and the Belgian political scientist and socialist mayor of Charleroi, Paul Magnette. Michael Jacobs, who advised the UK’s former prime minister Gordon Brown, is also a signatory. At the heart of the manifesto is a call for a European assembly that would have a budget of up to €800bn a year, financed by taxing corporate profits more effectively, as well as income and wealth. The EU has been accused of failing to address the manifest unfairness of huge multinationals such as Apple, Google and Amazon channeling profits through member states where taxes are lowest. The budget would be worth 4% of the EU’s GDP – four times the current budget. Funds would be raised from four sources: an extra 15% levy on corporate profits, tax increases on individuals earning more than €100,000, a wealth tax on personal fortunes above €1m, and a tax on carbon emissions. Half of the proceeds would be returned to member state governments. A quarter would go to research, innovation and education. A fund to better manage migration and a fund to make agriculture and industry greener would also benefit. Insisting they do not want a “transfer payments Europe”, countries would see only a 0.1% difference in what they collect and get in return – a big difference from proposals for a eurozone budget that many economists see as a long-term necessity for the 19-country bloc. The money would be overseen by a new European assembly consisting mostly of national politicians and some MEPs. While the assembly would be in touch with EU institutions, it would sit outside EU treaties and have the final word on spending. The public are invited to comment and improve the proposals, which the authors said were “not perfect, but … do have the merit of existing”. Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel thinktank, who did not sign the letter, questioned the need for a continent-wide project. “If the cross-border transfer element is only 0.1%, why do the whole thing at EU level?” he asked. “Anything we would do at the euro-area level would mean doing something less at the national level and that is politically why it doesn’t happen,” he said, pointing to failed attempts to create pan-European national insurance schemes. Richard Corbett, Labour’s leader in the European parliament, said the manifesto appeared to reinvent the wheel. “Instead of using the already existing EU budget and the already existing directly-elected Parliament, and building upon them, it suggests that the member states of the EU would all agree to set up a brand new hybrid Parliament and give it a budget in which it alone would decide on spending four times the size of the existing budget. They’d do better to lend their support to proposals that can actually be achieved.” There have been a series of failed and faltering attempts at voluntary collaboration on economic policy. After the French president, Emmanuel Macron, came to power on a mandate of “a Europe that protects”, Paris and Berlin renewed their vows on Franco-German cooperation, opening talks on corporate tax harmonisation as well as a common position on an EU digital tax. With Angela Merkel hamstrung by coalition difficulties and in the twilight of her time as German chancellor, the agenda has stuttered, causing frustration in Paris. The limits of voluntary cooperation were also exposed in Europe’s search for a financial transaction tax. In 2014 a coalition of 10 willing EU member states embarked on plans for the so-called Robin Hood tax on shares and derivatives, but five years later that agreement remains elusive and some countries have dropped out. Meanwhile, European diplomats bemoan the lack of leadership from capitals that hampers the EU reform agenda, from strengthening the eurozone to overhauling asylum policy. Wolff said the eurozone debate had been “basically stuck” for at least five years. “It remains very, very small steps if at all. We will see only a change when the next big crisis happens; then decisions will be taken. But in the absence of a serious crisis, there is no leadership across Europe to agree.” • The manifesto is published by the Guardian, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, La Vanguardia, Gazeta Wyborcza, La Repubblica and Politiken • This article was amended on 10 December 2018. Pablo Iglesias was an initial signatory to the manifesto but later withdrew.",

    "transcript": "Two decades ago, Canada’s westernmost province was in the midst of environmental and economic calamity. A small beetle was devouring large swathes of the region’s valuable pine forests, leaving millions of trees dead as infestation spread. The government waited anxiously for cold winters – which would kill the beetles – but year after year the cold never came. By 2008 the decimation of the forests, along with a series of intense storms walloping the province, prompted British Columbia to take action on climate change. The provincial government introduced a carbon tax, putting a price on fossil fuel emissions. And, crucially, all the money raised was returned to the people in tax cuts. “It was groundbreaking,” said Karen Tam Wu of the Pembina Institute, an environmental thinktank. “It was the first one in the world that was revenue neutral.” A decade later, as climate scientists and policymakers converge on UN talks in Katowice, Poland, urgently seek mechanisms to rein in carbon emissions in a bid to halt the inexorable rise of global temperatures, the British Columbia experiment with the tax is setting an example to others. Economists and environmentalists have voiced support for it; the World Bank has called it a “textbook” way of developing environmental policy. Earlier in October, the economist William Nordhaus, winner of this year’s Nobel Prize for economics, threw his support behind the British Columbia model as an ideal model for export to other economies. British Columbia is a province known for its environmental lean: yoga and hiking are the region’s main cultural exports. For many Canadians, it seems fitting that the continent’s most progressive carbon tax would originate amid mountains, surf and forest. But the man who helped to usher it in, the former premier Gordon Campbell, rejects the notion that love for the environment is unique to the region. “If you talk to people in rural communities, in urban communities, in Ontario or Alberta, and they all care about the environment,” Campbell told the Guardian. “They all want to go to pristine places.” Troubled by the compounding effects of climate change he saw both at home and abroad, Campbell and his government believed a carbon tax represented the most effective way to address the problem – and it wasn’t a time to point fingers. “Are we willing to do something to try to stop [climate change] from taking place, to slow it down?” he said. “Even for people who say: ‘It wouldn’t matter, Canada could have all of the emissions in the world and it wouldn’t make any difference.’ That’s not the point. We should do our bit.” The carbon tax isn’t anything new. The world’s best known carbon tax to carry that name began in the European Union in 2005, with the Emissions Trading System. With initial success the price of pollution permits reached more than €20 ($22/£18) for the right to emit a ton of carbon. But heavy lobbying by industry led to a massive oversupply of permits and a price crash to €3 in 2013 – far too low to drive carbon cuts. Reforms have taken the price back above €20 in recent weeks. China has seen the attraction of carbon markets as an efficient way of delivering the biggest carbon cuts at the lowest cost. Its carbon market is being established and will, on completion, be the world’s biggest. In the world’s second biggest polluter, the US, 10 east coast states have had a “cap and trade” system for carbon emissions since 2009, under which companies have their greenhouse gas emissions capped and then must trade any surplus or deficit with others. But Barack Obama, while president, was unable to pass a nationwide system. Some prominent Republicans have backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax, but with little success. Many fossil fuel companies claim to back carbon taxes, notably in Australia, where climate policy rows have toppled prime ministers. The oil giant BP is among the supporters of carbon taxes, yet recently spent $13m (£10.22m) in helping to defeat a proposal in Washington state. In the rest of Canada, despite the success story in British Columbia, other provinces are dragging their heels. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has legislated to impose a carbon levy on reluctant provinces, generating a storm of opposition. Ontario’s premier Doug Ford, who recently repealed the province’s carbon tax, has called it “the worst tax ever”. “It’s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word,” said Wu. “It’s really a key tool in the toolkit to incentivise the transition to a low carbon economy and curb carbon pollution. In British Columbia, it has definitely worked.” Nonetheless, the outlook for carbon taxes looks bright: 88 nations, representing more than half of global emissions, say they are or will uses carbon pricing to tackle climate change. Furthermore, some states have suggested they would impose carbon border levies on imported goods from nations that do not tax carbon. By design, the British Columbia plan was simple: it slapped a tax on any fossil fuels used for heating, electricity and transportation. Each person and business was expected to shoulder the burden of pricing pollution; no loopholes, no exemptions. In everyday life prices ticked up, most noticeably at the gas pump. Companies with emissions-intensive work passed their increased costs on to consumers. But the critical selling point of the plan – the tax’s revenue neutral design – was unprecedented. With a revenue-neutral tax, the government keeps none of the money collected from the levy. Instead, it redistributes all of it – close to $1.8bn in its first three years – back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts. As a result, the increase in energy costs for residents was offset by a tax cut of roughly equal value. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour to reduce emissions would end up in the black. “The nice thing about the revenue-neutral carbon tax was that it didn’t judge people: if you want to buy something that emits more than somebody else, you’re going to pay more tax,” Campbell said. “People who wanted to have their taxes actually reduced had to change a little bit of their behaviour, and their tax load would have been reduced.” Low-income residents, as well as those living in rural areas that relied more heavily on fossil fuels, received extra tax and cash benefits. The tax began as a $10/ton levy on carbon emissions, eventually reaching $30/ton by 2012. In speeches touting the tax, Campbell said the reduction in emissions would equate to removing 750,000 cars from the road in the province. The move – the first of its kind – placated both conservative economists and environmentalists. And, it worked. “We saw fossil fuel consumption decrease by more than 17% and in the rest of Canada fuel consumption increased by more than 1%,” Wu said of the four-year period between 2008 and 2012, when the first tranche of increases went into effect. Fears that the tax would have a negative impact on the economy quickly melted away when the numbers came in, she said. The province grew its economy by 16%, far outpacing any other region of the country. “It was leading edge at the time,” Campbell said. “And, unfortunately, 11 years later, it’s still leading edge.” By 2012, when the tax reached its first maximum level ($30 per ton), 64% of the population supported it. By 2016, it garnered the support of nearly 70% of residents. In Victoria, the province’s capital, residents remain unfazed over the constant increases – a testament of how the tax has drifted into the background. Devon Crosby, who has worked in the oil and gas industry for much of his career, said he has little patience for the current feud across the country. “Look, I’d rather pay an extra 15% on gas for a cleaner and nicer British Columbia.” For others, the tax cuts outweigh any increased costs. “Money talks,” said resident Kim Hollingsworth. “People need incentives to change their behaviour.” She based her decision to buy a new, more energy efficient heater on the climate rebates – part of the suite of climate policies Campbell introduced. The revenue-neutral aspect of the tax is novel but has frustrated some environmental groups, who feel the tax does not do enough to reduce emissions. Others felt it was too onerous: between 2012 and 2016 Campbell’s successor as premier, Christy Clark, froze the tax and repealed a number of environmental policies. “When the carbon tax was frozen, we saw emissions go back up,” said Wu. By 2021, the tax is slated to reach $50/ton, but the current British Columbia government is examining modifying the revenue-neutral aspect of the programme in order to allocate funding for green infrastructure, deviating from its original revenue neutrality – a move Campbell feels defeats the purpose of the tax in the first place: “I’m not happy when we say it’s going to be revenue-neutral carbon tax and it isn’t really. Don’t play that game with people.” He remains optimistic that the current feud in the country will dissipate over time. Too many people, he says, are on the defensive, feeling the problems of climate change are not directly their fault. “I think the relevant question is: are we willing to do something about it when it’s happening?” he said. “And if we can help, are we willing to?” Figured out The numbers that are fuelling international concerns about global warming and climate change are stark. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by a third over the past 100 years, to more than 400 parts per million. That has happened as a result of sharp rises in annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which have roughly doubled since 1971, to 53.5m tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. (CO2 from industrial processes and from forestry and other land uses makes up about three quarters of greenhouse gases; methane comprises another 16% and nitrous oxide about 6%). Annual global emissions flatlined for three years from 2014-2016, but rose sharply again last year. Meanwhile, over the past century, average global temperatures have risen more than 1C. The one bit of good news is the exponential rise in renewable power supplies, which have surged over the past 20 years to comprise more than 8% of global electricity generation. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, signatories are supposed to rein in carbon emissions so as to keep global temperatures from rising to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the 1.5C threshold is now looming, mechanisms for implementing Paris are still weak, and many observers are predicting that rises of 3C or more are now far more likely by the second half of this century.

    "transcript": "Paul Howland is standing in a bed of nettles, his head surrounded by a halo of dusky blue sloes. Behind him is an impenetrable tangle of undergrowth, self-seeded trees and what looks like the long-discarded parts of an a vehicle. “The old path went up here,” he says, waving his walking pole further into the thicket. “I first spotted it on Milne’s county map of Hampshire from 1791.” Howland emerges from the nettles and shows me an image on his phone which confirms his suspicions: we have just found one of Britain’s missing footpaths. “This is Greenwood’s 1826 county map and you can see the path. It was called the Markway and goes straight up to this line – now the A30 road. But compare that with the current Ordnance Survey map.” He unfolds a paper map and points to our position. “Instead of going straight, the footpath turns hard left at this point and heads back towards Andover. What we have here is a missing mile to a forgotten right of way – and a very useful missing mile, because it links to other footpaths.” England and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but there are an estimated 10,000 more that have been lost from current maps. Even that figure looks like a huge underestimate: a recent survey in Cornwall alone identified 3,000 possible paths that had fallen out of use and needed to be checked. That work of rediscovery is being done by volunteers, people such as Howland, who has so far made 85 legal applications for the recovery of lost paths in a small corner of Hampshire. A government deadline of 2026 for such claims has given Howland’s work a renewed sense of urgency. “It sounds like plenty of time, but I reckon that in our area we’d need to make two applications every week until 2026. There is just so much to be done.” As a walker, I reflect, I’m used to losing my way. It’s a bit alarming, however, to find that paths can get lost, too. Howland chuckles. “It’s easier than you think.” We give up any attempt to force a way through the bushes and set off up the path to the left. Two deer watch us warily from a stubble field and the giant white dish of a radio telescope appears to hover on the horizon as we catch up with a group from the Ramblers, among them Jack Cornish, project manager for the nationwide campaign Don’t Lose Your Way. He explains how government legislation in 1949 ruled that every council should draw a definitive map of footpaths and bridleways, a laudable aim, but one carried out piecemeal. “Some parishes recorded hundreds of paths, others did almost nothing. You ended up with footpaths that led nowhere or simply disappeared.” Once those paths failed to appear on OS maps, people stopped walking them. The nettles grew, the ash and sycamore seeds blew in and, within a few years, they were invisible. If a housing estate or a major road then appeared, that path was truly lost. And it did not only happen in the countryside. The Open Spaces Society has pointed out that urban areas were often exempt from the 1949 regulations and produced no definitive maps, leaving footpaths in cities and towns particularly under threat. Howland has a rough estimate of losses from his own experience. “In my area I expect an annual loss of half a percent – mostly from new buildings and roads.” “Those missing paths can be the vital element in a good circular walk, or access to great countryside.” “These are ancient rights of way,” Cornish adds. “Rights built up over centuries. And it’s not just about walkers: cyclists and horse riders need them, too.” We reach a sign – “Private road, access only” – and ignore it. “It’s a public bridleway,” says Howland, reassuringly. One of the ramblers finds a sign lost in the undergrowth and, producing a pair of secateurs, quickly makes it visible again. Walking with Howland is to see the British landscape through a fresh pair of eyes. Where I see walls of thorny bushes, he sees a double hedge hiding an ancient drovers’ path; where I see neat white posts at the entrance to someone’s drive, Howland sees a devious attempt to gull the public into believing they are on private land; most of all, where I see cul-de-sacs and dead ends, he spots opportunities to discover lost routes. He reads the landscape like a detective, building the physical elements into narratives of growth and change. He shows me a patch of land on his OS map called Bransbury Common that was declared open-access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Almost surrounded by a chalk stream, it was both biologically important and a local beauty spot. For as long as it has been an open-access area, the two bridges that once allowed entry have been unusable. They have never been replaced. “The public have the right to be on Bransbury Common,” says Howland. “But getting there is harder.” He has seen abandoned railways, used as footpaths and recorded as such on OS maps, summarily closed when new owners arrive. In other places, agricultural schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship demand that landowners open up paths in return for payments. When the schemes finish, these “permissive” paths can disappear overnight. On other occasions, new owners simply don’t understand local traditions. In October 2016, for example, villagers in Bratton, in Wiltshire, were astonished to find a traditional riverside path through watercress beds blocked by barbed wire and “private property” signs. A London property dealer had bought the local mill and erected the barriers. It took a two-year court battle to establish that the path was a legal right of way. “There are two ways to recover a lost path,” Cornish says. “By proving regular public use over a 20-year period without any attempt to prevent access by a landowner, and by detective work on historical maps.” What about the Markway, I ask. How did that disappear? “Almost by accident.” Howland says. “In the second world war, a Hurricane fighter base was built here and the path temporarily blocked. That order was not rescinded until 1956. By then it was too late: the last mile of the route had got overgrown and forgotten.” If not for Howland, this right of way would have permanently disappeared. We stop talking to stroll along a short section of busy road, before turning once again on to a path where spindle flowers gleam like nubs of coral in the hedge. A kestrel cuts away across the field, glorying in its freedom. We come eventually into the pretty thatched village of Chilbolton and, in the way of all good country walks, reach a pub. Over a bowl of hot soup, Howland shows me the paperwork that each Definitive Map Modification Order entails. “It does take hours of work, but a lot of the information and maps are now online. The National Library of Scotland website is particularly useful. You don’t need to be spending days in the National Archives at Kew, interesting as that would be.” The campaign has put pressure on under-resourced local councils. Hampshire’s executive member for rural affairs, Edward Heron, pointed out to me that Hampshire has seen a rise in applications from five a year to 35. “We expect that these increases will continue until the closure date of 2026.” The good news is that any application submitted by the 2026 deadline will, eventually, go through the legal process of assessment and consultation. Meanwhile Howland is planning more routes. His diffident manner masks a steely determination, and he clearly likes the elements of research and historical analysis. “It’s given me a better understanding of how the landscape changes and develops.” In theory, that research could go back to the era of Richard I. His reign, which began on 4 July 1189, is the beginning of legal time. In practice, many rights of way date back to the enclosure acts of 1750 to 1850. Either way the sense of a long game being played is palpable and Howland knows it. “A restored right of way will usually last for ever.” He smiles. “There aren’t many tasks in life that you can say that about.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/ebola-drug-trials-could-lead-patients-treated-home",
    "date": "2018-12-04",
    "transcript": "Ebola could be transformed from a terrifying disease into something that can be managed at home if drug trials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are successful, a leading scientist believes. Four experimental drugs are starting to be used as part of a groundbreaking trial under extremely difficult conditions in an outbreak in conflict-ridden eastern DRC. But, says Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases expert and the director of the Wellcome Trust, any data gleaned from the use of those drugs will be put together with evidence from future outbreaks in a five-year programme that may lead to effective and licensed treatments. That could take Ebola out of the isolation units where patients are cared for by nurses in masks and allow them to be looked after at home. “You could turn Ebola from something that really is feared and horrific in communities to something that is preventable and treatable,” Farrar said, adding that if a drug could be produced in pill or injection form “you could start thinking about home care”. And if it could be done for Ebola, he said, the model could be used to find treatments for other diseases such as Nipah and Lassa fever that also manifest in sudden lethal outbreaks. A blueprint for a five-year programme to trial drugs against Ebola is close to being signed off by the World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health in the US, the Department for International Development in the UK, the Wellcome Trust, the pharmaceutical companies making the drugs, as well as Médecins Sans Frontières and the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), organisations running field clinics. Farrar, who is chair of the WHO scientific advisory group, said: “We need to move away from seeing these as discrete episodes – DRC in 2018 and then it stops. Then maybe Uganda in 2020 and it starts again. The plan in place would be essentially to say this is a five-year programme: multi-epidemic, multi-country, multi-partner. The world tends to make drug trials really complicated. They are really simple. You have a protocol, people give consent and you randomise them.” The design will be adaptive, so if another drug comes along or one of those in the trial is found not to be working at all, they can be brought in or ruled out. This sort of flexibility is a new approach. Most trials are designed around the information drug regulators require to license a new treatment. During the west Africa outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the US Food and Drug Administration argued that a placebo would need to be included in trials to establish how well any drug worked. Other experts and doctors in the field refused to accept this, saying it would be unethical to give drugs to some Ebola patients and nothing to others. That argument has now been buried. In the DRC, the four drugs to be trialled will be randomly given to patients and information collected on how well they work in reducing the death rate compared with each other. ZMapp, which was used in west Africa, is one of them. The others are mAb114, Regeneron’s Regn-EB3 and remdesivir. Patients have already been given some of these drugs on a compassionate basis. The trial is beginning in record time. Researchers from Oxford University’s centre for tropical medicine and global health finally managed to launch a trial in Liberia in January 2015, after five months of negotiations over the ethics and how it should run. By the time it began, the epidemic had waned to the point where there were not enough cases to show whether the drug they had chosen, called brincidofovir, actually saved lives, and the manufacturer withdrew it. The drug and vaccine trials in that huge outbreak had changed people’s thinking, said Farrar. “The biggest thing out of [the west Africa outbreak] was acceptance by everybody that research is an integral part of the response. That was hugely controversial. It is now mainstream. “Also there was a success story: 35,000 or 36,000 people have now been vaccinated. The commonsense view is that it is the reason why this epidemic has not gone horribly wrong so far.” One of the vaccines used in Guinea, made by Merck, is now being deployed in DRC to immunise a “ring” of contacts of any person who becomes ill. to immunise a “ring” of contacts of any person who becomes ill. Everyone in the family and neighbourhood is offered the vaccine. In a departure from that protocol, neighbouring Uganda, where it is feared Ebola may spread, has vaccinated about 2,000 healthcare workers. When outbreaks happen out of the blue, they take a toll of nurses and doctors who are the first in contact with the sick and are unprotected. “You can’t stop Ebola. We all know that. There is an animal reservoir. To stop the initial outbreaks is impossible,” said Farrar. But vaccination, if it works, “will stop the tragedy of healthcare workers dying”. And if the novel plan for trials of drug treatments is successful, it could take the terror out of this and possibly, in the future, other infectious diseases as well.

Email us at theupside@theguardian.com • This article was amended on 7 December 2018. An earlier version said that vaccines owned by Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and another belonging to the Chinese government, are not yet licensed but are being used in DRC to immunise a “ring” of contacts of any person who becomes ill.

    "title": "A cure for HIV is in sight as science chases the holy grail",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/30/cure-for-hiv-world-aids-day",
    "date": "2018-11-30",
    "transcript": "More than 50 years after it jumped the species barrier and became one of the most devastating viruses to affect mankind, HIV remains a stubborn adversary. Treatment has improved dramatically over the past 20 years, but people who are infected will remain so for the rest of their lives, and must take one pill daily – at one time it was a cocktail of 30. But now, as another World Aids Day pulls into view, scientists are beginning to ask if the biggest breakthrough – an out-and-out cure for the tens of millions who have contracted the virus – could be in sight. The excitement lies in research that is having some success in drawing the virus out of a latent stage (in which it can lie undetected for long periods) so that it could be destroyed. “The last couple of years have been very exciting on this front,” said Satish Pillai, an associate professor in HIV research from the University of California San Francisco. “We’re now attempting find the holy grail of HIV research.” “In the first instance, we want to identify the signature characteristics, in a reliable and accurate way, of latently infected cells,” Pillai said, speaking of HIV-infected cells that evade current treatments. “The other side is that we’re developing novel strategies to destroy them once we’re able to identify them.” “We’re entering this new era of finding a functional cure to eradicate the virus,’ he explains. The difficulty in dealing once and for all with HIV is that, unlike other viruses, HIV-infected cells are able to “hide” by entering a resting phase that makes them invisible to our immune system and current treatment therapies. These ‘latently infected’ cells then exist in reservoirs in the bodies of those with the virus, and can launch new, resistant attacks if treatment is discontinued. Over the last few years, scientists have determined that destroying this last reservoir of cells will be the future of a cure. “People have been looking into latency long before this became a focus for a cure,” said Dr Jonathan Angel, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. “There have been people working on HIV research for a long time, but only recently has the tone shifted.’ “In my personal opinion, our therapies have become so good that looking at better therapies has become futile. People are taking a pill once a day with no side affects. That’s hard to improve upon.” In fact, the increased efficacy of antiretrovirals has curbed the deadliness of the disease significantly. The virus exists in around 36.7 million people around the world and, although it killed around 1 million people in 2017 according to UNAids, that represents a drop of almost 50% from 2005, when mortality from Aids-related illnesses was at its peak. This drop is due to improved medicine, as well as logistics and patient awareness. But the virus remains a grave health problem in rural areas that lack these resources, especially in regions such as Africa – more than a quarter of people in Swaziland have the virus. The deadliness of the disease in some regions, the tremendous expense and the pressure on patients, means that a cure remains an important goal. There are a number of different approaches currently being studied. One approach, often named the “kick and kill” or “shock and kill”, aims to kick the resting cells out of their sleep so they can be pinpointed and eliminated. Sarah Fidler, professor of HIV medicine at Imperial College London, who recently led a major study testing the efficacy of the kick and kill method said: “The idea is to reactivate the latent cells so they start producing the proteins on their surface so they look different from healthy cells. We would do this with some kind of drug, which is what we’re in the process of determining.” The other research approach wants to find and destroy the HIV-infected cells while they’re still in the resting state. The key to doing this would be finding something distinct about an infected, resting cell – as opposed to a healthy one – so that an antiviral agent can target them. Scientists call this elusive target a biomarker. There is promising work being done with antiviral-viruses – viruses that are engineered to target and destroy other viruses. A specific strain, the rhabdovirus called Maraba virus (MG1), has been engineered to seek out faulty cell communication, something that happens in both cancer and HIV. A difference as small as this, between healthy and unhealthy cells, is enough for something like MG1 to target. Angel says the MG1 approach only occurred because of the physical proximity of scientists researching cancer and HIV. “The MG1 project came up on the side from being on the same floor as oncology, and seeing seminars from guys in cancer research,” Angel said. “There are viruses that are able to kill cancer cells based on the fact that they have impaired interferon signalling [proteins made by cells to prevent virus replication]. This is an innate antiviral molecule, present in all of our cells to ward off viruses. “We know that HIV can interfere with those pathways, but what is not known is whether that is the case with latently infected cells, because they occur with such a low frequency in the body. “MG1 as a potential therapeutic agent that can exploit these cells.” Although there is consensus that destroying the virus reservoirs is the next step, there are disagreements about whether this could be properly called a cure, as we understand the term. “Completely eliminating the reservoirs of HIV would result in a cure. The dissension might exist on what is referred to as a ‘functional cure’,” Angel said. “This refers to establishing a state where the immune system itself (without antiretroviral therapy) can control the virus so it is not detectable in the blood and there is no effect on the immune system. “While the scientific community might consider this a cure, the general public might not,” he said. The speed of the research has been made possible because of the advocacy community that stands behind it, says Fidler. “We are talking about a community of people with HIV that have been an extraordinary driver in researching the condition,’she said. “In our most recent trial, no-one dropped out, which is practically unheard of.” “It’s still a very stigmatising condition. People don’t feel comfortable with talking about it, as they might with diabetes or cancer,” Fidler said. “I think it motivates this collaboration. People still feel that they are somehow different and that’s what makes people join together, they relate to these other people who have the virus. They are a potent advocacy force.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "In a cramped office hidden within the poorly lit corridors of a shopping mall in Israel, sits the equivalent of Nasa’s mission control in Houston. Yet there are no rows of scientists and flight controllers wearing headsets, all of their faces fixed on a large screen charting spacecraft. And no astronauts telling them they have a problem. Instead, three large computer screens display a world map showing a satellite, roughly the size of a large shoebox, orbiting the globe. It is one of many private autonomous “space labs” conducting experiments for paying clients including pharmaceutical firms, universities and chemical companies. This is the new frontier of space exploration and research. Enormous, slow-moving government agencies such as Nasa no longer have a monopoly. The sector has commercialised, making room for large aerospace companies including SpaceX and Boeing, but also plucky startups exploiting increasingly cheaper access to the heavens. The one in Israel, SpacePharma, is attempting to tap into one emerging space industry: microgravity experimentation. At the core of what it provides is the ability to run tests in a situation that is currently impossible to replicate on the planet – a zero gravity, or very close to zero gravity, environment. And without gravity, an unavoidable constant that has forever restricted every experiment, a new field of science is promising breakthroughs. “In space, everything is different,” said Yair Glick, the research and development director at SpacePharma. Almost nothing – chemicals, plants and even human cells – behave the same in microgravity as they do on Earth. Even the most simple experiment produces new results: “If we mix water with oil, we know the water goes down and the oil. Not so in space,” said Glick. National space agencies have been conducting microgravity research for decades, often on the effects of muscles and bones of astronauts, but also on how it affects other elements, for example, flames – they don’t flicker upwards but instead form a ball. The results have been astonishing. One experiment conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency looked at the proteins associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which primarily affects young boys and leaves them immobile. Proteins, the building blocks of cells, crystallise differently in space as they are unburdened by the Earth’s pull and form in a more orderly way. Researchers were able to record their new structure and make medicine that drastically delays the effects of the disease. Its creators claim it could potentially double the lifespan of patients and keep them walking until 25, instead of 12. Rich Godwin runs the US firm Space Technology Holding, which takes research done in space and applies it to the real-world market. Commercial microgravity testing is a potentially huge market, he believes, and expects more big successes as it privatises. “It’s not changing chemistry. It’s changing physics,” he said. “It’s like the invention of the microscope.” Yossi Yamin, the chief executive and founder of SpacePharma, estimates there are about 30 private companies selling microgravity experiments. There are three main ways to do it. The first can be done on Earth by renting a plane and nosediving in parabolic flight, simulating weightlessness. But the process is extremely imprecise and only lasts a few seconds. Most companies instead rent space 250 miles up on the International Space Station, which acts as a sort of real estate agent for low Earth orbit. They make small automatic laboratories that are sent up on a rocket, often when astronauts are delivered, and are plugged into the wall. In these, liquids can be heated, cooled, and tiny automatic pumps allow customers to mix chemicals. SpacePharma also provides free-roaming satellites, which orbit the Earth independently. Its first was sent up on an Indian rocket in 2017. In the small office in Herzliya, a city that is the tech hub of Israel, the nanosatellites are handmade, in a lab with a plastic 3D printer and a soldering table. “If you have autonomous mobile units, you can command and control it from your mobile,” said Yamin, who worked for the Israeli army’s satellite fleet for 25 years. Each satellite costs about £2.4m but has enough space for 12 clients, whose experiments can run concurrently, dramatically lowering the cost. The commercial space research business is worth about half a billion, he estimates. But he is betting on a market boom. Pharmaceutical companies are looking at creating drugs in space that are more effective than those made on Earth. Once these more-perfect proteins are formed, they can be used as “seeds” to duplicate back on Earth. “These are masterpieces created in orbit,” Yamin said. The next stage in the field of microgravity, industry insiders believe, will be “space factories” where materials that can only be made in space are manufactured. Twyman Clements, the chief executive of Space Tango, a US firm that began launches last year and has conducted 88 experiments in space, including one commissioned by Budweiser on barley and another that looked at how cannabis reacts in space. But now it is moving into making products in space and bringing them back. “This is not just about research. It has scalable application,” said Clements, who grew up on a farm in Kentucky and made his own rockets. “We look at high-value products made in microgravity for Earth,” he said. They need to have a high price tag because it costs so much to send material up and down. There are already customers looking to make fibre optic cables, which are more efficient when manufactured in space. And another product that could be produced in orbit are retinal implants to restore vision, which are made from light-activated proteins but do not form well on Earth under their own weight. Space Tango is looking at how it could make them in space. “The next steps are toward production,” said Clements. “That has not happened quite yet. The retinal impacts could be the first.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "Nicolas Dezeure drove his yellow post van up the winding single-track road, past fields and olive groves, to an isolated stone house at the top of a hill. Outside the front door, an elderly woman raking fallen leaves welcomed him like a long-lost friend. “It’s lovely to see the postman as I don’t usually see anyone else all week,” said Janine, 81, as Dezeure handed her a tax bill and an envelope addressed to her husband who died several years ago. She ushered him into her kitchen for a chat. A rural postman politely checking on a lonely elderly person might seem a natural part of French countryside life. But Dezeure’s carefully planned visits to Janine each Monday morning are part of a new strategy for the French post office as it tries to find a joint solution to two very different challenges; the growing number of elderly people living alone; and a decline in letter-writing in the digital era, which means France is looking for new ways to make a profit from its 73,000 postal workers. In 1990, delivering letters accounted for 70% of the state post service’s turnover; in 2020 it will be less than 20%. The new service in which customers pay for postal workers to check on their elderly relatives during morning rounds has been hailed as a clever solution to the modern epidemic of loneliness. But some trade unionists have cautioned that people should not have to pay for something that used to happen informally for free. La Poste, France’s publicly owned postal service, says it is using its extensive presence in every corner of France to bring new services to elderly people in isolated areas. The service, Watch over my parents (Veiller sur mes parents), was launched last year. Customers – often in their 50s and living in major cities – pay from €20 (£18) a month for postal workers to visit their parents living alone far away. Visits can be weekly or more regular, with a report delivered to the family and an option of a 24-hour helpline and alert system. About 6,000 elderly people are currently availing of the service – the average age is 82, the oldest is 98. In Janine’s kitchen, with her neat display of copper pots and china teapots, Dezeure, 37, who has been a postal worker for 16 years, carried an official list of questions for small talk, including: “What did you watch on TV last night?” But he has got to know Janine quite well in their 15-minute chats each Monday, so he improvises. “In any case I don’t watch TV,” she said. “But I did watch Out of Africa on DVD last night.” Dezeure said: “She knows loads about me. We talk about my days playing rugby, my aching shoulders, knees ... ” After the chat, he sent a message straight to Janine’s two daughters, in their 50s, who live more than 370 miles (600km) away in the Paris area, telling them she was OK. “I agreed to do this for my daughters,” Janine said. “They worry that I’m on my own in the middle of nowhere.” Her package includes a 24-hour helpline and an alert system if she has a problem. “I used to boast I never went to the doctor, but then I had a fall recently. I feel more secure this way.” She has lived for 40 years in the same house, built by her husband, and never wants to move away from the secluded spot. “The radio is a marvellous companion,” she said. “My motto is: ‘Turn the radio on, fill the house with sound.’” Dezeure sees the human link with customers as one of the best parts of his job. He grew up in this corner of the Vaucluse in southern France and his own grandparents, in their 80s, live on his delivery route. “The postman is a key figure. People come up to you in the street. We’re always there at the same time of day. People virtually set their watch by us, saying: ‘Ah that’s the postman, it must be time for lunch.’” Eric Baudrillard, in charge of developing new strategy at the French postal service, said: “No other postal service in the world has done what we’re doing for elderly people. We’re pioneers on this. People are living longer, and more of them want to stay in their own homes as long as they can. We know there will be more need for social links like this as mobility grows and adult children move far from their ageing parents. Despite all the digital tools that we have, there is still a need for human connection.” He denied that the French post office was cashing in on friendly gestures that postal workers had been doing for years for free. “Postal workers always spontaneously and informally connected with clients and looked out for them, and that will continue. But what we’re doing is adding new services and bringing greater value.” Other schemes have already been rolled out – postal workers in France can deliver elderly customers supplies from shops, basic prescriptions, books from libraries and hot meals – though they are paid for by local councils. This week La Poste began offering a service delivering elderly people a regular printout of photos and messages from relatives, which it described as “a kind of Facebook on paper”. Pascal Frémont, from the Sud trade union, who was a postal worker in Loire-Atlantique for 15 years, said he had reservations about the post office capitalising on the silver economy. “For us, it’s not a problem for postal workers to keep an eye on older people, because many of us already did that. But if it is a paid-for service, that excludes some people who can’t afford it, and affects the notion of public service. We would prefer partnerships, such as with the health ministry. And we’d prefer for any support of the elderly to be funded by the price of stamps. Also, postal workers aren’t healthcare staff, so we should be cautious about that.” Yves Lecouturier, a former postal worker who ran a postal museum in Caen, Normandy, said: “The social link between postmen and postwomen and the population always existed in France. In the late 1970s, we delivered Monday to Saturday and I remember some older people in remote rural locations subscribed to a daily newspaper just so the postman would come round to deliver it – that would be the only person they saw.” As Dezeure left to continue his morning’s round, Janine said: “I want to stay living at home and I appreciate my adult children want to know I’m OK. It’s pleasant to see the postman for a regular chat, and what choice do I have? It’s this or leave my home.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "transcript": "As any saver knows, interest rates can go up as well as down. But they normally do so in conjunction with the economic cycle, and not with the physical activity of the account holder. Now, a Ukrainian bank is offering better rates of interest to customers who prove they are taking 10,000 steps every day, as part of efforts to make its clientele not just richer, but healthier at the same time. Monobank, a rapidly growing bank which has signed up more than half a million customers in just over a year, has offered the variable rate to about 1,500 savers on its mobile platform. It works like this: customers use a smartphone health app to monitor their physical activity. Monobank accesses the data on a daily basis. People who manage the 10,000 steps are granted a rate of 21% on their savings. Anyone who fails to walk the walk for three days in a row will see their rate slump to 11%. “I’m hoping to look fitter pretty soon,” says Alexey Drozdov as he marches through another chilly Kiev evening to clock up the mileage. “They say, ‘I bet you can’t do it every day.’ And I was like, ‘OK, I’ll prove you wrong.’ “Normally, a deposit only makes you happy at the end of a period; with this one, you can enjoy it every day because you get to show yourself that you have the guts to keep on going.” The concept was devised by Monobank’s three CEOs, Dima Dubilet, Misha Rogalskiy and Oleg Gorokhovsky, in an effort to aid both personal and national economic wellbeing and address obesity-related health problems. Ukraine has the second highest death rate from coronary heart disease in the world at 395.73 per 100,000; almost 50% of men are predicted to be obese by 2030. “Everyone knows exercise is important but life often gets in the way,” said Dubilet. “If our sports deposit account gets people exercising more, that can only be a good thing – for our account holders and for Monobank.” There were some early concerns about customers gaming the system – particularly when some users hit their 10,000 steps more quickly than humanly possible. Bank officials quickly discovered that products were being sold to help run up the 10,000 steps without human involvement. The offenders were punished with an immediate relegation to the lowest interest rate. Of the broad customer base, more than 50% are managing the step count to qualify for 21% returns on their deposits. Bank officials did not say whether there were any special terms for disabled people. Monobank’s approach and rapid success reflects Ukraine’s booming financial technology scene, with 58% of the nation’s fintech companies launching since 2015. The country’s technology sector is strong generally, and startups based in Ukraine or founded by a Ukrainian raised $265m in 2017. Amazon bought the video doorbell firm Ring for $1bn in February, while Snapchat bought augmented reality startup Looksery for $150m. Dubilet argues that the conditions endured by Ukrainians since conflict broke out in 2014 have motivated young entrepreneurs to seek ways to improve day-to-day life. He wants to increase the number of Ukrainians using the “sports deposit” account and is looking to collaborate with both healthcare professionals and the government in Kiev. Monobank would also like to launch its sports deposit platform in the UK, possibly in early 2019.",

    "transcript": "The creator of a house made of bamboo that can be put together in four hours to solve the chronic shortage of affordable accommodation in the Philippines has won a £50,000 top prize to develop cities for the future. Earl Forlales, 23, a graduate in material science engineering, took inspiration from the bamboo hut his grandparents lived in outside Manilla. Forlales was awarded first prize by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) for his house, known as Cubo, for its use of low-cost, sustainable material, and the speed at which it could be constructed. John Hughes, the competition head judge and Rics president, said: “The world’s cities are growing all the time and there is a real need to make sure they are safe, clean and comfortable places to live for future generations. “There were many exciting, original designs among the submissions. However, Earl’s idea stood out for its simple yet well thought through solution to the world’s growing slum problem. “As we look at our entrants, who are our next generation of leaders, I believe that real progress will be made in tackling the world’s biggest issues.” Forlales’s house could be manufactured in a week, constructed in four hours and costs £60 per square metre. Its use of bamboo – which releases 35% more oxygen into the environment than trees – was praised by the judges. The ability of the houses to be constructed in any bamboo-producing area was one of the key attractions. Forlales has already identified a suitable area of land to start building his Cubo houses. He plans to begin work next year with experts from the Rics in an attempt to help relieve the huge pressures on housing in Manila, where a third of the 12 million population live in slums. He said: “This is a huge step forward to helping the people of Manila. The state of housing in the city is at crisis point, and will undoubtedly get worse with this new influx of workers. “Cubo started as nothing more than an idea, conceived while spending time at my grandparent’s house – it is incredible to think that it now will become a reality. “I would like to thank Rics for the opportunity to develop the idea, and look forward to working with them to put this money to good use in Manila, and then hopefully elsewhere around the world.” The Cities for our Future competition launched in January 2018 aiming to find practical solutions to problems that the world’s cities face. There were more than 1,200 entries, which were narrowed down to 12 finalists, who were given a mentor from the Rics to help them develop their idea over several months. The final judging took place this month. Dr Beth Taylor, a competition judge and the chair of the UK National Commission for Unesco, said: “One of the reasons Earl’s entry stood out from the other finalists was through its use of traditional, sustainable technologies and materials, to solve an issue facing modern cities across the world.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Jørgen sharply inhales as the needle pierces his vein, exhaling when the heroin reaches his bloodstream. His eyes reopen with a glimmer of excitement, tinged by a profound scowl of disapproval. All over Europe, every day, many thousands of people will perform this same ritual. Hundreds will do so, like Jørgen, in drug consumption rooms. But none of these will be in the UK, where drug addicts are mainly confined to back streets, crack houses and hostel bedrooms. While European overdose rates are falling, the UK now has the worst drug death rate across the continent: one in three of the approximate 8,000 people who die as a result of drugs in Europe will do so in Britain. It could all be very different. In Denmark, there has been no shortage of overdoses in the Skyen (Cloud) drug consumption room I visited – more than 800 at the last count. But no one has died. Drug-related deaths in the country have stabilised since 2011. In fact, there has never been a recorded death in any of the 78 drug consumption rooms in Europe. Why? Because nurses quickly administer antidotes and immediately resuscitate the person before calling an ambulance. Elsewhere, the death rate from opiate overdoses is about 6%. “These people are really sick, they cannot just suddenly stop taking drugs,” says Anders Larsen, a social worker and chemist at Skyen, as he scrapes a small quantity of powdered heroin from under the microscope and into the bin after testing its purity. “All we can do is make it as safe as possible, and if they decide that they want to give up, then we will immediately direct them to addiction support services.” At Skyen, visitors can get clean needles and are allowed 24-hour access. There had been fears the opening of a consumption room would increase the numbers of new drug users, but this has not happened. Rather it has transformed the fabric of Copenhagen’s historic “open drug scene”. As many as 10,000 syringes were found every week on the streets of Vesterbro, the Danish capital’s former meatpacking district, prior to the consumption room opening in 2012. That figure fell below 1,000 within a year, as drug-taking in the city’s main hotspot – where users would formerly inject behind bins, in stairwells, and on the street – became largely shielded from public view. There are now five such medical facilities across the country, where drug addicts take cocaine and heroin as well as methadone, under clinical supervision. At Skyen, staff have overseen more than 7,500 people administer more than 1m fixes in six years. Their wraparound service delivers harm reduction and social work, in conjunction with the shelter next door, by providing assistance with housing applications and organising hospital appointments. Crucially, most of their visitors are extremely marginalised - “hard-to-reach, hard-to treat” - and may never have any other contact with non-users, or officialdom. In the UK, pressure is growing on Westminster to allow the Scottish parliament permission to open a drug room in Glasgow, where overdoses are reaching unprecedented levels having quintupled in just 20 years. The government has repeatedly blocked any attempts to permit a Scottish exception, however, citing fears about the challenges the facility could pose to law enforcement agencies, and of the implied acceptance of wider criminality. In a statement, the Home Office said there was no legal framework for the provision of drug consumption rooms in the UK and that there were no plans to introduce them. A spokesperson stressed that drug dependency must be prevented through treatment and recovery. Such services, however, are in decline. An addiction service recently blamed the 26% rise in drug-related deaths in England between 2013 and 2016 on the 18% cut to treatment budgets in that time. “Drug consumption rooms have operated across Europe for the last four decades and they have been proven to be effective at engaging some of those most marginalised in society, providing safe spaces for those who would previously have been injecting in a risky way in public places,” says Niamh Eastwood, executive director of the drug information charity Release. “Drug consumption rooms reduce the risk of fatal overdose, reduce public injecting, and increase access to health and treatment services for those with who have a history of problem drug use. “The only thing that stands in the way of the UK following the example of other European countries is the British government, who continuously state that they will not support drug consumption rooms despite the evidence and the fact they could save lives. It seems they are happy for the backstreets of our city and town centres to continue to provide such spaces.” Although the government has acknowledged the potential public health benefits of consumption rooms, it would rather “see our most vulnerable and desperate fellow citizens suffer and die for ideological reasons, than allow cities like Glasgow to open one”, according to Martin Powell from Transform Drug Policy Foundation. “Europe’s overdose prevention centres have supervised millions of injections, and treated thousands of overdoses without a single death.” Across Europe the legal status of injecting rooms differs. Germany and Switzerland changed the law to allow for drug consumption rooms. Spain did not need to because it does not criminalise personal possession. In France, the safe spaces (housed in public hospitals in Paris and Strasbourg) are more contentious because the country has some of the strictest narcotics laws in Europe. In Portugal, which is set to soon introduce consumption rooms, the decriminalisation of drug use caused a steep fall in the drug death rate which now stands at a 10th of that in the UK. Ireland and Belgium are also soon to introduce them too. In Denmark the provision of the service was sparked by a longstanding campaign led by residents and activists focused on improving public health that eventually gained the support of the majority of the wider population. In an act of civil disobedience on the day of the general election in 2011, a mobile facility in an ambulance run by volunteers in Copenhagen began offering a sterile space for drugs to be taken. “It was quite controversial at first and there was real tension,” says Ivan Christensen, who now manages the men’s shelter next door to Skyen. The volunteer social workers were waiting to be arrested, but nothing happened. Weeks later, the second-hand ambulance, known as Fixelance, parked in front of parliament to draw attention to the debate taking place inside: the first reading of a bill to establish consumption rooms. Some months later, the municipal government asked them to establish a fixed drug consumption room – which it has since funded – and a change to the law was passed in the summer of 2012 to allow individuals with severe problems to possess drugs for their own use, thus enabling such facilities to work within the law. A stationary facility was opened shortly after, and since then an even bigger consumption room has opened nearby, along with three others across Denmark. They are hectic places where minor disputes often erupt, yet workers and visitors snatch sanguine moments together where they bond over stories, meals and shared frustrations. Skyen visitors, who tend to buy their drugs locally, are allowed 35 minutes in the smoking room and 45 minutes in the injecting room. “I take drugs to numb my pain,” says a Muslim veteran of the Bosnian war, after inhaling heroin fumes in Skyen’s smoking room. “You cannot begin to imagine what I have seen.” Another tells me that he would otherwise be taking drugs on the streets. “It’s more calm here, and I do not have to worry about being attacked,” says an Afghan cocaine addict who fled the country after war began in 2001. “Here I have dignity.” A longtime heroin addict who was in care growing up in Denmark explains that visitors to Skyen are treated with “empathy, not judgment”, as he recalls his tumultuous life story. “We are not condemned, we are cared for,” he says. “This place gives us greater control over our own destiny.” Skyen’s employees’ views are shaped by their every day experience, watching people come and go, while committing crimes to fund their addiction which means they are in and out of prison. “What’s the point of sending people to jail, where there are no harm reduction measures despite drugs being so easy to buy,” says Larsen, sitting next to a man who has just taken a shot of heroin. “People will scratch a needle on the floor to sharpen it so they can get their hit. I wish we could give them free, clean drugs. All this crime is for nothing, the proceeds go back into crime. The war on drugs is lost.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "To perform the “saltur”, an Afghan wrestling term, a fighter spins behind their opponent, then lifts them a few inches off the floor and slams the victim backwards overhead and into a pin. It is a technique that coach Ghulam Abbas has taught students for more than 30 years, and one he dearly loves to see. “I forget my troubles when a student takes the opportunity,” says the 57-year-old coach of the Maiwand wrestling club in west Kabul. But he can no longer demonstrate the move. As he strolls among his 40 teenage students, grappling and grunting, his left sleeve hangs conspicuously loose over where his arm should be. Two months ago, Isis suicide bombers attacked the wrestling club. At around 6pm on 5 September, Abbas heard gunfire and a cry of “suicider!”. He charged to the door, slamming it shut onto the foot of the attacker, who promptly detonated a bomb held in a sports-bag. Another detonated a car-bomb just outside as help was arriving. It was only when Abbas regained consciousness in hospital that he realised his left arm had been severed in the explosion. In total, 30 people were killed and a further 50 wounded. “Before, I was very good at showing students the throws, but now I have to tell them to practise with other boys,” says Abbas. “That has been very hard for me.” At home, too, he has had to adapt. His wife helps him put on his left sock in the morning. “When she was washing the carpet, I used to like to wash it with her,” he says, “but now I cannot.” But Abbas never doubted he would return to the Maiwand wrestling club. While in hospital, hundreds of visitors showed up by his bedside, thanking the man who put their children on the right path – or, in the attack itself, saved their lives. Abbas paid for the repairs to the club building himself. A black scar still rings the wall where the entrance was. A patch of lighter paint marks the hole blown through it while yellow foam pokes through a patched up roof. He also kept fit waiting to come back: running, unsteadily at first, around the hospital grounds. Ten times in the morning, and ten at night, as soon as the wound stopped bleeding. His tenacity is paying off. Around half the usual 100 or so students are attending a free-practice session this Thursday, the beginning of the Afghan weekend, but the number, says Abbas, is growing. As students trickle in, a security guard frisks them lengthily at the gate of a newly-constructed entrance tunnel shielded by concrete bollards topped with barbed wire. One 23-year-old admits he was scared to return. But wrestling itself is a form of resistance. “The enemy wants us not to play,” says a defence ministry official, “but we are showing that we can come back and make things better.” Pausing from a batch of rapid squats, 16-year-old Sajid Omid says that on the day of the attack, a piece of shrapnel hit him in the chest and his wrestling partner was killed. “I am scared to come but my love of wrestling means I cannot not come,” he says quietly. He hopes to become the latest in a long line of champions trained by Abbas, but security concerns means nobody knows when the next match can be organised. “Those who lost limbs and can’t come back here are in an even worse situation,” says Bashir Ahmad Faizi, “I hear they want to die.” The attack on the Maiwand club was Isis’s fifth strike this year in the same area of west Kabul, a poor Hazara neighbourhood of low brick houses. Hazara pride is wrapped up in Afghanistan’s wrestling scene; champions in four weight-categories were killed in the assault. By targeting the 6-million strong, mainly Shia Muslim, minority Isis hopes to breed sectarian strife between it and the Sunni Pashtun majority. Fears of a collapse into the kind of blood-letting seen in Iraq have so far proven exaggerated, but Hazara resentment of the government is growing. Abbas founded this branch of the Maiwand wrestling club in 1980. Like so many Afghans, he has already recovered from more than most will suffer in a lifetime. During the 1990s civil war, a rocket killed his first wife. The small shop he owned was burned down, too. Outside the gym, he walks past a rolled-up wrestling mat that rests by a chain-link fence. He paid $700 for the mat – the finest available in Afghanistan. One day he will open it and see if it, too, can be re-used. For now he cannot bear to look. It is “full of blood and body parts”, he says. Inside the gym, the end of the session nears. Someone lets down a knotted rope, and one young man pulls himself up, legs swinging in the air.",

    "transcript": "The Kasai river slides far across the plain. When the rains come, the sandbars in the middle – where fishermen have built temporary encampments consisting of straw huts – will disappear, making the river wider still. Local people will tell you it’s just a rivière; in this country, they reserve the word fleuve, a big river, for the mighty Congo alone. Mushie is built on one bank of the Kasai river, in the way that towns in other countries spawn from main roads. The town is two hours in a fast boat from Bandundu, and seven hours along the river in the other direction from the provincial capital, Inongo. There is no road. It’s only when you travel these inland waters, passing the standing fishermen paddling their pirogues – passing the dugout canoes and the big, flat cargo boats, laden perilously low in the water with families sitting on top of their goods – that you get a true sense of the scale of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country is as big as western Europe, with its people scattered across small villages lying along the rivers, in the forests and on the plains. If you were going to try to stamp out a lethal disease, you wouldn’t want to be doing it here. Yet that is what’s happening. In DRC, a country tarnished in international eyes by war and violence, Congolese doctors are finally winning the battle with sleeping sickness, a disease of west and central Africa that became an epidemic thanks partly to the enforced displacement of peoples and poverty caused by the policies of invading European colonialists. Rowing pirogues along the river. At the turn of the millennium, there were roughly 30,000 cases in DRC. Last year, there were 1,100. In the first half of this year, 350 were recorded. On the horizon is the tantalising prospect of elimination. The vast majority of the world’s remaining cases, 85%, are in DRC. “If DRC eliminates sleeping sickness, the world eliminates sleeping sickness,” says Dr Victor Kande, former head of the government programme to fight the disease. Kande, the man they call the father of sleeping sickness, is 68 now and walks carefully, eyes on the uneven ground, taking the long way around to avoid steps to the hospital ward at Mushie. He is venerated. And passionate. “You have to love it,” he says of the work. Dr Victor Kande in the sleeping sickness ward at Bandundu general hospital. At the age of 27, shortly after finishing medical school, he was the only doctor for 11,000 people in a village in Équateur province, to the north of Bandundu. A 12 year-old boy was brought in by his parents, tied up with ropes. His name was Jérome. “He was talking a lot. He was angry. His parents said we brought him here because he can’t be with other people. He is very agitated,” says Kande. “They took him to a traditional healer but he could do nothing.” Kande had been briefed on the diseases he would see in this region and the symptoms rang a bell. He went away to look through his medical textbooks: sleeping sickness. The early stages were innocuous – headaches, joint pains, fever. Then the symptoms would apparently go away. Sometimes it would be several years before the madness began. Victims would shout, accuse people, get violent. And start sleeping a lot. Then a lot more, until they could barely be woken for food. Finally, they would slip into a coma and die. The parasite that causes sleeping sickness, trypanosome, is seen here magnified under a microscope. These parasites are transmitted to humans by tsetse flies, resulting in sleeping sickness. “I went back to see the patient and felt his lymph nodes,” he says. They were lumpy, the most telling sign. He took a fluid sample. The lab confirmed that the trypanosome could be seen under the microscope, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, transmitted from one person to another through a bite from the tsetse fly, which feeds on human blood. “I asked the nurse how we treat sleeping sickness,” says Kande. “He said that there was a store where there were drugs from Belgian times.” This was in 1977. The Belgians left after independence in 1960. “We opened the box and found melarsoprol. There was no expiry date,” says Kande. “I read in my book how to use it.” Melarsoprol was an arsenic-based drug introduced in 1949. The rapid spread of sleeping sickness during the late 19th century was a result of the opening up of Africa, and followed the sequence of the European invasion along the Congo River. Melarsoprol, an arsenic-based drug, was introduced for the treatment of sleeping sickness in 1949. For over half a century, it was the only drug for the late stage. It kills 5-10% of the patients treated. Jérome was among the lucky ones, probably because he was young. He had nine injections over three weeks and was cured. “I was really happy. The young man became really close to me. He came to my house and ate with me and became like my son,” says Kande. An image of a tsetse fly outside a sleeping sickness treatment ward at Bandundu general hospital. DRC, a country riven with problems, is an ever present near the bottom of global leagues for development indicators. The war that raged in the country from 1998 to 2002 war was the most lethal anywhere in the world since the second world war. A second Ebola outbreak in a year is now slow-burning in the worst possible region of the country, conflict-riven North Kivu, where UN peacekeepers try to deter rival factions from slaughtering each other. But amid political uncertainty and disturbances, Congolese doctors have not wavered in their determination to end the scourge of sleeping sickness. The national programme for the control of African human trypanosomiasis sends out screening teams to actively search for cases in villages, offering blood tests, lymph node fluid testing and even lumbar punctures. They target settlements in the forests and on the river banks, where the tsetse flies live and feed on the blood of fishermen, farmers and their families. In these remote rural areas, where there is no running water or electricity without a generator, Congolese doctors and nurses have been running clinical trials of a new drug that could transform treatment. Flying over Bandundu. Bandundu alone, where most cases occur, spans 300,000 sq km – an area bigger than the UK. And it’s what they call “dynamic”. Whole villages move. They run from sleeping sickness and are not on the map. The government does not know they exist. Using satellite technologies, heat sensors that can suggest where there are inhabited houses in the forests, and sampling data from census teams that give an idea of how many generally live under one roof, the programme has found 10,000 villages that nobody knew were there. Life on the riverbank. In the bigger villages, mobile screening teams set up under shelters made from palm leaves and branches. A massive, battered register on the first of three tables lists every family in the village – with spaces for children yet to be born – and the years in which they have been screened. Everyone who arrives is allotted a number and joins the queue, sitting on a snaking row of plastic chairs, moving up one chair at a time until they reach the second table, where basic screening – the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (Catt) – is performed. They get to choose which finger is pierced with a needle, and their blood is then collected in a thin plastic tube. The screener, in a white coat, mixes a drop with a deep-blue coloured fluid containing antigen on a paper slide. When 12 blood spots are ready, the paper is gently vibrated for five minutes in a small machine. If there is a clumping of dark specks in a blood spot, the person is recalled and sent to a third table for further tests. Mobile screening teams perform card agglutination tests. Some faces show fright, even horror, as they sit alone at the third table. Belinda Bizaka, 17, in school uniform with two blue biros twisted in her hair, looks bored and embarrassed. She’s back for a rescreen because this happened three months ago. The confirmatory tests that time were negative. There are three, involving two more blood tests and a sample of lymph node fluid from her neck. Belinda Belinda says she didn’t know tsetse flies carried sleeping sickness. “I was bitten on the farm,” she says, muttering the words with teenage hostility. “This month. I go to school every day and then work on the farm.” Once more, the tests are negative. Belinda stares into the middle distance. Mini mobile teams on motorbikes access the remoter villages, carrying all the screening kit they need. The tablets they bear – which have the potential to transform not only the fight against this disease but, in future, others too – record information about the location and health of individuals that is automatically uploaded to a data bank owned by the ministry of health in Kinshasa. Malaria cases, childbirth, vaccinations. One day, all that knowledge could be collected and acted upon. The motorbikes could not get to Chaida’s village, however. The little boy is seven, but looks like a four-year-old. He has been ill for years, says his father, Zindo, and suffers from headaches, fever and lack of appetite. Zindo: ‘My son was sleeping and whining all the time’ “He used to cry all the time,” says Zindo. “We went to health clinics and were told it was malaria. When the treatment the boy had did not work, we thought it was sorcery. We went to a traditional healer.” Chaida got no better and was falling asleep all the time. His father heard about the screening team visiting Lebida village. He put his small son in a pirogue and paddled the half hour along the river to get there. The tests revealed the parasites. A lumbar puncture in the base of the spine showed it was stage two sleeping sickness, affecting the brain. Chaida and his dad were put on the back of motorbikes and taken straight to Mushie hospital. Chaida was given fexinidazole, the new drug that Congolese doctors have been trialling. It was discovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDI), an international collaboration that grew out of the frustrations of volunteer doctors of Médecins sans Frontières, who did not have the treatments they needed to save lives. Because he is in a trial, run according to strict protocol, we are not allowed to use Chaida’s full name or show his face. But after two weeks of daily pills, he has become a happy little boy with a cute grin and an infectious laugh. He capers around the ward and chases chickens in the hospital grounds. The doctors say he sings and dances. His father sticks both thumbs up at this reincarnation of the boy he barely remembers. “He couldn’t play with others. In the classroom he was sleeping all the time,” he says. He now intends to take his wife to the screening team. “My wife may also have sleeping sickness. She sleeps. She can’t cook well for the children.” If anyone suggests she is under a spell, he says: “I will tell them it is not witchcraft.” This belief that sleeping sickness is caused by sorcery has destroyed lives. Alfred Mpayambe, 55, was a fisherman in Mushie, with his own dugout canoe and an income that supported his wife and two children. Then he started suffering headaches, developed skin lesions and lost weight. Over two years, he spent 300,000 Congolese francs – roughly £146 - visiting health clinics (where he was told it was hypertension) and traditional healers (who said he’d been bewitched by his uncle). Alfred Mpayambe: ‘I thought it was witchcraft’ “I stopped working because it was very serious. My mother, my brother and friends thought I was going to die,” he says. Marie Kibuku Bizier, 74, his mother, was almost sure it was sleeping sickness. Her generation had seen a lot of it. “When he was ill he had many troubles and he was very aggressive,” she says. “He shouted that I was a witch. He even beat me. I ran away. That is why my brother was angry.” When the disease brings on its madness, family and neighbours believe the victim has been cursed. Witch hunts are not unknown and have sometimes ended horribly, with a blazing tyre around the neck of the accused. In the end, Alfred went to Mushie hospital, where Dr Tim Mayala, lead investigator there of the fexinidazole trial, diagnosed and enrolled him, at a very late stage. His left arm and leg were partly paralysed. “He was sleeping in the day and in the night. We had to take him to bathe, to wash or to clean his clothes,” says the doctor. Alfred took the fexi tablets he was given in hospital once a day for 10 days and was cured. His problems are not over: his arm is still too weak for paddling or fishing; his wife has left him; and someone stole his boat while he was ill. “I want my wife to come back but now it is not possible because I must bring money into the family,” he says. His uncle is still not speaking to him. “I must find a solution, because living this way is not good. My mother and I are just alone. We need to make it up, but my uncle doesn’t want that.” Dr Wilfried Mutombo Kalonji and his team. Dr Wilfried Mutombo Kalonji of DNDI, the coordinator of the trials, cannot forget two patients who died from melarsoprol in 2004, when he was a young doctor in Kasai province. It marks you. “Both men were about 20 or 25, and young and strong. I was the only medical doctor for about 800 people. They came in and we did the lab tests and found they had sleeping sickness and I gave them the only treatment we had. The guys started feeling worse and worse. They had seizures and confusion, went into a coma and died. “They come with their parents and they trust you. Sometimes the family will look at you like a criminal, as if to say: ‘You killed my son.’ This was a very, very bad experience. “Melarsoprol was terrible. We also had many relapsed cases. In Kasai, half the patients relapsed. Half were cured but half were not.” Kande, who rose to become the first director of DRC’s sleeping sickness programme, lobbied for diagnostic tests and treatments with the World Health Organization, donors, European tropical medicine institutions, NGOs and anyone else who would listen. The arrival of the Catt test was his first triumph. But he, like every other doctor who had nothing else to give his patients, was appalled by the deaths from melarsoprol. A sleeping sickness patient at Mushie hospital. “I asked the question at that time, at the WHO – ‘We don’t have drugs, the few drugs we have cause severe side effects, they kill, people die. What are we to do?’” he says. None of the pharmaceutical companies wanted to help. There was no chance of any financial reward. DNDI was set up in 2003 to find drugs for a group of tropical diseases for which there could be no profit for pharma. For sleeping sickness, it decided to trial a combination including a drug called eflornithine, which worked in the second stage but was prohibitively expensive – although it made money in the west in hair removing cream. Combined with other drugs as nifurtimox-eflornithine (Nect), less of it would be needed, making it cheaper. Clinical trials are complicated, bound up with rules and protocols that make them difficult even in Europe and the US. Running such a thing in the heart of DRC was at the very least ambitious. Dilapidated local hospitals had to be refurbished. Wards needed paint; they needed new, easily cleanable floors, better beds, an incinerator for hospital waste, microscopes, centrifuges, ECG machines to check the health of hearts, and other equipment to meet standards required in the western world. Hospitals had to be selected that were reachable by the small planes run by the Mission Aviation Fellowship, which transports aid workers. Local medical staff had to be trained in record-keeping and how to gain informed consent from a sick patient who cannot read or write and has no concept of what a clinical trial might be. “We developed tools and pictures, explaining in a very easy way,” says Dr Wilfried. “Most patients are poor. We provide food and the treatment is free. So to be fair, we give food and free care to all the patients with sleeping sickness, whether or not they are on a trial.” Nect was licensed with the help of trial evidence from DRC in 2009. But it has to be given through twice daily infusions by trained staff in a hospital for a week. The kit for one patient weighs 10 kilos. DNDI’s investigators were given access to some of the big pharmaceutical companies’ compound libraries, where records are kept of molecules that have been discovered but for which a commercial use has not yet been found. They hit on fexinidazole, which Hoechst, now part of Sanofi, had begun testing in the 1970s but abandoned when it appeared there was no longer a big market in the affluent west for drugs against infectious diseases. Pharma focused on cancer, heart disease and other chronic illnesses instead. Dr Helene works at Bandundu General Hospital. DNDI’s trial compared patients on NECT with those on fexi. The cure rate was much the same, but the advantages of fexinidazole were great. It works in both stages one and two, obviating the need for a painful, invasive lumbar puncture to identify the relevant type. It is in pill form, which makes it easy to transport and administer. The Congolese doctors are now waiting to hear whether fexi will be approved by the European Medicines Agency. It’s a triumph for the Congolese doctors, who are now moving into trials of another pill, which they hope will be a single-dose cure that patients could take at home. Dr Erick Miaka, with his tsetse fly trap. Dr Erick Miaka, the head of DRC’s sleeping sickness programme, says the hardest cases are the last ones – not only villagers in the remotest places, where motorbikes can’t reach, but also people in more accessible homes who don’t come for screening because they no longer fear it. He is looking forward to getting 15m tsetse fly traps in place on the rivers to cut the chain of transmission. “In 2019 it is necessary to intensify all the activities, if possible,” he says. He is proud of what they have achieved in DRC. It is a quiet triumph for a country that has such a bad image. “On the TV they talk more of the war in the east than the medical success story,” he says with a wry smile. https://interactive.guim.co.uk/docsdata-test/1bHJvQudK2K38GQ4kTihmIAhJ-oWOoAWEAqukn5KVjiI.json Commenting on this piece?

    "transcript": "The UK’s poppy appeal has raised nearly £3bn in today’s money in the 100 years since the end of the first world war, the Guardian has established, making the yearly autumn fundraiser one of the most successful street donation campaigns in the country’s history. People have given on average £1 every second for an inflation-adjusted amount of £2.89bn since the appeal fund was launched in 1921. Fundraisers say this armistice centenary year could bring in record donations of more than £50m. More than £1bn has been raised in the past 25 years alone, comparable to totals raised by Comic Relief and Children in Need respectively since their establishment in the 1980s. The appeal remains controversial, however. The newsreader Jon Snow refused to wear a poppy on air in 2006, decrying what he called “poppy fascism”, and in 2016, Fifa banned the England team from wearing them in World Cup qualifiers. This week, the Novara Media co-founder and Labour supporter Aaron Bastani called the poppy appeal “sickening”, saying “as a country, Britain spends £45m on poppies to feel good and help a worthy cause, while 13,000 ex-veterans are homeless”. Despite the charged debate, there has been the biggest spike in donations in the past decade since the end of the second world war. The money raised has gone to veteran care homes, family respite and advisory services, among other causes. More recently, with the realisation of the scale of mental health problems among military personnel following campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, attention is turning to mental health through the likes of Forward Assist, a Newcastle-based charity that helps with social integration of veterans. The proportion of personnel with a diagnosed mental health condition has almost doubled in the past decade. Lisa Gordon, 46, joined the army in 1990 and served for 11 years in Northern Ireland and Bosnia, before being medically discharged due to injuries and going on to experience social isolation and depression. “It was my own pride that was stopping me from accessing support,” she said, adding that Forward Assist helped her turn things around. “I was scared of people judging me, but as soon as I walked through the door there was no judgment whatsoever. I was among people that understood me. They put me back together and helped me find myself again.” Through group activities including nature walks and fishing, Gordon was able to connect with others who had had similar experiences. “The other veterans understood depression,” she said, “and a lot of the females were socially isolated too, so we helped each other”. Like Gordon, Bob Wilson also volunteers for Forward Assist. He experienced bouts of depression following 16 years of service, starting in Northern Ireland. “I saw some horrible things which play over in my mind, like when you see your best mate blown to pieces by a bomb and then you have to kill the dogs to stop them from running away with the bones. That’s not a nice thought to go through your head. “I do whatever they [Forward Assist] need me to do – driving or going fishing – as long as I’m doing something, I’m not thinking. We’re very grateful for the help the poppy appeal gives because places like Forward Assist have given me a community.” Royal British Legion research found veterans are twice as likely to become unemployed than civilians, resulting in about 120,000 being currently out of work. The Officers’ Association, which receives 60% of its money from the poppy appeal, has set up an employment app to help veterans find new careers, with almost 2,000 registering for assistance each year. One such former officer is Anthony Thompson, 31. After joining the Royal Marines in 2008 and completing two tours of Afghanistan, Thompson sustained an injury and was medically discharged in 2017. “I had a really awful transition from the military,” he said. “I didn’t feel supported. I applied to 256 positions over the seven months that I was unemployed and was unsuccessful in all of them.” A veteran friend recommended Thompson contact the Officers’ Association. “I started networking through the OA and things started turning around for me then … luckily I reached out before things went too far,” he said.",

    "transcript": "For Jon Brennan, all it really took was a mouth full of teeth. His life fell apart when he was 32. He was running a successful carpentry business, but alcohol and drugs had crept into his life, then slowly taken over. One day he came home to find his house empty. His wife, with whom he was raising two children, had packed her bags and left with the children. She left a note saying: “This isn’t what I signed up for.” “That just devastated me,” says Brennan, now 59. For the next 10 years, he drowned his sadness in even more drugs, spending his savings and losing his business along the way. A harrowing trip to the emergency department finally jolted him awake and he cleaned up. He was left with just one persistent problem from his chaos days. His drug use had taken a heavy toll on his mouth: his teeth were a mess. A counsellor introduced Brennan to Dr Jay Grossman, a dentist and the director of Homeless Not Toothless, a Los Angeles charity that provides free dental care to the homeless, as well as to veterans, foster youth and other at-risk groups. “My teeth were so bad, he decided to just get rid of the uppers,” says Brennan. “He went ahead and gave me a set of dentures.” It is a service that is not available to many in the homeless community, but good dental care – and specifically dentures – can transform a homeless person’s life, Grossman said by phone from his office in Brentwood. Providing people with false teeth can put them out of pain, prevent infection, and restore their sense of pride. And while dentistry in general can be expensive, a set of dentures is relatively affordable, and can last for a decade or longer. “I don’t want to take away from the importance of food, shelter and proper medical care,” says Grossman, who has been running Homeless Not Toothless since he founded the charity in 1992. “But even if we provided all that, and they have no teeth – so aesthetically they don’t look the part – what kind of job are they ever going to get?” Brennan noticed the difference immediately. With his dentures, he was finally able to eat properly, which improved his health. His pain was gone and he regained his confidence. “I could get out working again and not be embarrassed by my teeth,” he says. “A first impression is a first impression. We all say, ‘Well, I don’t judge people’, but everybody does.” The need for dental services in the homeless community is enormous, says Grossman, noting that Homeless Not Toothless has a waiting list of 900 people. A handful of other charities are trying to meet the demand in other parts of the world: an Irish dental technician fits homeless people for dentures on the streets of Dublin. In Houston, Healthcare for the Homeless offered dentures or other dental care to more than 6,700 people last year. And in Geneva later this month, the homeless charity Carrefour-Rue will begin offering free dentures to the homeless people who come to its weekly dental clinic. Its first patient, a man in his 30s, has lost all but six of his teeth. This week, a volunteer dentist will fit him out for a set of dentures in a small room at one end of the container-cum-health centre on the edge of Geneva’s Parc Beaulieu. Three weeks later, the prosthesis – which could last for a decade or longer, if the man takes good care of it – will be ready to wear. “I think he has no idea what he’s getting, but I’m certain it’s going to completely change his life,” says Dr Edoard Coquoz, a volunteer dentist who oversees Carrefour Rue’s dental services. Coquoz has already identified two dozen other candidates for the service. But he is sure the need is much greater. “Our goal is to help people re-establish their lives, bit by bit,” says Noël Constant, a ponytailed 79-year-old who is Carrefour-Rue’s director. “It’s a question of being able to chew, but also of appearance,” he adds. “Our society is very intolerant. It puts a huge importance on the way you look.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "date": "2018-11-07",
    "transcript": "When Sabrina Bugget-Kellum walked into a neighbourhood clinic in New York for a routine appointment in in 2016, she was desperate. Her son was in prison. She was trying to look after his two young children, who were aged one and two. Their mother was emotionally unstable. Bugget-Kellum did not want the chaos of the adults’ lives passed down to another generation. “We didn’t know if they would be safe with their mother,” she recalled recently. “I began to pray, please God, I need some help. There were so many things going on.” While at the clinic, Bugget-Kellum learned about a new parenting programme designed for carers of young children who have faced early adversity such as domestic abuse, homelessness or the loss of a parent to incarceration. “It was like I had my ammunition and I knew how to fight,” said Bugget-Kellum of the programme. The scheme, called Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-up (ABC), pairs parents with a coach trained in the needs of infants and toddlers who have experienced trauma. Bugget-Kellum’s coach reinforced simple techniques to form a healthy bond between adult and child, and helped her work through her own emotional wounds to create a less stressful environment at home. The results were so transformative, she said, that she started working as a parent coach for the same programme. “I have a son who is 26 and in prison, so I’m thinking maybe had I had an opportunity to get some of this, I don’t know, maybe I could have been more nurturing,” she said. “ABC gave me the confidence to say, you can do this. I don’t have to be angry with myself any more.” Traumatic or highly stressful childhood experiences are known to have lifelong emotional, behavioural and physiological impacts. Children who are abused, neglected, or exposed to conflict, violence and horror, are far more likely to have drink and drug problems, criminal records and perhaps resort to violence and abuse themselves. But researchers have also found that interventions such as the ABC programme can significantly buffer the damaging effects of stress and trauma, even at a biological level. A growing number of advocacy and public health organisations are working to bring “trauma-informed” approaches into the mainstream for doctors, carers and first responders. The crucial role of caring and calming adults Scientists are continuing to untangle the complex biological effects of childhood trauma on the brain and body. Research in the past decade points to “toxic stress” as the root of the connection between adverse childhood experiences (Aces) and health problems in adult life. The theory is that continuous or repetitive exposure to stressful situations through, say, domestic abuse, or growing up in poverty, causes the body’s natural fight-or-flight stress response to stay switched on. Researchers say that without the influence of a caring and calming adult the stress becomes “toxic”, and elevated cortisol levels change the functioning of the child’s brain, weakening the immune system and even altering the way a child’s DNA is “read and transcribed”. “This is the source that a lot of the problems in our society can be traced to,” said Leena Singh, programme director for the National Paediatric Practice Community on Adverse Childhood Experiences (NPCC), which has an office in San Francisco. “There is a saying in public health – we need to move upstream. This is the work that is the root of the root.” Singh’s organisation is working to integrate screening for adverse childhood experiences into standard paediatric primary care. The programme hopes to recruit 1,000 clinicians to screen 300,000 children for Aces over three years and is running pilot sites at six clinics across the US, with plans to add more. Singh says paediatricians have a vital role to play. They could refer patients for behavioural therapy or social support, but in medical schools they are rarely trained in the impacts of toxic stress. There are logistical hurdles to overcome too, such as how to add another process on to providers that are already overburdened, and how to bill insurers for time spent screening. NPCC says it is working through its pilot sites and member network to resolve those problems. It is also involved, through its parent organisation, the Center for Youth Wellness, with a clinical study on the effects of Ace interventions on certain biomarkers. Ultimately, Singh believes, their work could contribute to long-term shifts in the paediatric field. “If we can address and intervene early when some of these things happen in very young children we can actually prevent some of the risky behaviours and health impacts later in life.” A two-generation approach can short-circuit the cycle of abuse One of the main challenges in pushing the model further, say proponents of trauma-informed care, is the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the approach. Researchers, including the CYW group and Mary Dozier, creator of the ABC intervention, say they are working to fill that gap. “In some regards [Aces are] a universal experience,” said Leslie Lieberman, director of special initiatives at Mobilising Action for Resilient Communities (Marc), a collaboration between 14 American cities and communities focused on trauma-informed programmes. Many programmes take a two-generation approach to try to short-circuit the cycle of physical, emotional or substance abuse. Tennessee, for instance, is in the third year of its Building Strong Brains initiative, a $1.25m scheme to fund innovative Aces-focused programmes across the state. One programme funded under the initiative, called Thrive by 5, will conduct Aces screening on all pregnant women at the Baptist Memorial Hospital for Women in Shelbyville. Women who report four or more of the different types of childhood adversities (physical, sexual or emotional abuse, neglect, domestic violence, household substance abuse or mental illness, parental separation, divorce or incarceration) will receive programme interventions and parenting education. Another programme called Handle With Care, which started in West Virginia and since expanded, allows police officers to notify a child’s school if they are called to their home for potentially traumatic event like domestic abuse or a shooting. School officials don’t receive any incident details but the notice allows them to better respond to behavior changes or offer necessary support to the student. The “infant courts” are also expanding. Zero to Three, an advocacy group for early child development resources, started piloting “safe babies court teams” in 2005, and now has more than 20 sites across the US. The teams work with young children separated by the court from their parents, often because of abuse or neglect, providing developmental medical screening, mental health services and community advocates to ease the trauma of entering the foster care system. In Tennessee, they’re calling for drugs education in schools Parents can receive psychological services too to deal with traumas of their own – a study by such a team found that more than two-thirds of parents in the programme had an Ace score of four or higher. For families who are reunified, the teams’ work appears to have an impact. Zero to Three reported that maltreatment recurrence rates over 12 months among children in the scheme was 1.2%, compared with more than 9% nationwide. As part of its statewide initiative one Tennessee court is building a new programme based on the scheme, with an emphasis on preventing Aces in children stuck in the court system, and on addressing parents’ own childhood traumas. The opioid drug epidemic, which kills more than 100 people every day in the US, has also brought into focus Ace interventions tailored to families facing substance abuse. Vermont experienced a 40% increase in the number of children taken into care between 2013 and 2016; more than half of children under five in 2016 were there due to parental opioid abuse. The state’s Opioid Coordination Council has recommended an “intergenerational approach”, calling for expanded maternal health and infant care programmes for high-risk families to mitigate the trauma of children born to opioid-addicted parents, and drug education programmes in schools to help prevent addiction in the next generation. Tucked inside a bipartisan opioid epidemic bill just signed by Donald Trump, called the Support for Patients and Communities Act, are several federal provisions encouraging wider recognition of Aces and trauma-informed care. The bill calls for an “interagency task force” to identify best practices within three years for mitigating the impact of trauma on infants and children and to create a national strategy to improve coordination of trauma-informed care at a federal level. The bill also authorises the Department of Education to provide grants to schools for mental health programmes to help mitigate the impacts of childhood trauma. Experts say greater cross-sector collaboration and more funding is needed for trauma-informed care to really make a difference. “The lifelong manifestations of that childhood trauma are cross-sector – it effects educational outcomes, employment opportunities, it affects your health,” said Marc’s Lieberman. “You’re not going to make a population-level impact without a cross-sector approach.” That makes the execution of trauma-informed care inherently complicated. But at bottom there is a simple and revolutionary idea, says Lieberman: “It’s about moving from ‘what’s wrong with you?’ to ‘what happened to you?’” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-11-06",
    "transcript": "A mobile laundry and shower service for the homeless has begun international expansion after being inundated with requests from struggling cities around the globe. Four years ago two young Australian men saw a gap in the market and fitted out a van with a washer and dryer, driving it to parks, churches and drop-in centres in a bid to bring hygiene services to the homeless community on their own turf. Lucas Patchett, co-founder of Orange Sky, said washing was initially viewed as a low priority for the community, and there was widespread scepticism about the plan. “When we dreamed this up it was a world first, and we had a lot of practical issues to overcome. How would we power the machines, where would we dispose of the waste water?” says Patchett. “But we strongly believed that access to hygiene was a basic human right.” There are more than 100,000 homeless Australians, and the population has complex needs. Patchett says Orange Sky has been able to forge bonds with the community by bringing the vans to its doorstep, and because it has no agenda besides the straightforward, free services it offers. Health benefits of the mobile laundry include halting the spread of mould, scabies and bed bugs, but Patchett says it is the mental health boost that is most significant. “We’re not preaching anything, or teaching anything or pushing anything. But it does take an hour to wash and dry someone’s clothes and during that time people tend to hang around. That’s when the conversations start. “Ninety-nine percent of the day, these people are walked past and ignored and not even looked at, and that can have a huge impact on psyche and sense of self-worth. So we just say g’day and offer something really practical that makes people immediately feel more confident to engage with the broader society.” There are now 27 Orange Sky laundry and shower vans operating in Australia, using generators and solar power to run the machines. Operated by volunteers, they do around 15-20 laundry loads and showers each day. Last month Orange Sky expanded overseas, unveiling a van in Auckland, New Zealand, with plans to venture to the US next. It costs around NZ$100,000 (£51,235) to kit out a laundry and shower van. A number of other mobile laundry services have launched around the world, including in several US states, Brighton in the UK and Athens, Greece, where 20,000 people are homeless. Orange Sky has also been asked to provide services to Singapore, Hong Kong and other British cities. According to Auckland council, at least 1,000 people sleep rough in New Zealand’s biggest city every night, and Orange Sky’s expansion has been welcomed by those caring for the community, saying the service has been embraced. The New Zealand housing and urban development minister, Phil Twyford, said Orange Sky offered rough sleepers something many New Zealanders took for granted, and was one part of giving them back their dignity and self-respect. “While superficially the service is about clean clothes and showers, the main benefits are the social interactions,” said Twyford. Mike, one of the first clients to use the Orange Sky van in Auckland, said it was a relief to be able to wash his clothes and bedding, as well as himself, on a regular basis. “It is a bit tricky, it’s hard enough to find somewhere to live and something to eat, let alone find a place to wash your clothes and have a wash,” he said. “I think it’s a good concept … and it has a roll-on effect. Your clothes are clean, you’re clean and you feel good about yourself.” Patchett says homeless women find the service particularly valuable, as many struggle finding a safe place to shower in privacy. “There was a woman who came to shower and she said she hadn’t had a safe space to do that for a number of years,” says Patchett. “And even just being locked in the back of a van with volunteers out the front really gave her some peace of mind.” Another man who had not showered for more than four months moved his social worker to tears when he climbed into the back of the Orange Sky van for a few minutes of privacy and relaxation. Cities in New Zealand such as Wellington, Whangarei and Christchurch have been in touch requesting Orange Sky services in their towns, and Patchett says with enough funding and volunteers, the service will soon spread countrywide.

    "transcript": "When 200 captive-bred frogs were set free in an ancestral swampland in South Africa recently, their simple homecoming ceremony gave scientists several reasons to cheer loudly. The tiny Pickersgill’s reed frogs – each the size of an adult thumbnail – were making history of a kind, by hopping one step further away from the abyss of extinction. It was a small dose of encouraging news at a dismal time for conservationists. Study after study shows how human encroachment is annihilating wildlife and insect populations. The latest WWF estimate this week found that people have wiped out 60 percent of animal populations since 1970. The question is: can we become as good at saving species as we are at destroying them? In the case of the frogs, rapid expansion of farming and other development near the South African port city of Durban has reduced their remaining kingdom to a land area of only 144 sq km (56 sq miles). But thanks to captive breeding, the 20-strong population has multiplied tenfold in only one year in a project run by frog experts Dr Adrian Armstrong and Dr Jeanne Tarrant. They are not sure how many will reach old age in the wild, but the turbo-boosted population growth gives them hope that this threatened species has a better shot at survival, in combination with other conservation action. The Durban frogs are not alone in being on the brink of survival, and their rescue begs a question: can species be rescued by programmes like this in which they are bred in captivity? Worldwide, more than 26,000 wild species face extinction and are listed as such on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Dr Richard Young, head of conservation science at the UK-based Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, says the true number facing extinction is likely to be much, much higher, as scientists have yet to formally classify or assess the multiple forms of life on our planet. Of the more than 93,500 species assessed so far, Young says it looks like 41% of amphibians are threatened with extinction, along with 25% of mammal species, 13% of birds and 33% of corals. No surprise then that conservation experts are resorting to some pretty desperate measures to protect and multiply vulnerable species before it’s too late. Breeding them rapidly in captive or semi-captive conditions is one strategy, largely pioneered by Welsh ecologist and Durrell chief scientist Prof Carl Jones, who was awarded the 2016 Indianapolis Prize for his role in saving nine species of wildlife from extinction. Over the last 35 years, Jones and fellow scientists have been involved in projects to protect more than 50 threatened species, mainly in Mauritius and Madagascar. Numerous similar restoration projects are underway globally, says Dr Kathy Traylor-Holzer, senior program officer at the Conservation Planning Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). She says examples include the Iberian lynx in Spain, the Eastern sarus crane in Thailand, the Kihansi spray toad in Tanzania, golden lion tamarins in Brazil or American burying beetles in the US. And while the conservation benefits of captive breeding and other techniques to artificially boost the number of threatened species may seem obvious, there are still some question marks about just how far scientists should go in managing or manipulating the living conditions of species they are trying to save. Young and his Durrell colleague Dr Andrew Terry acknowledge that intensive breeding is “something of a last resort”. “These programmes are expensive, complicated and difficult,” says Terry. “If you are breeding species with the intention of putting them back in the wild, you have to monitor the outcomes very carefully and also ensure that you don’t introduce new diseases or pathogens back into the wild by accident.” Because they are dealing with species that often have very low genetic diversity, project managers must also guard against the potential for inbreeding. “You can’t always breed animals in captive conditions and simply open the cage doors. Sometimes they need a bit of time to adapt to predators and learn what to eat in their new environment.” He cites the example of the Pygmy Hog Conservation Project in Assam, India, where captive-bred hogs are released into a large enclosure containing plants found in their wild environment. “They still receive supplementary feed in the enclosure but we try to eliminate all human contact so that the young animals start to learn to support themselves. Then we move them to soft release areas to acclimatise, and to leave at their own speed. After three to four weeks, we find them coming back less often for supplementary food.” Young says the survival rate for captive-bred animals varies greatly, depending on the species: “With amphibians you expect a high mortality rate, but when we released ploughshare tortoises back to the wild, we experienced a near 100% survival rate.” Is there a point that should not be crossed with intensive management and other emerging de-extinction projects? “Yes, in my view, there probably is a line,” says Young. “We need to focus more on the species that are still with us, rather than those that are already extinct. There are possibly 70-80 Sumatran rhinos left alive, so it does not feel right to be investing in trying to bring the woolly mammoth back to life, instead of saving the Sumatran rhino.” Following the recent death of Sudan, the last Northern white rhino male, Edinburgh Napier University ecologist Dr Jason Gilchrist panned expensive plans to resuscitate extinct or near-extinct species. In an article published in The Conversation, Gilchrist argued that instead of investing in “Jurassic Park” technology, such money was better spent on protecting the Southern white Rhino, Asian rhinos and other threatened species. “You can’t just pluck a species off the extinct-shelf, like the woolly mammoth, and put it back in an ecological niche that no longer exists. But, we are facing an absolute crisis,” says Terry. “So there is also a place for new cutting-edge technology. Some might seem outlandish today, but in a few decades they will become commonplace.” “What we find so frustrating is that global biodiversity loss is happening under the radar, whereas there should be international outrage before it slips away,” says Terry. “It should be right at the top of the global political agenda.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-10-29",
    "transcript": "For the faithful greyhounds of southern Spain, life is fast, furious and often short. At the end of hunting season each year, thousands are rewarded for their efforts with a swift execution. Some are throttled with wire to save on bullets. Now, however, the movement to confront such barbarity is gathering pace as rescued greyhounds – galgos in Spanish – become more and more popular among hipster communities and city dwellers in northern Spain. As many as 2,000 animals are saved each year. Finding new homes for them used to be difficult, but not any more. According to Anna Clements, the co-founder and director of SOS Galgos, it is becoming more common to see young couples walking the dogs in Barcelona. “It is uplifting to see a happy galgo being walked in the city instead of how it used to be, when they miserably roamed the streets in search of food and water.” Rescuing galgos in distress is not always easy or possible. “We all know that someone who is cruel to an animal can become violent towards people and unfortunately hunting is widespread and popular in rural areas of Spain, so dealing with hunters is very unpleasant,” says Clements, while taking part in a rescue operation in southern Spain. Sometimes, dogs are rescued following a call from a member of the public. But sometimes dog owners get in touch themselves, Clements says. “They use emotional blackmail on the phone, saying ‘if you don’t take my useless dogs I’ll have to get rid of them’.” “There is a huge loop in the legal system which enables hunters to do as they please with their dogs and there is no concern from the authorities whatsoever.” Klea Levin, a Swedish former model and galgo activist, has also noticed a rise in interest in rescued greyhounds. “For a long time our awareness campaigns highlighted the horrible ways in which greyhounds are treated, showing images of mistreated dogs. This mobilised people from animal protection associations,” she says. “We realised, however, that we would reach a wider audience if we talked about this terrible situation but showed greyhounds as they really are – elegant and beautiful.” Levin has used her villa in the foothills of the Tibidabo mountain, in Barcelona’s exclusive Sant Gervasi neighbourhood, as a temporary home for rescue dogs: currently two greyhounds, Jungle and Nico, are awaiting adoption. Levin believes that the attitude towards greyhounds in big cities has changed since she arrived in Barcelona two decades ago. She says: “We see more and more greyhounds in the street. Not only has it become normal, but it has become something fashionable: my neighbourhood is full of elegant greyhounds.” “In Barcelona you don’t buy galgos, you adopt them,” says Levin. It does not matter if they are fast runners or good hunters. “The adopters want to know if the dogs are sweet and gentle, and white galgos are the most popular.” Marc Velasco and Marta Huguet are the founders of Brott Barcelona. They design collars for “modern dogs” and have two adopted galgos – Brot and Penny. “The owners care about the quality and style of the accessories because they mirror their lifestyle,” says Huguet. The galgo movement is also gaining momentum abroad. A march for galgos was organised in Germany earlier this year, and dozens of galgos are adopted each year in the US. Petra Postma lives in south-central Pennsylvania and has been working in international galgo adoption for almost 20 years, the first 10 years in the Netherlands. “Nine years ago I moved to the US and brought my personal dogs with me, within a year Sage [Save a Galgo Español] was born. When I arrived, there were maybe three or four organisations bringing galgos over occasionally. In recent years I have seen how many greyhound adoption groups have tried their hands at galgos: some successful, others not so much.” Clements says there is still a long way to go. Tens of thousands of creatures are thought to be destroyed in southern Spain alone every year. “We strive to maintain a balance, to not only do rescue, but also to work equally at lobbying for the situation to change,” she says. “There should be a strict census led by the authorities to regularly check how many dogs a hunter has and their whereabouts. This is not the case. There is a huge loophole in the legal system, which enables hunters to do as they please.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "It is said that the hardest thing you can do with a violin is play Paganini. But for Palestine’s foremost luthier, fixing instruments in refugee camps and using music to bring people together in a divided region comes a close second. Shehada Shalalda, 28, is thought to be the only professional sanie kaman, or violin maker, in Palestine. The other luthiers in Palestine specialise in Arab instruments. Thirteen years ago he was an unremarkable high school student growing up in the old quarter of Ramallah when he heard the aching strains of a single violin wafting up from a newly-opened music school. He was mesmerised and in that moment his life changed. Since that day, Shalalda spent hours in the Al Kamandjati music school, sometimes skipping school to be around the sounds. There, he learned how to fix and clean instruments and how to transform a piece of wood into a violin, planing away at the edges to bring out the curves and hollows, the f-holes and the waist. “I grew up in the middle of the war zone. I didn’t think I would survive,” said Shalalda. “Making violins offered me a way to remain alive. It was a chance to see the world and do something for my community: bringing peace through music.” At Al Kamandjati, he met Italian violin-maker Paolo Sorgentone, who invited him to study luthiery in Florence in 2008. “When I arrived in Italy, it was a shock and a surprise to see there weren’t checkpoints and soldiers with guns in the streets as in Palestine,” says Shalalda. “My friends and I had imagined that the entire world was like our country.” In Florence, he created his first violin. He continued his studies at Newark School of Violin Making in the UK. Shalalda returned home to Palestine in 2012 and set up a workshop in the Al Kamandjati music school, which is still just up the road from his house. Shalalda’s instruments are sold to customers worldwide. “This is a way to show that my homeland is producing beautiful handicrafts. Palestine is known only for conflict, but we also have a strong cultural tradition,” says Shalalda, who is back in Ramallah after participating in the prestigious International Triennale Violin Making Competition Antonio Stradivari in Cremona, Italy. It was the first time a violin made in Palestine was submitted to the competition. Bringing music where there is the noise of war moves him. He has repaired musical instruments in the refugee camps of his hometown Ramallah as well as in Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon. He plans to continue these efforts with his friend, Italian luthier Alberto Dolce. “The refugees have no potable water, no electricity. They are not allowed to work,” said Shalalda. “Music is an important tool to express their feelings, as a universal language.” Next February, he plans to go Gaza City, and repair instruments of the few music schools left standing after the Israeli airstrike of 9 August, which destroyed the Said Al-Mishal Cultural Centre. He has not yet received permission to go to Gaza. Almost 100 km separate Ramallah and Gaza, an hour’s car trip, but Shalalda will spend an entire day travelling as he cannot pass through Israel. He will probably have to fly to Egypt and then drive to Gaza. But he is worried that the Israeli security forces might close the borders and he will not be able to return to the West Bank, where his wife Buthaina and his three children Nabil, Juri and Omar will be waiting for him. “Music is a powerful instrument of peace,” says Shalada. “I won’t stop building bridges between cultures thanks to these beautiful instruments, violins.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Standing on a windswept beach on the north-west coast of the Isle of Man, Bill Dale looked out on to plastic bottles, cartons and packaging forming a thick carpet covering the shingle. It was 2007, the global plastic binge was already well under way, but the millions of tonnes of waste seeping into the oceans as a consequence had not reached the public consciousness. “I was with a friend and we thought, ‘Let’s just clean up this one beach.’ We had no idea then of the scale of the problem.” It took six weekends, working long hours, to collect all the plastic litter. “We shifted 30,000 plastic bottles and large pieces of plastic,” said Dale. “You would pick one piece up, and underneath was another and another in layers. Some of the stuff went back 20 years.” Today, as Dale stands outside an Edwardian summerhouse in the west of the island at Niarbyl bay, he believes Manx beaches are the cleanest in Europe. But the regular sweeps of the 100-mile coastline, conducted by his charity Beach Buddies, are just one facet of the island’s approach to ocean protection that makes it a global leader. In the charity’s visitors’ book, alongside comments from schoolchildren, teachers and parents, there is a signature that stands out: that of Dr Han Qunli, a senior figure within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). It was after his visit that the Isle of Man joined the likes of Mauritius, Menorca, Jeju in South Korea and Noosa in Australia in being singled out for a commitment to protecting and enhancing the coastal environment and biodiversity. The island’s determination to protect the coastal environment from the multiple threats of plastic pollution, climate change and overfishing has earned it the status of a Unesco biosphere region, designated because it is an outstanding example of a place where people and nature work in harmony. It is the only entire island jurisdiction to be granted the status. One indication of the islanders’ commitment to a better marine environment is the numbers that turn out for Beach Buddies. It has attracted 10,000 volunteers over the years – 12% of the Manx population. Dale said: “We have kids who come with their schools to do a beach clean, then tell their parents: ‘Dad, I want to go and do a beach clean on Saturday,’ and they bring their parents here. These beaches are virtually self-cleaning now.” For marine biologist Dr Fiona Gell, who grew up on the Isle of Man, the grim reality of what is happening to the world’s oceans is all too familiar. She has spent her life studying the damage being done to the sea’s flora and fauna, and has seen first-hand the devastation that means just 13% of the world’s oceans are untouched by the impact of humanity’s footprint. Now a marine scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Agriculture in the Isle of Man government, she heralds the steps being taken on the island as proof that all is not entirely lost. In 2011, there were just two protected marine areas in the seas off the island. But in the past seven years Gell and her team have been instrumental in throwing a protective ring around the island, increasing the number of marine protected areas to 10, which cover 50% of the inshore waters. From the Calf of Man, a tiny island off the south coast where seals sunbathe on the rocks and basking sharks swim in the summer, to Ramsey Bay in the north, these marine nature reserves restrict trawling and dredging by fishermen and other damaging activities, in order to protect sealife habitats. Looking out over Ramsey Bay, which in 2011 became a marine nature reserve covering 94 sq km, Gell points out the location of seagrass beds, horse mussel reefs and maerl beds that are once again thriving. “Seagrass has declined globally in a really scary way, particularly in the UK, since the 1920s,” said Gell. “It looks like a green meadow under the sea and has a really high level of carbon storage. It is also really important for juvenile scallops.” Each marine feature being protected and enhanced by the reserve creates diverse habitats that allow scallops, juvenile cod, lobster and other fish to thrive. And while in many areas the fishing industry finds itself at loggerheads with environmentalists, fishing businesses on the Isle of Man – which fish for king and queen scallops, brown crab, lobster and whelk – have been involved in drawing up the protective marine belt around the island, even if some had to be heavily persuaded at first of the case for the protection zone. Dr David Beard, chief executive of the Manx Fish Producers Organisation, is also a marine biologist. “Back in 2009, Ramsey Bay had been overfished, there was very little stock left in there and the industry volunteered that area to be closed for a period of time,” he said. “It was an important source of both king and queen scallops from a value point of view and because the whole area supplies the spats [young scallops] to other areas in the Irish sea it affects the recruitment of the other stocks.” The bay encompasses one of the most restricted fishing areas in the coastal waters, where dredging or trawling for scallops is banned throughout the year, except for two weeks before Christmas when up to 30 boats are allowed to go out. Each year the fishermen carry out a stock survey, so by the time they are allowed to fish they know the location of the highest quantities of scallops. “They get the highest value for the least impact,” said Beard. “It is a very low-carbon action because they know where to go and they are allowed to trawl for 20 minutes maximum, and it means there is less impact on the seabed. The fishermen know that if they destroy the seabed by overfishing you prevent the spat from settling, so you destroy the fishing, and it is a vicious circle.” Gell has been instrumental in trying to bring the public and fishing industry along with the conservation efforts. “We are trying not to impose from the top,” she said. “Each marine protected area comes from a lot of engagement with the local people. We go out all over the island to villages and towns and hold stakeholder meetings, with maps to discuss why an area needs to be protected, and to involve people and bring them onboard. It is a slow process but when I look back to 2008 and see what we have achieved I think it shows that people working together in communities can make a difference. “We have to stay optimistic. From my experience here over the past 10 years, I think we have shown people can get involved in a real community approach and can make a change.” As one of 52 Unesco island and coastal biosphere areas, the Isle of Man is focusing now with partners in Menorca, the Maldives, the Philippines and other islands on eliminating single-use plastic from their shores. If that eventually puts Bill Dale out of a job, he could not be happier. • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

So he took a camera to the streets of Tel Aviv and began filming conversations with citizens and posting them on YouTube. Gil-Shuster wanted to improve dialogue between the two sides, as well as educate outsiders about the realities of the conflict. “Part of the problem is Israelis and Palestinians are very cut off from each other,” he told the Guardian. Instead of coming up with interview questions, Gil-Shuster decided to solicit them from internet users around the world. Thus the Ask an Israeli/Ask a Palestinian Project was born. His first video asked people in Tel Aviv what they thought of the idea of a one-state solution to the conflict. In the six years since, he has interviewed thousands of Israelis and Palestinians across hundreds of videos and has racked up 44m views on his channel. Use of the vox pop – from the Latin term vox populi meaning voice of the people – is a common journalistic tool to provide a snapshot of public opinion, but is rarely used on such a large scale; Gil-Shuster produces new videos every week. Gil-Shuster, who self-funds the project, says he has strict rules to ensure it remains as representative of public opinion as possible. Admitting it is not an exact science, he says he tries to randomly select “the most average” people he can find on the street, ensuring a mix of different genders, ages and backgrounds. Soon after starting the project, Gil-Shuster went to the West Bank to seek the views of Palestinians, working with a Palestinian translator. The channel, which has more than 100,000 subscribers, has largely found popularity in Europe and the US. But Gil-Shuster says he often receives feedback from Palestine and other parts of the Arab world – some negative, some positive – with his videos getting a lot of hits in Saudi Arabia. Gil-Shuster, who works by day as an administrator at Tel Aviv University, does not shy away from asking the controversial or offensive questions requested by his viewers. If there is a common perception about an aspect of the conflict, he thinks there is value in putting it to people on street. “As a person involved in this conflict, I’m trying to figure out where perception meets reality,” he said. Once he has picked an interviewee, Gil-Shuster says all their answers are included in the video. “People say horrible things that I think make Israelis and Palestinians look horrible. It has to be included.” “I never cut or edit anyone,” he says. This pre-empts viewer criticism that he has chopped the videos to make a political point. He is variously accused of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian bias, depending on the video. But Gil-Shuster says he sees the project partly as a mirror for Israelis and Palestinians to hold up to themselves. He says the videos are a great way for foreigners to learn about the conflict. “If you want to understand a conflict, you need to know what it’s about,” he said. “You need to know all those small issues that are happening. Living in myth drives people to the wrong solutions.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "Let’s start with a letter. Not, on this occasion, from Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but from Helpful of Clacton-on-Sea. Jo Steranka wrote in to suggest seven specific ways that people can help in the struggle against climate change, environmental degradation and global warming. Of course, individual actions are hugely important. But so is the work being done by scientists, social entrepreneurs, innovators and activists. And this week we had a little something from each. In the Amazon, as deforestation continues apace and the frontrunner in Brazil’s presidential race eyes another swathe of destruction, we found scientists embarking on the long job of putting trees in the ground rather than taking them out. It’s too early to say whether this is the start of something. But reforestation is catching on around the world: from New Zealand to China, from Europe to west Africa, people are planting hundreds of millions of trees. They’re planting trees in India, too (remarkably, to celebrate the birth of girls) – but not nearly enough to make a difference to smog season, which is about to start in earnest. The reason air quality gets so bad at this time of year is partly down to the burning of farmland, to get rid of crop residue once the harvest is in. A number of enterprises have spotted a business opportunity in buying up the biomatter and turning it into useful stuff, as Rishika Pardikar found out. On the subject of making good use of the things that everyday folks leave behind, the Dyson awards published their shortlist of quixotic, sustainable inventions this week. Read all about them here. The best: a fork made out of potato peelings. What we liked Solar-powered cooking pots seem like a good idea, particularly when they can charge your phone. Thanks to BBC World Hacks for this one. And while we’re speaking of innovation, the New York Times took a look at a device that might make running easier. Could this bring us closer to a sub-two-hour marathon? What we heard I would like to implore you to look into writing about permaculture.

    "transcript": "Flying above the Tambopata River in a single-engine Cessna turboprop, the panorama is desolate. Jungle rivers are ripped open into a delta of sand dunes and stagnant, discoloured ponds. Ant-sized bulldozers roll down mud paths on the soggy moonscape dotted with glinting corrugated iron rooftops. Amid the roar of the propellers, Cesar Ascorra eagerly points to a cluster of newly planted saplings in the sand. They are evenly spaced, like a polka dot pattern, but the area they cover is dwarfed by the swathe of destruction carved by illegal gold miners. “It’s a start,” says Ascorra. “We’ve reforested 42 hectares (104 acres) of land deforested by illegal gold mining,” he says. The amount, so far, may seem like a proverbial grain of sand in a desert of carnage. In this region of south-eastern Peru, there was more deforestation last year than ever: 9,860 hectares or 38% of the total amount. Since 1985, the uncontrolled alluvial mining has destroyed nearly 100,000 hectares of rainforest, according to the CINCIA Amazon research institution. But the damage goes beyond felling trees. Around 180 tonnes of mercury are dumped every year into the rivers, lakes and soils of the biodiversity hotspot which was visited by Pope Francis in January, according to studies by Peru’s Artisanal Gold Council. As part of the reforestation experiment, scientists are trying out tree species which can survive in the sand left behind by mining. They are also using bio-char compost, made from locally grown Brazil nut shells, to block the absorption of mercury from the soil into the trees and to regenerate the topsoil. Among the saplings planted is the mighty shihuahuaco which could grow to be one of the tallest trees in the forest and is the preferred nesting place for the rare harpy eagle. Miles Silman, head of the Wake Forest Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainability which partners with CINCIA, says these are by far the largest trials of restoration on mined lands in the lowland tropics. The practice is not confined to Peru but is common in the forests of Brazil, Colombia and increasingly Venezuela, driven by its economic crisis. “Mining is about as destructive a land use as you could think of short of nuclear annihilation,” he tells the Guardian. “But, there are trajectories where it is a tragedy, full stop, and there are trajectories where you are left with a landscape that can heal for future uses.” At this experimental stage, the scientists are “looking at methods and technologies to address the problem at scale,” he explains. The next step, he says, is to work with the miners and communities to “implement them at scale”. The gold fever, which exploded after the 2008 global economic crisis and the metal’s vertiginous price rise, has brought tens of thousands of fortune-seeking migrants to the jungle from poor Andean regions nearby. While the use of mercury is cavalier and commonplace, some miners have been persuaded to try out new machinery which uses gravity separation and bypasses the use of the toxic heavy metal to bind with the gold. “They get more gold,” says Walter Torres, engineer with Peru’s innovation and technology institute CITE, in Madre de Dios. “At the moment they (the miners) are getting around 50%, with these machines they can increase their yield to 80%. That’s guaranteed.” The mining corridor stretches like a festering wound along the basin of the Madre de Dios river, and has spread to other rivers. But there are still provinces untouched by mining, such as Tahuamanu, at the intersection of Peru, Bolivia and Brazil, which has become a model for sustainable forestry. Some 70% of the province is made up of logging operations approved by the Forestry Stewardship Council, says Nelson Kroll, manager of the 220,000-hectare Maderacre concession, which supplies sustainable timber, mainly to Europe. “The way to go forward has to do with science and technology,” says Kurt Holle, the new director of WWF Peru who for two decades ran Rainforest Expeditions, an eco-tourism business in Madre de Dios. “You have to form citizens who want to do, rather than have to do, what is right for nature,” he says, citing his experience in engaging an indigenous community in nature tourism and creating a natural buffer against mining. Mining’s get-rich-quick appeal makes its spread seem inexorable, but some local people are fighting to secure their region’s long term survival. “We bring the science closer to the people to help them solve everyday problems,” says Ascorra. “There’s still a lot of green and the green is hope.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Deep breath. Autumn in India is smog season, the worst time of year for some of the world’s most polluted cities. There’s a reason for this. In addition to everyday problems such as traffic, industry, domestic cooking and road dust, this is the time of year when farmers set fire to their post-harvest fields. It’s called “stubble burning” – a cheap and easy way to deal with crop residue that needs clearing for the next planting season. Though technically illegal, it is rife across northern states like Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh – home to some of India’s most polluted cities: Delhi, Kanpur, Ludhiana and Allahabad. Some estimates say that stubble burning contributes as much as one quarter of the air pollution in Delhi over the winter months. A study conducted by Harvard’s John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences said: “On certain days, during peak fire season, air pollution in Delhi, which is located downwind of the fire, is about 20 times higher than the threshold for safe air as defined by WHO.” But now a slew of private companies are coming up with a range of offerings they say can help. A Hamburg-based company called Bio-lutions has set up a factory near Bangalore to convert agricultural residue into fibres that can be used for packing material and tableware. The end products could also help tackle the burgeoning plastic crisis, as they are as cheap as plastic to produce, and take about three months to biodegrade. As proof of concept, the company ran a pilot for about a year and a half where about 750–1,000kg of agricultural waste was procured each month from a farmer located in Mandya, Karnataka and used to manufacture about 4,000 boxes, which were sold to Big Basket, India’s largest online food and grocery store. “More than 95% of these farmers were burning such agricultural waste earlier,” said Maheshchandra Guru, director of Vikasana, a sustainable agriculture NGO that works with Bio-lutions. “Vikasana pays about 500 rupees per tonne of residue collected and per acre of agricultural land generates about 4-5 tonnes of waste, so they earn about 1,500-2,000 rupees additional income each month,” he adds. Other innovators are also working in the agricultural residue space. Papyrus Australia, an Australian company, has developed a technology that can convert the banana tree trunk into products like paper, packing material and furniture. The technology is especially welcome, considering the huge volume of farm waste on banana plantations in the world’s biggest banana producer. New Leaf is another innovator company based in New Delhi that is helping farmers use farm waste like rice husk and coconut shells alongside biomass like dung cakes to extract renewable energy in order to power cold-storage and ripening facilities. “The storage facilities are completely off grid and do not require diesel generating sets,” says Akash Agarwal, director and co-founder of New Leaf. “The machine uses about 40-90kg of waste a day to heat water, and using such hot water, it refrigerates 5,000-30,000kg of fruits and vegetables.” Named GreenChill, the bio-waste based cold-storage system and ripening chamber is installed on farm. “The facility is completely automatic in the sense that the farmer only needs to dump the waste into the system and it takes care of the rest,” Akash says. Sumanta Bagchi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, says that the rapid commercialisation of farm produce has resulted in a decline in the “pastoral use of farm residue”. “With initiatives like these, farm waste is being put to good use, especially considering how stubble burning contributes to air pollution,” he said. Speaking about Delhi in particular, Bagchi notes that during winters, windless weather conditions help trap airborne pollutants to initiate a smog over the city. “The pollution from crop burning from in and around Delhi only adds to this problem. So, with innovations like these, one of the factors of air pollution can be mitigated.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Eyes glued to the screen, mouths wide open, they watch the final scene of the Disney film Aladdin. When the movie ends, the faces of nearly 500 children turn gloomy and tears fall down their cheeks. They come from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, and the time has come for them to return to their tents and metal containers in the squalid Moria camp on Lesbos. No one is getting out of here on a magic carpet. Dozens of the 3,000 minors here have attempted suicide because of overcrowding, squalor and their hopeless situation. But one man is trying to make things a little better for the children abandoned on Europe’s doorstep. Moved by the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who made global headlines when his lifeless body was pictured lying face down on a Turkish beach, Salam Aldeen headed to Lesbos three years ago and dedicated his life to migrants. In a warehouse 200 metres from the camp, the Iraqi-Danish founder of the aid group Team Humanity constructed a playground, with inflatable castles and a small football pitch. Several hundred children arrive at 4pm, holding hands. “It was difficult for the children to leave behind what they were experiencing in the camp,’’ says Aldeen, who has recruited volunteers among the refugees in Moria. “They’d watch their Syrian parents quarrel with their Afghan neighbours, and they’d bring the same tensions into the playground. “We worked hard to try and convince them that in here, just as in the camp, we’re all the same: no colours, no religions, just human beings. And you know what? They understood it better than the adults.” In the evening, the volunteers set up a large screen where cartoons and films for children are shown in Arabic or Farsi. These are the final moments of peace for the children, who know that soon they will have to return to the camp, where the air is foul because rubbish is scattered everywhere and mothers sleep with knives under their pillows to defend themselves from rape. Ayat Abuznade, a 31-year-old Palestinian doctor who often visits Lesbos to volunteer, says the venture has given the children hope. “I saw hope and happiness begin to light up in these children’s eyes,” she said. “Day to day, I experienced children just being normal children, without any worry or fear showing in their eyes. This centre gives these children suffering hope and somewhat of a temporary normal life.” Aldeen has also devoted himself to saving migrants on the perilous journey to Europe. His name has become known across the Middle East, spoken of by people in destroyed homes in Mosul or at camps in Syria and Jordan. In January 2016, he was arrested in Greece and accused of aiding illegal immigration because, according to the authorities, one day he went too close to the Turkish waters to search for two sinking migrant boats. He spent 48 hours in jail but faced a trial that lasted two years. He was acquitted of all charges in May 2018 and eventually resumed his work. A few weeks later, a Danish businessman asked him what he would do with a sizeable donation. “I’d build a playground,’’ he said. “A place where the children of Lesbos could go back to being kids.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "At the end of a dusty road in the southern African hinterland sits a small concrete building with an orange door. It is a structure so modest and remote that it is hard to believe it could hold lessons for addressing one of the world’s biggest challenges. The unit is the medical hub for Gasita, a village of 2,000 people in the south of Botswana. Inside one of the rooms, pharmaceutical supplies are neatly stashed on shelves while a photograph of the country’s president, Mokgweetsi Masisi, is propped up on a counter next to a window that is ajar, letting in a warm breeze. Outposts like these – offering family planning services, contraception, education – have helped bring about one of the world’s most remarkable demographic shifts. In a continent where fertility rates are the highest in the world and populations are soaring, Botswana has a different story to tell. Fifty years ago, Botswanan women would have seven children on average. Now they have fewer than three. It’s one of the fastest falling fertility rates anywhere in the world – a dramatic decline that merits scrutiny. The world’s population is on track to hit 8 billion in 2023, and almost 10 billion by 2050. Sub-Saharan Africa is set to grow faster than anywhere: there were 1 billion Africans in 2010, but that number will grow to 2.5 billion by 2050. Some have warned that this growth risks “driving civilisation over the edge”, a controversial view given that it is rich countries, not poor, that lead the way on consuming the world’s resources. But enabling women to control their fertility – a move that almost inevitably leads to them having fewer babies – is not just about a tussle over resources, or the environment: it brings enormous ramifications for women’s health, education and employment – with knock-on effects for society and the economy. So what did Botswana get right? *** In a ground floor office at the University of Botswana, in the country’s capital of Gaborone, Dr Chelsea Morroni considers the issue. “Everyone is always asking how did this happen?” An expert in international sexual and reproductive health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Morroni has lived in Botswana with her family for five years. As founder and director of the Botswana Sexual and Reproductive Health Initiative, she spends her days delving into issues around fertility and contraception. But Morroni says understanding Botswana’s dramatic fertility decline involves teasing apart a complex web of factors. “There’s been a huge amount of change in Botswana,” she says, pointing out that since Botswana became an independent country in 1966 the landscape developed quickly, with high levels of economic growth and development of both healthcare infrastructure and education infrastructure, enabling young women to become educated and have employment opportunities. “All of those things on the macro level are really important to fertility declines anywhere in the world,” says Morroni, whose work is part of the Botswana UPenn Partnership: a collaboration between the Botswana health ministry, the University of Botswana and the University of Pennsylvania. But the country made more direct strides, too. “Botswana also was very proactive in the early years in establishing a family planning programme, so in setting up a programme that was far-reaching in terms of its geographical reach, providing access to most people in the country to a range of contraceptive methods,” says Morroni. Maternal and child health and family planning services were integrated from the outset more than 40 years ago. A suite of contraceptives are now available through facilities ranging from the most rural health posts to urban hospitals. An NGO, the Botswana Family Welfare Association (Bofwa), works with the government to reach out to even the most rural of locations around the country to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services, particularly among young people. There are other considerations, too. The infant mortality rate decreased from 97.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1971 to 17 in 2011, while an increasing proportion of the population living in urban settings could also play a role: fertility rates are generally higher in rural areas. And there is another issue. “Botswana … has been very hard hit by HIV, one of the hardest hit countries in the world,” says Morroni. And as she points out, research suggests there is an association between HIV infection and reduced fertility, although how much of contribution that has made to the steep fertility decline is very difficult to say. “Luckily with the advent of universal access to antiretroviral therapy we are seeing a narrowing of the gap between fertility in HIV infected and uninfected people which is really, really a step in the right direction,” she says. All of which mean that women like Chyna are becoming statistically rarer. “I have seven children and all the time I was bearing these seven children, there was never a break in between eight years,” says the 30-year-old, sitting inside the Gasita room, the fabric around her hair bright with the colours of the Botswana flag. A single mother, Chyna found respite from multiple pregnancies through the work of Bofwa. “I eventually got to find out about the implant from Bofwa – I asked for help because the pregnancies were getting out of hand and, knowing myself, if it wasn’t for the implant I would still be pregnant now,” says Chyna, speaking through an interpreter. “I am very, very grateful. My only problem is that I have got so many kids that I can barely take care of [them]. They need clothing, they need to be fed.” While the health post is government run, Bofwa makes a visit about once a quarter to Gasita and nine other settlements around Kanye, led by nurse and midwife Phenyo Ntoko. These outposts are replicated across rural Botswana, where women are increasingly keen to embrace contraception, including the implant which sits in the upper arm and lasts for years. Their priorities are as individual as the women themselves. For some it is about preventing pregnancies at an early age, for others the main goal is to space children. Many women gathered at the health posts said they only want two, with many years between them to help them raise their first child well. Despite the complex range of factors behind the dramatic fertility decline, and the fact that different countries have different political histories and cultural and social influences that make comparisons difficult, Morroni believes other nations could take a leaf out of Botswana’s book. “From my perspective it is really about having the political will for the development and implementation of a high quality family planning programme with reach,” she says. A World Bank report on Botswana’s fertility revolution says myriad other factors contribute to a more measured approach to family planning: the education of girls, encouraging women to enter in the workforce, and reaching individuals in their homes by means of visits by family welfare educators. Una Ngwenya, the chief executive of Bofwa, agrees that the family welfare educators were a key factor behind the fertility decline. But, she adds that national averages don’t tell the whole story. “Where I work, mothers still have six kids,” she says. “People tell you in Botswana you have an average of women having two kids – I ask you, where? I cannot see that. “We are one of the most unequal countries in the world – what happens here in the big villages and in the cities, does not necessarily happen in Lorolwane,” she adds, referring to a remote village beyond Gasita, as yet without electricity. A member association of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Bofwa receives core funding from the organisation, as well as some government funding and contraceptive commodities and antiretroviral drugs from Botswana’s Ministry of Health and Wellness. Other partners include the Positive Action for Children Fund from private firm ViiV Healthcare. “We have five centres,” Ngwenya says, ticking off sites around the country. “It gives me satisfaction to see a group of girls speaking very confidently about how they want to make their choices.” Ngwenya rejects the idea that contraception is being pushed on women, pointing out that communities are impatient for Bofwa to work with them. “It used to be difficult to go into a community and talk about about contraception. Now they even [say] ‘hey you are taking too long, come to our community, we need you people here, now’,” she says. But Bofwa has had to close at least two centres because of Donald Trump’s reinstatement of the controversial “global gag rule” which prevents US federal funds going to any group that performs or even provides information about abortions. Among the Bofwa services suspended are projects specifically engaging with populations, including sex workers and men who have sex with men, as well as another working with vulnerable children. “Ah, that was such a blow,” says Ngwenya with a sigh. “The impact of the gag rule was so much on the clients, but also on Bofwa’s reputation. It really impacted our work in a very negative manner.” Bofwa does not provide abortions, but it does counsel women who might be seeking one – which is legal under certain conditions in Botswana – and those who have had an abortion. “For me, it is rewarding to see Bofwa help one girl to terminate a pregnancy that came from incest,” says Ngwenya, adding that improving understanding of when abortion is currently legal is important. “We want the community to know their rights,” she says, noting that the team see cases of young teenagers becoming pregnant. “Our research tells us there is a lot of need here. What has happened to these kids? Could it be rape, could it be defilement?” Nonetheless, Ngwenya is sanguine. “Bofwa is a very resilient organisation, we have been here for 30 years and we will go on for a good while to come.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Eduardo Marina was harvesting in the peanut fields with all the adults in his family when he smelled the smoke. Raising his head, he saw that Missira, his village in southern Senegal, was burning. Marina ran towards the fire. The children were still in the village, being babysat by his eldest daughter, Satou. Gathering them up, he and the whole family ran through the forest and over the border into Senegal’s tiny southern neighbour, Guinea-Bissau. That was in 1991. They have never been back to Missira. Ever since, they have lived with thousands of others in limbo in Guinea-Bissau, waiting for a nearly four-decade conflict to end. Now, they are on the verge of becoming full Guinean citizens, as beneficiaries of a sweeping policy that stands in stark contrast to many countries’ reluctance to take in those fleeing war, persecution and poverty. Seven thousand refugees will join Guinea-Bissau’s 1.8 million citizens, equivalent to the UK naturalising 256,000 refugees at a stroke. The government made the declaration last December and approved it in July. Since then the UN refugee agency has been working with a local contractor to produce and distribute ID cards, naturalisation and birth certificates for the refugees and their children, most of whom have never known any other home except the verdant, Creole-speaking, gumbe-playing country they grew up in. “They were facing the risk of being stateless because of having no documents,” said Mamadou Lamine Diop, the UNHCR’s recently appointed chief of mission in Guinea-Bissau. “It can be a lesson to others: how Guinea-Bissau managed to get rid of its caseload.” When he arrived, Diop realised that a major obstacle to getting the refugees naturalised was the astronomical amount the government wanted in order to turn each one into a citizen – 900,000 CFA (£1,230) per person. Under his leadership, the UNHCR managed to negotiate down to 150,000 CFA. UNHCR is trying to raise this amount – $2m (£1.52m) in total – from donors. Without it the organisation cannot start processing ID cards. “Just imagine how much money we can save and redirect to other people in need,” Diop said. As well as the money, dysfunctional Guinea-Bissau hopes to reap a much-needed reputation boost with the policy. Before the villagers fled, armed rebels fighting for the independence of Senegal’s southern strip had been coming to Missira regularly, demanding animals and warning people to get out. When they arrived in Guinea-Bissau, Marina and his family headed straight for the village of Pelundo, where they had old family ties dating from colonialist days, when Guineans used to go and work in French peanut fields. They were a hungry, ragged group by the time they got there. “We only had the farming clothes we were standing up in,” said Marina, now a meticulous 73-year-old who became the village chronicler, keeping track of local fortunes in large notebooks. “We managed to take the children. That was all.” Nevertheless, he said, Pelundo welcomed them in. “The villagers here said we had complete equality,” he said. “They even gave us posts – I was the secretary of the village football club.” He gestured at Pelundo’s simple earthen streets and its veranda-ringed houses. “This was common land. If you had the money, you could build a house on it.” Marina is looking forward to being a citizen – he cannot imagine ever being able to return to Senegal. “I don’t dare go back,” he said. “The rebels come and go – you think it’s peaceful and suddenly they strike.” For Satou, his daughter, naturalisation is less about safety and more about identity. Now 39, she was babysitting at the age of 12 when the rebels came to burn down their village. “My ID is Senegalese, but now I’m Guinean,” she said, balancing a baby on her hip. “I’m from here. I wouldn’t want to go back. The villagers see us as locals now – in fact they always have done.” Their old village, Missira, is one of 64 that have been wiped off the Senegalese map. Scouts who have gone to look for it say the streets have become forest and the houses are completely gone. The only way you can tell it was once inhabited is by the clustered fruit trees that drop their mangoes on the forest floor, with no one there to eat them. With the Marinas now happily integrated in Pelundo, Missira will probably stay that way. But not all of the refugees in Guinea-Bissau feel the same. Some still long for home, decades after leaving – not every village has been as generous as Pelundo. In Tarero, as the families who fled expand, land is running out. “As you harvest your crops, the locals are sowing theirs right behind you,” said Lansana Tiara. “There is hospitality, but it’s limited.” Land rights are often a highly contentious issue for newly minted citizens, as in the case of Tanzania when it offered 200,000 Burundian refugees citizenship in 2015. Guinea-Bissau’s $270 per refugee includes a sum for integration, to which land is key, but it cannot solve all land-related problems. For many, the border between the two countries is a frustrating colonial relic, and the whereabouts of “home” is complicated. “In colonial times, my father was forced to work planting trees in Guinea-Bissau, so the whites could walk in the shade,” said Nfally Tiana, puffing on a pipe in his 1970s-style flowery robes. “He ran away to Senegal. I fled Senegal to come here.” Tiana’s father told him stories of the time before colonialism and borders, when after work, the men used to rest under a large tamarind tree. “Maybe if this had never happened, we’d be sitting under that tree now,” he said.

    "transcript": "Beer might come with a head, but it doesn’t often come with a heart. But nestled in the Bohemian hinterland, the Pivovar Chříč is not your average brewery. For one thing, it is staffed almost entirely by mentally and physically impaired workers. For another, it diverts all its profits to funding a primary school. Petr Jakubicek is the brains behind the enterprise, tucked away in a village 50 miles west of Prague. A brewery was established on the site in 1573 before being closed by the Nazi occupation authorities in 1943 in a move to requisition grain to feed German forces on the eastern front. It was later converted into a collective agricultural enterprise and stripped of its beer-making machinery by the communist authorities who came to power in what was then Czechoslovakia after the second world war. Reopened in 2016, it is once again producing beer, courtesy of a workforce previously unable to find work because of their disabilities. The idea for the enterprise was hatched by Jakubíček and his wife Jana as they sought a business model that could provide work and meaning for disabled people in the area, mostly resident in a state facility in the nearby village of Zavidov. “It’s a big problem in this country that we have social institutions that are full of people physically capable of working,” said Jakubíček, 39, an NGO specialist from Prague with experience of devising programmes for the disabled. The initial plan was for a sheltered workshop producing wood or ceramic products, before commercial opportunities in what is the world’s most enthusiastic beer-drinking nation pushed the project in a different direction. “We had a business manager who was worried about how to get out of the red,” explains Jakubíček who revived the long-derelict brewery facility with the help of Propolis, a Czech civic group. “We had some examples of good practices regarding social business plans. With wood and ceramics, you may find customers buying it once, but with beer we knew they would want to buy it forever.” Wheeling crates of beer from a cooling room, Vašek Stark acknowledged his debt of gratitude to the enterprise. Stark, 62, has resumed full-time work for the first time since he was 20, when his career as a specialist machine operator was ended by a road accident that left him with serious brain injuries. “I like the idea that the brewery is here,” said Stark, one of about 20 mentally and physically impaired workers. “I would have liked to have worked before but I couldn’t because I had to take care of my parents.” Workers fulfil a variety of tasks, including bottling, labelling, cleaning and delivering, on the basis of individual suitability, and the production process is overseen by a seasoned brewer with 40 years’ experience. All receive a minimum wage of 12,200 Czech koruna (£420 a month), with the higher skilled earning more. More valuable, says Jakubiček, is the esteem gained by the workers. “The most important thing is that working here gives them a sense of pride,” he says. “It gets them out of the institution, where some residents are more severely handicapped. Some of them might not know the value of money, but most of them can read and write.” The result is a thriving brewery producing half-a-dozen varieties of lager, stout and ale – including an IPA called Mahatma in honour of Gandhi – which is sold to pubs and licensed premises in cities such as Prague and Plzen. Demand is increasing, Jakubíček says, thanks to word of mouth and customer satisfaction in a highly competitive Czech beer market dominated by long-established breweries such as Pilsner Urquell, Krušovice and Staropramen, all of which have been bought by foreign owners in recent years. About 120,000 litres (240,000 pints) of beer have been produced so far this year, with plans to increase production and perhaps recruit more workers. The profits have helped fund the establishment of a primary school next to the brewery, filling a gap left by the closure of the village’s previous state school 10 years ago. Eighteen pupils – aged from six to 10 – are taught in a single classroom along non-traditional teaching principles based on Montessori methods, overseen by Jakubicek’s wife, Jana, a qualified teacher.

    "date": "2018-10-04",
    "transcript": "Britain’s leading Muslim organisation has launched a scheme to train women for leadership positions in mosques and community bodies. Twenty women have embarked on the six-month intensive programme run by the Muslim Council of Britain, aimed at equipping them for leadership positions. As well as one-to-one mentoring, the women will visit “best-practice mosques” and be given media and public speaking training. A national conference in Manchester this weekend on the future of mosques, organised by the MCB, will include a session on the participation of women on boards of trustees and other bodies running places of worship and community programmes. Few mosques in the UK have women on their trustee or management boards, and men outnumber women on all charity trustee boards by two to one, according to the Charity Commission. The MCB said: “This lack of diversity is unacceptable and it is essential for the management boards of mosques and third sector organisations in general to reflect the communities that they serve in order to function effectively.” The initiative comes as some Muslim women are demanding equal access to and greater involvement in running mosques. More than a quarter of mosques in the UK have no facilities for women, and in the remainder access is often restricted and the space they are allocated is limited. In August, Scottish Muslim women launched a campaign for equal prayer space and inclusion in decision-making bodies. The Scottish Mosques for All campaign said: “It is unfortunate that many mosques fail to provide basic access for Muslim women to use the facility to pray, or the quality of the space can often be inadequate and not suitable. “It is also unfortunate that many mosques have limited or no women present at mosque trustee or managerial level, either intentionally preventing women from taking up these roles or not sufficiently providing a welcoming atmosphere where women feel comfortable to get involved. The place and role of women in mosques is in real crisis in the UK and elsewhere, and this status quo must change.” Another organisation, Open My Mosque, is calling for a commitment from mosques to equality, and the Bradford-based Muslim Women’s Council is raising funds for a mosque led and governed by women, “based on the principles of openness, inclusivity, social justice and sanctuary”. Andleen Razzaq, a former trustee of Al Manaar mosque in west London, who is lead facilitator of the MCB’s women in mosques development programme, said: “Muslim women are doing amazing work in the community, but often have no experience of being trustees or on decision-making bodies. We need to have big conversations around the barriers to women. Most are cultural; in Islam, men and women have equal spiritual standing. “We can see the direction things are moving in. Women are feeling more empowered – their voices cannot be ignored, the momentum is definitely there. Young women in particular are hungry for change. If men won’t welcome them, women will be tempted to create their own spaces.” All mosques should “reflect the values of equality, inclusivity and diversity”, she added. Ghazalla Hussain, who is taking part in the programme, said it was helping her build her confidence and “believe in myself a bit more”. “A lot of mosque committees don’t understand what women want or need. But I think they know times are changing, and they have to change too,” she said. In a speech on International Women’s Day in March, Harun Khan, the MCB’s secretary general, backed calls for gender equality. It was “time to ensure that everyone understands their own responsibility in achieving equal access and opportunities for men and women in British society today”, he said. Referring to domestic violence, pay inequality, abuse and harassment, he said: “Closer to home, why is Muslim civil society still full of many mosques that only have prayer spaces for men and none for women, as if to imply that prayer and a sense of community is only for men?” The marginalisation of women in mosques was “simply unacceptable”, Khan added. The MCB’s training programme for women will be reviewed at the end of the current pilot scheme, and there are plans to offer a similar programme to men in the future.

    "title": "'They have been failed': first UK school to address early-life trauma planned",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/01/they-have-been-failed-first-uk-school-to-address-early-life-trauma-planned",
    "date": "2018-10-01",
    "transcript": "The UK’s first school for children who have experienced early-life trauma such as neglect or abuse and are currently being failed by the education system could open within two years. The short-stay school would provide children aged four to seven with therapy and education to prepare them to rejoin mainstream schooling. The proposed Your Place academy in Norwich has had input from leading psychiatrists and psychologists and aims to create a template that could be copied elsewhere. Harmful early experiences including physical, sexual or emotional abuse, loss of a parent or exposure to drugs or alcohol in the womb can have a significant impact on a child’s social and emotional development. Schools often respond with behaviour management approaches such as isolation booths or, if those fail, expulsion. Existing alternative provision tends to be for older children and of variable quality. Daniel Thrower, an executive headteacher with the Wensum Trust, the academy chain behind the proposal, said: “Children experiencing significant early-life trauma have been typically failed in UK schools. This is not the school’s fault. “We wish to use and build on the knowledge we have gained through a two-year pilot project and combine this with the findings of the latest brain-based research, to support those children more effectively and, through the training arm of the school, educate and support fellow professionals.” The pilot project, funded by Norfolk county council, resulted in 83% of children with the highest level of need avoiding exclusion. However, the pilot – an outreach project – also demonstrated the need for a permanent facility. Anne Oakley, who works with children with developmental trauma and attachment difficulties in Norfolk schools and is part of the Your Place team, said: “The work we do has to be repetitive because you’re altering the structure of the brain, so it has to be really regular. Rather than the bolted-on once-a-week session it has to be many times a day. That’s the real difference.” As well as helping troubled children and their families by preventing exclusions, the Your Place team estimates it can deliver £8.7m of savings within five years. If one were opened in each of the 152 local education authorities in England and Wales, this would translate to £1.3bn over the same period. The benefit over the longer term would be far greater as the figures do not take account of potential costs such as demands on the health, welfare and criminal justice systems. The proposal is for a school with 32 places, half of which would be full-time, with referrals from social workers, teachers or parents. Pupils would be accompanied by a key person from their mainstream school, most commonly a teaching assistant, who would help them transition smoothly between the two sites. Thrower anticipates most children would attend for a term or two before being ready to rejoin their mainstream school. The school would work with families to ensure the home environment is stable and outreach provision would continue, including with former pupils. The academy is waiting for the backing of Norfolk county council to submit an application to the Department for Education next month. If successful, it could open in the 2019-20 school year. Peter Fonagy, the chief executive of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families (AFNCCF), said at least 50 years’ worth of research had shown the impact of early life trauma on subsequent development. “School is probably the most important and appropriate platform for intervention available to us in society,” he said. “So making a school for these children therapeutic is, to me, the only logical solution we can offer these children to rescue them and ensure they have the life they deserve to have.” Fonagy has advised the project and, if it comes to fruition, the AFNCCF and University College London, where he is head of psychology, will carry out research on the outcomes for its pupils. Other backers include Adoption UK – adopted children have typically had adverse early experiences and are disproportionately excluded from school – and Dr Bruce Perry, a psychiatrist at the Child Trauma Academy in Houston. Thrower said responses from parents had been positive, with some even wanting to move to Norwich so their children could attend. Chloe Smith, the Conservative MP for Norwich North, who helped secure the backing of all Norfolk MPs for the project, said: “Unfortunately in Norfolk we have a disproportionately high number of excluded children and this is the kind of solution I think can be good for our county but also revolutionary nationwide.” Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Norfolk and a health minister in the coalition government until 2015, said the trailblazing nature of the proposed school meant it did not fit neatly into the current education framework, particularly for funding, but he hoped it would get the go-ahead. “Norfolk, through a gap analysis, identified the need for more provision for trauma children,” he said. “The resulting pilot study funded by the local authority was so successful and cited the need for the school. I am sure the successes Norfolk have had will help them overcome the funding challenge and use the savings already generated to support the school.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Rare is the DIY dilettante with the foresight to know they are never going to use the rest of that paint they stashed in the shed after doing up the living room. Who hasn’t kidded themselves that they really are going to touch up all those grubby spots with the leftovers in years to come? With an estimated 50m litres of paint going to waste each year in the UK (that’s enough to fill 20 Olympic swimming pools), we are all guilty. No wonder the average home is thought to have at least 17 half-empty pots gathering cobwebs under the stairs. Enter Community RePaint, a network of 74 projects which aims to reduce the paint going to landfill. Founded in Leeds the network wants to cut household hazardous waste and provide a cheap way for charities, community groups and low-income households to freshen up their walls and woodwork. Like the repair cafes that fix broken appliances the movement is growing fast as people turn away from the throwaway culture and try to put less in the rubbish bin. One of the largest RePaint schemes is run by ReciproCity, a social enterprise on the Wirral which has evolved from a building materials swap shop into a budget decorators’ paradise. Last year they received 81,100 litres of paint, donated by members of the public, manufacturers and trade wholesalers. The paint is piled high inside their warehouse near Birkenhead, a democratic jumble of brands and finishes: 2.5 litres of Little Greene traditional oil gloss in Bone China (RRP £65) sharing a shelf with the Wilko equivalent, Pearl Grey, which costs barely a tenth of the price. In the RePaint world all paint is equal, whether recommended in Elle Decoration or sold in B&amp;M Bargains. All paint brands are sold here for £1.20 a litre and sample pots are ten for a pound. Before resale the paint is checked by ReciproCity’s eight members of staff to ensure there is no mould and that it is exactly what it says on the tin, says Rebecca Owens, who set up ReciproCity 10 years ago with her partner, Mike Close. It is pot luck whether they have the colour you are after and in the right quantity. But that is where their new paint recycling project comes in. Two years ago they joined forces with a company called Newlife, whose founder, Keith Harrison, an industrial chemist, cracked the enigma code of the paint world: how to reprocess waste paint back to a superior grade emulsion. Harrison patented the process and guards it jealously; the Guardian was not allowed to take close-up photos of the equipment or ingredients, lest his rivals figure out his secret. But what we can tell you is that it involves big plastic barrels, a massive whisk, some sort of filter and a sprinkle of additives to increase shelf life. “Mike says it’s a mixture of art and science,” says Owens, who professes herself a “rubbish” paint reprocessor. “I tried to make a duck egg and it turned out navy. It’s not a job for monkeys. There’s a definite art to mixing the colours.” The recycled range, called ReColour, has a selection of 20 shades with the requisite silly names: silver sonnet (a mid grey), gilbert green (mossy), powder puff (a Germolene pink). A 5-litre tub of colour costs £9 and it’s £6 for white or magnolia; a bargain compared with commercial prices – 5 litres of Farrow and Ball’s Sulking Room Pink is now a staggering £78. Prices are even cheaper for charity shops who buy wholesale to sell on to their customers. Greys are the top-seller locally. “We can’t get enough grey,” said Owens. “Apparently we sell a lot more red than the other ReColour outlets down south too.” Last year ReciproCity managed to redistribute 65,100 litres of the paint it had received – 28,500 of which were recycled into ReColour. Owens’ only frustration is that they end up sending all the empty plastic tubs to landfill (though the metal tins can often be recycled). Anyone can buy ReColour, regardless of income. But some housing associations give new tenants vouchers to buy the paint when they move into a property. In Greater Manchester, the RePaint branch is operated by Rochdale Boroughwide Housing, which offers a 10% discount to its residents. You have to put any paint snobbery to one side when buying ReColour. A look around the Wirral paint mixing plant shows what a mongrel the finished product can be: the batch of Bailey Blue that Close has just finished appears to be a mixture of Crown, Dulux and Homebase own brand, all from tubs with less than a litre left upon donation. But feedback from decorators is good, says Owens. “We would never use a whole barrel of budget paint to make a batch of ReColour because it would be too watery,” she says, while issuing a warning to those who always believe you get what you pay for. “We have learnt a lot about the quality of what’s on the market. I can’t name names but there are some budget paints which are much better than you might think – and vice versa.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "So the world’s in a mess, the country’s gone to hell and we’re all doomed, right? Wrong. The optimism of youth appears unaffected by our gnarled grownup worldview. And remarkably, young people seem to most optimistic in parts of the developing world. An Ipsos survey found, for example, that 90% of teenagers in Kenya, Mexico, China and Nigeria were hopeful about the future. “Young people believe in the Nigerian dream,” said Olasupo Abideen, a social activist. “We are trying to change the rhetoric around how Nigeria is being perceived. As a result we are always optimistic, we are focused and we have energy.” Of course, optimism will vary depending on where you are. This week, Guardian correspondents reported from two African countries showing promise in terms of jobs and growth, and asked whether their success might be replicable elsewhere. Half the world away, in the north of England, the problems young people face concern not just jobs but homes as well. Our reporter Mattha Busby caught up with a social enterprise trying to kill those two birds with one stone. Speaking of two birds and one stone, a British charity called Think Ahead is trying to do something about the lack of mental health resources and career opportunities for young people. Its first cohort of young mental health social workers graduated on Friday, as our reporter Ammar Kalia found out. What we liked With the anniversary of the #MeToo movement pulling into view, the Christian Science Monitor took a global look at all kinds of ways of teaching men how to treat women with respect, from anger management classes in Mexico to lapel badges on Japanese schoolgirls’ coats. The New York Times, meanwhile, investigated Israel’s attempts to come up with solutions to the perennial issue of drought. What we heard This is what happens when the media, our guardian, dig in deeply to the lives of the everyday people. We learn about the wonderful things going on. Out of the reach of pyramid pinnacle politics. Because people feel the huge need to simply be human. To share ideas with one another. To get out and do things.

    "transcript": "On a recent home visit, Levi Chambers-Cook came upon a harrowing sight. “I found someone after they had just taken an intentional overdose,” she says. “Luckily, she was still alive.” It is not the kind of work that the 24-year-old imagined for herself while growing up in Surrey and then completing a degree in English. But it is exactly the kind of work that Britain, with its mental illness epidemic and social care crisis, urgently needs. As of today, there will be almost 100 new mental health social workers entering the workforce – the first graduates of a two-year programme run by Think Ahead, a fast-track training scheme. “Mental health social work is not a profession which historically people coming straight out of university would’ve known about,” says Natalie Acton, co-founder of the charity, which has almost 300 recruits training to graduate in future years. Social work may have long fallen out of fashion, but Acton says there were 23 applicants for each place “showing there’s a real demand for this kind of work amongst young people”. Chambers-Cook’s experience helps explain why. She was working for a pharmaceuticals recruitment company, but felt like an outsider because of her values and ethics. She wanted to work for disadvantaged people “and agitate for them on the frontline”, an aspiration that chimes with the broad values and sensibilities of a generation. The average age of the first cohort of Think Ahead graduates was 26 – almost half the age of the 45-year-old average of social workers as a whole in the UK. For Alec Tooms, 23, social work is the perfect environment for young people to flourish in. “Young people have the opportunity to challenge the status quo,” he says, “and I’ve been supported to pilot new ideas because social work is all about change and adapting to the people we’re working with.” There is a pressing need for increased adult mental health care . According to the latest Care Quality Commission research, the number of NHS mental health nurses fell by 12% between 2010 and 2017, while the total number of detentions under the Mental Health Act rose by 26% in 2012-16. Councils made £420m of cuts to adult social care in 2015-16 alone. One in six social workers left their jobs in 2016 and 11% of vacancies remained unfilled. All this means 400,000 fewer adults are receiving social care compared with 2010. High-profile childcare social work scandals, such as the Baby Peter case and the historical abuse in Telford, have compounded the situation by tarnishing the public’s perception of the career. Yet young people continue to train in social work. Last year, applications for social studies degrees were the fourth highest among all courses. Maisie Satchwell-Hirst, 23, is a Think Ahead graduate who works with psychosis patients in Cambridge. She says the positives of the job far outweigh the negatives: “It’s a real privilege to be allowed into people’s lives and their private spaces. It lets us work in a holistic way and actually make a difference.” Chambers-Cook adds: “Normally you might be seen as an intruder, but the fact that most people welcome you allows you to help them in so many ways.” This help has resulted in Chambers-Cook’s earlier client making a significant recovery in hospital. She is also pleased with the outcome in another case: “A young person using our support now doesn’t feel the need to be taking her medication anymore; she feels empowered and has even set up her own fitness company where she is thriving.” The learning curve has been steep. Satchwell-Hirst says: “Since I look quite young, I was worried about going to people’s homes and advising them. I would wonder how anyone could take me seriously.” For Tooms, his age was also an initial concern because he mostly works with older people. However, he says: “Overall, people are just happy to have someone coming to see them and to have a conversation with.” Satchwell-Hirst has found that “in a professional capacity, people trust my training to put me on an equal footing”. While Think Ahead is not the only scheme to draw graduates into social work – there is Frontline which trains childcare social workers and the government’s own Step Up to Social Work traineeship – it is the only one to specifically address adult mental health. With one in six adults in the UK currently experiencing mental health problems and suicide the most common cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 49, it is a field that still needs attention. “There’s no double standard with mental health,” Tooms says, “it affects the people we work with and it can affect us, too.” Now recruiting for their fourth intake, Think Ahead is looking towards expansion into several new mental health trusts in England. “You won’t always get a thank you and that isn’t why we do it,” says Chambers-Cook. “In a way, saying goodbye to people and discharging them is our biggest reward.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "As an ocean early warning system, coral reefs have been sounding the alarm for years. They have been bleached white by marine heatwaves and killed off en masse by a combination of factors including pollution, overfishing, acidification and climate change. But now scientists in Florida, and other tropical locations worldwide, are attempting to stop the rot by creating coral “nurseries” in which young populations can be raised in controlled conditions before being planted on denuded reefs. Off the southern tip of Florida, a sprawling marine farming operation has been established in which corals are painstakingly grown on anchored fibreglass trees and then planted on the barrier reef. “The idea is to do as much as we can now to give these coral populations a fighting chance,” says Jessica Levy, programme manager at the Coral Restoration Foundation. “If you don’t put back the material and diversity that has been lost, the populations are going to crash and become extinct. For reefs, you’re looking at a global extinction of the ecosystem if things don’t change quickly.” Florida has the world’s third largest barrier reef, with nearly 1,400 species of plants and animals and 500 species of fish, but the reef is vanishing fast. Research found that roughly half of the reef has disappeared over the past 250 years. Coverage of acropora, the primary genus of reef-building corals, has plummeted by 97%. “The reef is pretty barren right now,” says Levy. The maladies are numerous and stretch back decades. A burgeoning Floridian population and mass tourism have led to water pollution and direct damage to corals, while agriculture has sent torrents of nutrients flowing on to the reef. Although regulations have curbed some of these local risks, climate change remains a big threat. In 2014 a spike in water temperatures led the Florida corals to bleach – when a reef expels its symbiotic algae under heat stress, whitens and potentially dies. It happened again in 2015, as a prolonged global bleaching event gripped the planet’s corals. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was cooked to the point that it reportedly smelled of death. The world is on course for a temperature increase that will comfortably wipe out most of the coral ecosystems, a scenario that would strip away a crucial nursery and smorgasbord for countless marine species, diminish fisheries and remove a vital coastal buffer to storms that will intensify as the planet warms. “The outlook for the Florida reef is pretty grim,” says Kim Cobb, a coral expert at Georgia Institute of Technology. “The threats are overwhelming. Just as the reef is climbing out of decades of systemic problems it is under increasing threat from climate change.” The Coral Restoration Foundation has increased the replanting of corals as the situation has deteriorated, and the foundation’s underwater trees are becoming sought-after items for stressed reefs around the world. Partnerships have formed to provide trees to places such as Jamaica and Colombia. A chartered fishing operation in Mexico is in talks to do the same. This month, it was announced that 100 corals had been successfully planted on the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest living structure, using the coral tree frames. The operation came about after tropical fish collector Ken Nedimyer noticed a rare type of coral called Acropora cervicronis growing on his live rock farm in 2003. A loophole in endangered species laws meant the coral was his to keep, so he began cutting it up to grow new coral from the fragments. Nedimyer hoped to regrow enough coral to start patching up Florida’s reef. Initially, the fragments were mounted on sunken concentric blocks that mimicked reefs. But the real breakthrough came in 2011 with the development of fabricated trees on which dozens of pieces of coral can be dangled from the branches. Backed by funding from the federal government and concerned donors, the foundation now has around 700 trees arranged in seven nurseries along the reef system as far as Ernest Hemingway’s old haunt of Key West. Retrieved fragments of wild coral are sliced into finger-sized pieces, sorted into genomic types and strung from the fibreglass and PVC trees, which are anchored to the seabed and buoyed with a float. Alongside the staghorn and elkhorn corals, swaying gently on lines in the currents, are boulder-covering corals that are mounted on nearby platforms. This environment lets the corals grow three times faster than normal. Even so, it takes up to nine months for them to reach the size of a small football, at which point they are taken to be attached to an appropriate reef using a special putty. Diversity is key, says Levy. While some other projects are experimenting with heat-resistant corals that can cope with occasionally warming waters, the foundation hopes a range of coral candidates will produce survivors. “We don’t want to put all our eggs in the heat tolerance basket,” she says. The aim is for the corals to take root, connect and spawn with each other. So far in 2018 more than 18,000 corals have been planted on to reefs, double that achieved annually five years ago. Around eight in 10 planted corals survive at least a year. This work is laborious and occasionally fraught. The trees need to be regularly cleaned of detritus, while around 300 coral genotypes across nine species must be sorted and tagged. Regrown coral can be swiftly wiped out by hot or cold snaps, storms or disease. Hurricane Irma stripped corals off the trees, although the structures themselves were almost all unscathed. “We lost a fair bit of stock with Irma,” says Levy. “This work can be very hard as well as very rewarding. You plant corals and watch them grow for several years and then something out of your control like bleaching can happen. “It just makes us go for the numbers – the more corals we get out there the more diverse it will be and the better chance something is going to survive past the continued stress.” The largest of the nurseries, located three miles off the Key Largo coast, has around 500 trees, which look a bit like giant, antiquated TV aerials. Branching staghorn and elkhorn coral dangle from the trees just 10ft underwater. A constellation of marine life, such as trumpet fish, hog fish and trigger fish, flit between the trees. A nearby reef site is dotted with replanted corals bearing the tags of the Coral Restoration Foundation, although the overall coral coverage is scant. The bleak scene is completed by stands of lifeless pillar coral, ravaged by a bacterial disease that swept through the Keys last summer. A nearby brain coral is split by jagged white lines, further evidence of disease. The origins of many coral diseases are vague but at least one major outbreak has been linked to human faecal waste: the Keys only gained a fully functioning sewer system during the past decade. Recent research has found that these diseases will worsen as the oceans warm. The scale of the foundation’s task is “monumental”, says Cobb. But the restoration work could help provide a lifeline for reefs, she says. “Corals made it through the impact that killed the dinosaurs,” she says. “I believe some corals will limp through, the question is how much will be left. There is important work that holds real promise. There won’t be just one solution but a whole basket of them, some of which we can only guess at.” Another form of reef renovation has been taking place in the Bahamas, where scientists have been collecting material from mass spawning events – when corals release plumes of sperm and eggs into the water en masse – to help produce more numerous, stronger offspring for replanting. “We’ve had pretty good results,” says Joseph Pollock, coral strategy director for the Caribbean division of the Nature Conservancy. He worked on a recent spawning event off Cape Eleuthera that has resulted in more than one million coral larvae. “This in itself is not a solution, it’s part of a suite of tools that can be used. If you’re not working on stressors from climate change down to coastal pollution, you may as well not be doing this work.” Back in Florida, the Coral Restoration Foundation is training a new batch of interns, who will help in educational outreach efforts with the public. At the foundation’s offices, fibreglass trees are being scrubbed clean and plans made to survey a nursery site as the skies clear from a tropical storm. The work, much like the morphing climate conditions ranged against it, seems endless. “I’m not ready to give up,” says Levy. “No one wants these reefs to die on their watch, so I would rather do something then sit back and watch everything die.”",

    "date": "2018-09-25",
    "transcript": "Ask most people about England’s epidemic of empty homes and they are likely to think of lavish vacant mansions in London owned by absent foreign billionaires. In fact, the majority of empty properties are in post-industrial areas, where poverty rates are high and house prices languish well below their pre-crash levels. Such a place is Stockton-on-Tees, near Middlesbrough, where Martyn Jones lives. Two years ago Jones, 23, was homeless and relying on friends to let him sleep on their couches while he struggled to find work. Today, he is painting a wall in a gutted home on a quiet street, part of a group tasked with refurbishing some of the area’s many vacant, derelict homes. Last week, Theresa May pledged an extra £2bn for housing associations to fund large-scale developments. But with new house building not providing enough affordable homes for more than 1 million people on waiting lists in England, social enterprises and councils are trying to bring empty homes, which number well over 200,000 and are worth almost £50bn, back into occupancy. One of them is Community Campus 87, which buys such properties in Stockton-on-Tees, refurbishes them and offers them to previously homeless tenants at rents below the going rate for social housing. In the process, it provides jobs and skills training for people such as Jones. Having left school at 16, Jones struggled with substance use and anxiety, unable to hold down a job. When his mother kicked him out, he worried he was out of options. “I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for Campus,” he says. “They gave me a home, helped me along the way and now I’ve started going to college.” Amid a dramatic national collapse in apprenticeships, about 15% of Community Campus’ staff are apprentices, according to its director and founder, Simon Virth. The group, which has refurbished about 250 homes so far, also offers help with job interviews, jobcentre appointments and finding free educational programmes at local colleges. At the opposite end of the country, Plymouth city council is offering landlords loans and grants of up to £50,000 per property to bring 375 long-term vacant properties back into use in the next three years. Fifty-nine homes were brought back into occupancy within the first year, but Dan Thorning, a housing officer, acknowledges there have been challenges. “It can take significant time to build rapport and trust with some owners of empty homes, or to get contractors on board that are willing to work on a project where there are complex issues,” he says. “Sometimes when owners refuse to work with us, we have no choice but to use enforcement powers to bring their properties back into use.” Plymouth is following the lead of Kent county council, whose pioneering no use empty initiative won a prestigious regeneration award earlier in 2018. Its interest-free loans have helped to transform 5,400 empty homes since 2005. In Stoke-on-Trent, the council has allowed people to buy derelict homes for just £1, on the condition they stay for 10 years and commit to investing in the property. The relative success of such projects has helped fuel calls for community-led housing to play a greater role in alleviating the housing shortage, which has coincided with home ownership falling to a 30-year low. The Giroscope group in Yorkshire also refurbishes empty homes for subsidised housing, and has had success branching out into a microbrewery, bakery, condiment manufacturer and a vegetarian cafe and shop. Profits are reinvested into the business, but funding remains the key challenge. Swingeing funding cuts Money is a constant problem for self-starting groups though. One of the main grants for Community Campus has risen by only 2% over 15 years. “That represents a 23% cut in real terms,” Virth says. A government scheme, the empty homes programme, was set up in 2012 to provide about £100m to community groups for refurbishments. It was ended by the Conservative government in 2015. Swingeing funding cuts to local authorities have further undermined renewal schemes, while the money is drying up for charities too; more than £3.8bn in government grants has been cut over the past decade. Banks can charge twice the rate of interest for loans to social enterprises as to commercial firms, if they agree to lend at all. This can hobble local startups and force them to lease rather than buy properties, meaning they ultimately return to the owner after refurbishment. Transferring empty properties to organisations which refurbish them and offer them to let at below local housing allowance rates means local authorities benefit from council tax receipts, the area gradually repopulates and the social enterprises can use the assets to raise money to buy more properties. The alternative is councils paying millions for emergency accommodation because they do not have enough housing stock to deliver their statutory duty to house homeless people, nor the funds to renovate the properties themselves, while whole neighbourhoods elsewhere are cut loose to rot. The homeless charity Centrepoint say that schemes like these provide some of the vulnerable people in society with a chance to develop the skills they need to get on in life. “These community led schemes offer a fantastic opportunity for them, and all those who unfortunately face homelessness, by not only providing affordable housing but also the hands-on experience and support to develop the key skills they will need in the world of work,” said Paul Noblet, its head of public affairs. “We hope that the example set by these schemes will inspire both government and employers to take similar action.” The housing charity Empty Homes says the absence of dedicated national funding means community-based approaches are more important than ever. These have a proven track record and they offer the best returns in financial, social and housing terms. “These organisations see beyond profit to save those in housing need,” says Chris Bailey, a campaign manager at Empty Homes. “They do so while delivering lower costs and better social outcomes; reinvesting in more affordable housing and improving the local area.” This translates into people such as Martyn Jones finding a path to a better life rather than heading further out into the margins. “I wouldn’t know where my life would be heading without Campus,” he says. “This gives me hope for the future.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/23/potsdam-inside-the-worlds-first-autonomous-tram",
    "date": "2018-09-23",
    "transcript": "Norbert Gresing shook his head as two teenage boys, deep in conversation and wearing earplugs, stepped out in front of his tram. “This is the type of situation I face every day,” said the tram driver, who has 25 years of experience under his belt, as he rang his bell. The boys, apparently oblivious to the green and white 10-tonne, 19-metre-long vehicle, appeared as bright green figures surrounded by fuzzy yellow dots on the screen in front of Gresing. In this case, the boys were not close enough that the tram had to brake, though it did slow down. But Gresing had little to do with the decision. He was merely sitting in the cab, his hand resting casually on a joystick in case he needed to intervene, while the tram drove itself. The world’s first autonomous tram was launched in unspectacular style in the city of Potsdam, west of Berlin, on Friday. The Guardian was the first English-language newspaper to be offered a ride on the vehicle developed by a team of 50 computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists at the German engineering company Siemens. Fitted with multiple radar, lidar (light from a laser), and camera sensors, forming digital eyes that film the tram and its surroundings during every journey, the tram reacts to trackside signals and can respond to hazards faster than a human. Its makers say it is some way from being commercially viable but they do expect it to contribute to the wider field of driverless technology, and have called it an important milestone on the way to autonomous driving. Travelling in real traffic from the tram depot of Potsdam’s transport company ViP, the articulated Combino model tram whirred its way through a high-rise housing settlement in the south-eastern district of Stern on Friday, contending with bikes, prams and cars which sometimes haphazardly crossed its path during the 3.7-mile (6km) route. Halfway into the journey on a windy day with leaves swirling over the tracks, an emergency was staged, whereby a Siemens employee pushed a pram onto one of the many unsignalled walkways running across the path of the tram. After its sensors alerted it, the vehicle responded by braking suddenly. Gresing calmly restarted the automated driving system once the woman had pulled the pram safely back onto the pavement. Along the track, the occasional tram spotter with a notebook and camera captured the historic moment. Gordian Stark, a visitor to InnoTrans 2018, an international transport exhibition taking place in Berlin, observed the tram in operation from the sidelines, and admitted he had initially been sceptical. “Truth be told, it does looks rather underwhelming, a normal low-floor tram, but closer up you see all the discreet technology like the sensors, and to see it tackle real-time traffic and to think this is the future, it’s a bit like what it must have been to witness the transition from horse-drawn to steam trams or gas to electric,” he said. As in many cities in the former communist East Germany, trams have formed the backbone of Potsdam’s public transport system uninterrupted ever since their introduction as horse-drawn vehicles in 1880. Promoted under communism as an efficient public transport method, it has since expanded to cover a route of 18 miles in length. With the city – currently having a population of 172,000 – expanding fast, it is seen as an essential part of its infrastructure. ViP is proud to boast of the new model that runs on renewable energy (wind and solar) and is able to carry up to 250 passengers as the most environmentally friendly form of public transport. Gresing, a native Potsdamer who grew up with trams, said at 63, and semi-retired, he was not concerned about his job security, though he admitted that some of his colleagues were. Nevertheless, ViP has said in the event of the artificial intelligence (AI) trams being properly introduced, drivers would simply be deployed elsewhere in the system, such as to marshal passengers on the platform or to help people with disabilities or prams, and have vowed that the high-tech trams will not lead to job cuts. “Our main priority is safety,” said Oliver Glaser, the manager of ViP, which has 420 employees and ferries 33 million passengers a year. “And secondly we think it’ll improve efficiency.” Gresing said he only had to recall his most hair-raising experience as a tram driver to consider the advantages of an AI vehicle: “When an elderly man who had left his hearing aid at home pulled out in front of me in his car” . At that point he sounded his bell and managed to bring the tram to a halt. “No one was injured but the car was a write-off,” he said. “It can be a very stressful job: you’re responsible for 250 passengers at a time. And if technology is there to take away some of the decision-making load, I welcome that.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "How to get people to behave better? Use carrots, not sticks",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/21/how-to-incentivise-charity-giving-recycling-unwanted-clothes",
    "date": "2018-09-21",
    "transcript": "It is a shrewd psychological tactic that all parents will be familiar with: instead of berating an errant child for their wrongdoings, focus instead in rewarding them for good behaviour. Now the idea is catching on outside the nursery, with implications for everything from recycling clothes to policing. Put simply: to get people to do things, throw away those sticks and invest in a prodigious quantity of carrots. Take the modern phenomenon of “fast fashion”: determined to keep prices artificially low for consumers, clothes companies exploit workers and use shoddy materials. The scale and pace of production and distribution is disastrous for the environment, and consumers end up with piles of unwanted clothes. Every year in the UK, 300,000 tonnes ends up in landfill – 235 million individual items. Now however, apps such as ReGain, Regive and Stuffstr are making it simpler – and more worthwhile - for people to return their unwanted clobber. The ReGain app can be used to find one of 20,000 drop-off points. In return, the diligent consumer earns rewards such as discount coupons for high street retailers. Stuffstr works in partnership with John Lewis to help people get cash in return for unwanted items from the chain. “Possibly the one prediction that we economists get right is that if you incentivise a behaviour, you will get more of it,” says Dr Matthew Levy, a lecturer in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). He cites research, including his own, showing that financial incentives encouraging regular exercise, stopping smoking and losing weight effectively promote healthy behaviours and that there is no backlash when the incentives are removed. “If anything, the incentives can be used to jump-start a healthy habit that keeps going,” he says. In the four months after its launch, the ReGain scheme received almost 17,000 parcels containing 47 tonnes of used clothes and shoes, of which 95% could potentially be reused, according to its founder Jack Ostrowski. There’s one obvious criticism of ReGain: if fast fashion is the problem, is it helpful to give people discounts to buy more fast fashion? Ostrowski argues that vague notions imploring people to save the planet don’t work. “We need to find a way to influence behaviour, and discount coupons help,” he says. The platform is also working with brands and retailers to find ways to divert used clothes from landfills and into the production of new clothes, he adds. Other reward schemes have had success in encouraging behavioural change. When police in Canada issued “positive tickets” – coupons for free food or movie tickets – to reward good behaviour among young people, they reported an almost 50% drop in youth-related service calls. “The ticket is the gateway to the relationship,” says Ward Clapham, the former superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Richmond, British Columbia. “If you want to build up an environment of trust, cooperation, collaboration and support, you have to have a relationship; and its a lot easier to start that in a positive environment than in a negative one. “My officers would say ‘In the old days we’d drive up in the police car and the kids would run away from us, now they run to us’.” Similar ticketing schemes have been trialled in the UK, and rolled out in Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, the US, and elsewhere, as police forces look at new ways to build trust within communities. In a similar venture, Hull city council have announced plans to launch a digital reward token – the HullCoin – that can be earned by volunteering and spent at local retailers. Elsewhere, a study on the recruitment of health workers in Zambia found that highlighting economic incentives during the recruitment process caused future employees to be more motivated and task-focused. The new health workers went on to conduct 29% more household visits than previous staff, twice as many community meetings and oversaw a 25% reduction in the amount of underweight children in the treatment areas. “Emphasising the economic incentives led to the recruitment of more effective, and more devoted, health workers than emphasising the societal benefits,” Levy explains. Conversely, if the deterrent for a particular action is not substantial enough (ie if the stick is a twig), people may view it as a licence to break the rules. When two behavioural economists conducted a study at a daycare centre in Israel and introduced a small fine of around £2 for late parents, the amount of latecomers increased. According to the researchers, this was because they could now avoid being guilty by paying the small fine. However, “this is less important when we are talking about rewarding good behaviour,” says Levy. Nava Ashraf, also a LSE economics professor, says that the more that people engage in altruistic acts, the easier it becomes. “We humans notoriously underestimate how happy it makes us to give to others,” she says. Ashraf’s research looks into the long-term impact of incentivising good behaviour. “Giving can become a habit and something people want to continue on their own, even if it isn’t rewarded. Platforms could induce people to start something that they may not otherwise do and in the process, they may learn how much they enjoy it, creating a craving for it,” she says. “We know from neuroscience that the more we do something the more easy it becomes,” she explains. “It goes from something we have to think about to becoming second nature.” Or as Aristotle put it: ‘We are what we repeatedly do.’ But Ashraf does caution that getting rewarded for one type of charitable giving “might also make people feel entitled” to get paid for other good deeds, something her research is hoping to shed more light on. For now, the rate of people regularly doing formal volunteer work has remained stable since 2001. If schemes such as ReGain go on to see long-term success, volunteer organisations might consider getting in on the act. “Obviously different groups are motivated by different factors,” says Ostrowski. “For some, the ‘feel good’ factor is enough, and for others, that reward stimulus is required.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-09-19",
    "transcript": "When Martin Agaba realised his urban farm had run out of space, he decided the solution was not to expand outwards but upwards. “We realised we had to use the roof,” he says. Of all the innovations that have galvanised people in his district in the Ugandan capital Kampala to grow their own food, these vertical box plantations remain his favourite. Kwagala farm, located on half an acre of land, is the brainchild of Diana Nambatya, a professor in public health, who began growing vegetables to save money on food in 2010. After receiving two cows as a dowry, she decided to use their dung to generate biogas for her home. Her burgeoning urban farm soon attracted the attention of the neighbours, and in 2012 she started training women at a small demonstration centre. The urban farm is just one of many springing up in and around Kampala, a city of more than 1.5 million people, as residents find creative solutions to the challenges of urbanisation. Between 2002 and 2010, Uganda’s urban population grew by 5.6%. This process, Martin Agaba believes, is eroding young people’s interest in Uganda’s agricultural sector, which employs approximately 69% of the population. Agaba trains children that live around Kwagala farm in how to grow strawberries, yams and spring onions. “We are motivating children to not rely just on boda bodas (motorcycle taxis – a popular form of informal employment) or TV but to do something creative every day.” Brian Ndyaguma, an entrepreneur and restaurant owner, says: “Somehow the young generation deserted the way our parents’ generation did things, so if you are going to convince young people to jump into agriculture, it has to be made sexy – it has to be made appealing to them”. It was Kwagala farm’s creative reuse of old tyres that first attracted visitors. Then, as they began to experiment with using other materials, such as disused drainpipes and milk cartons, some of the local children began to create their own designs. “Now the children do not copy what we do,” says Agaba. “They do their own thing.” Harriet Nakabaale runs a small farm called Camp Green in the Kawaala area of Kampala. She collects the plastic bottles discarded by her neighbours. By cutting them, she can use them as flowerpots; by perforating them, they can become watering devices. Nothing goes to waste. Even the shells of the eggs produced by her chickens will be used to grow cress. Kwagala farm has three cows which they feed with banana peel and corn, which is grown using hydroponics, a method of growing plants using a water-based solution instead of soil. Agaba and his colleagues collect the cow dung, which they use to produce fertiliser. Despite the business potential, there are no plans to expand the farm. “We do not need more than three cows,” says Abaga. “We are teaching people to keep less but to do more with what they have.” An education programme at the farm has trained more than 700 women and young people in urban farming and how to make organic fertiliser and biofuel. Martin Agaba, who works at Kwagala urban farm, says: ‘We don’t keep more than three cows. We teach people to keep fewer and do more with what they have.’ Brian Ndyaguma relies on urban farms in Kampala for a large proportion of his restaurants’ vegetables, herbs and fruits. He sees a business opportunity not just for urban dwellers but rural farmers as well. “We still have a big advantage here in Uganda because we have good soil, so food is largely available. The challenge is the distribution.” Congestion, lack of refrigerated trucks and long hot days in the markets can make it difficult for the food grown outside of the city to stay fresh. “Urban farming gives rural farmers with more space the opportunity to concentrate on perennial crops, like corn or cereal,” he says. Agaba is an engineer and, like most of the people working on the farm, he has a day job, choosing to work at the farm as a pastime. Though he doesn’t sell much of what he grows, he still recognises there are financial benefits to his hobby. “Growing your own food makes you money by saving you money.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "They’ve tried dams, dykes and dialogue over the years in vain attempts to reverse one of the world’s most stunning environmental disasters – the near-total disappearance of a sea that was once the size of Ireland. So it’s time for a different approach. On Friday, the deserted, dried-out bed of the Aral Sea in a remote part of Central Asia will echo to the sound of an electronic music festival, as activists try to raise awareness of the catastrophe, and put the sea back on the map, figuratively, if not literally. Visitors to Moynaq, a forlorn Uzbek town, are usually disaster tourists coming to gawk at the desolation of the apocalyptic landscape, where the carcasses of ships rot on sand once covered by the world’s fourth-largest lake. But this week, hundreds of revellers have been descendingfor the festival of electronic, techno, avant-garde and dance music. DJs from Moscow and Berlin will mix music “that teleports you mentally to other places”, organiser Otabek Suleimanov enthused. It will very possibly be the first electronica festival to be held in a ship graveyard. “It’s great!” said Farukh Sharipov, a 25-year-old graphic designer standing on the quay on Thursday under the burning sun, seeking a spot to pitch his tent after flying in from the capital Tashkent and driving two hours across the desert to Moynaq. “The whole world should know about the Aral catastrophe … Not everyone pays attention to an ecological catastrophe, but if we come here to party then people will come and start taking an interest.” A lawyer who moonlights as a DJ, Suleimanov dreamt up this quixotic event to draw attention to the plight of the Aral Sea, which has shrunk to a tenth of its original size because of shortsighted Soviet policies. Intense cotton farming that diverted feeder rivers for irrigation has been blamed for the recession of the sea in the late Soviet period. The waters left behind a toxic, salt-encrusted, pesticide-poisoned land that poses a serious environmental and health hazard. The music for the festival will be pumped out beside a reconstructed lighthouse in Moynaq, a once thriving fishing port left high and dry when the waters disappeared from the town in the 1980s. “It’s wonderful” said Keulimzhay Abylgaziyev, 61, recalling with a gesture at the seabed behind the stage how he used to swim in the sea there as a child. “It used to be all water here, and everyone worked as fishermen, but now it’s all dry. It’s important for people to know about it, and for people to come here – and for the sea to come too, God willing.” Although the event is starting relatively small, the organisers have big ambitions: they hope the festival, which is free of charge, will become an annual event. In their wildest dreams, one day it will turn into a central Asian version of the Nevada desert’s Burning Man. That may be a pipe dream, but locals including hotelier Mahmud Akbarov are excited anyway. “More events like this should be held, to attract people here.” There are no big names playing, but there are some interesting acts – DJs include Orgatanatos, an Uzbek project producing “ambient, glitchcore, noise and other experimental styles” and Interchain, a Moscow punk-techno duo. The festival’s name evokes its environmental aspirations: Stihia, a Russian word loosely translating as “the elements” but with connotations of something “unstoppable”, Suleimanov told the Guardian – like the drying up of the Aral, which split into two parts in the 1980s. Its northern part in Kazakhstan has been rejuvenated by a dam, but the southern Uzbek section is in a dire state: in drier years, it is just a narrow strip of water on the western side. Stihia has a mystical element as well as a pragmatic one: Suleimanov sees the music-makers as akin to the rainmakers of the area’s ancient nomadic tribes, although “rainmakers were using drums, and we’re using electronic music to call the sea back”. On Thursday afternoon, gazing out over the former seabed as he waited for the sound systems to trundle across the desert from Nukus, his main concern was that those making the trip to Moynak should have a good time. “It’s all about the aftertaste – how people feel when they leave.” Stihia looks set to rock not just Moynak but all Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country of 34 million people that until recently was known as one of the world’s worst police states. Since long-ruling dictator Islam Karimov died in 2016, his successor Shavkat Mirziyoyev has been experimenting with a thaw often dubbed the “Uzbek Spring”. Under Karimov, Uzbekistan was a buttoned-up conservative state that frowned upon fun, discouraging everything from rap music to Valentine’s Day celebrations. Official backing for Stihia is a sign of the changing times – and Suleimanov believes the festival will send out some positive vibes about Uzbekistan by “telling the world: look, guys, things are changing – and if the government is supporting such a crazy idea as having electronic music in the middle of a desert, then you can trust that at least something is going well!”. The idea would have seemed “shocking” not long ago, said Sharipov with a chuckle. “Now this is kind of normal, because our society is becoming more open. People can just have fun, without being afraid of anyone.” Some revellers were embracing the environmental theme with gusto, such as a young man who gave his name as Uncle Chill who was wearing an oxygen mask and a black PVC contraption strapped to his otherwise bare chest. “I came from the future,” he told the Guardian. “This is an outfit from the future. The thing is, I came to warn people that we’re destroying the planet. This is the outfit that we’re going to be wearing in the future, because there’s no fresh water, polluted air. That’s a problem. That’s why I need the mask. I want to show people what’s happening.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "As the dust settles at the National Museum of Brazil after its devastating fire last week, Samuel Franco Arce is gearing up to help. Arce has twice rescued his own small museum in Guatemala from floods and storms, and has just completed a Dutch leadership course to teach others this unusual form of emergency aid. He and a team of “first aiders” have offered to help their Brazilian colleagues find the funds and experts they need after a fire engulfed their 200-year-old national museum. A Unesco-led mission is being readied this week to head to Rio de Janeiro to provide concrete help. “They are still in shock,” says Arce, speaking from the offices of the Prince Claus Fund in the Netherlands, co-organiser of the cultural course. “They have to assess the damage and we are asking if they have the proper forms, if they need online tutorials and what experts they need.” Art and culture are perhaps more vulnerable than at any moment since the end of the second world war – and not just in Brazil. Flood, fire, war, terrorism, sabotage, theft, earthquakes and neglect: the causes of cultural dereliction are many and varied. Participants in the Dutch course, backed by Unesco, the Smithsonian Institute and heritage body Iccrom, came from 23 countries and five continents. The event culminated in a faux-disaster scenario: a gas explosion, army and fire officers guarding the scene from protesters, and the rescuers carrying out shattered artefacts “as carefully as you would a baby”. “First aid for heritage is very much like first aid to a human,” says course organiser Deborah Stolk of the Prince Claus Fund. “It is like a cultural ambulance, to stabilise the situation and prevent it from getting worse. After assessing the risks, for example, of whether you can go into the building, people would stabilise a wall, prevent it from falling down or evacuate a vase in a dangerous place.” It is not always that simple. Lama Abboud, an architect based in Homs in Syria, has taken several of the Dutch courses and organised a network of training in Syria. “Since 2011, our Syrian culture heritage [has been] threatened by many complex situations due to the armed conflict and its consequences,” she explains. “In Homs, the built heritage is in its worst conditions, exposed to all weather elements in addition to vandalism for more than six years. The conflict leads to a large displacement [of people too], so most intangible heritage elements are in real danger. Looting and illegal excavation are a real threat too.” Like a caricature, says Stolk, community tensions and inequalities that already exist have been exaggerated during a disaster. Khan Agha Dawoodzai, an activist from Afghanistan, says that the answer was to get the community involved. “In recent weeks, there was fighting in the Ghazni province and a museum of Islamic civilisation was destroyed,” he says. “The documents were blown by the wind through the streets. If the community had understood the importance of their documents and a little about how they could protect them, it could have been the first responder.” Cultural heritage, he points out, can even be a weapon – when, for example, the Buddhas of Bamiyan wall carvings were blown up by the Taliban in 2001. Such heritage could be important to villages for their future economic development, tourism and shared community. “Smaller conflicts fuel the bigger ones,” he says. “A village may have different ethnicities but our cultural heritage is the same: this is our shared identity and very important to peace building in Afghanistan.” Elsa Arroyo followed this approach last year, after an earthquake struck in Mexico, damaging mural paintings in 16th century monasteries. The lecturer at UNAM university’s Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas helped raise $10,000 in finance and took her 60 students on an extraordinary field trip – to work on recovering the monuments. In this case, the local community also received government funding for its own reconstruction, but she says poverty continued to be a challenge. “Culture needs maintenance in order to have a good condition, and all these monuments are kind of abandoned, even if they are used for rituals and festivities,” Arroyo says. In Peru’s high Andes Michaela Novotna, another course participant, has been trying to raise awareness of places like the Santa Cruz church in Orurillo, Puno – supposedly closed because it is falling down, although still used for weekly mass. “We’re rescuing sad paintings that look like rags, broken sculptures, leaning churches – it’s something called a slow disaster,” she says. “I’m working with colonial artwork that has been neglected for 200 years.” Treasures of the past are far more than just stuff, especially when local people get involved in their own rescue, adds Stolk. She spoke via satellite phone to advise victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, after they decided to rescue a collection of Quang manuscripts from a collapsed library. “They changed from being victims to active participants in their own recovery,” she says. “Everything they would take from beneath the rubble would see a future. What happens is that you can connect a past to a future, while people are actually in this very miserable situation in the present. That hope and that pride are very much underestimated.” This is how Abboud feels, thinking about her home in Syria and the restoration ahead in Brazil. “The conflict will be finished one day, but the cultural heritage – that will stay. When we rescue and protect our heritage, it is the same as when we protect our children. Both carry parts of our souls and our ancestors’ spirits.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/12/no-mr-salvini-migrants-and-refugees-are-not-a-burden-a-photo-essay",
    "date": "2018-09-12",
    "transcript": "Migrants and refugees rarely get a good press. Headlines tend to accentuate the costs not the benefit of good hospitality. Politicians from the UK to US, Germany to Italy, rarely have a good word to say about them. But refugees are not all helpless dependents, hopelessly reliant on charity. They make economic contributions, grow GDP, start businesses and social enterprises, create jobs. For every one implicated in a crime, thousands more are raising children, volunteering, filling the skills shortage in Europe. It is perhaps in Italy where this gap between perception and reality has had the greatest political impact. Here we focus on five who defy the lazy political stereotyping of the Italian far right. Mohamed Shapoor If 20 years ago you had suggested to Cpl Mohamed Shapoor, who was then living among mortar attacks launched by the Taliban, that one day he would become a chef in Italy, he would have laughed in your face. But life is unpredictable, which is the most important lesson Shapoor has learned during his incredible existence. Now 47, Shapoor abandoned his military uniform and decorations in 2000, fleeing from an Afghanistan agonised by a war that continues to claim civilian victims. Today he is one of the most esteemed chefs in Palermo, Sicily, where he has been living for 10 years. “I thought I would wear that uniform forever,” he tells the Guardian with the stern glance of a soldier. “In time, I learned that that conflict was never going to end, and I decided to leave. Life has taught me that we are not victims of history, just that not everyone is lucky enough to realise it. “I am convinced that today, thanks to having fled my country, Mohamed Shapoor realises that he was not destined to be a corporal, but a chef in the land of pasta and pizza.” A flyer attached to the door of the restaurant Moltivolti in Ballarò, an ancient quarter of Palermo, announces the opening of enrolment in the “cooking class with Shapoor”. There are many people eager to learn how to prepare dopiaza, an Afghan dish made with onions, curry, garlic paste and chicken, or mantu, large medallions filled with veal and accompanied by a sauce made with vegetables and red squash. But the real attraction, as you might imagine, is Shapoor, a real legend in these parts. His customers, who come by the hundreds to fill the tables of Moltivolti, ask to speak with him after savouring his dishes. To offer their compliments, to be sure, but also to meet the legend of Cpl Shapoor, the nemesis of the Taliban who conquered Sicilian palates. Adibata Konata The “mother” of the inhabitants of Ballarò, now home to thousands of migrants, is a Junoesque woman from the Ivory Coast. It’s no coincidence that around here she is known as “Mama Africa”. Her name is Adibata Konata, she is 65, and for years she has offered the poor of Ballarò a warm meal and sometimes even a bed from a small restaurant in Santa Chiara square, just off the famous open-air market. It makes no difference if you cannot pay; Mama Africa’s restaurant is open to all of her “children”, including newly arrived migrants. Konata, born into a large middle-class family, has lived in Palermo for over 20 years. Her heart, however, is still in Ziga, a poor village in the heart of Sanmatenga, Burkina Faso, which she visited before arriving in Italy. Here Mama Africa invests her proceeds to refurbish hospitals and offer food, clothing, books, farm implements, and electrical and plumbing material, with the goal of raising the living standards of the inhabitants. “We started a small workshop with about 10 people who make necklaces, bracelets, and clothing items using raw materials from Africa. After paying the employees, all additional proceeds go to Ziga,” she says. “My work will probably never save Ziga from poverty, but as an African woman I feel a duty not to forget that our brothers and sisters live in the same conditions that forced us to leave. I cannot forget this.” Boubou Magassa and Adul Balde The story of Boubou Magassa and Adul Balde may seem ordinary. Yet these two 20-year-old migrants, who hail from Mali and Guinea respectively, found rare solace in Sicily in the form of a dignified job, a serene life, peace. Nothing more. They arrived on the coast of Sicily aboard a dinghy at the beginning of 2017, after having spent nearly a year of agony in Libya, among detention camps and harassment at the hands of militiamen and traffickers. Today they work as mechanics in the town of Riesi. Here, not only do Magassa and Balde contribute to Italy’s economy, but like many others, they have also helped revive this small town, which Italians gradually abandoned. The population of Riesi is nearing 10,000, down from more than 20,000 in the 1950s, and the town continues to lose 100 inhabitants each year. There are hundreds of small towns like Riesi across Italy that risk extinction. “We’re happy here,” says Magassa. “They treat us well. We didn’t have great expectations. We came here in search of good fortune, and we only hoped to find what we dreamt about: a normal life. This is our greatest achievement.” Atta Jacob Dozens of migrants queue up in front of Atta Jacob’s office each day to speak with him. Jacob, 31, who arrived from Ghana in 2008, is a representative for the CGIL, Italy’s largest labour union. To understand the long road that has enabled Jacob to earn a job, a desk, an office, and the respect of his colleagues, one must enter into the abyss of the San Ferdinando migrant camp, whichtoday is home to 1,000 people. Here, migrants live in shacks with no water or electricity. They have been called “new slaves” as they are exploited in the tomato fields and olive groves of southern Italy for meagre compensation. Until two years ago, Jacob was one of them. “I used to live in a shack like this one,” he says. “I worked in the fields with the others for €2 an hour. It was horrible. But people here are willing to withstand this and even more in order to survive.” The migrants waiting for Jacob in front of his office live in the San Ferdinando camp. His goal as union representative is to better their working conditions, while at the same time compelling the state not to forget that behind the “Made in Italy” brand are migrants such as them. “They are the ones who work in the fields eight, nine hours a day,” says Jacob, who left his eight-year-old daughter in Ghana, and hopes to reunite with her soon. “They are the ones who sweat under the sun to pick the tomatoes that are shipped all over the world. Ghanaians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Gambians, Malians – the same people that the government wants to expel.” Mamud Shamsu On the road from Caltanissetta to Palermo, Mamud Shamsu watches the cars speed by. Occasionally, someone stops to fill up. Shamsu walks up to the car, smiles, and begins pumping the petrol. His days as a petrol-station attendant in the Sicilian countryside have the same cadence, week after week. To some, his work may seem monotonous. It’s not a busy road, and it’s not easy to come upon talkative customers, but this is all Shamsu needs to get by in Italy, where the 28-year-old arrived 10 years ago from Ghana. “I consider myself incredibly lucky,” he says. “I know it’s not easy to find work in Sicily, especially if you’re a migrant. People from my country wait years for opportunity like this. “We’re not here to steal jobs from Italians, we’re here to work. We want to pay taxes like everyone else. No breaks. We just want the chance to build our lives, like everyone else.”",

    "date": "2018-09-10",
    "transcript": "From the age of three, Yehuda Sabiner harboured a secret ambition to become a doctor. But it seemed unlikely to be fulfilled: he was raised in one of the strictest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel. His education was limited to religious study, first at a private school that barely taught mainstream subjects and later at a yeshiva, a religious school, where he spent 14 hours a day studying Jewish texts. Sabiner, a bright boy and an outstanding student, was earmarked to become a leading rabbi. But he never forgot his dream. When he was 21 he confessed his ambition to his new wife. She was horrified: she had married him on the understanding that he would be a rabbinical leader. Also, he had no knowledge of science. But Sabiner’s yearning would not go away. Now 28, Sabiner is embarking on the final year of his medical degree. He will be the first person born and raised in a Haredi community in Israel to become a mainstream doctor, and he plans to specialise in internal medicine. Sabiner has benefited from a pioneering scheme at the Technion university in Haifa to draw young ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews from largely closed communities into mainstream education and then into the workforce. The numbers are still tiny – about 60 out of a total student population of 10,000. “But the idea is to bring the number to 200 within five years, and to 400 within 10 years,” said Prof Boaz Golani, a vice-president of the university. “Engaging the Haredi community is important for Israel. Having a civil society where entire segments live in their own world and with little interaction with others is not healthy. It’s a recipe for tension and animosity.” In 2017 the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel rose above one million for the first time, accounting for 12% of the population. By 2065 they are expected to make up a third of Israel’s population. Traditionally, Haredi men are not economically active. Many spend their time in religious study, relying on state benefits to support their large families, which average almost seven children. But in recent years the Israeli government and educational institutions have taken steps to integrate the Haredi population into colleges and workforces. “There was a concentrated effort launched a few years ago by the ministry of transport, which needed more engineers,” said Golani. If the Technion could get Haredi students on to its courses, jobs could be guaranteed. “We knocked on the doors on yeshivas in Bnei Brak [an overwhelmingly ultra-Orthodox town near Tel Aviv]. We found a few rabbis ready to talk to us. The idea was to take young men who had the brain and intellect to meet the scientific admission criteria, and who were not perceived as chief rabbis of the future. “We said we would not try to force any change of lifestyle of students, such as [strict] dress codes or praying. We kept a low profile.” The Technion team identified 37 young men for a pre-university programme run from an anonymous rented warehouse in Bnei Brak. Over the course of 18 months, teachers tried to close a 12-year education gap to bring the Haredi men up to the standard of high school graduates. They studied from 8am to 10pm. “It was like a bootcamp, very intensive,” said Golani. “But they brought from the yeshivas an ability to study hard, to focus, to apply logic, so we built on these skills.” At the end of the programme, about half were admitted to the Technion; they graduated this summer. Bringing the students up to the required educational standard was not the only challenge. Gender segregation, a norm in Haredi communities, was a big issue, Golani said. “We told them upfront that we would not allow gender segregation on campus, no way. We suggested they arrive at class 10 minutes early and sit together, and they accepted that. We also told them that we have female professors, and we will not tell them they can’t teach certain students. They accepted that too.” Another key issue was use of the internet. “So each [Haredi student] carries two phones: a kosher phone, with no apps, and a regular smartphone. On that there is an app which tracks the history of all addresses browsed and sends a report of every website visited to a designated person in their community.” Some students have been ostracised by their communities. “One girl was boycotted by her friends. Someone else told me he was hiding for years, lying to his wife and family, telling them he was studying at another yeshiva when he was at the Technion.” The university also runs programmes aimed at encouraging Arab students to enrol. “That tends to be easier because their communities are eager to see them gain top-quality education and so the community resistance is much lower,” said Golani. It was essential to integrate “untapped resources” – meaning Arab-Israelis and ultra-Orthodox Jews – into the economy, he added. “The economy of Israel is largely based on the hi-tech sector. It’s the locomotive that carries the entire train of the Israeli economy. But we just don’t have enough people. Israel is a small country; we’re not India or China.” When Sabiner embarked on the challenge of becoming a doctor, initially he faced scepticism. “I was told it was impossible for me to catch up [academically] and to be accepted, that I would never make it as a doctor,” he said. But staff at the Technion “believed in me when no one else did”. “I was sure this was the only thing I want to do in life. I studied day and night, with a baby on my shoulder and my wife studying with me. I finished [the pre-university programme] with 99% in every field, and I was accepted [on the medical course]. “In the beginning, I kept it as a secret, only my close family knew. But then it became a known secret and I was under the microscope. In the end 99% of people were encouraging me.” Now that the end is in sight, he wants to encourage other Haredim to follow suit. “When I started the journey I said I don’t want to be a single episode. So I opened a group on social media telling other Haredim how they could become a doctor. Now we have 35 more in medical school.” Attitudes were changing, he said, with more integration and mutual understanding. “People understand we’re not a bottle of Coca-Cola on a production line, we’re individuals. If you want to do medicine, you should do medicine, and if you want to be a lawyer, you should be a lawyer. And if you want to study the Torah, go for it.” • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "Like other British soldiers who served in Afghanistan, the former British army captain Ed Aitken relied heavily on his Afghan interpreter. And not just for translation. Nervously leading his first patrol in Helmand province in 2011, Aitken recalled coming under fire for the first time: “The infamous crack-thump of fire in our direction and a crack-whizz of rounds deflecting off undergrowth.” He turned to see his interpreter, Mohammad Hares, looking relatively relaxed. Hares had already spent two years deployed with the British military. He had experienced much worse. “I felt safer knowing Hares was nearby. He probably had more combat experience than even my hardened troop sergeant,” Aitken said. It was the start of a collaboration which turned into a friendship and latterly into a movement that took on the Home Office – with impressive results. The British military employed an estimated 2,000 Afghan interpreters between 2001 and 2014. About 390 relocated to the UK and an unknown number of others arrived illegally. But many have been unable to bring their wives and children with them; and hundreds more remain in Afghanistan, some in mortal peril from Taliban reprisals, having not met stringent eligibility criteria for the resettlement programme. Aitken suggested contacting the interpreters to set up a network. “I agreed,” said Hares. “I got in touch with other Afghan interpreters and asked what the major problems were. We discussed visas, families, what would happen when our visas ran out. We collected all the information. “We became the focal point for the Afghan interpreters,” Aitken said. They called the organisation Sulha Network. Sulha (which means “reconciliation” in Dari) is now in contact with more than half of the 390 interpreters in the UK. The initial aim was threefold: to secure indefinite leave to remain for those given temporary British visas; to waive residency application fees of more than £2,000, which most of the group could not afford; and to secure the right for families to join them in Britain. They also wanted all interpreters to be eligible for resettlement, not just those in service during the narrow window specified by the British government. Aitken and Hares set about contacting the media, lobbying politicians, senior military figures and anyone else they thought might listen. Favourable press coverage, including a Daily Mail campaign, helped. In April they sent a letter to the Home Office: “We took great risk because we believed in the integrity of the British army, only to be let down by the politicians who see us as a number and not as people,” they wrote. The letter arrived on the day Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary over the Windrush scandal. Her successor, Sajid Javid, announced a series of concessions intended to ease the way for their resettlement in the UK. Among them, the Home Office agreed to waive the hefty fee to apply for permanent residence. The announcement made national headlines. “We had an amazing success,” says Aitken, noting that Javid conceded the points on his first day in office. “This two-man band got the home secretary on his first day in office pledging to make the changes.” Butthis was just the beginning. Many issues remain unresolved, such as the fate of the interpreters who arrived in the UK without visas and those still in Afghanistan and who want to leave. Hares said many interpreters left behind in Afghanistan are even more at risk now. “It is 10 times worse than 2010,” he said. Messages from interpreters eager to leave the country suggest that the resettlement process is sluggish at best. A dedicated phoneline set up in the British embassy in Kabul is proving problematic. “I called them many times but they don’t pick up,” wrote one former interpreter who worked with the army for three years. “Can you please find out [if I qualify for resettlement],” he asked via the Sulha WhatsApp group chat forum. Family reunion is the other big issue that needs resolving, says Aitken. Interpreters were told they needed to bring family with them immediately – a now-or-never offer. But many were unable to do so, for practical, bureaucratic or mundane reasons. However, Aitken and Hares have dug in, and late last month received an encouraging letter from the immigration minister Caroline Noakes. “I am … committed to looking again at what can be done to make it easier for Afghan interpreters to bring family members from Afghanistan to the UK,” she wrote. “The government has said those relocating to the UK can do so with their families and I am determined to respect that commitment,” she added, offering to meet Hares to discuss the issue. Aitken and Hares are not giving up. They also want to secure better working opportunities for the Afghans who are resettled in the UK, as very few have landed on their feet professionally. They see great potential inthis talented labour pool who could be employed as reservists, police officers or social workers. The motivation behind Sulha applies as much today as it did when they founded the organisation: that the UK should not turn its back on those Afghans who worked and fought alongside British troops. “We are still campaigning. We will keep struggling and keep trying,” Hares said. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/07/kidney-transplant-organ-donation-i-shouldnt-be-here-ive-had-three-potentially-fatal-illnesses",
    "date": "2018-09-07",
    "transcript": "Almost 40 years ago, I interviewed a charming 11-year-old girl who was on dialysis – or a kidney machine, as it was quaintly called then. My newspaper was backing a campaign to increase the then paltry number of people carrying donor cards. Claire Corps’s family in Ripon, North Yorkshire, had built a garage extension to house the machine and were anxiously awaiting a transplant. So articulate and smart was Claire that she later became something of a poster girl for kidney transplants and appeared on both Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and Blue Peter. Her operation came in 1980, thanks to a kidney from a 29-year-old man who had died in Leeds of a head injury. I visited her post-op at St James’s hospital in Leeds, with a teddy bear and a Mike Harding book to hand. We later lost touch. But recently I thought I would try to find out how long Claire, with her eminently Google-able name, had survived after the transplant. The answer was uplifting. Not only was she very much alive 38 years on, but she is now Dr Claire Corps, a senior researcher in transplant medicine, and a key member of staff at the hospital that saved her life. Corps has several academic papers to her name and lectures around the world. She sits on five official medical committees at national level – and is helping develop a new way of preserving donor organs pre-transplant for much longer than is currently possible. It was obvious when she was 11 that Corps was smart, but taking into account the amount of school she was missing because of her health, her scientific career has been nothing short of remarkable, even if her health has not always been perfect. “I shouldn’t really be here,” she said in her hospital office. “I’ve had three potentially fatal illnesses: renal failure when I was eight, two brain haemorrhages when I was 16 and neurosurgery, then liver failure in my 20s. My kidney transplant was the first success they’d had at St James’s with such a tiny child. “Then I needed a liver transplant – the first time they had ever done a liver transplant in a kidney transplant patient. When I made it to 50 years old, Professor Peter Lodge, who did the liver op and is now my boss here, said I shouldn’t have made it out of childhood.” When we met, she was also awaiting brain surgery on two aneurysms, which, as she said, were ‘waiting to blow, like pipes about to burst’. A calm thoughtful woman, supported by a strong Catholic faith, she admitted nonetheless to being distinctly edgy about the procedure. In the event it worked out fine, and she is preparing to return to the laboratory and continue her work. Corps explains that being medically literate can be a double-edged sword for someone who spends a lot of time as a patient in the hospital where she works. “My doctors do say, a little grimly, that I’m unusually complicated,” she said. Before our meeting, she had emailed a list of 10 highly technical questions to the team at the neighbouring Leeds general infirmary who were about to work on her aneurysms. “They probably won’t welcome such an interrogation, but since I was a child, I have always insisted on knowing the full story. My patient head and my science head do sometimes clash. When I was 16, I was hospitalised in Plymouth with the first of two brain haemorrhages I had swimming in Cornwall and the doctors told me my notes said, ‘Must be told everything.’ It was true; I’d always said the only way I can fight this is if you tell me exactly what’s going on.” I had imagined 38 years must be something of a record for a kidney transplant, but Corps was anxious to explain that 40- and 50-year survival times for kidney transplants are not unknown today. Health concerns did block her plan to study medicine after her time at Ripon Grammar, however. “The brain haemorrhages left me paralysed down one side and I had to teach myself to write again and miss a year of school. But I did it. You’re not supposed to be able to have two brain haemorrhages and then get into Mensa. “But I wouldn't have been tough enough for medicine. Going into liver failure as a junior doctor wouldn’t have made me very useful. So the work I do, partly in the lab, partly on screen, suits me perfectly.” Her PhD, which she gained in 2007, is in organ preservation for transplantation. Corps also finds time to look after her elderly father, take part in the annual Transplant Games (swimming, walking and cricket-ball throwing), and do amateur dramatics. Her partner is a fellow kidney transplant recipient who works for the NHS in Edinburgh. “So as you can see,” Corps said as I was leaving, “life has had its ups and downs. But surprisingly I am still here and trying to put back some of which I have taken out.” Lodge, her boss, said: “She’s a remarkable woman to have been through all she has and still have the passion to go to work every day and do her charitable stuff. “It’s not unknown for people who’ve had transplants to get very interested in helping other people, but Claire has always been extremely bright and that has helped a lot with her science. She’s written a lot of good stuff and we’ve worked together for 25 years on and off.” This article is part of a long-running series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-09-04",
    "transcript": "When Nicola Dady was diagnosed with an aggressive form of kidney and bladder cancer, her first thought was not of herself but her children. “My first feeling was, oh my God, what’s going to happen to them,” says Dady, a Londoner and single mother to two small children. “All I could think about was them. I didn’t want to die before my kids know who I am. Corey was only three at the time, and I thought if I die he’s not going to remember me at all.” She embarked on chemotherapy, with a poor prognosis of surviving more than five years. While she was in hospital, her children stayed with friends and relatives, but she felt terrible guilt when she realised her illness, and her absence, was taking an emotional toll on them. “I’m a single parent so we spent all of our time together, I was everything to them.” They felt sad and confused, she says. “Shenai became really clingy. I’d drop her off at school, she would go in and run back out again and say ‘bye mummy, I love you’, then she’d go in and run back out again. She always felt that would be the last time she’d see me.” Dady approached social services and charities to see what support they offered children with a parent or carer with cancer. She was given leaflets, but could not find what she was looking for. “Most organisations support people with cancer or children with cancer but there’s very limited support of children with a parent with cancer. I was so surprised. I thought, if my kids are suffering, there must be hundreds of kids who are suffering,” she says. She knew it would help Corey and Shenai to meet others in a similar position. So in 2012, she set up a charity, Don’t Forget the Kids, with funding from the Big Lottery Fund, to support children dealing with the trauma of being bereaved or having a loved one with cancer. Six years on, she regularly fields enquiries for copycat ventures across England, Scotland and even California. Families take part in “meaningful” arts and crafts that help them to learn more about each other. This might be guessing each other’s favourite films, for example, or drawing family trees. It is also a way for parents, who may not live to see their children grow up, to pass on their values. There are activities involving music and poetry, with the aim of creating positive memories and enjoying some “guilt-free fun”. The group meets regularly in a bright, spacious room at Broadwaters Children’s Centre in Tottenham, north London. “When they [the children] first come they don’t know what to expect,” says Dady. “They’re having massive changes at home so they’re very quiet usually and withdrawn. Or you might find with boys they might be over-boisterous. We just embrace them. We don’t force them to get involved in arts and crafts [...] but slowly you’ll see them coming over and join in.” Gemma Hall took her young brother James along after their mother died of liver cancer five years ago. James was nine at the time and did not want counselling. “At first he didn’t show much emotion,” says Hall, who has special guardianship of her brother. “It’s deep-rooted, he’s put her in a box and locked it away. I was very cautious of his feelings, of trying to get him to talk and be open with his emotions because I didn’t want him to hold it in and become angry.” Dady, who knew the family, suggested they come to the group. “Coming here allowed him to express his emotions, not necessarily through talking because he wasn’t quite at the age where he could express it verbally, so he would do different activities,” says Hall. “It really helped him. He was with other children who had experienced similar things so he didn’t feel so alone.” The charity provides peer support but is not a counselling service, says Dady. The children are under no pressure to discuss their experiences, but “if they want to talk about stuff, it’s a safe environment for them to do so”. Two years ago Dady received a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust fellowship, a special grant to travel around the US to research creative ways of helping children through bereavement – and in June she was awarded the fellowship’s Viscount De L’Isle award for her determination to succeed to help others. There have been challenges, she admits. Some people are reluctant to discuss their cancer diagnosis with their children and this can stop them coming to the group. However, with new enquiries each week there are plans to expand and launch another three groups across London, as well as to run trips away for families. Dady visited the Avery Center in Chino Hills, California, which offers therapy for people who have suffered a traumatic experience, such as the death of a loved one. “They’ve expressed an interest in starting a Don’t Forget the Kids out there in California,” says Dady, who is looking into how that could work. It is eight years since Dady was diagnosed. She had been told there was an 80% chance the cancer would come back within five years, but it did not and she is in remission. While Don’t Forget the Kids began as a way to comfort her own children, it has turned into a broader mission for Dady. Her experience, she says, has given her a purpose that she lacked before. She has published two books and recently finished a screenplay. “We need to live our best life,” she says. “I’m grateful for my cancer experience because it woke me up.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "'It saved our business': Italy's farmers turn low into high with cannabis",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/30/it-saved-our-business-italy-farmers-turn-to-cannabis-hemp",
    "date": "2018-08-30",
    "transcript": "Italian farmers are in crisis as low prices of wheat, desiccated land and big companies importing grain take their toll. But some have found a solution: growing cannabis. Hemp cultivation has been legal in Italy since 2016, and over the last few years the amount of land dedicated to the plant has increased from 400 hectares (1,000 acres) in 2013 to 4,000 hectares today. The law – which allows cultivation for non-pharmaceutical use of plants with up to 0.2% of the psychoactive compound THC – was introduced with the intention of increasing the development of industrial hemp production. Italians have taken advantage of the legal change to produce not only hemp ricotta and environmentally friendly bricks, but also hemp pasta and biscuits. “The boom in the production of hemp is an excellent example of the ability of agricultural firms to discover new frontiers,” said Roberto Moncalvo, the president of Coldiretti, Italy’s largest farmers’ association. “We are in the middle of an opportunity for economic and employment growth.” This solution to the crisis affecting Italian farmers can be seen in a small green oasis set in the arid interior of Sicily. Among the clay fields and sheaves of abandoned grain, a sign depicting a seven-point leaf hangs from a gate. Beyond it is Salvo Scuderi, the president of the agricultural cooperative Colli Erei. The 41-year-old has just finished reaping part of his hemp harvest, which will be used to make pasta, oil and flour. This year, Scuderi and 20 other producers of Rete Canapa Sicilia, an association whose goal is to promote and market the use of hemp in the region, have together produced almost 150 tonnes. “Hemp saved our business,” he said. “This year we earned 10 times more than what we used to earn with wheat and it has enabled us to hire four workers.” Wheat yields a profit of €250 (£220) per hectare in today’s market, while hemp can generate net earnings in excess of €2,500 per hectare, according t Rete Canapa Sicilia. And there are many Sicilian farmers who, in order to breathe new life into the dry land and to improve their financial situation have substituted wheat with hemp. In the countryside around Catenanuova, temperatures can reach the mid-40s in the summer. It is where the Italian car manufacturer Fiat used to test its prototypes under high temperatures, scorching weather would force trains to stopbecause of expanding rails. But it is not the heat alone that has caused the desiccation of the land. “Years of monocultural wheat cultivation are the problem,” said Dario Giambalvo, professor of agricultural sciences at the University of Palermo. “It has caused soil erosion, and is at risk of soon making the land infertile.” According to data from Italy’s Council for Agricultural Research and Analysis of Agricultural Economics, land planted with durum wheat decreased by 7.4% in southern Italy last year, and by more than 9% in the north of the country. Overall production decreased by more than 4% during the last year. This is why the move towards to hemp farming could help, say experts. “The cultivation of hemp is a valid opportunity for a diversified farming which can be a good solution for the rebirth of abandoned and less fertile land,” said Giambalvo, “The ancient Romans taught us that diversifying crops can help make the land more fertile. I do not know if this will lead to the growth of the agricultural sector, certainly for Italy is a return to the origins.” Up to the 1940s, Italy was the world’s largest producer of hemp after the Soviet Union. Back then in Italy, more 100,000 hectares were planted with hemp. After the war andthe move towards synthetic fibres, the cultivation of hemp plummeted. The downward trend continued as the campaign against illegal drug use was strengthened. In 1961 the Italian government signed the single convention on narcotic drugs. Despite the international treaty specifically excluding non-pharmaceutical hemp production from the regulations controlling cannabis, it led to further to decline in hemp cultivation in Italy. “Hemp has been waiting 60 years to reclaim its rightful place,” said Scuderi. “And this could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2% and to develop pharmaceutical experimentation.” The 2016 law does not prohibit the commercialisation of hemp flowers, a gap that allowed market for the sale of light cannabis to blossom, with more than 500 stores in Italy. The flowers, sealed in bags or jars with names such as Gorilla Blue, Amnesia and Raging Bull, can be collected and used for tisanes or as scents for wardrobes. But the majority of customers simply crumble them, roll them and smoke them. The effects are not as pronounced as most cultivated strains of cannabis, which typically have THC levels of 15-25%, but do offer an immediate sense of relaxation. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Italy ranks third in Europe for consumption of cannabis. On his company’s jars of hemp flowers, Scuderi has placed a label: “pizzo-free”. “It means the product is made without giving a cent to the mafia,” he said. “We launched a clear message: producing cannabis doesn’t mean just regenerating the land; it is also a way to weaken the mafia, which for decades has continued uninhibited in its quest to control the criminal business of drugs trafficking, and to give back to the farmers what the bosses had taken away from them.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "No turban, no sermon, just books for kids: meet Iran's travelling cleric",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/28/iran-cleric-esmail-azarinejad-bringing-joy-of-reading-poor-children",
    "date": "2018-08-28",
    "transcript": "“It was almost winter and Bear was getting sleepy,” the Iranian cleric reads aloud. He has taken off his clerical robe, put aside his white turban and is trying to entertain a group of children in one of Iran’s poorest villages. In between phrases, he troops back and forth to make sure everyone is listening. “Are you with me?” he asks. “What did Bear want to do?” The children, who are painting their school walls, reply: “Bear had a story to tell.” It’s all in a day’s work for Esmail Azarinejad, a father of two who is not your average cleric. Iranian theocrats are better known for delivering inflammatory remarks at Friday prayers or fulminating on television against a backdrop of “Death to America” chants. Azarinejad, 39, sees his mission somewhat differently. When he’s not teaching Islamic philosophy or Arabic literature at his city’s seminary, he travels to villages in the impoverished south-west of Iran, distributing books from the boot of his old Peugeot and reading passages from books such as Bear Has a Story to Tell by the American author Philip C Stead. “Since I came back to my city nearly six years ago after studying in Qom, I realised that 98% of the kids in our villages did not have access to books other than what’s taught in schools,” he said. In his free time, he has started visiting the province’s poorest villages, reading books for kids, showing them films or helping them paint their schools. “Reading books and telling tales is an excuse for me,” he told the Guardian. “My aim is their intellectual development, so that they have a beautiful world and be able to develop skills. I have a slogan, which says: story, ball, colour. Story will make their minds and world beautiful, ball is playing sport and being healthy, and colour is about painting schools or their libraries.” Azarinejad’s car carries a range of books and films including the Persian translations of titles by the Canadian author and illustrator Peter H Reynolds and those written by the American author Megan McDonald, who is known for her Judy Moody series. “I try to prepare the space for their creativity rather than teach them what to do,” Azarinejad said. “I have no prejudice in choosing book titles, whether written by a foreign writer or by an Iranian, whether religious or not, any book that is fit for developing their mind and skills is good to me.” In his latest trip this week to villages in Dishmok district, Azarinejad showed a four-minute film by the Palme d’Or-winning Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami to 15 children. Early in his career, Kiarostami, who became Iran’s foremost film-maker before his death in 2016, worked at the institute for intellectual development of children and young adults in Tehran, making films about children. Azarinejad said showing Kiarostami’s Two Solutions for One Problem seemed essential in the village because he realised the adults there had been locked in a feud for some time. “Afterwards, I gave them five words to use and compose a story of their own: oak tree, dried-up river, grandma, goat and crocodile. They have oak trees in the area and also a river, and I wanted to draw their attention to the fact that one day their river might dry up,” he said. Iran has a rich tradition of storytelling and fairytales. Its oldest form of dramatic performance is called Naghali, which is on Unesco’s list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding. According to Unesco, “the performer – the naqqāl – recounts stories in verse or prose accompanied by gestures and movements, and sometimes instrumental music and painted scrolls”. Azarinejad said the age of social media has hugely sidelined such ancient traditions that need to be revived, something he hopes to do by encouraging children to write down fairytales told to them by their grandparents, and then recite them to their friends. The Iranian cleric, who earns about 15m rials (£275) a month, insisted he works on a benevolent basis but encourages donations to support his activities. Provincial locals are raising money to buy him a new car. “I use my private car, use my own petrol, I take my own food while visiting these villages,” said the cleric, who documents his work on social media. “I have not pursued government help, nor they have given me any. This is happening in the sidelines of my life, not related to my job.” Azarinejad, who has two children aged seven and 12, said the tough times Iran is facing because of sanctions and a tense political situation have not taken hope away from him. “There’s a sense of hopeless, there are financial difficulties, but personally I haven’t lost my hope,” he said. “My hope is these kids, so long as I can encourage them to read books, I’ll remain hopeful. So long as I see kids with books in their hand, hope will be there.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "Shruti Kalra can never watch a film at the cinema without having to nudge the person next to her. “Every time there’s a silent scene, I need to ask them what’s going on,” says Kalra, a Delhi-based professor, who is blind. She only dares going to see a film with someone she knows won’t mind the disturbances. But when she watched the wildly popular Bollywood biopic Sanju things were different. As the film began, she opened an app on her smartphone and plugged in her earphones. A few taps later she was listening to an audio description of the movie, for the first time in her life. “I felt so independent just to be able to follow and understand the entire film on my own,” she remembers. Kalra is one of the first users of XL Cinema, an app developed in India that can synchronise an audio description of a movie with its cinema audio track. The app, launched in July by the software firm Brajma Intelligent Systems, uses audio descriptions provided by Saksham, an NGO working to empower people in India who are blind or visually impaired. Saksham produced the description in the office and studio of the film’s director, Rajkumar Hirani, a major figure in Indian cinema. In its first two weeks it was used almost 2,500 times at screenings of Sanju, despite being introduced three weeks after the film’s initial release. The app is free but some data is collected, including the name and location of the cinema theatre where it’s been used. The app is the first of its kind. India’s 8.8 million blind and 47.7 million visually impaired citizens have previously been excluded from the national obsession of Bollywood. “I often don’t understand why people around me are laughing during a movie,” says Krishan Kumar Murugan, who has limited vision. While badly needed new legislation that was introduced last year has boosted the rights of disabled Indians, it stopped short of forcing private firms to use tools such as audio description, sign language and captioning when producing media, including movies. Bollywood studios have made positive noises about greater accessibility, though some ultimately argued there was little point in producing audio descriptions if cinemagoers had no way to listen to them. “Film-makers didn’t take us seriously,” says Dipendra Manocha, Saksham’s co-founder, who is also blind. He’s hopeful that the new technology will now help ramp up the pressure on Bollywood studios to deliver. “There has been a big shift in attitude from production houses after seeing the app work so seamlessly with Sanju,” Manocha says. Leading film production firms including Sony Pictures, Yash Raj Films, Phantom Films and Fox Star Studios have shown interest. “We are exploring this idea for some of our upcoming movies,” says Vivek Krishnani, the managing director of Sony Pictures Entertainment Films India. “Next time, we’ll plan much further in advance to ensure that audio description can be part of our films right from day one,” says Hirani, one of India’s most feted film-makers. Before the app’s arrival, the only way to watch a movie with audio description was to wait months after the film’s release to order a DVD from Saksham, if the NGO had created one for that film (it has made 28 so far). A handful of audio-described screenings are also organised a few times a year at film festivals and in auditoriums around the country by interested organisations. The XL Cinema app was originally created to allow cinemagoers to listen to translations of movies in multiple languages, according to Kunaal Prasad of Brajma Intelligent Systems. “Meeting Kunaal seemed like divine intervention. We were so relieved to have found a solution,” says Manocha. Within three weeks, Prasad had carried out trial runs of the app while Saksham’s team gained permission to debut the app at screenings of Sanju. Manocha and Prasad are hopeful of a wider response once word spreads. “The app is a great example of universal design,” says Manocha. “I hope that the power of Bollywood will be able to draw attention to inclusion.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/23/the-syrian-refugee-aiming-to-become-an-olympic-swimmer",
    "date": "2018-08-23",
    "transcript": "Once upon a time, water was Eid Aljazairli’s greatest adversary, a vast expanse that stood between him and a life in Europe. Now, it sustains his greatest ambition. Aljazairli was a non-swimmer when he fled Damascus and took his chances on a small, barely seaworthy vessel that took him across the Mediterranean. Now he spends four hours each day in a swimming pool and dreams of making it to the Olympics. “My story starts with the American swimmer Michael Phelps,” the 24-year-old says, sitting in a friend’s flat in north-east London. “I was sitting at home late at night and I saw a video of him on YouTube by chance. “I saw him swimming and flying. He really inspired me and ignited a passion inside me,” he adds. “After watching two hours of films, I just said to myself: this is something I have to do.” Aljazairli was training to be an accountant and working as a visual merchandiser, developing floor plans and three-dimensional displays for shops when the Syrian war broke out. He arrived in Britain from Damascus in 2016, settling first in Scotland and then in the outskirts of London. When he was granted a five-year visa to remain in Britain this January, he moved to a hostel. And started swimming. Within six months, he has gone from barely being able to swim at all to clocking 43 seconds for the 50-metre freestyle. His times remain well short of Olympic qualifying levels, but his coaches reckon he could compete in a refugee team if the Rio 2016 innovation is repeated at the Tokyo games in 2020. The swimming Syrian, who lives on a meagre allowance of £5 a day, says he saves on groceries so as to put money aside for his monthly membership at the Waltham Forest Feel Good Centre. “I started practising, and I was so excited at first. When I started, I could not swim two or three metres, and I didn’t know why because it looked so easy on the video,” he says. Swimming takes him away from everything and transports him to another world where he feels untouchable, he says. “When you have a hard day and have a lot going on, you just go into the water and enter another world. In the water you cannot hear or see anyone … All I have is 25 metres and my passion to get to the Olympics.” Daniel Bullock, a local coach who has taken Aljazairli on, says the pace of his progress is remarkable – but that he has a way to go to get to hit the Olympic standard (currently the best in the world swim approximately twice as fast as him). “I hope that there will be mini-Olympics within the bigger event … We have been trying to support Eid’s application and find out whether there will be another like that,” he says. He adds: “The reason so many people have taken Eid’s story to heart and helped him … is that with little help, he has taught himself to swim in six months. He’s remarkable in his own right and has made rapid progress. His story is really an inspiration. I hope he will go back to Syria and be the next minister for swimming and generate interest in it,” Bullock adds. A crowdfunding page has been set up to help raise money to give Aljazairli the right support to compete. Aljazairli is now learning English and wants to go to university in September, but swimming is now a big part of his life. “I currently swim from 6am to 8am and 6pm to 8pm. I can organise my life around it,” he says. “When people hear my dream of swimming in the Olympics and I tell them I want to be like Michael Phelps, people laugh … They say, ‘You are a refugee and you get £5 a day, don’t waste your time and do other things.’ But I believe in myself and that I can do anything. When I hear people say that, it pushes me harder. I am not just a refugee, but I am a dreamer.” Bullock says: “Eid wants to go and be competitive. He has a long way to go to do that. He needs help with nutrition and help with strength and conditioning. He needs to swim in a pool bigger than 25 metres … We are a stepping stone helping him through to the next stage.”",

    "date": "2018-08-21",
    "transcript": "Rohingya refugees are turning to blockchain-type technology to help address one of their most existential threats: lack of officially-recognised identity. Denied citizenship in their home country of Myanmar for decades, the Muslim minority was the target of a brutal campaign of violence by the military which culminated a year ago this week. A “clearance operation” led by Buddhist militia sent more than 700,000 Rohingya pouring over the border into Bangladesh, without passports or official ID. The Myanmar government has since agreed to take the Rohingya back, but are refusing to grant them citizenship. Many Rohingya do not want to return and face life without a home or an identity. This growing crisis prompted Muhammad Noor and his team at the Rohingya Project to try to find a digital solution. “Why does a centralised entity like a bank or government own my identity,” says Noor, a Rohingya community leader based in Kuala Lumpur. “Who are they to say if I am who I am?” Using blockchain-based technology, Noor, is trialling the use of digital identity cards that aim to help Rohingya in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia access services such as banking and education. The hope is that successful trials might lead to a system that can help the community across southeast Asia. Under the scheme, a blockchain database is used to record individual digital IDs, which can then be issued to people once they have taken a test to verify that they are genuine Rohingya. Noor’s goal is to give Rohingya the power to reclaim their identities with a resilient system that their host countries will recognise, allowing them access to social programmes, legal rights, education and healthcare. At this stage, the Rohingya Project’s main objective is to address the most prominent issue facing stateless peoples: financial exclusion. Noor’s team is one of a group of refugees and stateless peoples around the globe who are harnessing the power of blockchain technology to reclaim their identities. The concept of the blockchain comes from the digital currency bitcoin, which tracks the movement of money around its ecosystem by grouping transactions into 10 minute-long blocks, each of which is inextricably linked to every previous block in a chain of transactions going back to the currency’s creation. Because of how those blocks are created and linked, they can serve as an immutable record of who owns what, even without any central authority verifying the network as a whole. That property – the idea of a decentralised, “trustless” database – has proved appealing to uses beyond e-money, with blockchain startups now offering everything from cloud computing to virtual trading cards. It has gained popularity among humanitarians in recent years, with charities using it to transfer money cheaply and disburse aid to refugees. Tufic Al Rjula’s birth certificate was destroyed in Kuwait during the first Gulf war. Living for two years in a Dutch refugee camp as he worked through the asylum process, Al Rjula met more than 1,000 other “invisible” men, women and children whose identifying documents were either destroyed or unverifiable. Years later, having personally experienced how centralised, paper-based IDs such as birth certificates, drivers licences and degrees can easily be lost, forged or misused, Al Rjula co-founded award-winning startup Tykn with Jimmy Snoek. Tykn’s mission statement is to provide “self-sovereign identity to all”. Al Rjula cites the punch card system used by the Nazis in the second world war to identify and track people on the basis of ethnicity as an example of the ways traditional forms of ID can be exploited and undermined. Snoek says that while paper-based ID is “non-resilient” to forgery, discrimination and loss, a blockchain-based system offers better protection. In their host countries, refugees and stateless peoples are often found living on the periphery of society. Unable to work legally and operating in cash-based “dark” economies rife with exploitation, they are prevented from building the network of official connections needed to verify their identity and open a bank account. Blockchain-based initiatives, such as the Rohingya Project, could eventually allow people to build the network of relationships necessary to participate in the modern global economy and prevent second and third generation “invisible” people from slipping into poverty. It could also allow refugees to send money across borders, bypassing high transaction fees. In Jordan’s Azraq refugee camp, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is using blockchain and biometrics to help Syrian refugees to purchase groceries using a voucher system. This use of the technology allows the WFP to bypass bank fees. But Al Rjula says privacy is still an issue. “The technology is maturing, yet implementation by startups and emerging tech companies is still lacking,” he says. The involvement of a trendy technology such as blockchains can often be enough to secure the funding, attention and support that start-ups – whether for-profit or charitable – need to thrive. But companies such as Tykn still have to tackle plenty of the same issues as their old-fashioned database-using counterparts, from convincing governments and NGOs to use their services in the first place to working out how to make enough overhead to pay staff, while also dealing with the fickle issues of building on a cutting-edge platform. Blockchain-based humanitarian initiatives will also need to reckon with the problem of accountability in their efforts to aid refugees and those trapped in the limbo of statelessness. Dilek Genc, a PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh who studies blockchain-type applications in humanitarian aid and development, saysif the aid community continues to push innovation using Silicon Valley’s creed of “fail fast and often,” and experiment on vulnerable peoples they will be fundamentally at odds with humanitarian principles and fail to address the political roots of issues facing refugees.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/16/regreening-niger-how-magical-gaos-transformed-land",
    "date": "2018-08-16",
    "transcript": "Rain had come to nearby villages, but not yet to Droum in south-east Niger. The sand under its stately trees looked completely barren, but Souley Cheibou, a farmer in his 60s, was not worried. He crooked a finger, fished in the sand, and brought out a millet seed. In a week or two, this seed would germinate and sprout, and soon the whole field would be green. Cheibou’s peace of mind stemmed from the trees encircling him, which had been standing long before he was born. Despite appearances, these were not any old acacias. They were gao trees – known as winterthorns in English – with unique, seemingly magical powers. From the peanut basin of Senegal to the Seno plains of Mali, to Yatenga, formerly the most degraded region of Burkina Faso, and as far south as Malawi: gaos are thriving in Africa. And over the past three decades, the landscape of southern Niger has been transformed by more than 200m new trees, many of them gaos. They have not been planted but have grown naturally on over 5m hectares of farmland, nurtured by thousands of farmers. According to scientists, what has happened in Niger – one of the world’s poorest countries – is the largest-scale positive transformation of the environment in the whole of Africa. This is not a grand UN-funded project aiming to offset climate change. Small-scale farmers have achieved it because of what the trees can do for crop yields and other aspects of farming life. “It’s a magic tree, a very wonderful tree,” said Abasse Tougiani of Niger’s National Institute of Agricultural Research, who has travelled all over Niger studying Faidherbia albida – the gao’s Latin name. Shielded from the sun, crops planted under the canopy of a tree usually do not do well in the short term, although there can be longer-term benefits. That’s one reason why many west African rainforests have been decimated. But with gaos, it’s the other way round. The root system of the gao is nearly as big as its branches, and unusually it draws nitrogen from the air, fertilising the soil. And unlike other trees in the area, gao tree leaves fall in the rainy season, allowing more sunlight through to the crops at a key moment. Used along with mineral fertilisers, crop yields double under gaos, and the gao-nourished soil holds water better, ensuring a better crop in drought years. Counterintuitively, the great gao regreening is only happening in areas of Niger with high-density populations. With less space to expand into as more people are born, hard-up farmers are increasingly realising that the trees can regenerate degraded land. “It’s literally a story of more people, more trees,” said Chris Reij, a sustainable land management specialist. “The whole point is that the trees are not protected and managed by farmers for their environmental beauty, but because they are part of the agricultural production system.” Inadvertently, the farmers are also doing their bit to offset climate change. Trees are crucial for storing carbon, absorbing it out of the atmosphere. “In mature, fairly dense areas, you get 30 tons of wood per hectare. Half of that is carbon,” said Gray Tappan, a geographer. Efforts to restore 100m hectares of degraded African land by 2030 are underway. The ambitious Great Green Wall project to surround the Sahara desert with trees and other plants has changed beyond recognition after debate over whether desertification - the process by which soil loses its fertitlity - is real. Progress is slow. In Niger, where temperatures often reach the 40s, the trees create a cooler microclimate, and rabbits and jackals are coming back. But none of these grand political projects explains why gaos have caught on. The trees’ pods make very nutritious animal fodder, and fallen branches make good firewood, meaning Droum’s women and children – whose job it is to collect fuel for cooking fires – rarely have to venture further than a few kilometres to find it. Women in Droum have also made medicine from their gaos for generations. “People come all the way from Zinder [Niger’s second largest city] to buy it,” said Husseina Ibrahim, a busy mother, next to a pot of boiling gao bark. “I’m the only one who makes this here. It’s great for me, it earns me a bit of money which I pay into the women’s cooperative.” Tales about how the gao came to be so revered abound. Legend has it that crimes against gaos have been taken very seriously since the mid-19th century. “If you touched a branch, you would go to jail,” Tougiani said. In splendid brocade robes and curly-toed velvet slippers, surrounded by self-portraits and stick-wielding guards dressed in red and green, today’s district chief in Droum takes a slightly softer approach. “It’s shameful to have to come before the chief and explain yourself. Often that’s punishment enough,” Maman Ali Kaoura said. Droum’s reoffenders face fines of between 5,000 to 10,000 West African CFA francs (£6.75-£13.50), a huge amount for hard-up farmers. A sense of ownership has been key in the regreening of Niger. Until the mid-1980s, every tree was considered to belong to the state. When this changed, regreening began, as people were happier to look after trees that belonged to them. In areas with the best cover, they organised patrols to protect their trees from passing farmers and neighbouring villagers seeking firewood. Once people discovered that “one gao was equal to 10 cows” for fertilising, as Tougiani put it, the tree’s popularity took off. Several schemes, including one where farmers with more than 50 gaos were paid 50 CFA for each one, helped it along. But their loyalty to their gaos could make areas around Zinder the most vulnerable to a disease that Reij and Tougiani have recently spotted killing trees near Niamey, the capital. If it spreads, the losses could be enormous, particularly in places where there is a near-monoculture of gaos. “I’m worried, because it’s green oil for farmers – it’s their wealth,” said Tougiani. “If they lose Faidherbia albida, they’ll lose their way of life. They’ll have to leave the village.” For Cheibou, losing his trees is unthinkable – they were his birthright. “I have nearly 100 gao trees in my fields, which I inherited from my father,” he said. On his way back to the village, he paused by a particularly large one, and cracked open its round seedpod. “This one was here when I was a boy. Just like it is now.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "transcript": "When Rose Mark retired from being a teacher, she and her husband decided to leave their bustling San Francisco neighbourhood to find somewhere they would feel safer. One problem: the booming local tech scene had turbocharged demand for homes, and they found themselves outbid time and again. As well as security, Mark craved a connection with her neighbours. Previously, she would be lucky to get a quick “hi” on the street. “I’m very friendly. I’ve lived in many different neighbourhoods in San Francisco,” she says. “I’d try to make friends but there wasn’t a sense of community.” Then, among the artist studios and loft apartments on the colourful streets of Jingletown, Oakland, Mark found an answer: the Phoenix Commons, a co-housing community for over-55s. Residents own their modest homes while sharing spacious communal areas, including a kitchen, movie room and a hot tub. The community is self-managed, residents work together in committees and each night a group of volunteers cooks for everyone. The four-storey complex of 41 units is designed to foster a sense of community. Apartment windows face each other and walkways create a visible sense of life and movement. Mark was one of the first to move in, two years ago. She appreciates how much residents help each other, from sharing food to supporting someone through the death of a partner. “My friends jokingly call this the Commune,” she says. “If they could witness life here, it might allay some of their fears about giving up their independence. It is an incredible feeling of security, safety and peacefulness.” Co-housing is growing in popularity with young and old around the world. There are 165 co-housing communities in the US and another 140 in the planning stages. In the UK, Older Women’s Co-Housing (OWCH) in north London has a long waiting list and there are 20 other established co-housing communities, and 40 in development. Co-housing is a long-established part of the housing mix in the Netherlands and Sweden, where communities are supported by government, and the idea is growing in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. Interest in co-housing has risen since the economic downturn and as housing costs in cities surged. Many may argue it is a lamentable trend, but closer ties with neighbours can provide an antidote to the modern epidemic of loneliness, particularly among older people. Half a century ago in the summer of love, baby boomers were part of a seismic cultural shift, and now another is under way, this time revolutionising retirement. This generation of retirees are the healthiest ever and crave continued personal independence while maintaining community ties. Robby Kiley, 75, a Phoenix Commons resident, describes traditional retirement homes as “landed cruise ships”, where meals and entertainment are provided at a cost. She worries that an absence of responsibilities leads to regression and decline. Phoenix Commons is self-managed, and residents must be able to live independently. That excludes people who require care but encourages those who want to continue to lead a relatively active lifestyle. “We’re always learning,” says Kiley. “Here you have to keep up.” Christian Zimmerman set up Phoenix Commons because, he says, it’s the way that he wants to grow old: in close proximity with his peers and not a passive consumer. “Living alone in an apartment is not the best way to live,” says Zimmerman, who spent 45 years managing retirement homes. “I don’t think a lot of people like it. I think they’re just afraid of the other things. They’re afraid that if they move into a community that they’re not going to get along with somebody, or they’re not going to get enough privacy. But what price privacy?” A couple of hours’ drive inland, in the university town of Davis, is another co-housing community, America’s oldest. Muir Commons was set up in 1991 by two architecture graduates, Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, who had researched co-housing communities in Denmark. The design for the multigenerational Muir Commons fills a typical American block, but instead of regimented rows of houses facing the road, homes have been built at angles to each other with open and connected front gardens. Children run back and forth, enjoying a communal playground, an orchard and vegetable beds. Cars are kept out of the way in car parks, and there is a common house where the community eats together a couple of nights a week. Ben Finkelor moved in because he thought it would be good for his children. “You open your front door and they can play and there’s no cars,” he says. “You can share parenting. We have social activities. On Father’s Day we have a water fight – dads vs the kids.” He thinks his children benefit from interacting with older residents. “The intergenerational thing is very important,” agrees Ray Frank, 72, another resident. “I would never want to live in a community of people of essentially the same age. It’s such a delight to watch children growing up. And we’ve found that the kids here grow up with certain skills that most other children don’t develop easily. They learn how to talk to people of all ages.” Residents say the Muir Commons children have better social skills, and the older residents without children and grandchildren of their own get to enjoy a sense of family. According to Stephanie Cacioppo, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Chicago, loneliness among retirees in the US is becoming an alarming public health issue. “The availability of community programmes, behavioural interventions and online resources is increasing to address the problem of loneliness. Co-housing is one of these programmes that gives us hope,” she says. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "In Bosnia-Herzegovina, a new thoroughfare on the European migration route, exhausted and demoralised refugees and migrants have found charity and support from a local population that remembers its own hardships in the not-so-distant past. Four months ago, about 70 migrants arrived in the city of Bihać, close to the border with Croatia, and pitched tents in the centre. The mayor, Šuhret Fazlić, suggested they move to the concrete shell of a half-built dormitory on the edge of town. “During the war, Bihać was under siege for 1,200 days,” said Fazlić. “We feel enormous empathy with these people.” There are now about 1,000 people living in the building. Few migrants and refugees want to stay in Bosnia, citing a lack of economic opportunity, but as people have been repeatedly and violently pushed back from Croatia, they have been made to feel welcome by many locals. Asim Latić, a restaurant owner in Velika Kladuša, another border town, said: “In February I saw a man standing in the street in the snow. I asked if he was hungry, and he said he didn’t have any money. “I said it didn’t matter and fed him. That guy texted his friends and the next day they came. More people came, and I had to close the restaurant. Since then, we’ve given out 68,000 meals.” Latić, 63, now receives funding from the International Organization for Migration, but for two months he and three friends funded the operation. “We are all war veterans. We know what it means to have nothing, we know what it means to be hungry,” he said during an interview at the back of his cafe, as dozens of people tucked into plates of spaghetti at the front. As the months go on, the mood is beginning to sour, however. On Monday in Bihać, locals protested against the current situation. Most of the anger was directed at authorities for mishandling the situation, but there is also growing unease about the migrants. Harun, 20, held up a sign saying “immigrants go home”. He said that three days previously, two migrants had stolen his mobile phone, possibly a result of Croatian police stealing or breaking phones, an allegation that came up repeatedly. The situation is made more difficult by Bosnia’s complex and dysfunctional political system, which has four separate levels of authority. Added to this are upcoming elections in October. Milorad Dodik, who leads the Serb-majority entity that forms half the Bosnian political system, has claimed Sarajevo authorities are deliberately settling Muslim migrants in order to change the demographic balance of the country. Fazlić said the government in Sarajevo was more concerned about scoring political points than finding a workable solution to the issue. “There are so many scumbags in politics who will say anything for political advantage,” he said.

    "date": "2018-08-10",
    "transcript": "It was conceived as a model for environmental living in the 21st century – a self-governing eco-village which would be communal, carbon-neutral and self-sufficient. The plans for Cloughjordan, a settlement in the heart of Ireland, provided for a working farm, solar power, an “edible landscape” and district heating. There would be 130 plots for homes on a 67-acre site and some communal ownership. Then, 10 years ago this month came the financial crisis. “In 2008, there were deposits on every site,” says Davie Philip, one of the founders. “Then, with the crash, we lost all our staff and 50% of our deposits.” Ten years later, it is remarkable that Cloughjordan is still soldiering on. Harsh lessons have been learned and this is certainly no utopia. But locals are adamant that they are the pioneers of a low-carbon economy and that the world can learn from their example. In all, 55 houses have been built on the 130 sites, with another 20 sites sold. The sustainable heating, drainage and sewage systems have had problems, leading to some ecological compromises, but the basic infrastructure works. And though it may not be fully self-sufficient, the village has a working farm, an array of well-tended polytunnels and a bakery providing the community with good food year round. Philip, a Scotsman who moved to Ireland 25 years ago and now lives on Cloughjordan’s main street, takes me on a tour. “Things are always a bit messy here because we have to do everything ourselves,” he says. “There are no municipal services, so we have to cut the grass, keep it clean, plant bushes and apple trees. This isn’t the market square that we envisaged, but it’s still used in various ways.” Some of the houses are self-built – Philip points out a hobbitish “hand-sculpted” dwelling with a roof made of recycled plastic “slates” – while others are contract-built. They are kept warm by the district heating system up the hill, whose boilers are powered by wood chips from an Irish sawmill. Behind it is a big field of solar panels, which Philip admits has not worked properly since it was installed in 2008. “The company that installed it went bust in the recession, so there was no recourse,” he says. As a result, the community has had to rely on mains electricity to drive the pumps. Across the road, in his RED (Research Education Development) garden, Bruce Darrell stresses the importance of growing one’s own food in an uncertain world. “I’m at the doomer end of the spectrum, I’m not a utopian,” he says, showing me the plots where he has been experimenting with various approaches to growing, including the “no-dig” method. “This is about resilience. It’s about how to get by in a resource-constrained future.” “When the diesel runs out, we’ll be ready,” says farmer Pat Malone cheerfully. Today he has connected his plough to a tractor but “as often as we can” his team employs horses. “We’re combining old practices with new equipment,” he says. “Horses provide dung and they disturb the soil much less than tractors. The challenge working with horses is to create time. For that, you need more people. We want to bring people back on to the land.” Similar sentiments are expressed by Joe Fitzmaurice and Julie Lockett at Riot Rye bakery. “We’re going back to the old system of bakeries, where the amount of bread you produced was limited by how far a [delivery] horse could travel,” says Fitzmaurice. Their wood-fired oven restricts output to 350 loaves a week and they supplement their income by running baking classes. The eco-village allows people to put ideas of low-impact living into practice and to promote them to the wider world. What’s harder, it becomes clear, is keeping the community itself happy. “When I arrived, I thought the work was to bring a lot of approaches – green building, permaculture, renewable energy – together in a community,” says Philip. “Now I see the real work, in every community, is how do we cooperate when we have different values and world views?” At Cloughjordan, rather than relying on (and being failed by) distant administrative bodies, the residents do all the work themselves – from governance to lawn-mowing. This requires a huge amount of collective effort and no small amount of diplomacy. “You need to be a good communicator,” says Lockett. “You’re engaging on a lot more levels. We’re tied together financially, which leads to different conversations with neighbours – people don’t usually talk about money.” Decision-making happens on a consensus basis; a number of groups and subgroups have been set up to cover areas such as education, land use and development. It can be complicated and often frustrating, but, as resident academic Peadar Kirby says: “What’s the alternative? Give all the power to the board? This governance structure allows a huge amount of creativity to flourish.” Many who consider themselves part of the project, including Philip, live in the old village of Cloughjordan nearby. “Some people in the pub will give out about us after a few drinks, but that’s to be expected,” Philip says. He points out that the population of Cloughjordan has increased, while many other Irish country villages are losing residents, so schools are better attended and staffed as a result. The biggest challenge, says Philip, is getting more young people involved. “We were in our 30s when we started, but we’re not that young anymore,” he says ruefully. “We need to make it easier for young people to come here, buy plots and build” and contribute to the community. He cites co-housing schemes as one possible way forward here. When I ask another of the founder-residents, the journalist Iva Pocock, if the success of Cloughjordan depends on whether it is replicated elsewhere, she shakes her head. “The idea that we’re going to save the world by people setting up eco-villages is naive.” A better measure of success, she says, is if other communities take on elements of what has been implemented here: the car-sharing scheme, for example, or what Pocock refers to as Cloughjordan’s edible landscape – the fruit bushes, trees and herbs around the village, which anyone can make use of. Kirby is more bullish. “If the question is: what political system could we design to get to a low-carbon economy? I think we’re modelling that, for all our faults and failures.” That evening, the sun is out and the market square is aglow. Children are playing, neighbours are chatting, people are out walking their dogs. The grass is unkempt and a few nearby buildings need a lick of paint, but somehow this seems less significant than it did when I arrived. Cloughjordan has a long way to go, it’s true, but perhaps we should appreciate just how far it has come.

    "title": "Universal basic income hasn’t made me rich. But my life is more enriching | Tuomas Muraja",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/07/universal-basic-income-rich-finland-work-benefits",
    "date": "2018-08-07",
    "transcript": "The Finnish basic income trial, of which I am part, finishes at the end of the year. Having been interviewed by nearly 70 separate media outlets, from the BBC to Le Figaro, the question I have been asked most often has been: how has the basic income trial changed my life? My answer is simple. In money terms, my life has not changed at all. However, the psychological effects of this human experiment have been transformative. I vastly prefer basic income to a benefits system fraught with complicated forms, mandatory courses and pointless obligations. Before the trial, the risk of losing unemployment benefits and the cumbersome process of reapplying for them were an obstacle to accepting small job assignments. The bureaucracy involved made accepting some not worthwhile, or simply too risky. The basic income trial started at the beginning of 2017. A random sample of 2,000 people aged 25 to 58 was chosen to take part and receive a monthly income of €560 (£475), with no requirement to seek or accept employment. The precondition was that the participants had received either a labour-market subsidy or a basic unemployment allowance from Finland’s social insurance institution Kela in November 2016. At that point I had just run out of a grant I had received and was officially a jobseeker, making me eligible to take part. The Finnish government wanted to find out if jobseekers obtain work more easily when the basic unemployment allowance is replaced with a basic income. During the trial the participants had the right to keep their basic income even if they found work. The idea is that temporary and part-time work is becoming increasingly common, which may mean there is also a growing interest in social security models that support the acceptance of such work. The basic income trial has indeed resulted in work for myself and many other participants, from IT experts, artists and commerce professionals to new graduates. And there is little doubt that the trial benefits people in creative fields, freelancers, people doing expert work and project workers – an ever-increasing number of people. My income consists of fees I charge as a writer and lecturer as well as grants I receive from various institutions. I have also had occasional brief periods of unemployment during which I have received unemployment benefits. My monthly income has varied from some €3,000 to nothing at all. The Finnish social security system allows an unemployed person to earn a maximum of €300 a month with a 50% tax set on any earnings exceeding that limit. While taking part in the basic income trial I have been able to accept speaking engagements in libraries and schools for a fee of €250, a seat in panel discussions in the SuomiAreena public debate forum and at book fairs. Concerns have been voiced about the high cost of the basic income model. But free school meals, free basic education and universal basic healthcare are expensive too. Critics say that basic income at the level used in the trial cannot be extended to cover the entire population as this would create an adverse balance of some €10-15bn. But atypical employment relationships are on the increase and our social security system has become outdated. The system requires more investment to boost the minimum income level, to improve the level of financial incentives and to simplify it. Basic income models do come with a small increase in taxation. For a large number of employed people this will, however, be compensated for by the basic income. As more people manage to find work while supported by basic income, taxation for everyone can be eased. In terms of purchasing power, basic income would have a predominantly positive effect as it would help people in low-income jobs the most. The critics fear that basic income will make people lazy. However, limited evidence from several basic-income trials from around the world prove that people use basic income to improve their quality of life and not as a licence to do nothing. Research has shown that unemployed people do not have a low motivation for work. Neither is it justified to say that unemployment on a large scale is the result of an unwillingness to work. The isolated cases of lazy, work-averse individuals so eagerly highlighted by the media do not represent the situation accurately. I hope this trial encourages future governments to examine fresh options. My living costs today stand at nearly €2,000 a month – it’s a sum I would never be able to pay with just the basic income. And that was not the idea. Rather, basic income acts as the perfect incentive – it gives you security to chase other opportunities. It pushes you to seek fulfilling work – and isn’t that what unemployment benefits should do? • Tuomas Muraja is a journalist and writer who is taking part in the Finnish basic income trial",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/06/paraguay-eliminates-malaria-regional-outbreaks-soar",
    "date": "2018-08-06",
    "transcript": "One recent morning, the halls of Senepa – Paraguay’s National Malaria Eradication Service – echoed to the sounds of folk songs and a violin. The health minister handed out medals, and a dancer, balancing a bottle on her head, swished her skirts around the room. The traditional celebrations marked Paraguay’s official elimination of malaria in June – the only country in South America to have eradicated the infectious, life-threatening disease, and the first in the western hemisphere to do so since Cuba in 1973. For many, it is an achievement akin to a military victory after 60 years of struggle. The campaign began in 1939, when a grueling war with Bolivia, an outbreak of malaria infected 80,000 people out of a population of 1 million. “It had a huge social and economic impact,” said Mónica Ozorio, a biochemist and the director of Senepa’s anti-malaria programme. “It affected all the regions – we even had it in the Chaco.” Tens of thousands died. The epidemic prompted Paraguay to establish its health ministry – and, in 1957, the anti-malaria agency. It was the beginning of six decades of sustained eradication, said Luis Escoto, the WHO representative in Paraguay. “Passing through different political moments and governments of different colours, it has become a policy of state,” Escoto said. A lasting commitment to spending of a fixed portion of income from the country’s social security programme – first 0.5%, later 1.5% – on battling the disease was a “decisive factor,” he added. So too were shifts in strategy – from a top-down, Senepa-led effort that focused on mass fumigation of mosquito breeding grounds, to one that incorporated the national health service and focused on diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cases. Senepa clustered dozens of diagnosis laboratories in malaria-prone regions, and those adjacent to Brazil. Private and public clinics are required to treat cases, free of charge. Businesses and media outlets run information campaigns. “If there’s an imported case of malaria these days, it’s national news – all the ministries are informed,” said Ozorio. But most point to the key factor as being a network of up to 5,000 unpaid volunteers – including urban community organisers and indigenous leaders – that is still working to educate fellow citizens, eliminate mosquito habitats, and stay alert for new cases. Everyone has a grandparent or cousin who did their bit, Ozorio explained. “We feel proud that a small country has done it, with our own resources and everyone working together,” she added. By the turn of the last century, these efforts were bearing fruit. The last case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest form of the disease, was registered in 1995. The Plasmodium vivax variety was eliminated in 2011. A five-year program with the support of the WHO and the Global Fund thereafter worked to prevent re-transmission and boost community education, prevention and treatment. Finally, in April this year, the country was certified as having been free of home-grown malaria cases for three years, the first of 21 countries – including Mexico, Belize and El Salvador – that were earmarked by the WHO as on course do so by 2020. “Paraguay is an excellent demonstration that it is possible,” Escoto said. The victory is a much-needed success story, both for Paraguay and the region. The country’s health service is fragmented and otherwise short on funding, often making the headlines for shocking reason, such as Paraguay’s high rates of child pregnancy. And despite long-term progress, malaria cases have spiked worldwide in recent years – to 216 million cases in 2016 – with much of the increase in Latin America. At least 445,000 people died from the disease in 2016. The disease has erupted in crisis-ridden Venezuela, where the government has refused offers of outside help to contain it. In Brazil – which shares 2,200km of largely uncontrolled borders with Paraguay – malaria infections grew by 80% between January and June, said Ozorio. “The risk of importation is very high, it’s undeniable,” she added. “30,000 people, especially students, cross the border every day.” Senepa is boosting coordination between migration officials, hotels, universities, and clinics; two Paraguayan nationals who returned from Africa with malaria in June were treated rapidly. And there are global trends that could see malaria return to Paraguay – and spread to nearby countries unused to the disease, catching doctors unprepared. “Climate change is a worry for everyone,” said Escoto. “We can’t let our guard down.” Rising, fluctuating temperatures, heavy rainfall and flooding all create hospitable environments for disease-carrying vectors in previously malaria-free areas, he explained. “In northern Argentina, provinces where mosquitoes once didn’t exist are now natural habitats,” he added. “Chile and Uruguay are now at risk.” But Paraguay remains vigilant, Ozorio said, and ready to share the lessons of six decades in eradicating the illness. “It’s a national achievement,” she added, describing heroic clinicians sent off to the countryside in decades past with little more than a microscope and a motorbike. “There’s a kind of mystique to Senepa,” she laughed. “There’s a lot of history to tell.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Just before dawn in the bustling city of Birgunj, an elegant middle-aged woman clocks on to start her border patrol shift. Maya Gurung has policed these streets for the past nine years. But she is not a law enforcement officer. She is one of a team of people who scour the Nepali-Indian borderlands for signs of one of the most insidious – and growing – crimes in this part of the world: the trafficking for sex of young women. Traffickers target young women from Nepal’s remote communities, promising them employment opportunities abroad, only to sell them into forced labour and prostitution once they reach India’s megacities. These women can spend years locked up in brothels, being made to have sex with over 20 men a day to make money for their “owners”. With no access to healthcare, many fall victim to disease and never make it home. Estimates put the number trafficked at as high as 10,000 a year. The “human interceptors”, as they are known, work in partnership with Love Justice International, an NGO that coordinates teams at 20 of Nepal’s border crossings. Gurung is tasked with monitoring the constant stream of traffic across the border, and physically intercepting women she suspects are being tricked out of Nepal by human traffickers. Love Justice International has said it averages about 90 successful interceptions a month in Nepal. The interceptors look for several signs that passers-by might be being trafficked, mostly by assessing their body language. Sometimes women were clearly panicking, but most often they were simply nervous, and look unrelated to the person travelling with them. “The first thing we say is: ‘Where are you from, where are you going?’,” says Gurung. “We ask if their family know that they are travelling to India and when they say they do, we call them to check.” At this point holes in the stories sometimes appear. The family may say she was travelling to meet relatives, while her accomplice would mention a job or a shopping trip. Often the women themselves would lie, refusing to give up hope of a better life on the other side. The traffickers have established close relationships with victims, and often came from their own communities. Sometimes they would pretend to be in love with them and trick them into India with promises of marriage. Increasingly, the traffickers were young women themselves. The interceptors do not have any legal authority to stop people crossing the border, and instead have relied on the local police force to apprehend traffickers once they have identified that an attempt at trafficking was being made. “The hardest part is when we take the girls we intercept to the police station and try to file charges against their trafficker, but these cases are not taken seriously,” says Gurung. “The police sometimes ignore the cases and even accuse the victims, saying, ‘This girl is no good and that she wants to be sold’.” Maya recounts one interception where the team identified a young woman being taken across the border by a man who had promised her a job that they later verified did not exist. When the interceptors took the pair to the police station to file a case against the trafficker, he became violent and threatened Maya and her family. “Intercepting human traffickers can be a dangerous job”, she says. Sometimes, the victim can prove reluctant to be rescued. This is where Asmita Thapa steps in. As the youngest member of the team she seeks to build a rapport with the women who were usually of similar age. Young women have found it easier to share their experiences with her and often provided valuable information about how the trafficker approached them and the routes taken from their village toward the border. “It can make me sad sometimes,” Thapa says. “The bad environment can be difficult to be around, and fighting and struggling with the girls that do not realise that we are trying to help them can be frustrating. They do not cooperate at first because many of them lack education and they trust the trafficker to be telling them the truth.” When women have been rescued, they were housed in a shelter until their family could collect them. Binsa Mishra, who has been an interceptor at the Birgunj station for the past seven years, explains that reuniting them can be complicated. “The parents of the girls can sometimes get angry when they come to collect their daughters, especially when they left without telling them,” she says. “Sometimes they try to beat them but we help them to understand each other where we can.” If the girls could not return to their families, they were connected with other NGOs who could offer long-term support in residential shelters. While most cases have been difficult, the group has managed to secure several convictions against traffickers. Often its success depends on the group’s relationship with the district-level police, but regularly these commissioners have been rotated out of their posts and valuable relationships were lost.

    "transcript": "Would you buy a shirt that has been through the back end of a cow? This could be a future fabric choice according to one Dutch startup, which is extracting cellulose from cowpats to make “manure couture”. Jalila Essaïdi believes that a non-vegan future will involve recycling cow manure into cellulose fibre, bioplastics, chemical concentrates and pure water – and being less squeamish about it, too. “Like a lasagne of manure, you need to make something out of it,” she says. “We see manure as a waste material, something disgusting and smelly. But oil [used to make fibre] isn’t clean and beautiful at the beginning. You really have to show people the hidden beauty if you transform this cellulose.” It is just one of a range of innovations seeking new materials for old applications, as the world tries to wean itself off dirty habits like plastics and hydrocarbons and embrace new technologies. Biocouture has in fact been around for several years but faces problems of scalability. Essaïdi, who is working with 15 farmers in Eindhoven to create an industrial-scale manure refinery this year, has already won awards for her innovation including $200,000 from the Chivas Venture and an H&amp;M Foundation Global Change award. “The process is chemical and mechanical,” she explains, having run trials to create a fashion show in 2016. “When you collect manure, it’s a combination of urine and cow poop, 80% water. We separate the dry and wet fraction. The wet fraction is fermented and we [extract] solvents to transform the cellulose, which is nothing other than the grass and corn the cows eat. “What makes our process better than the normal textile industry Croft method is that we don’t need high pressure, as the cow stomach is the first step in making the fibre softer. It’s also more energy efficient.” Cow waste is an international environmental issue: in New Zealand, an estimated 60% of waterways are unsafe for swimming due to runoff from dairy farms full of algae-promoting nitrates, phosphates and bacteria. The EU has limits on manure used as fertiliser, to reduce water pollution, but in dairy lands like the Netherlands, there are regular reports of organised “manure fraud”. The Dutch government’s environmental agency estimates 30%-40% of the country’s 76bn annual kilos of manure enters a black market of illegal waste, secretly traded or spread on the land at night to avoid fines for overproduction. Kim Roetert, public affairs spokeswoman for the ZLTO farmers’ association, believes manure is an inevitable side-effect of animal farming but too much is a real problem. “Just seeing it as a waste product shows limited vision, though,” she says. “Manure has a lot of value, not just in making the ground fertile, but also, as Mestic is doing, making textiles, paper and bioplastic ... or bio-energy. There would be no reason for farmers to commit manure fraud if it were no longer a waste product.” H&amp;M Foundation, established by the clothing retailer H&amp;M, reckons we will have to get used to such unusual source materials. “The world is already consuming the equivalent of approximately 1.6 planet’s worth of resources every year, and there is an urgent opportunity to shift to a model where valuable materials are recovered,” says communications manager Malin Björne. “Fashionista or not, we are all going to have to get used to sometimes unconventional materials as we cannot rely on cotton, for example.” H&amp;M won’t comment on whether it would produce clothes with Mestic, but other manufacturers have told Essaïdi that they would consider using the cost-efficient fabric – but would not declare it explicitly on clothing labels. Some academics believe cellulose taken from dung has even more high-tech potential thanks to the quadruple-bellied digestion power of a cow. Prof Alexander Bismarck, head of the polymer group at the University of Vienna, is working on creating ultra-thin nanocellulose, for instance – although he had to start with elephant dung because none of his students would initially work with cowpats. “The beauty with an animal is that it’s collecting low-grade biomass, processing it for you, regurgitating, [then] acid and enzymes attack the cellulose and it comes out in the back in quite fine fibres,” he explains. “You expend much less energy in grinding down this cellulose to nanofibers. If you can make thinner paper for printed circuit boards, so your computer or iPhone is lighter, I don’t think the public will mind if the product came out of the back end of an animal.” The key question with manure couture, though, is whether the fabric smells. When the Dutch television channel RTL Nieuws took Mestic on to the streets, some people – after sniffing it – said they wouldn’t mind putting it on. Some are more sceptical. Jan Willem van der Schans of Wageningen University, a sustainable livestock farming expert, believes even such innovations are not enough. “This will not solve the beef and dairy problem [of] gastric methane emissions,” he says. “It makes a ‘dead end’ technology less bad, so one could argue that it extends the lifetime of a wrong production system.” And what about the farmer? Hans Huijbers, chair of the farmers’ associaiton ZLTO which is working with Mestic, wouldn’t mind wearing it. “If I’ve been busy in my cowshed, then I’m already coated in manure!” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-07-23",
    "transcript": "Cast out, marginalised and even murdered, transgender people in Pakistan used to have to rely on their wits to survive. Now they are running for parliament. The country is conservative and deeply religious and homosexuality is illegal, but it has nonetheless introduced laws that are at the global forefront of trans rights. Pakistan has officially recognised a third gender since 2009. Laws were liberalised still further in March with a wide-ranging piece of legislation that grants intersex people, eunuchs and trans men and women the option to self-identify their gender on official forms. A person born male can now hold a female passport. In contrast, the UK requires a citizen to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have lived for at least two years in their chosen gender. The ruling means a lot to Zara. Kneeling on a mattress that takes up most of the floor of her concrete home, she reaches into a fake alligator-skin purse and pulls out a green identity card, and tears well up. On the card, Zara’s gender is marked as “X”. “I was born with a very small male organ. Inside, my feelings are female,” the 35-year-old said. “I want to live like a woman, cook and do domestic work. “Our appearance is different, so why should we have to have ‘male’ on our identity card?” There are 13 trans candidates to choose from in Wednesday’s election. Nadeem Kashish, a 35-year-old transgender woman running for office in Islamabad, smokes a cigarette on the street below her makeup studio. Banished from home, she entered the “guru” system, in which an elder khwaja sira houses younger trans people in return for a cut of their earnings as dancers or sex workers. She wants that system abolished, saying it is exploitative. “When you see a transgender person, do not give them your notes, give them your votes,” Kashish advised listeners to her weekly radio show. The trans community in Pakistan is divided between a young, international-leaning cohort who believe gender is fluid, and an older group who claim only those born with both female and male genitalia truly qualify. Almas Boby, who launched the country’s trans rights movement by storming a police station in 2004 to call for the arrest of “dirty men”, argued that the law would merely encourage gay men to claim they were transgender in order to claim benefits. “There were 10,000 khwaja siras counted in the census,” she said, referring to the official exercise conducted last year, thought by many to have recorded only a fraction of the community. “After this there will be millions, billions.” One reason for the growing acceptance of the trans community springs from an unlikely source - Pakistan’s mullahs. The Council of Islamic Ideology, a government body that has deemed nine-year-old girls old enough to marry and approves the right of men to “lightly” beat their wives, has offered some support to trans rights. Its chair, Dr Qibla Ayaz, noted a trans person, Heet, appears in the hadith – the sayings, actions and pronouncements of the prophet Muhammad. In practice, Pakistani law forbids discrimination against trans people. It mandates vocational training and enshrines the right to run for political office. Mehlab Jameel , a trans activist in Lahore, said: “Grassroots activists have worked so hard over the years to make this possible.” As a result, Pakistan has among the most progressive, inclusive and culturally sensitive legislation in the world, she added. Trans people have lived for centuries on the margins of society on the subcontinent. Many consider their sexual ambiguities to be God-given, meaning khwaja siras are sought out as intermediaries to the divine and are able to offer curses or blessings. Wedding parties often hire khwaja siras to dance, and indeterminate gender is considered useful in areas where women are forbidden from leaving the house. But trans people are typically cast out by their families, and many of the estimated 500,000 in the country end up as beggars or sex workers. Fifty-eight have been murdered in the past three years Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone. Sceptics of the law note that Pakistan regularly fails to implement positive-sounding legislation. Many of the provisions require the involvement of the four provincial governments, none of which have passed its own version of the law or allocated any funding for trans issues this year. That could mean the trans-specific shelters required by the legislation, for example, exist primarily on paper, said Qasim Iqbal of the trans charity Blue Veins. Zara still hopes the law’s provision of “easy loan schemes” could revive her business selling mobile phones. Her long, auburn hair had become a familiar sight to traders at Aabpara market in Islamabad, but her previous lack of an ID card meant the shop she ran for 13 years was recently seized without notice by the landlord. She needs money to start up again. The overall momentum leads Zara to picture a brighter future. “I want to wear women’s clothes all the time,” she said, her bland male outfit contrasting with pictures on the wall of her in bright, patterned dresses. “I’m hopeful that one day we will live that freely.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "The radical sheriff giving offenders a chance",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/23/gadsden-florida-sheriff-prison-re-entry-program-morris-young",
    "date": "2018-07-23",
    "transcript": "Growing up as black boys in rural Gadsden county, Morris Young and Jaron McNealy would have had the same instinct in their youth when they saw the police: run. “I saw them as a foe. They’d only come by to arrest,” said Young, whose younger self would be surprised to discover he is now a veteran sheriff of the same northern Florida county where he was born and raised. McNealy, 28, took a different path in his teens, getting involved with gangs and a string of arrests and jail time eventually landed him in state prison for four years. But on a recent stormy Florida Saturday, the two sit in McNealy’s mother’s house across from one another on opposing couches with no tension and no drama. The sheriff and his deputy have come by to say hello to McNealy and his three sons, aged 10, eight and seven, as part of Young’s commitment to a new program to prevent children from following their parents into the criminal justice system. The scheme links children with professional counselors and life coaches. Jaron McNealy, 28, with his children at his mother’s home. “We’ve seen a trend where the children start coming up through this same cycle as those incarcerated parents,” Young said. “We wanted to sort of wrap our hands around them and put them on the right track.” The scheme is just part of Young’s community policing approach which includes decarceration and prisoner “re-entry” to lawful society to try to tackle recidivism. “I believe in giving folks two, three, four and five chances to get it right,” he said. Since his first election in 2004, Young has pushed prosecutors to get low-level offenders out of long jail stays, and has encouraged deputies to use arrest power with discretion. “If we pick up a young man with a piece of crack cocaine in his pocket, instead of making an arrest, put it on the ground and just mush it up. Tell him: ‘OK. The next time.’” And while it’s difficult to attribute cause and effect when it comes to social issues like crime, over Young’s tenure crime in Gadsden has roughly halved and juvenile arrests are down by more than 75%. The county is also sending 65% fewer inmates to state prison than it was eight years ago. Young has survived as the longest-serving black sheriff in Florida state history despite his philosophy facing significant challenge. Prosecutors attempted to run Young out of office in 2014 for his liberal use of furloughs, which allow inmates out of custody for short predetermined stints of time, usually a few days. Young believes resistance to his approach comes down to the financial incentives that incarceration creates. As Major Shawn Wood, Young’s loquacious right-hand man, puts it: “No one in this country should even make one penny off people being locked up in chains.” But don’t misunderstand the two, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows either. “We’ve got a reputation for catching our man,” Young said. “Commit a serious crime and you’re going to go in and you’re going to do time.” But all that is qualified by a few progressive mantras that undergird daily decisions at the Gadsden sheriff’s office: arrests don’t necessarily resolve crime, and when arrests must be made, that’s the exact moment where re-entry ought to begin. ‘This is the best I’ve been’ Errick Feaster always loved cars and got pretty good at fixing them with his dad as a kid growing up in Gadsden. Yet having failed to ever get his license, Feaster wound up in jail for 11 months last year for driving without one. It wasn’t the first time. Feaster, 44, had been in and out on drug and other minor charges for much of his adult life. But within a few days of getting to jail some inmates suggested Feaster go speak with Ed Dixon, head of the “crossing over” re-entry program in the jail. The program places inmates at job sites outside the jail during the work day with businesses who train them. No guards. No bars. Rather than sitting in a cell, Feaster was working fixing cars. “It gave me some time away from that building I was in,” said Feaster. Errick Feaster is now a foreman at a tire store after completing the re-entry program. And after he got out, with recommendations from the program, Feaster found work easily. “I went on interviews and for the first time in my life all of them called me back,” said Feaster, who is now working as a foreman at a tire shop in Valdosta, Georgia. “Throughout my whole adult life, this is the best I’ve been. I am not struggling like I was before.” Dixon, a former county commissioner, was recruited by Sheriff Young to head up re-entry because of his deep ties to the community. “Every inmate we surveyed said: ‘Hey, they’ve got great programs in jail and prison, but as soon as I get out, all that support is gone.’ So we said: ‘How can we make it last?’” Dixon said. Dixon’s philosophy is based on an obvious, but often overlooked fact of local incarceration. “They’re going back into Gadsden county and they just went from being inmate Johnson to Mr Johnson.” When they do so without support, recidivism is common. “We’ve had people call us and say, ‘Look I don’t want to go back to jail, but I need you to help me find a job because if I don’t get one, I’m going to go back to what I know,’” said Maj Wood. For Gadsden’s sheriff’s office, finding that person gainful employment is every bit as much their job as arresting them if they do turn back to crime. “I put the entire community on notice that we all are responsible for this,” Young said. ‘Church is it’ Race and economics are prologue to understanding Gadsden. It’s the only majority-black county in Florida, and it’s planted firmly in the bottom 10% of median household income in the state. Fully 25% of residents live in poverty, 56% higher than the national average. Through the 1800s and 1900s the county was well familiar with the violent repression that defined so much of life in the south for blacks. Gadsden was home to at least four lynchings in the late 19th early 20th century, including the killing of AC Williams in 1941. Having survived a white mob’s first attempt on his life, Williams was intercepted en route to the hospital, shot dead and left on a bridge. He had been surrendered to the mob, it’s worth noting, by employees of the sheriff’s office. Segregation and outbursts of racist violence against blacks in Gadsden persisted well into the second half of the century. In the 1960s, voter registration drives by the Congress of Racial Equality (Core) were routinely harassed and assaulted by whites, and even had their Quincy headquarters burned down in 1964. The schools here did not desegregate until 1970, 15 years after the supreme court declared segregation unconstitutional in Brown v Board, and only did so under threat of a federal court order. A less contentious form of racial splintering still weighs heavily on Gadsden’s most ubiquitous social institution: the church. Like in much of the country and nearly all of the south, segregation in these spaces is nearly absolute. A Bible study session at the Gadsden county jail. The county boasts about 250 registered churches, one for every 180 residents, which is a lot even for the heart of the Bible belt. “We don’t have a whole lot of nightclubs and nightlife or those kind of social things to do so church is it,” Young said. As much as possible, Young asks churches to invite the department in, and strongly encourages attendance among his staff of more than 100. At a law enforcement celebration event at First Baptist, Gadsden’s oldest white church, black deputies gladhand and joke with gray-haired parishioners over a breakfast of biscuits, sausage, eggs and gravy. Faith is a major component of Young’s programming, going so far as to perform baptisms of willing inmates behind jail walls. The jail chaplain Jimmie Salters estimates he has performed more than 400 inmate baptisms in a galvanized water tank that sits in a garage on the jail grounds. Religious services are a regular staple in the jail. Sometimes the Gadsden sheriff’s office employee choir comes along to sing. Inmates are encouraged to sing along and even get up and join, standing among their jailers in jumpsuits but unshackled, together in praise. ‘They got a lot of people behind them’ After Jaron McNealy was sent to prison, the mother of his sons and daughter was arrested too. With nowhere left for them to go, they wound up at the home of their grandmother Natalie Johnson. “It was a blessing but it was a lot. I was sitting there having a panic attack thinking about – what are we going to do?” Johnson said. Last year, when the sheriff’s office approached her about putting the boys (his daughter was too young) into a pilot mentoring program for children with incarcerated parents, Johnson admits she was hesitant. “I was afraid it would make them withdraw more,” Johnson said. “But it did the opposite, it completely drew them out,” Johnson said. “It’s been real good, because they were lost.” The children work with a counselor and life coach who tutors them every day on their academics, and on life skills like self-esteem, social interactions and even basic things like personal hygiene. Jaron McNealy with his daughter, six. He has begun reconnecting with his children since leaving prison. Gadsden isn’t reinventing the wheel. Work release programs are a time tested (and historically exploited) tradition in the US criminal justice system. Mentoring for children with incarcerated parents has been a priority for youth advocates for at least a decade, and even enjoyed a healthy federal grant outlay in the early days of the Obama administration. Community policing is a major priority of many departments in the wake of the Black Lives Matter moment at least in word if not in deed. But what Sheriff’s Young’s team does seem to be showing is that an earnest commitment to rewriting the southern tradition of harsh and punitive punishment can have real impacts on how communities perform and how they relate to the police. When McNealy was released from prison in April and started trying to reconnect with the boys, the program had him a bit miffed initially. “At first I’d look at seeing the sheriff around and be like ‘I ain’t talking to them,’ McNealy said. “But now I look at it as beneficial and I’m loving it. If they get in trouble, guess what? They got a lot of people behind them.” One of the boys, who has watched police arrest both of his parents, says for a long time he was scared of them. Now he wants to be one: “So I can tell people how to learn to make good decisions and not do bad things.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-07-22",
    "transcript": "We are fighting the wrong war. People are suffering from mental distress on a scale perhaps never seen before. They wait months for cursory medical intervention, and have to travel hundreds of miles for a rare inpatient bed. In response, all government does is promise something it can’t and won’t deliver, parity of esteem, and then get back to its hysterical obsession with Brexit. Our mental health is fracturing, here and now. It’s a public health emergency – the numbers are off the charts. Yet the political response is absurd, like fiddling endlessly with a leaky tap while the roof is falling in. Would the hopeless response be the same if the pandemic was a physical illness like cancer? This is why we elect MPs – to fix things that are broken, not break something that was fixed. That said, we will definitely lose this struggle if we just see it in terms of beds and billions of pounds. Medics often say prevention is better than cure. This is so obviously true of mental illness that it’s shameful how little we strategise about it. There is no shortage of daily advice for enhancing physical health. Reject bacon!Quit smoking! Take up half-marathons! Eat goji berries and salsify! But where are the programmes, the education, the government advisories and the interventions to help protect our mental health? Every week more than 100 Britons take their own lives. These are preventable deaths but the prevention work has to come early. It has to come at the same stage as the running and goji berries. It has to come before the wheels have fallen off. Because we don’t really know what causes mental illness, it is hard to know what advice to give people. Standard lists recommend a healthy diet, moderate exercise, regular sleep patterns, and a rejection of recreational drugs. All obvious, unremarkable – and ineffectual. I have come up with an alternative list – things I wish I’d done before depression picked me out from the crowd with a flick of a bony finger. 1. Stop trying so hard The mental illness epidemic among our young people can hardly come as a surprise. Grade inflation and hyper-competition have made this the most stressful time to be a teenager. The message from schools, parents, peers seems to be: get top grades or your life is ruined. Little wonder young people are suffering like never before. Teachers and parents won’t like me for saying this, but exam grades BBB and a clean bill of health might be preferable to four A-stars and a prescription for antidepressants. “If the homework brings you down then we’ll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown,” Bowie sang to his infant son. That might be taking it too far but a more balanced approach will help stave off burnout. So stop promising to give 110%. I usually aim for closer to 70%, unless the boss is lurking, when I cunningly step it up. Good enough is good enough. 2. Lower your expectations Someone cleverer than me once came up with a neat formula that explains so much about our self-imposed anxiety. Satisfaction = achievement/expectation. By this infernal calculus, in order to feel better, we must either achieve more (and there quickly comes a point where that becomes harder and harder and more and more stressful) – or simply lower our expectations. We know this to be true: as we attain a higher level of material, professional or athletic accomplishment, we do not rest. Our expectation bobs up, like an overactive ballcock. And so we must outperform again, to advance, to progress. That philosophy, born of the enlightenment and industrial revolution, has become a global religion. And a curse. Our salaries must go up with our self-importance and our status, our companies and economies must grow year-on-year, our cars and kitchens and computers must get better and better, our leaders, our clothes, our holidays must be impeccable. And yes, our sports teams must win all the time. What folly. A life is not a linear chart that goes up. It’s a messy scatter graph of moments and experiences, some joyful, others painful. And it’s so improbable in the first place that we should set our expectations to zero. There – infinite satisfaction. 3. Take up something you’re bad at Perfectionism is a close cousin of mental unease. Shake it off by taking up something that is an end in itself, not just another means to an end. Fail. Laugh when you do so, whether it is pottery, dancing or fishing. It can be a powerful revelation – and a huge release – to understand that you are not perfect and that it does not matter that you are not. Of course, this should be something which will not endanger anyone, including yourself – so best to avoid gambling, go-karting or ice dance. It is preferable if it is not a “winning game”. Drawing, singing, walking, yoga, Warhammer, birdwatching. It’s particularly beneficial if you can induce an adverse remark in the talentless execution of this endeavour, ie “Gosh, you really have a horrid drone for a voice!” Or “What is that squalid little image supposed to be? Can’t make out your brush strokes at all”. Feel the criticism and rejoice in it. You are crap – and it doesn’t matter! 4. Reject the age of the self Depression is an illness that feeds on isolation. Loneliness and self-absorption are its handmaids. Turn your back on 30 years of individualism, by embracing the communal, the social, the voluntary. Another real human face is an antidepressant. So volunteer. Do something for nothing – and see how it makes you feel. Remarkably, when we volunteer we can get a far greater sense of making a difference than we get from paid-for transactional arrangements. It goes without saying that rejecting the self means rejecting the selfie. Stop posting for a month and notice the difference. All the great life experiences are offline.

    "transcript": "The New Zealand company behind a landmark trial of a four-day working week has concluded it an unmitigated success, with 78% of employees feeling they were able to successfully manage their work-life balance, an increase of 24 percentage points. Two-hundred-and-forty staff at Perpetual Guardian, a company which manages trusts, wills and estate planning, trialled a four-day working week over March and April, working four, eight-hour days but getting paid for five. Academics studied the trial before, during and after its implementation, collecting qualitative and quantitative data. Perpetual Guardian founder Andrew Barnes came up with the idea in an attempt to give his employees better work-life balance, and help them focus on the business while in the office on company time, and manage life and home commitments on their extra day off. Jarrod Haar, professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology, found job and life satisfaction increased on all levels across the home and work front, with employees performing better in their jobs and enjoying them more than before the experiment. Work-life balance, which reflected how well respondents felt they could successfully manage their work and non-work roles, increased by 24 percentage points. In November last year just over half (54%) of staff felt they could effectively balance their work and home commitments, while after the trial this number jumped to 78%. Staff stress levels decreased by 7 percentage points across the board as a result of the trial, while stimulation, commitment and a sense of empowerment at work all improved significantly, with overall life satisfaction increasing by 5 percentage points. Helen Delaney, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, said employees’ motivation and commitment to work increased because they were included in the planning of the experiment, and played a key role in designing how the four-day week would be managed so as not to negatively impact productivity. “Employees designed a number of innovations and initiatives to work in a more productive and efficient manner, from automating manual processes to reducing or eliminating non-work-related internet usage,” said Delaney. Andrew Barnes said he would take the results of the trial to the board to open up a discussion on how a four-day work week could be implemented long-term in his company. “If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing?” asked Barnes, who believes the new work model has the potential to profoundly impact society for the better. “Are you likely to get fewer mental health issues when you have more time to take care of yourself and your personal interests? Probably ... if you have fewer people in the office at any one time, can we make smaller offices?” New Zealand’s workplace relations minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, said the results of the trial were “very interesting” and he was keen to encourage businesses to trial new and improved work models. “I’m really keen to work with any businesses that are looking at how they can be more flexible for their staff and how they can look to improve productivity whilst working alongside their staff and protecting terms and conditions,” Less-Galloway said. • This article was amended on 20 July 2018. An earlier version said that there was a 24% increase in the percentage of employees who felt they were able to successfully manage their work-life balance. The increase was from 54% to 78%, which is an increase of 24 percentage points, not 24%. This has been corrected.",

    "transcript": "“You need to start looking for a kidney donor right away. Start with social media and go all out.” The tone and urgency of her doctor’s advice had left Ashley De La Mode somewhat perplexed. With just 5% kidney function remaining, the 38-year old makeup artist and single parent from London knew she needed an organ transplant sooner rather than later. “But it was not until I was added to the transplant waiting list this year that I fully realised what my doctor had really meant,” she said. “As a black person I am facing at least a four-year wait for a new kidney. Very few black people in the UK donate organs after death. And with a rare blood group, I could end up waiting far longer.” De La Mode is one of hundreds of patients from the UK’s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities who are forced to wait longer than the majority of white patients due to a paucity of suitable organs from the same ethnic and racial pool. A new report from NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) reveals that 21% of people who died on the waiting list last year were from a BAME background, compared with 15% a decade ago. The percentage of donors from BAME backgrounds did increase last year, but is still at just 7%. The scarcity is attributable to unfavourable religious and cultural beliefs among BAME communities that discourage organ donation after death. About half as many BAME families support organ donation compared with white families, the NHSBT report found. But for many ethnic minority patients the delay in finding better-matching organs can often mean poor quality of life and even premature death. At 66%, the UK already has one of the lowest organ donation rates in the developed world, comparing poorly with countries like Spain, Croatia and the US. According to the NHSBT, three people die every day waiting for an organ. “Kirit Mistry, co-chair of National BAME Transplant Alliance, says more than 30% of people on kidney waiting lists are from minority communities and that organ donation rates have barely improved since 2008. So is it possible to influence ethnic minorities to change their unfavourable attitudes towards organ donation at all? A new report that I wrote for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust suggests it is. The data and case studies from four other countries - the US, Israel, India and Qatar - show that attempts to counter cultural and religious barriers to organ donation are having some impact. Once known for their deep mistrust of the medical establishment and lowest consent rates, black Americans are now the largest minority organ donor group in the US, ranking above Caucasians, Hispanics and Asians. From eight donors per million in the 1980s African Americans today account for 37 donors per million, mainly due to a sustained and culturally sensitive peer-to-peer education approach. “Deep fear of racism, distrust of doctors and adverse religious beliefs are common to black communities not just in the US but in Britain and other European countries too,” says Dr Clive Callender, a Howard University transplant surgeon and founder of Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program. “Addressing them required working closely with the people, especially youth, and trusting them to come up with their own community engagement approaches. We also focused on behaviour change and healthier lifestyles rather than only creating awareness about organ donation.” Faith-based public education campaigns and donor recognition initiatives have played a vital role in improving organ donation rates in India and Qatar. With multi-ethnic foreign workers making 88% of its population and a growing problem of transplant tourism Qatar did not even have a national organ donation program up until 2010. “Today we’ve not only curbed transplant tourism by 70%, but quite unexpectedly we also have more living kidney donors, especially Arabs, than deceased donors in the country as a result of our targeted culturally-sensitive public awareness programs,” says Dr Riadh Fadhil, director of Qatar Organ Donation Centre. The most radical example of transformation in religious and cultural views towards organ donation, however, comes from Israel. At 44% the country had one of the lowest consent rates in the developed world, with Israelis accounting for the highest number of transplant tourists globally and often seeking organs from executed prisoners in China. “The free-riding behaviour, where you take organs but never give and is found in almost every society, stemmed from orthodox Jewish views on organ donation. Religious views not only didn’t recognise brain death as death they also branded doctors like me as murderers. I couldn’t take the hypocrisy,” says Dr Jacob Lavee, a prominent cardiothoracic surgeon and the pioneer of the reciprocity model of organ donation. Reciprocity systems give some degree of priority to registered donors who require an organ transplant. Israel passed new laws in 2008 to curb transplant tourism and introduce a point-based priority system that allowed registered donors and their families to receive priority over non-donors in transplants. Since implementing the laws in 2012 Israel has seen a sharp rise in organ donation rates with an unexpected surge in altruistic living kidney donations. “Our model is proof that it’s possible to change negative attitudes while also making the system fairer for everyone in the society,” he adds.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/13/canada-shopping-cart-design-homelessness",
    "date": "2018-07-13",
    "transcript": "It’s a challenge often overshadowed by the more pressing concerns of homelessness: where to store your belongings. But since 2016, a group in western Canada has been designing a prototype vehicle aimed at offering those who live on the streets a better alternative to shopping carts when it comes to transporting their worldly goods. “Part of the reality of being homeless is that you need somewhere to put your goods,” said Devon Siebenga of Metro Community, the church in Kelowna behind the initiative. “A lot of our people spend most of their days worrying about, or trying to take care of, or tracking down their stuff.” For many, shopping carts have become a tool to meet this need – but one that is far from ideal. “The problem is that the shopping cart is obviously not their own property and so there’s a huge amount of anxiety that floats over them as they go through their days,” said Siebenga. The shopping carts can be seized by police at any point, forcing some to decide between paying hefty fines to retrieve their belongings or simply forsaking them. “It’s this constant wonder, am I going to be walking down the street with all my stuff and all of a sudden it gets taken?” So around two years ago, the church began asking if there might be a better option. Their quest took them to the Kelowna campus of the University of British Columbia, where engineering staff and students eagerly signed on to the challenge. Representatives from the city and police soon also joined in. Input on the design came from those with experience of living on the streets; they wanted something they could own and use legally, that would protect their belongings come rain or shine and which could travel long distances easily. The cart also had to be light enough to manoeuvre through city streets. “It doesn’t need to be able to go 4x4ing, but it should be able to go through snow, go over curves and gravel and some mushy terrain,” said Siebenga. The first prototype was delivered in May. Made of plywood and specially designed composites, the cart is equipped with handbrakes, shelving and locks, meaning users can park the carts without worry when they head inside for appointments or a meal. The design has already been through several iterations and will likely go through many more, said engineer Bryn Crawford. “Even this first model is significantly different and a bit heavier than the next few we’ve got on the go.” Four more prototypes are expected to be delivered in the coming weeks. Each will be handed over to those living on the streets with the goal of collecting feedback to refine the cart into a product that could potentially one day be commercialised. “This isn’t simply a Kelowna problem,” said Siebenga. “In some ways it’s a global opportunity.” He was careful to stress the limits of the initiative. “It’s not going to replace housing or keep people off the streets.” Instead the hope is that the carts will allow people to fret less over the security of their belongings, giving them space to focus on recovery, safety and housing, he said. “This provides a dignified alternative while they seek to get their lives back on track.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/why-are-we-afraid-to-say-vagina-myanmar-learns-to-talk-about-sex",
    "date": "2018-07-12",
    "transcript": "“There’s a hpou (a child’s toy), tayat ywa (mango leaf) and mout paung (sweets).” Pausing in her list of euphemisms, Dr Thet Su Htwe leans in to the microphone. “And even samosa,” she adds. At this, the rapt audience of young women gathered at her workshop shrieks and bursts into chatter. “Why are we still afraid to say the word ‘vagina’?” the doctor asks finally. Talking about vaginas – not to mention sex education – is taboo in Myanmar. But it became the focus of discussion two months ago when The Vagina Monologues – a play of 18 stories about women’s experiences and their vaginas, exploring issues of menstruation, gender roles, relationships and gender-based violence – was performed for the first time in Yangon. Su Htwe usually keeps a low profile, but for one weekend, as she was invited to speak at the performances, her sexuality and reproductive health classes came to the fore. She warned that if people cannot even bring themselves to talk about vaginas then women’s rights will not improve. In Myanmar, sexual and reproductive education technically exists on the curriculum in state schools – but a combination of teacher ignorance and embarrassment means that little is actually taught. “Parents and teachers think that if you teach sexual education you will encourage kids to become sexually active, so there is a big education gap,” Su Htwe says. She founded her organisation, Strong Flowers, which provides reproductive and sexual health education services and resources, in 2016. Su Htwe teaches in schools and community centres, and across religions. “At first I was worried that people might say ‘this Muslim lady is talking about sex’; no I’m not talking about sex, I am teaching about sexuality, our bodies, consent … I was worried people would be confused and think I am doing something that is not good for the society, or for religions.” Women’s rights are also slow to progress in Myanmar. Despite five years of debate, a law that criminalises violence against women still has not been submitted to parliament. Participants attend Su Htwe’s classes for a variety of reasons. Aye Aye Tint, 33, was interested to learn more about health: “I learned more than just the dos and don’ts about my health, like if a husband has a sore on his private part, he should openly tell his wife to prevent the disease.” “I also learned about how couples should behave, not just personal hygiene,” she said. After the workshop she said she shared the training with her single and married friends, “they told me they should have attended the training too, because they need it and don’t even know things like the different parts of the uterus”. Twenty-four-year-old La Min Ko from Myeik, in southern Myanmar, who attended one of the classes led by Su Htwe, said: “Before the training, to be honest, I didn’t think the subjects were so important for us. But I learned so much about gender equality, human rights, emotional intelligence and sexuality.” Su Htwe learned that it was different for girls at a young age. After puberty, her mother forbade her from running out in the streets with her friends. “I was told I can’t wash my hair or eat spicy food like lapet tho (tealeaf salad), or else it would cease my menstruation,” she said. “When boys and girls enter puberty, the space is narrower for girls and wider for boys. Boys are told they have to get ready to lead the family and study hard, and for girls going outside is dangerous, we are told anything could happen to you at any time – violence, rape or sexual harassment on the streets.” After finishing school she became a doctor and volunteered at the Muslim free hospital. Again she realised the relationship between cultural gender expectations and treatment of women. When she was preparing to get married, another tipping point occurred. She was passionate about working as a medical doctor and did not want to give up her profession, despite the cultural expectation in Myanmar that a woman should give up her job and dedicate herself to family life. After raising the topic with her husband, she was surprised to hear that he was supportive of her choice. This confirmed her belief that it was her responsibility to educate people about women’s rights, challenging cultural expectations, and she believed the best way she could do this was through education. Su Htwe’s first class was not in any of the big cities, but rather in a small village outside Yangon. She divided the group into two classes, one for women and one for men, for anyone aged 16 and upwards. “At first I wasn’t sure whether to call it just reproductive health, as to use the word sexuality might scare people or make them reluctant to come.” After a friend told her to believe in herself and be bold, she explained all aspects of her class to the local community leaders, and they welcomed it. Her first supporter was an older male farmer harvesting chillies at the time of the class. “He said he could only give two days for the class, but because he thought it was important to talk about our bodies he would encourage his wife and daughter to come to the classes too.” To illustrate how poor knowledge is, she reveals how many women have been using the emergency contraceptive pill for regular use. “I kept on being asked about where they can buy the three-day pill, but I said I didn’t know what they meant, then they described that you can take one pill and have sex for three days without getting pregnant,” she said. Su Htwe believes education is the first step to building respect for each other’s bodies, learning about the similarities and differences, leading to respect for women’s rights: “We need to educate women, what are your rights? And raise awareness, not only among women but nationwide, and among men.” She hopes training for teachers in teaching life skills, sexual health and respectful relationships, will improve. “We can’t do this with just one talk, we also all need to work together.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "The surprising sounds of a late evening in Mogadishu: surf on the beach, laughs of revellers, clinking of cups and glasses, oaths of harassed waiters and the soft melodies of the oud of Aweys Kabanle. Kabanle, a 45-year-old former dressmaker turned musician, is playing traditional Somali music at the luxury Mogadishu Beach View hotel at the city’s Lido to a smartly dressed audience in one of the world’s most dangerous cities. “This is Mogadishu. We laugh and sing. We play music. Music is for peace so we no longer live in fear,” Kabanle says, sipping a cappuccino. There are few cities with contrasts as stark as those of Mogadishu. Swollen by hundreds of thousands of people displaced by famine, drought and conflict in rural areas, its outlying districts resemble a vast refugee camp. Authorities are incompetent, corrupt or simply absent. It is seven years since the Islamic militants of al-Shabaab withdrew but many streets bear the scars of more than two decades of incessant warfare. Mogadishu’s inhabitants have long been known for their resilience, but a new wave of activists, entrepreneurs and artists are now trying to improve their city. Two years ago, Kabanle survived an al-Shabaab gun attack and suicide car bombing close to where he now performs every evening. The attack left at least 10 dead, including three of Aweys’s friends. The oud player was forced to jump over the wall of the hotel where he was playing to escape. “For several months following, there was no show,” he says. “People were unwilling to come back but I was committed to come here again. I started the first night by myself alone playing music and resumed hosting the show. Thanks be to God, people got confidence and now they are coming back for my show.” Despite the ongoing violence in the Somali capital, the economy is growing, hundreds of expatriates are returning from the west or African nations, scores of colleges are opening to cater for the young population and there is growing investment from the diaspora. Estate agents thrive: a two-storey house can cost nearly £100,000. Mogadishu has hosted a TEDx conference. Ahmed Hassan Sheikh decided to return to Mogadishu from Kenya a year and a half ago. He started his own arts company inside the fortified Mogadishu airport complex, where thousands of diplomats, United Nations staff and regional troops from the African Union stabilisation force are based. There is no shortage of demand for Sheikh’s paintings. “I do not need to fight with a gun. I have a powerful pen with which I draw my feelings. I believe through it I can bring change. I can make Mogadishu peaceful,” the 48-year-old artist says. His paintings call for young people to take up pens and books instead of arms, to warn against illegal migration and its devastating effects on Somali families. Other drawings recall life in old Mogadishu before the civil war, a time when the city was known as the most beautiful city in Africa. “When people see my artworks of former Mogadishu and how it used to be like, they appreciate how peaceful and prosperous Mogadishu was,” Ahmed says. Then there is Ubaxa Caasimadda (Flowers of the City), a group of students who, 18 months ago, set out to smarten scruffy city streets and mark roads to increase public safety. They started with the safest roads such as those near the presidential palace, because some had already received death threats from al-Shabaab. “When we started, we did not even know what will come out. It was just, go and do and then see. We knew the dangers we were facing but we took that risk,” says Amira Mahad Abdulle, a 24-year-old university student. Abdulle wears a burqa to conceal her identity and does not respond to phone calls from unknown people for her safety. “There are a lot of threats coming in but I try to stay safe. I do not fear. I want to serve Mogadishu,” she says. The group decided to act “because nobody else was willing to do it” and the government in Mogadishu is focused on fighting al-Shabaab. “We could not sit behind and wait for someone else to do this for the people of Mogadishu. We are the youth of this country and we decided to stand up for it,” Abdulle says. So far the group has painted dozens of zebra crossings and have planted flowers on pavements. “We are committed. We were born in Mogadishu and we want to help our city become developed, beautiful and safe like other cities in the world,” Isse Hassan Ibrahim, a 23-year-old typographic graduate, says. Though his best friend, a government employee, was assassinated by al-Shabaab last year, Ibrahim never stopped working as a volunteer in Mogadishu. “When my friend was killed, I got scared but I decided not to quit. I want to help my people and my capital city,” Ibrahim says. “We now have new youth groups joining us from other cities.” In the last 18 months, US and Somali forces have intensified the battle against al-Shabab, though without achieving decisive success. Last week US officials said a new airstrike killed 14 militants. Though the increased military activity has weakened the extremists, it also led to more civilian casualties. Kabanle believes his country will soon be at peace. “Somalia is no longer a war zone. It is a love zone,” he says, pointing to a group of young men and women sitting on the warm white sand of Mogadishu’s beach.

    "date": "2018-07-09",
    "transcript": "At 73, Dr Rajagopalan Vasudevan is roughly as old as the mass production of plastic. But that is not the reason why the chemistry professor has a soft spot for the much-maligned material. “Plastic isn’t the problem,” the venerable scientist says in his office in the southern Indian city of Madurai. “We are. Plastic wouldn’t clog our oceans or our landfills if we didn’t throw it there in the first place. And there is so much we can do with it instead.” He should know. In January this year, Dr Vasudevan was honoured with one of India’s highest civilian awards, the Padma Shri, for his groundbreaking research on re-using waste plastic – in a very unusual way. The idea emerged from his workshop at the Thiagarajar College of Engineering in Madurai as far back as 2001. Disturbed by calls to ban plastic, which he believed was important to poor people, he wanted to find a solution to the growing environmental challenges it raised. “Ban plastic and it can severely affect the quality of life for a low-income family,” he says. “But if you burn it or bury it, it’s bound to affect the environment.” And so, he began a series of experiments in his workshop to discover effective disposal techniques. In a molten condition, he found that plastic had the property of an excellent binder. Acting on the principle that like attracts like, Dr Vasudevan looked at another chemical of similar nature: bitumen, a black tarry substance that was being combined with gravel to lay roads. “Bitumen, a highly heterogeneous mixture of hydrocarbons is in effect, composed of polymerssimilar to plastic,” he says. When molten plastic was added to stone and bitumen mix, Dr Vasudevan found that, true to its nature, plastic stuck fast and bound both materials together. The bitumen-modified plastic improved the tensile strength of the road by making it more durable and flexible. Plastic also prevented pothole formation. When the layer of molten plastic filled the space between the gravel and bitumen it thwarted rain water from seeping in and causing structural defects. When late Dr Abdul Kalam, India’s former president and scientist visited Thiagarajar College, he encouraged Dr Vasudevan to lay the first plastic paved road within the campus. “He asked me to make the roads grey, since black roads absorb and trap heat,” says Dr Vasudevan. In 2002, he paved a 60-ft road within the campus with plastic-modified bitumen. The road is still intact today. He received a patent for the process in 2006. Since then, almost 10,000km of Indian roads have been paved using his technique. At Dr Vasudevan’s workshop, shredded plastic in big bins shines like bright confetti . These are the remains of the plastic material that we use (and throw away) in our everyday lives. Plastic from water bottles, notebook liners, single-use bags with a thickness of less than 50 microns; all kinds of plastic waste is fed into his shredder and reduced to strips. An assistant demonstrates – on a much smaller scale – how the plastic road-laying process works. Asphalt is heated to a temperature of 170C (338F). Shredded plastic below 70 microns (including the multi-layer plastic shreds) is then sprinkled over it. The bits of plastic seemingly disappear, melting into the red heat. Heated bitumen is added next. The molten plastic then moulds with the bitumen and stone and results in a shiny tar surface. “When using plastic as a binder, we’re reducing the quantity of bitumen that is normally utilized for road laying by 6-8%,” says Dr Vasudevan. A regular road requires 10 tonnes of bitumen for each kilometre. A plastic road however, requires only nine tonnes of bitumen and one tonne of waste plastic for coating. So, for every km, the plastic roads save as much as one tonne of bitumen. “Our planet is drowning in snack-food packaging that is non-recyclable,” says Almitra Patel, a member of India’s supreme court committee for solid waste management. “If (this technology is) seriously adopted in all cities for all multi-film laminates, it has the potential to achieve near-zero landfill, leaving almost nothing for final disposal.” The real challenge lies, she says, in collecting all of the voluminous post-consumer packaging. To environmentalists who believe that the technology could be harmful because of toxic fumes from plastic residue, Dr Vasudevan points out that the plastic used is softened at 170C. “Plastic decomposes to release toxic fumes only if it is heated at temperatures above 270C (518F). So there is no question of toxic gases being released,” he says. Since plastic coats the stone and interacts with the hot bitumen, it’s properties change and it doesn’t break down when exposed to light and heat. Dr Noreen Thomas, a polymer science expert at Loughborough University, said the process appeared to be an imaginative solution, but cautioned that plastic waste is often a complex mix of materials not all of which would work well with Dr Vasudevan’s operations. Some might burn up in the heat, and others, she said, might prove unsatisfactorily soft as a road surface. “There is always a risk when heating or burning mixed plastic waste in an open environment when the composition of the plastic waste is unknown,” she said. “It is important to find more applications for mixed plastic waste but even more important to ensure that more environmental pollution is not created in doing so.” Nonetheless, at least 16,000km of road have subsequently been paved in the state of Tamil Nadu. The national government has since approved the idea and sanctioned at least 13,000km across the country to be paved in the material as well. Of this, 8,600km have already been completed, says Dr IK Pateriya of the rural development ministry in Delhi. Using the same process to merge waste plastic and stone with materials like limestone, ceramic waste and granite, Dr Vasudevan has created another eco-friendly building material that consumes up to 40% more waste plastic than that used in the road laying process. He calls this material “plastone” and says that it is lasting, durable and cheap. Each plastone block consumes nearly 300 plastic bags and between four and six plastic bottles. A stone tile measuring one square metre has a manufacturing cost of Rs 100, approximately £1.. 60 plates would be sufficient to construct an eco-friendly bathroom, says Dr Vasudevan.The material could also be used to pave sidewalks, replacing cement, he says. Today, self-help groups from various states across India, local citizens and schools are engaged in helping Dr Vasdevan collect waste plastic. “It’s time we stop seeing plastic as the enemy and turn it into our biggest resource,” says Dr Vasudevan.

    "transcript": "We’re unlikely to find fixes to our global problems if we’re battling against our planet’s natural resources rather than making use of them. This week, some tales of harnessing the power of nature as we tackle man-made crises: climate change and our insatiable need for energy. Move aside, the sun – could the moon be the solution to our clean energy crisis? The power of our ocean tides, the only renewable source derived from the moon, might be able to provide huge amounts of clean, renewable electricity. Damian Carrington reports from France on the extraordinary inventions that could help to harness it. In the meantime, the sun’s not doing a bad job: a heatwave in the UK helped break solar power-generation records, with solar briefly eclipsing gas power stations as the top source of electricity. Rising temperatures and dry spells in the US midwest are wreaking havoc with crop yields, as new pests and diseases emerge due to hot and arid conditions. But now an ancient Syrian grass that survived a civil war might provide salvation for stricken American farmers, as Mark Schapiro explains. Elsewhere this week, we are celebrating the 70th birthday of the UK’s National Health Service, the world’s largest government-funded healthcare system. Haroon Siddique brings us five fascinating innovations from health services around the world that could help the NHS to break new ground over the next 70 years. And in Gaza City, Oliver Holmes and Hazem Balousha report on the strip’s first ever coding academy, where 16 students (half male, half female), surrounded by boundaries, are breaking free online. What we liked This New Yorker examination of universal basic income and this Wired tale of the French boat that’s circling the planet powered by renewables. What we heard All these tidal sources are important and may contribute, but the main and cheapest contribution comes from efficient use. In other words: it is not sustainable to fly to remote destinations to board a ship that is supposedly cruising to important places that we must see. It is not sustainable to board a jet plane to watch a football match. And it is not sustainable to fly in food from faraway places out of season by airplane just for the kick of strawberries in winter or lamb from down under. Commenter, continental cyclist, writing below the line of our piece on tidal power. Where was the upside? In living rooms up and down Britain, where Christian Sinabaldi, Erica Buist and Deborah Linton captured the agony, ecstasy and weird snacks that friends and families from countries competing at the World Cup shared as they watched their heroes on TV.

    "transcript": "It’s a scene straight from a Silicon Valley startup. Hot-desking twentysomethings type code into laptops covered with stickers. Retro Pac-Man graffiti and motivational slogans like “DO EPIC THINGS” adorn the walls. Bookshelves are filled with the tech classics: The Facebook Effect and The Founder’s Dilemmas. Wifi routers hang overhead, as do Edison bulbs, emitting more style than actual light. But this is not the San Francisco Bay Area. No electric cars quietly whirr by. Instead, this is Gaza, with its cracked streets and checkpoints manned by militants. On the perimeter of this impoverished coastal enclave are Israel and Egypt, countries that have blockaded this tiny slice of land for years. Tight restrictions on the movement of goods and, vitally, people, have been the death of much industry here. But Gaza’s first coding academy hopes its hi-tech business model — which operates in the virtual rather than real world — will be somewhat immune to physical barriers to trade. “That’s the reason we started this. It ignores boundaries,” says 31-year-old Ghada Ibrahim, who was in the first class of coders, which started a year ago. “The blockade is a huge factor. It’s a reason why we have a lot of people who have come to sign up.” With funding from international charities such as Mercy Corps and significant tech world players such as Google, the academy provides two basic requirements its students need for a freelance career developing websites and apps: internet and electricity. In Gaza, that means paying for a generator to supply 10 hours of laptop juice a day. “We do something that no one can cut off,” Ibrahim says, then stops herself mid-sentence and pauses for a few seconds. She adds, smiling: “Although maybe they can.” Israel provides Gaza’s internet, and as yet has never cut it off. Sixteen students (half female as a rule) enrolled in the first class, which had international support from Founders &amp; Coders, a UK-based nonprofit providing free coding lessons. Ibrahim recalls a slightly haphazard programme: eight hours a day where students were expected to self-learn coding and present a weekly project. Of the original 16, only nine graduated. “We had a lot of problems,” she says. “It was supposed to be one month. It went on for six months.” She says the students, several of whom had degrees in information technology, struggled to adapt to self-taught techniques following a lifetime of parrot-fashion schooling: they continually looked to the teacher when stuck. “We all grew up to be taught by someone. It’s never self-learning,” she says. To combat this, the class implemented what Ibrahim calls the 20/20/20 rule. When encountering an issue, students spend 20 minutes trying to figure it out online, then 20 minutes with the help of another classmate. The final 20 minutes are with the help of a mentor. It works. The class after Ibrahim’s had 12 graduates, and the one after that had 14. The fourth cohort is currently ongoing with all 16, she says, looking into the classroom, “but it’s only the third week.” And while the first classes had support from professional coders, all the mentors are now former students. It’s self-perpetuating. Moamin Salamah Abu Ewaida, 34, is the engagement and development manager at tech hub and co-working space Gaza Sky Geeks, which launched the coding academy last year. What is essential, he says, is that freelance business skills are also taught at the academy. Each student is trained how to pitch to international clients and use job-finding websites such as Upwork, a global freelancing platform. For real-world practice during the course, local businesses and charities are offered pro bono web development work. And, crucially, Gaza Sky Geeks helps its graduates get paid, in a place that many financial institutions avoid for fears of money laundering, not to mention the fact that its de facto government has been on a US “foreign terrorist” blacklist since 1997. Gaza Sky Geeks has partnered with banks and online payment systems that can verify its credentials. Graduates have already started developing websites for international clients in Europe. “Our end goal is to use tech as a gateway. This area [Gaza], it could be the next Berlin or Dublin,” says Abu Ewaida. He warns against dismissing that dream, and says the conditions are there for a thriving freelance coding community to develop: “We have the talent. And the price for us is a little bit less than others. We can deliver.” And, regardless, “This place can give more than opportunity,” he says. “It can give hope. It’s emotional more than professional.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "Using giant kites, blades and paddles, and mimicking pogo sticks, blowholes and even the human heart, groups around the world are on the cusp of harnessing the colossal power of the oceans. The challenge is huge - seas have been battering coasts and sweeping sailors to their doom for millennia - but so is the prize: huge amounts of clean, reliable and renewable electricity for an energy-hungry world. Taking on the challenge of operating in this savage, corrosive environment is not for the faint-hearted, and the costs remain worryingly high, as demonstrated by the government’s rejection on Monday of a £1.3bn tidal project at Swansea. “There is no doubt – shit happens during marine renewable energy projects,” says François Renelier at Bessé, a French insurance broker. But the ocean energy sector is frothing with ideas, with hundreds of companies developing an extraordinary array of devices and backed by billions of dollars of investment. Among the serious contenders tapping rapid tidal flows are 12 metre-wide underwater kites that soar and swoop. “We fly with the tides,” says Martin Eklund, at Minesto, which is installing a £25m array off Anglesey, north Wales. “The main advantage is we can harvest energy from very low currents. This resource is abundant – it is everywhere.” Tapping that resource is vital, say ocean energy supporters. Global temperatures continue to rise and the world’s nations need to increase clean energy production fast. Although wind and solar power increased 75% between 2013 and 2016, they still only provided 10% of the world’s electricity and even less of total energy demand. “We will need every kind of renewables we can get out hands on, including marine, to move us around, heat our homes and so on,” says Declan Meally, at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. A coalition of 25 ocean-faring nations, called Ocean Energy Systems, estimates a global potential for wave and tidal energy of 750GW by 2050, almost twice today’s global nuclear capacity. The EU projects 100GW in 2050, providing about 10% of the bloc’s electricity. Many nations, from Ireland to India to Korea, are now making moves and tidal and wave energy capacity doubled in 2017, albeit from a very small base. China has invested $200m since 2010 in ocean energy, and the EU €3bn in combined public and private money in the last decade. Tidal energy is most advanced. Bladed turbines are being deployed, which harness fast tidal flows in the same way wind turbines catch the wind. The world’s first large-scale tidal array, the Meygen project built by Atlantis Resources in the Pentland Firth, is now sending power to the grid. But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too. OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish. Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector. “The cost of building something to withstand these extremes is the only thing that has held it back so far,” says Tom Denniss of Wave Swell in Australia. His company’s device works like a blowhole, with waves blasting air up a tube and out through a turbine. He compares developing wave technology to his own record-breaking feat of endurance running: “I ran 622 marathons in 622 days and it was a lot easier than developing marine energy technology - at least it took less time.” Other wave devices, such as Wedge Global, use buoys that bounce up and down on a pole, like a pogo stick, then duck underwater when storms rolls in. Another, Corpower, uses a hydraulic system inspired by the human heart to dampen the impact of the worst weather. “That has been the big challenge for wave energy – how to turn it on and off in big storms,” says chief executive, Patrik Möller. A strange-shaped vessel called the Penguin takes a very different approach, gyrating with waves to capture power in a spinning weight. It has proved particularly robust, says Ali Pekcan, at Wello, its Finnish makers: “It has survived many storms. It is a great achievement to keep a device in [the sea] for over a year without maintenance.” Paddles are being deployed too, such as WaveRoller, which uses long seafloor flaps that are washed back and forth by swells. Another, Wave Piston, uses paddles strung along a 185m pipe to push pressurised water through a generator. The Wave Piston’s biggest challenge to date was a big industrial trawler ramming into the system, despite the deployment having been cleared with the marine authorities. “We have had a lot of adventures, some good, some bad,” says Martin von Bülow, at the company. One technology that is not being widely pursued is tidal lagoon power. Here, large, expensive walls are constructed to trap seawater at high tide, which is released through turbines at low tide. But those constructed so far, such as in France and Korea, took advantage of sea walls being built for other purposes such providing a transport link. Which technologies make it into mass production remains to be seen, but the sector is backed at the highest levels, from Europe to China to Canada. “Clean renewable energy from the sea ticks all the right boxes,” says Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. “It is a groundbreaking industry with plenty of potential for new jobs and economic value, and in a world facing the devastating spectre of climate change, it also helps us supply homegrown energy while drastically cutting our greenhouse gas emissions,” he said at the International Conference on Ocean Energy in Cherbourg, France, last week. The way Denmark captured the wind turbine manufacturing market by moving early is inspiring many of the leading nations. “Everyone is trying to be the next Denmark, but for another technology,” says Bruce Cameron, the former director of renewable energy in Nova Scotia, which hosts the bay with the biggest tidal range in the world. However a major obstacle to ocean energy commercialisation has loomed into view: the stunning drop in cost of offshore wind power in the last year, as huge farms are rolled out. “While offshore wind in Europe has clearly come of age, ocean energy is still learning how to take the first steps,” says EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella. This has led some governments, such as the UK, directing their subsidy support to marine windfarms. This has left wave and tidal energy developers stranded between successful testing and the full-scale production that would then start driving costs down. “They call it the valley of death - we’re there,” says Marcelle Askew, at Swedish wave energy firm Seabased. However, some nations are still offering support: Canada has a feed-in-tariff and France, despite concerns at the finance ministry over costs, is expected to offer a major tender within months. Ocean energy supporters say it is essential in addition to offshore wind to drive progress towards a zero-carbon world. Tidal energy in particular has the advantage of being precisely predictable, years ahead. “As long as the moon circles around the Earth, you will always have tidal energy. But you can have no wind for days and days,” says Laurent Schneider-Maunoury, CEO of Naval Energies, the makers of OpenHydro. His company is also exploring another ocean energy technology which provides power 24/7, by exploiting the temperature difference between surface and deep waters to generate electricity. Like other ocean energy technologies, this may well already be competitive with the expensive diesel generators used in many small or isolated communities. The seasonal timing of the biggest waves can be good too, says Arnie Roblan, a senator from Oregon in the US, which is strongly backing ocean energy. “The winter storms bring a lot more power than in the summer, which exactly matches [heating] energy use,” he says. Cost is not the only challenge to be overcome, such as ensuring coastal communities themselves benefit from projects and ensuring marine life is not endangered, though dolphins, seals and fish all appear to avoid the devices deployed so far. The big question remains undecided: will ocean energy will provide a major new wave of renewables in the years to come? Some have doubts, like Prof AbuBakr Bahaj, at Southampton University in the UK, and who has analysed the sector for 25 years. “I’m not really sure,” he says. Others, like Drew Blaxland, from developers Atlantis, says with many technologies now proven to work, it is simply time to scale up production and drive down the costs. His message is blunt: “Wake the hell up, grab it by the nuts and get on with it.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "When Christian Sinibaldi turned up at homes across England to photograph fans watching the World Cup, he was overwhelmed by every nationality’s hospitality. “And their food,” he says. “I’ve eaten a lot of crisps and beer, but also the traditional Brazilian dish of feijoada in north London, Mexican quesadillas and guacamole in Putney, and a lovely Moroccan tagine cooked on the barbecue in Letchworth.” Sinibaldi sat with a fixed camera near the television screen and never asked anyone to pose: he didn’t need to. “Pretty much as soon as the match got under way, they forgot I was there.” He enjoyed watching the tension build. “Very few people left the room or changed positions throughout the game. They were glued to their chairs.” It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. “But I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming – I could see it in their faces.” There’s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it’s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn’t make the cut. England 6 Panama 1 Cooper family, Milnrow, Rochdale, 24 June Timing is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper’s house, where the family are on countdown for England’s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of “Half an hour to kick-off” drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George’s flags. The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers – grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five – know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England. Stones’ header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. “I missed it!” says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five – including two Harry Kane penalties – all before half-time. “This is unbelievable!” Rick shouts. “Football’s coming home.” The noise from the boys’ vuvuzelas is deafening. “The boys were too little for Brazil 2014,” says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, “so I’m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I’m mad for it now.” His brother Malc says, “You always have that hope with England, and it’s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona’s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we’re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there’s a different mentality.” Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, “The country couldn’t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: ‘If they play football, they’ll murder ’em.’ He’d have been thrilled with this one.” Brazil 1 Switzerland 1 Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 June Cristina “Kiki” Machado’s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki’s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. “We drew six,” says Kiki (in hat), “because Brazil has won five times – we drew one more for luck.” Kiki’s living room is packed out with her “north London family”, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend’s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children. “My family in Brazil said people aren’t celebrating there the way we are,” Kiki says. “It’s natural when you’re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.” She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, “Of course. Your teacher will understand.” After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. “I’m in defence mode,” says Janaína Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). “That game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.” The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don’t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that’s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. “When we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,” Kiki says. “The hangover lasted a week.” Senegal 2 Japan 2 Adama Kande and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 June The music and the chat don’t stop at Adama Kande’s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums. Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. “Senegal is like Brazil,” he says. “Everyone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too – I’m a good player.” An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Mané sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: “It’s game on. Game on.” But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates. “I wanted more,” Adama admits at full time. “They got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.” For him, the World Cup couldn’t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour’s TV. “When Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.” Neilum agrees: “They love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they’re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric – it’s just fire.” Morocco 0 Iran 1 Essakhi family, Letchworth, 15 June Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He’s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, “because when there’s a football match on, we want to watch it”. Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school; Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed’s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right). The 1-0 loss to Iran is “a bit of a let-down”, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: “Footballers in England are so famous – it’s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.” “I would love Morocco to win,” Mohammed says, “but realistically, it’s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We’ve been asking for about 20 years.” His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: “I was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.” Azza, who recently graduated, is working in Morrisons, and is delighted to wear her Morocco shirt to work when the team play Portugal a few days later. “It was to raise money for Clic Sargent [a cancer charity for young people]; we pay a pound to wear the team shirt. It was a real conversation starter. That’s what I love about the World Cup: the unity. No matter what happens or what team you support, there’s a conversation you can have with anybody.” Japan 2 Colombia 1 Nishi family, Acton, London, 19 June Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly. Today the Nishis – Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) – are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he’s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa’s penalty, secured in the game’s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos Sánchez: “It was kind of scary before he took it – we were very surprised that we won.” His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. “To be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn’t get a good result.” Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages. For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. “Japan didn’t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.” The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a “very strong” Belgium. Iran 0 Spain 1 Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 June If only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: “Vahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team’s hope).” Sadly, his golden foot doesn’t save the day: Iran’s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0. It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. “We often get together for food and gossip and chat,” says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, “so you can eat with your eyes first”. Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. “That is what we do when ladies get together,” she says. “The group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.” “I think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,” says Shirin, “but not attack. Even if they try to score, there’s nobody there; they keep themselves to their own goal.” Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, “because they don’t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.” Pupak agrees: “It was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times – even though they lost, I think they did quite well.” Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. “My youngest said, ‘But Mummy, I’m English.’ Even though I’ve spent most of my life here, I don’t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.” Serbia 1 Costa Rica 0 Bogdanovic family, London, 17 June On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: “We sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,” says Deanna, 47 (on left). “We try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.” Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion. Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago; soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. “Often you question where home really is,” Deanna says, “but the World Cup erases that feeling. I’m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,” she says of the winning goal, “it was such an amazing feeling. I don’t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.” The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven’t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. “Back then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.” His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: “Even if we were 3-0 up, I’d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.” Iceland 0 Nigeria 2 Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 June Iceland’s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland’s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, “It’s like a fairytale – we’re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we’re so super proud of them.” But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. “When we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,” Silla says, “but Gylfi Sigurdsson didn’t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.” What went wrong? “They were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn’t keep up with that pace.” Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team’s strength. “The Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.” Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Thór Halldórsson, whom he describes as “a Viking shield wall”. “I was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete – then that became the more important part of his career.” Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters’ “Viking clap” as a lead-in. But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. “People approach us and say, ‘Well done.’ Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.” Colombia 3 Poland 0 Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 June In Colombia, football isn’t watched with strangers in a bar – it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa). The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone’s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations. Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009. “Growing up in Colombia,” he says, “sport isn’t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it’s a little bit of home in the UK.” The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode – and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. “Goooooooooooal-azo,” they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: “Championes, championes, olé, olé, olé!” Erik says, “Football is an international language. I play four or five times a week – it’s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club’s kit and now we are all watching together.” Sebastian Cano, 29, who moved to the UK in 2013, agrees: “It’s a sense of community. This is how it would be back home. I grew up with Carlos Valderrama [known to non-football fans for his big, blond perm] as a national legend, but in my opinion that generation was overrated. This squad is better. “The last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals; James Rodríguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.” France 1 Peru 0 Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 June Studies over the years have reported that the French aren’t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren’t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France’s victory over Peru. “It was a bit weak,” Yves says, “they could have done a lot better than that. I didn’t find it very exciting really.” Jeremy agrees, pointing out, “We have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn’t win.” Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. “We want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it’s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.” Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. “I remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there’s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, ‘I belong to that country.’ Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I’ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven’t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.” There’s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. “To bring luck,” Jeremy says, “we all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.” Mexico 1 Germany 0 Hayaux-du-Tilly family, Putney, London, 17 June At the apex of a divisive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win. “It was a brilliant game,” Yves says. “Mexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly; it wasn’t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half; unfortunately we didn’t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.” The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. José Pablo, 19, “will probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays”. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: “And of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas – as an expat, it’s a way to connect with your country.” After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. “I was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It’s very, very powerful.” Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. “I love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That’s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.” Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. “It was a bittersweet feeling,” Yves says. “I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico ‘the fifth game’,” ie the quarter-finals. “That has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,” he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. “We didn’t care about our score,” he says. “We were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.” South Korea 1 Mexico 2 Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 June No one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung’s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. “I asked my friends how they thought we would do,” says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, “and they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.” He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. “I saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.” Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks – an extremely popular combination the Koreans call “chi-maek”, from “chi” for chicken and “maekju”, the Korean word for beer. “Unfortunately we couldn’t find Korean beer,” Jaeyoung says, “so we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.” They hung up the Korean flag for luck. “I don’t watch football usually, just the World Cup,” says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. “It’s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I’ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I’m really happy to support them.” For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. “It was the best moment – a miracle.” Despite today’s loss, they are extremely proud of the team’s forward, Son Heung-min. “He got a really incredible goal during extra time,” says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. “After the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, ‘Don’t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!’” He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team’s World Cup. “I didn’t expect that kind of score,” he says. “It was really impressive.” The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored: “And I was like, ‘What the hell? This is awesome,’” Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn’t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. “We were screaming and dancing,” Jaeyoung says . “I just wish I had put a bet on.” Russia 3 Egypt 1 Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 June The balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova’s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. “He was absent on principle,” she explains. “He’s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn’t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.” Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love; Anastasiia’s husband is British, and Polina’s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg. Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt’s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: “I don’t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.” “Our first goal was the best moment for me,” Anastasiia says. “I remember thinking, we’re so close to winning the game, and if we win we’ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.” She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: “I hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren’t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.” Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. “We won and that was a surprise for everyone,” she says. “We’ve only won two games so far – but for us it’s like we’ve won the whole thing.” • This article was amended on 2 July 2018 to correct the spelling of Adama Kande’s surname. • Commenting on this piece?

    "date": "2018-06-29",
    "transcript": "Last year Dae Dae Motley-Gibson was struggling. The 23-year-old was juggling an exhausting work schedule at her job in a kitchen at Newark airport, alongside parenting duties and a family medical crisis. She needed support. She found it in a union. Young people like Motley-Gibson are starting their work lives at a time when activism has been mostly absent from low-wage industries. In the airline workforce, unions have long represented flight attendants and other professionals. But the labour movement hasn’t penetrated the precarious airport-catering sectors, staffed mostly by low-wage immigrants and people of colour. Things began to stir at the Newark airport kitchen when the service workers’ union, Unite Here, recruited Motley-Gibson to help organise her colleagues to demand better working conditions. Last month she helped arrange a rally on behalf of 2,700 fellow catering workers at United Airlines kitchens around the country, calling for fair contracts and the right to form a union. The campaign has bridged social and racial divides. “This is the most that we’ve all come together,” said Motley-Gibson, a first-time organiser. “Each department, each race, each age group … [Companies] want us to be against [each other]; now we talk to each other.” Motley-Gibson isn’t the only young American talking about unions for the first time. Last year, bucking a long trend of decline, union membership in the US grew by 262,000 members. Three in four new recruits were, like Motley-Gibson, under 35. That’s a major upheaval considering the wilting of unions’ political clout over the past two decades. From about 20% of the workforce in 1983 (the earliest year for strictly comparable data), union membership declined to just under 11% last year. On Wednesday, the supreme court dealt another major blow to unions by ruling that non-union members in the public sector no longer have to pay for union representation in collective bargaining negotiations. The hard hats and smokestacks of yesteryear are making room for tablets and tweets as the labour movement gets a millennial upgrade. One in four new hires was unionised last year, of nearly 860,000. An era of inequality, insecure work and Donald Trump has begun to galvanise frustration among a generation often dismissed as self-absorbed. Now hyper-networked millennials are rediscovering the potential of organised labour to seed economic empowerment at work. Young workers have realised that “a generation of corporate-driven policy choices have decimated the rights and economic security of working people”, according to Liz Schuler, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the largest federation of US labour unions. “The millennial and Gen Z generations are more civic minded and acutely in tune with the power of collective action … a union card helps them leverage their power.” Even the ivory tower is embracing worker solidarity. Graduate students at Columbia University recently staged a week-long strike for official recognition of their new union of teaching and research assistants, historically not treated as regular employees. Though the administration has resisted contract negotiations, organisers are building momentum on campus, while a nationwide movement to organise student workers is growing. “Income inequality and disparities are at one of the peaks since the recession,” said Ian Bradley-Perrin, a Columbia graduate worker. “It could be a moment when people are looking for solutions. And the solution [that] has been in existence for a long time, that maybe people haven’t given credit to, is unionisation. Cultural perceptions of unionisation and unions have changed.” Entrepreneurial and creative opportunities have expanded for some in an era of instant global communication and commerce. But millennials dreaming of careers in traditional white-collar professions such as finance and publishing are facing the hamster wheel of temp gigs and unpaid internships. Unions offer a ballast as they navigate an uncertain economy: a boost in wages, especially for women and workers of colour, as well as insurance benefits; steady schedules; and an advocacy network to challenge exploitation, sexual abuse or discrimination in a post-#MeToo era. About two-thirds of professionals responding to a recent AFL-CIO survey said they “would support a proposal for a union at their current job” if they had an opportunity to join one. Despite usually having spent more time in formal education than their parents did, young workers cannot bank on the financial and social security their parents’ generation enjoyed. About 11% of young US college graduates are unemployed or lacking full-time work, and gender and racial income disparities are growing for millennials. The re-energisation of labour parallels other youth-powered activism. Young community activists have bolstered worker-driven protest movements from Occupy to the Fight for $15 to #MeToo, linking issues of living wages, labour protections and social justice. And younger “gig” industries have spawned organising campaigns and legal battles to expand labour protections in sectors such as ridesharing apps, retail and computer programming. Some fresh blood is long overdue for a union movement grown anaemic since the 1970s, strafed by globalisation, automation and rightwing rollbacks on union protections. “Right to work” laws have helped deplete union coffers in many states by restricting their ability to collect fees from all workers at unionised firms, while Wednesday’s supreme court ruling imposed similar barriers on public sector unions. At the media website Curbed NY, editor Amy Plitt’s beat is high-class real estate. As a young journalist, Plitt had never seriously considered unionising. “It didn’t seem like something you could do,” said Plitt. But office murmurings about workplace concerns eventually crystallised into a union drive, and within months a collective bargaining committee was established representing each outlet of Curbed NY’s parent network, Vox Media. In January, the management officially recognised the union as part of Writers Guild East, which represents several other digital news outfits. Last week (6 June) staff at the New Yorker joined the growing list of media workers forming unions. Now embarking on her first contract talks, Plitt said she was attracted to “the possibility of joining together with colleagues and really having a voice at the table”. “The more people in this industry come together and do this, and demand certain rights and different priorities … I think it’s only going to make the industry stronger,” she said. And as long as the old story of bad bosses and angry workers persists in the “new economy”, the union promise will age well: a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/mobile-phones-french-school-ban",
    "date": "2018-06-22",
    "transcript": "It’s breaktime at a middle school in rural Brittany, and huddles of teenagers are chatting in the playground. Two 15-year-olds sit reading novels, while others kick footballs or play chase. One boy does some press-ups. The hum of conversation and flurry of movement contrasts with most other French secondary schools, where playgrounds can be eerily silent as pupils stare at their mobile phones. In La Gautrais, no one looks at Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube. Here mobile phones have been banned. Few seem to miss them. “I do have a phone, but I leave it at home and don’t really think about it much,” shrugged one 14-year-old girl in a denim jacket. “I don’t rush to check it after school. When I get home, first I’ll have a snack, I’ll chat to my mum, do some homework, then I might look at my phone. But only if I’m waiting for an important message.” Two of her friends don’t have mobile phones at all. “We don’t really need phones because we’re always chatting to each other in person, we chat the whole time – too much probably – and we’re really good friends,” one said. La Gautrais middle school in the village of Plouasne banned the use of mobile phone on its grounds four years ago, long before the French president, Emmanuel Macron, made an election promise to outlaw children’s phones in schools in an attempt to “detox” teenagers increasingly addicted to screens. From September, all nursery, primary and middle schools will ban mobile phone use. More than 90% of 12- to 17-year-olds are believed to own a mobile phone in France, and children were already banned from unauthorised use in class. But , as in the UK, it was left to headteachers to decide whether to limit phones in breaktime. La Gautrais’s 290 pupils between the ages of 12 and 16 come from surrounding villages in this farming area. Since the ban, staff have noticed more social interaction between children, more empathy and a readiness to learn at the start of lessons. There is less “switching-off anger” at having to move from breaktime gaming on smartphones to focusing in class. “No phone use at school gives pupils a moment’s peace from social networks and some children tell us they appreciate that,” said the headteacher, Yves Koziel. “On social networks there’s an acceleration and extreme simplification of group relationships which can create conflict, even bullying. We’re freeing them from that – at least during the day. We’re cutting the umbilical cord and offering some respite from it.” Koziel said he was pleased to see children returning to “ordinary things”, such as chatting, games and breaktime clubs and activities including dance and knitting. “I think children are more available for social interaction when they’re obliged to really speak to each other,” he said. Policing the ban has not been difficult. Pupils switch off phones and leave them in schoolbags and there are fewer than 10 confiscations a year. “At my previous schools, sometimes phones were in pencil cases and pupils were checking them or writing messages on phones on their laps,” Laura Floch, an English teacher, said. “Here, phones aren’t an issue.” In March, Floch took a group of 15-year-old pupils to London for a five-day trip, visiting sights including the British Museum and the Museum of London. The teenagers were not allowed to use their phones during the day or during excursions, except when asking to take photographs of sights, but they could use them in evening free time. She said: “They knew it was fair and they accepted it. But I could see other groups of children from France on similar trips at the same museums just sitting on benches and staring at their phones during the whole museum visit instead of taking part.” Sitting with his friends at breaktime, Anatole Desriac, who recently got his first mobile phone at the age of 15, said he approved of the ban. “When I’m with my friends I prefer a proper conversation,” he said. “If you’re all standing around with phones, you talk about what’s on the screen rather than really listening to each other.” He and his friends use their phones to listen to French rap on the long bus journey. At home, playing Fortnite on PlayStation was just as enticing as a phone, but all their parents limited screen use. “Knowing how to use phones in moderation is just part of life for us,” Christian-Steven Kitoko, 16, said. Desriac’s mother, Nicole Lefeuvre, a librarian, said: “Children and parents tend to agree that it’s a good thing not using phones at school. Parents of teenagers find it hard enough to be constantly negotiating screen time at home.” Her rules include no phones before the age of 15, no phones in bedrooms, no screens at all on Thursdays and school-holiday reading time for novels, comics or magazines. In the playground, many under-14s said their biggest worry was breaking their phones, smashing them or dropping them in water so they were happy to leave them at home for safety’s sake. One 16-year-old girl said she did not mind keeping her phone switched off on though she felt attached to it. “I have to know it’s there and I keep it in my jacket pocket, touching it regularly. I feel a bit lost without it.” In Bourges in central France, Jean-Claude Chevalier, the headteacher at Littré middle school, which has 600 pupils, introduced a ban on phone use at breaktimes this year because of what the playground had become. “Staff were surprised to see hundreds of children simultaneously glued to their phones during break – all sitting down staring at a screen and not talking,” he said. “It brought a loss of empathy, because children can use much stronger language on a screen than they would use face to face.” None of the fears about banning phones had materialised. “We thought there might be more playground violence and rowdiness but that wasn’t the case. Pupils talk more, the playground is livelier,” Chevalier said. “We thought we’d have to confiscate dozens of phones a day, in fact the number of confiscations has gone down. We thought the toilets would be monopolised by children sneaking a look at their phones, but that hasn’t happened at all. “What we have seen is that pupils seem less addicted to phones.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "It is midday, and a teenage boy has been removed from class for causing trouble. But instead of being sent to the headteacher’s office, he is jamming on a keyboard while a teacher adds in some drums. “It calms them down,” says Nick Stillwell, the co-founder of the SupaJam school in Swanley, Kent. “They realise life’s OK, and put the knife down.” With its leopard-print wallpaper and vinyl records playing in the entrance hall, SupaJam is not your average educational institution. The Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt has been known to pop by to run workshops. “We try to create an environment that’s a little forgiving,” says Stillwell, a music industry professional who set up the music school four years ago with his business partner, David Court. “This whole thing has been established so it doesn’t feel like school.” Drawing on their expertise the pair created a course in the music industry for young people who who have fallen out of education – 16- to 18-year-olds not in education, training or employment, as well as those aged up to 25 with special educational needs. Some students have spent time in young offenders’ institutions, or have drug or alcohol problems. Some were gang members. SupaJam’s success rate is remarkable – 97% of those who complete the course leave with a nationally recognised business diploma, and 85% go on to further education or employment. “That’s huge for these kids,” says Stillwell, “because everyone’s been telling them how rubbish they are. We give them things to brag about.” Stillwell and Court self-funded the school for its first two years, before winning a contract with the Department for Education. As well as traditional classrooms it has a recording studio, editing suite and enough instruments to start an orchestra. Industry professionals drop in to offer lessons and work experience; the US singer-songwriter Sonia Leigh performed here last year. This summer the students have been given their own stage to curate at the Black Deer music festival near Tunbridge Wells. “Did you know Albert Einstein played the violin?” asks second-year student Katie, 17. “A teacher told his parents they should take him out of school, he wasn’t smart enough. And then they bought him a violin and he sailed through.” Katie has also experienced the power of music. Bullying and family problems shattered her GCSE year, and with only a scattering of Cs and Ds she felt she had nowhere to turn. At SupaJam she has become a star pupil, even creating her own blog about music and mental health. “In formal education they don’t take into account anything you might struggle with. You might be having a bad day but that isn’t the person you are,” she says. “Nick and David actually give you a chance.” SupaJam’s co-founders can identify with their pupils. They met at 15, both kicked out of school without qualifications. “We were the naughty boys, but we were lucky because we had nice families. We weren’t abandoned by the adult world, like some of these kids,” says Stillwell. After setting up their own company they offered an internship scheme, but when it attracted only middle-class children they decided to try something different. The initial idea was to help six local teenagers – they now have 70 pupils and 31 staff, including welcomers to meet students as they arrive; safeguarding specialists in every class; and one-to-one maths and English tutors. Getting the young people into work is the primary objective. “They will often be the only person in education or employment in their family,” says Court. “Sometimes we have to battle with the parents because the kids can earn more money if they’re out on the streets dealing than in school.” While the special requirements of the students vary – from learning difficulties to physical disabilities – they are not taught separately, although all staff are trained in dealing with disabled students. “We decided to mix them all up and they naturally started to self-support each other,” says Court. “They don’t label one another, they just get along. It puts all of us to shame. These kids are inspirational.” Ahead of the Black Deer festival, the students have been working with professionals on every aspect of production, from choosing and booking the acts to running the sound and lighting. Gill Tee, the festival’s co-founder, says she could have found herself in a similar position to the students when she was young. Growing up on a council estate, her teenage brother was murdered when she was 12. “I used to nick my mum’s tranquillisers,” says Tee. “I wanted to escape the pain at home, seeing my beautiful mum shattered.” But she stayed out of trouble, and began her music career making tea at Capital Radio. “It shows these kids that they can do the same.” Last year the first three SupaJam graduates were accepted into university, a proud moment for the school. But taking up those places proved intimidating for the students. Stillwell and Court responded by setting up a charity that will run a mentorship programme and send tutors along with the students for the first six weeks of their studies. Their dreams for SupaJam are even bigger: plans to open a second base in Ramsgate, and then to expand nationwide. “These kids are too young to abandon,” says Stillwell. “This is our society and we have to fight for them.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/why-dutch-bring-up-worlds-happiest-teenagers",
    "date": "2018-06-17",
    "transcript": "In a biology class at a secondary school near Rotterdam, Gerrit the skeleton is not the only one with a permanent grin. The Groen van Prinstererlyceum, which first trialled happiness lessons a decade ago, teaches some of the least troubled teens in the world. In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people. It contrasts starkly with the picture in countries like Britain, where depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, and the US, where the number of young people taking their own lives has risen sharply. So why is this flat, damp country of 17 million people with its history of Calvinism and colonialism so good at giving young people an optimistic outlook? Dr Simone de Roos, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), says life satisfaction among teenagers has not dropped since 2013. “I think Dutch children have generally positive interactions in all their social surroundings,” says De Roos. “They have a supportive environment at home, with friends and also at school. Dutch parents give a lot of support and have mild control. There’s an egalitarian climate, teachers are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and pupils trust teachers.” The last Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, comparing children of 11, 13 and 15, showed a happy Dutch youth. When asked where they would be on “Cantril’s ladder” – with the worst possible life for them on 0 and their best at 10, about 94% of Dutch boys said six or above. Dutch girls were slightly lower, ranging from 84% to 92%. According to that report, young people in the Netherlands were also in the top five for eating breakfast on weekdays, watching more than two hours of weekday television, having kind and helpful classmates – and in the bottom five for being overweight, having sex before 15, and feeling pressure from schoolwork. They were less likely than average to experience bullying and generally found it easy to talk to parents. The results chime with a 2016 Dutch Statistics Office study of 4,000 people from 12 to 25, who ranked their happiness at 8.4 out of 10, and a PISA report in 2015 noting that the country – alongside Finland and Switzerland – seemed “able to combine good learning outcomes with highly satisfied students”. Of course, the general state of the nation helps. There is little unemployment in the Netherlands, relatively low inequality and a healthy economy. Five months ago the SCP compared the Netherlands favourably with 25 years ago, while another study showed people were more optimistic than last year. “At some point there’s a critical mass of optimistic voices, and then it gets its own dynamic,” says Prof Paul Dekker, the SCP programme leader in values and meaning. The director of the World Database of Happiness, Prof Ruut Veenhoven, also believes young people are less burdened by an expectation to “be good”. “If you look across Europe, the Dutch and the Danes are the most lenient and focus more on developing autonomy than giving priority to obedience – and that fits the society,” he says. “Children are more free to do what they want, and in doing what they want, develop an idea of what they really like and social skills. A happy boy may be sometimes not a very good boy.” In Dutch, there is no phrase that means literally “you are a good boy” or “good girl”, says 14-year-old Tjalling Appelhof, from Amsterdam. “You say ‘bravo, lad’ or ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’,” he says. Like most Dutch teenagers, he cycles to school and feels he has a good level of self-determination. “I can say how late I come home – not at 3am, I mean, but some time before bedtime!” he says. “I think I have enough freedom.” Despite the country’s reputation for cannabis smoking, the Trimbos Institute reports a downward trend for using alcohol and drugs and smoking in Dutch children aged 12 to 16. Such activities are described by HBSC experts as “risk behaviours” that impact happiness. Other negatives are bullying and fighting. At Groen van Prinstererlyceum, Dani Karremans, a 16-year-old majoring in sciences, believes such pressures are not extreme in the Netherlands. “If I compare things with other countries and especially other schools, you hear that people are bullied, often seriously,” he says. “Here, you don’t really see that. If people try to bully me, I just ignore it. I’ve got my own friends who I get on with. I don’t have a social ‘image’ or think that everyone has to like me – it’s not realistic.” Dani, whose mother is Indonesian and Polish and whose father is Moroccan, says his father spends more time on Facebook than he does. Saffron Jones, also 16, and majoring in social sciences, is half-English and half-Dutch. She says that from when her parents split up 11 years ago, her friendship group has always been supportive. “I could always stay with my friends at primary school. Now, if I’m stressed about school, mostly one of my friends is good in that subject, so I’ll call them and they help. It calms me down.” The HBSC data supports this: 86% of Dutch teenagers say their classmates are kind and helpful, putting the country top of the tables at 13 and 15. Sex education starts at four, and Saffron says her boyfriend is accepted by her friends and parents. Meanwhile a poster on her school’s wall encouraging people of all sexualities to “come out” reaffirms that openness is OK. The rate of teenage pregnancies in the Netherlands is also the lowest in the EU. The Dutch school system – almost entirely publicly funded – incorporates major exams at about the age of 12 and three levels of secondary education from practical to the most academic. But it is possible to progress from one to the other or repeat a year and, despite concerns about dropping standards and increasing segregation, such flexibility could make for less stress. Yara Agterhof, 17, from Vlaardingen, has just changed her subject focus. “I was a year ahead, [taking] physics, chemistry and biology,” she says. “I figured it was too hard for me and made a decision to go back. Now I have a different profile with the things I do actually enjoy. I don’t feel like I’ve lost a year and I think my parents feel: ‘As long as you’re happy, we’re happy.’” There are social problems such as differences between minority ethnic and native Dutch achievement, while one in nine children grows up in poverty. But Jacqueline Boerefijn, a biology teacher at the Groen van Prinstererlyceum, says even if a school wants to expel a child, it must find another school for them, so there are incentives to deal with issues. But Boerefijn, who developed happiness classes at the school a decade ago, and also gives positive psychology lessons to educators, is worried that Dutch children are under threat from new pressures around educational achievement. “Please stop putting the bar higher, because we have happy children,” she says. “We already have so many highly educated people, and at the moment there are not enough people to do the plumbing and carpentry jobs.” For Tjalling, it is pretty simple. “In the Netherlands we are rich, most things around children are well organised, like school and healthcare, and if people are poor, we try to help them. That’s maybe why children are happy. “It rains a lot. But you get used to it.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

A reference to the conclusions of a report that has yet to be published has been removed. In addition, an earlier version said that the Dutch school system was almost entirely public.

    "transcript": "When Daniel Goldsmith’s first son was born in Quebec in 2013, he took the newborn on a trip to Colorado Springs, the US town in which he grew up. “I’d smile at a mother in a coffee shop, because her baby was the same age as mine, just weeks old,” he recalls. “And then she’d tell me she was going back to work the following week.” Goldmith, a humanities teacher in Montreal, spoke to old friends about their experiences with babies and work. “It just sounded like the definition of insanity: mothers going back to work two weeks after a baby was born; fathers taking two days off.” The 35-year-old had emigrated to Canada with his wife, Giulia Zaccagnini, a few years earlier. He took advantage of a Quebec social policy unheard of anywhere else in North America: a programme of extended non-transferable paternity leave at 70-75% pay offered by the government. “Most of my [male] colleagues at work are somewhere between 28 and 40, and I don’t know of a single one in the department who’s had a kid who has not taken those weeks of paternity leave,” says Goldsmith. “If something generous like this is being offered, you don’t say no.” In the family of Canada’s provinces and territories, Quebec has long been the noisy, rebellious child. In 2006, it divorced itself from the country’s complex and lacklustre parental leave programme. The province created its own system, the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), a model influenced by Scandinavian countries and with the aim of improving gender equality. Along with Quebec’s highly subsidised daycare system – the envy of parents across the rest of Canada, with rates as low as C$7.55 (£4.35) per day per child – QPIP was seeded in the 1990s by the controversial separatist leader Pauline Marois, then Quebec’s minister of families. “Marois is a feminist and fiercely determined,” says Sophie Mathieu, a post-doctoral fellow at Brock University who researches the Quebec parental leave system. “As a province, Quebec went from being the laggard in gender equality – Quebec was the last Canadian province to give women the vote – to being the leader.” QPIP gave parents higher replacement rates – 70-75% of one’s income, over a maximum 52 weeks – than other Canadian provinces, while offering more flexibility in terms of shared leave. But the most innovative aspect of QPIP is its “daddy quota” — the five weeks of “use-it-or-lose-it” benefits, for fathers and non-biological mothers in lesbian couples. “There is so much working against fathers when it comes to leave,” says Andrea Doucet, the Canada Research Chair in Gender, Work &amp; Care. “Fathers go into work and say they want to take leave, and their bosses say: ‘Well isn’t your wife taking leave?’ Fathers were being penalised for taking leave, all the stuff that women have been going through for so long. “What they found in places like Sweden is that if you give fathers their own leave, something families will lose if they don’t take, taking the leave becomes expected.” Among fathers in Quebec, the effect was close to immediate, with take-up rates among eligible dads jumping 250%. “Over 80% of Quebec fathers take their paternity leave,” says Doucet. And 86% of Quebec parents will also in some way share the rest of their parental leave. Compare that with the 15% of fathers who take parental benefits in the rest of Canada, and the estimated 2% of parents who use the shared parental leave programme in the UK, and the results of what some policy experts have called “the Quebec experiment” begin to seem quite stunning. Globally the picture is even starker. Almost two-thirds of the world’s children under a year old – nearly 90 million infants – live in countries where fathers are not legally entitled to a single day of paid paternity leave, according to new research by Unicef. Ankita Patnaik, an economist at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington DC, authored one of the first papers studying QPIP. She says the programme quickly showed results with regards to time use between couples. “I found that the mothers having babies in Quebec under QPIP were spending more time in paid work one to three years after having their children,” she says. What’s more, Patnaik found that fathers who made use of QPIP were engaging in more childcare and domestic work one to three years later than fathers who did not – 37 minutes more per day, on average. Doucet, who has studied fatherhood for two decades, says that the true worth of Quebec fathers spending more time with their babies is still difficult to reflect in numbers. “The real question is: later on when the child is sick, who is going to care for the kid? We’ve seen … that when fathers build their confidence, competence, love and the feeling that they are an equal parent, then when things go wrong, it’s not always the mother [who takes responsibility].” While five weeks of leave is a good step in this direction, “it’s just one step”, she adds. Goldsmith, who also used shared parental benefits to take months-long leaves for both his young sons, believes that men caring for their babies in the early weeks of their life has a significant and continuing benefit for family life. “It’s different for dads. Mums have an automatic bond but dads have to earn it. And then when you start getting reactions from your babies, it makes you want to be more involved,” he says. “I want to care for my kids, not because of some abstract theoretical notion of sharing 50/50. My son smiles when I smile, he smiles when he sees me. So I do things for love. Love becomes the reason.” In Canada, that love is spreading. “In the 2018 budget, we have introduced an additional parental sharing benefit of five weeks,” says the families minister, Jean-Yves Duclos. “This is directly related to this very successful experiment in the province of Quebec. “We know it’s policies like this that will help us achieve a more equal and inclusive society. These are the kind of policies we want. Not the kind that build walls. Here in Canada, we prefer bridges.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "A year ago, Saranzaya Chambuu received a distressed phone call from her sister Naranzaya. Their roommate had brought a male friend home the night before. When she left for work, he stayed. Hours later, Naranzaya called her elder sister. “She was crying and asking: ‘Who was that man? He raped me and then he left.’” That man, they would soon learn, was a ruling party MP, Gantulga Dorjdugar, who is now under investigation. He says he has been wrongly accused and the two “mutually consented” to having sex. It is one of the most high-profile political scandals in Mongolia in years, and highlights both the progress and the challenges in a nascent but growing women’s rights movement. Saranzaya, 32, is one of a small but increasingly bold group of women calling on their country to tackle pervasive sexual violence. For some, this is the beginning of Mongolia’s #MeToo movement, though weak laws and a culture of victim-blaming mean it has a long way to go. “Some people ask why don’t we stop and why are we fighting for this,” Saranzaya said. “We want to make a path for other women. If this can win in court and they can bring justice to victims, we can prove the system is just and that will help other victims.” According to Mongolia’s first nation-wide survey on gender-based violence, released on Thursday by the national statistics office and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), 31% of women say they have been subjected to sexual or physical violence by their partner. One in seven women (14%) say they have been subjected to sexual violence by someone who was not their partner – a figure twice as high as the estimated world average and higher than almost anywhere else in Asia, according to Henriette Jansen, a UNFPA adviser. “In Mongolia there is huge variation in proportions of women experiencing non-partner sexual violence throughout the country. It is everywhere and sexual abuse against women is quite alarming compared with the rest of the region,” said Jansen. But a backlash is building. In March a group of women knitted hundreds of red pussyhats and wore them to a protest against violence in the capital on International Women’s Day. In May a women’s group held a performance of the Vagina Monologues, translated into Mongolian. In 2016, after years of lobbying by activists and female lawmakers, the country made domestic violence a crime for the first time. Now a consortium of NGOs is pushing for sexual harassment in the workplace to be included in the country’s labour laws. Sexual assault or abuse below the level of rape is handled by the country’s human rights commission, which can only make recommendations. Justice delayed While awareness is increasing, justice is still rare. Naranzaya’s case stalled at first when two doctors who first examined her took a leave of absence and then were replaced. The case was reopened in August after Naranzaya’s family provided items – underwear and a duvet – found to have traces of Gantulga’s semen. Gantulga, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, has repeated his client’s assertion of innocence. The national survey found that only 10% of women who said they had experienced “severe sexual violence”, including rape, from someone who was not their partner, said they reported their case to the police. A separate survey of 300 rape victims by the Gender Equality Centre found that about 65% of reported assaults went to trial. Just 9.5% of victims polled said they had received compensation. Police data shows victims get on average 804,854 tugrik – about £250. Women who speak out are often blamed. Late last year Bolor Zaankhuu, 33, published her own #MeToo account. Fifteen years ago, while taking an elevator up to her fourth-floor apartment, a man grabbed her from behind and groped her, she wrote in a blog. She struggled until the elevator doors opened and she ran out and down the stairs to the ground floor. When she went to the police with her father, she recalled, she was reprimanded for wearing a tank top. It was the middle of summer. “Immediately I was blamed,” she said. Bolor later identified her attacker, who spent one night at the police station before being let go. Now, she said, she waits to take elevators until no men are around and she doesn’t allow her 10-year-old daughter to go anywhere alone. A woman who lives and works in Ulaanbaatar said that on one occasion four years ago she woke up in a hotel to find a man raping her. Later when she filed a police report alleging she had been drugged and assaulted, the investigator said she was not likely to get compensation and encouraged her to drop the case. Eventually she did. “I don’t feel bad about it any more. At least, I want to shake that mindset. Women feel guilty. Because they got drunk or because they went to that party, they blame themselves … that if I hadn’t been wearing this or that, then this wouldn’t have happened,” she told the Guardian, asking that her name not be published. Women have contacted Saranzaya to say they too have been victims of sexual assault, but no one has joined her campaign. The sisters have been called prostitutes and liars. Others say Saranzaya is using her sister to try to extort money from the MP. Even women’s rights groups have stayed away after critics accused Saranzaya of being politically motivated. Hospital shelter Researchers and advocates are worried not just about the extent of sexual violence in Mongolia but the severity of it. The survey found 72% of women who said they had been injured by their partners reported “severe” harm such as broken bones, cuts to the head and in some cases miscarriages. Researchers found forms of abuse particular to Mongolia: hundreds of women reported being chased by their partners in cars, on motorcycles or horses, or being lashed with whips. The number of people reporting abuse is growing, a statistic that could mean more people are willing to do so, or abuse is on the rise, or some combination of the two. At the One Stop Service Centre, a small office and room with bunkbeds at Ulaanbaatar’s main trauma hospital, abused women can shelter with their children for up to 72 hours and seek medical help, therapy and legal advice. Deedentsetseg Chuluunbayar, a social worker at the centre, said that in 2008, the first year it was open, it received around 300 women. Last year the number was 960, despite the centre closing for a month, and now it gets at least eight women a day. On payday and public holidays, more women come to the hospital with injuries. On 18 March, Soldier’s Day in Mongolia, 15 women came to the centre. Deedentsetseg said Mongolia’s new domestic violence law could lead to fewer women reporting abusive partners. In the past, women reported their husbands to the police to scare them, and then they would drop the case. Under the new law, domestic violence cases have to go forward to trial. “It’s really a difficult situation because most of the women who come here don’t want to disrupt the family and are dependent on their husbands,” Deedentsetseg said. ‘Reverse gender gap’ It is unclear why sexual violence is apparently so prevalent in Mongolia, a middle-income country that prides itself on its peaceful transition from a former Soviet satellite to a democracy in 1990. Some blame a macho culture, while others point to a “reverse gender gap”. For years after the transition, families invested more of their resources in sending their daughters to school and kept their sons home to herd. Mongolian women now outpace men in education, health and work. Men have higher rates of unemployment and alcoholism, and their average lifespan is 10 years shorter than that of women. “Men’s reputation has fallen. These things can be a reason why more men are angry with women, which leads to violence,” said Boldbaatar Tumur, head of the Men’s Association in Gobisumber province, which works on raising awareness of men’s issues. Others say Mongolia’s close-knit rural communities encourage a culture of silence. “Very few people can say ‘me too’,” said Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a former MP who pushed for the law criminalising domestic violence. “In the countryside there is no anonymity, and because of that no one wants to speak out.” Gerelee Odonchimed, vice-director for education and advocacy at Women for Change, a women’s empowerment group, said Mongolia’s women rights movement needed more patience. “It can be slow but, yes, time is up,” she said. “We aren’t talking about changing the colours of the walls. We are talking about changing people’s minds.” Saranzaya and Naranzaya are also taking things slowly. They have moved into a new apartment and Naranzaya, 26, is back at school, studying to become a teacher. “She’s starting to feel OK again,” Saranzaya said of her sister. This week Gantulga, the accused MP, resigned from parliament. Saranzaya has noticed that when the case is in the news again, her sister slips back into a depression. She has wondered whether they ought to drop the case and move on with their lives. “I said if it’s too difficult we can stop, but she says no, we will fight together.” Additional reporting by Munkhchimeg Davaasharav • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "The message is written on a poster, hung between trees that offer shade but little relief from the blazing sun. It spells out what has been achieved in this rural Indian village: “We no longer die in childbirth.” For the women of Purabgaon, in the Amethi district of Uttar Pradesh, expectations had always been clear. Get married young, then have back-to-back pregnancies. Those babies would be delivered in unsanitary conditions at home by a dai, a village midwife with no training and many superstitions. “Even if a woman was taken to hospital for the birth, half an hour later she would be bundled home to do the chores, feed the cattle and cook,” said Gulab Yadav, a project manager in Amethi for Save a Mother. The maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Amethi has been one of the highest in the world – 451 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to a 2008 government survey. Anaemia is one key problem: around 55% of Indian women are anaemic, and rural women’s diets are often poor. Save a Mother aims to educate rural women about pregnancy, nutrition, immunisation, delivery and care of the child. “We told them to delay having the first baby and leave a three-year gap between pregnancies to keep mother and child safe and healthy. And they understand that delivery in hospital is safest because complications such as heavy bleeding can be treated,” said Gita Gupta, a Save a Mother team leader. Gupta leads a group of 20 female “change agents” in Purabgaon. Each of the 360 villages in Amethi covered by the scheme has a team of 20 agents – local women trained to educate other women. Gupta sometimes changes the lyrics of romantic folk songs to refer to iron supplements, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and breastfeeding. “They find it easier to remember what I’ve told them if they sing it,” she said. Beginning with 20 villages in Amethi 10 years ago, Save a Mother has expanded to 1,100 villages in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. The maternal mortality rate for those villages has been reduced by 90% and infant mortality is down by 60%. Last year in Purabgaon, not a single mother died in childbirth. Nationwide there are five maternal deaths in childbirth every hour, but the mortality rate has been falling steadily, from 280 per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 174 in 2015 and 130 in 2016. Shiban Ganju, a Chicago-based doctor, founded Save a Mother after a visit to rural Uttar Pradesh. “As a physician I knew [the high mortality rate] could be solved by a dedicated group working with the community,” he said. Ten years on, he said he had learned two key things. Firstly, that changing social behaviour is the most effective and least expensive way to reduce the impact of disease. And secondly, that the Indian government should increase its public health spending from the current 1.1% of GDP – one of the lowest proportions in the world – to 2.5%. Some of the older women in Purabgaon talked candidly about the relentless pressure they were put under to give birth. “I had five children in quick succession, my mother-in-law kept saying she wanted a grandson. Then I married off my eldest daughter at 15. That was wrong,” said Urmila Devi. “I know better now. My youngest girl won’t get married before 20 and I will tell her to control her pregnancies.” The village remains highly conservative, but the project has had an impact: many women can now leave the house and attend meetings without needing the permission of their husband or mother-in-law. Moreover, empowered by the information they have absorbed about pregnancy and childbirth, they have some leverage in family discussions. “They tell their husbands that if they want a healthy baby … the mother has to eat well. If they aren’t given fish or meat, they drink two glasses of milk instead. And they insist on a hospital delivery,” said Gupta. In the past, tradition has dictated that women wait for a priest to announce an auspicious moment to start breast-feeding the newborn. While waiting, often for up to three days, they fed goat or cow milk to the baby, causing diarrhoea. “Now we breastfeed at once. We don’t wait for the priest,” said one of the mothers, Kanti Devi. Seema Agrahari’s three children, now six, three and one, were all delivered in hospital. “I had an IUD for my family planning. It’s the best thing I did. I felt well during each pregnancy,” she said. “But I could have been one of those who died in childbirth. Information saved me.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "transcript": "It was a scorching hot day when Carlos Fernando Argueta was interviewed for a job at a clothing factory in western El Salvador, but he still wore a long-sleeved shirt. The tattoos on his arms had cost him jobs before, tell-tale signs of his past life in the notoriously brutal Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang. “Believe me, I’m very ashamed,” says Argueta, 39, who joined the gang when he was 12. “I know that we corrupted many hearts and minds. But if God has his arms open for people like us, then why can’t society give us a job opportunity?” Between 30,000 and 60,000 active gang members in El Salvador, in a population of 6.3 million. It was one of the most dangerous countries in the world last year; in 2015 it recorded one murder every hour, after a truce between the MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs fell apart and a bloody turf war resumed. The interviewer spotted that Argueta was attempting to hide his past. He gave him the job anyway. Argueta has worked for nine years at League Central America, a clothing factory that produces apparel for US universities including Harvard and Princeton. It’s one of a growing number of firms, at least 10 so far, in El Salvador hiring reformed gang members. Those include energy firm AES Corporation and a tuna packing company, according to the Trabajemos por la Paz (Working for Peace) group, which has found jobs for more than 700 reformed gang members since 2008. Unsurprisingly, research suggests that those who can find regular employment are more likely to escape the cycle of gang violence that has tormented the country. League Central America has employed at least 100 former gangsters since 2009. The company pairs with local churches and community groups to provide job training and facilitate the delicate process of cutting ties, which involves careful negotiation with leaders who view defectors with suspicion. In fact, members are never considered to have truly left, only to have become calmado, or inactive. According to the head of League Central America, Rodrígo Bolaños, none of those who joined his firm have returned to active status. This process of rehabilitation stands in stark contrast to the politically popular mano dura, or iron fist, approach to dealing with the country’s gang violence, which has seen lethal extrajudicial violence meted out by security forces. “We have stopped a tremendous problem by embracing the community, giving them a true opportunity in life. We’re resolving the problem instead of killing them,” says Bolaños. “It sends the message that we have to embrace the community if we want to have a healthy country.” Manuel Oswaldo Henríquez, a 31-year-old employee at League Central America, joined the Barrio 18 gang at 14. “After ninth grade, I didn’t want to study anymore,” Henríquez says. “There was no future for me in this country because I had already tattooed my body.” His teachers were afraid of him, awarding passing grades out of fear. His life consisted of shootouts in rival neighbourhoods, followed by the inevitable retaliation on his own turf. “It’s hard being in the gang. It’s not like your mom telling you to do something. If you don’t follow the orders, there are punishments, beatings. That’s life in the gang.” Now, Henríquez has a respectable job that allows him to provide for his wife and six-year-old son. Not everyone is convinced of the merits of offering jobs to people such as Argueta and Henríquez who have perpetrated terrible crimes. Many Salvadorans bear the scars of years of gang violence. Some firms still refuse to partner with Trabajemos por la Paz, while others are only comfortable offering food for programmes and events. Those that do open their doors also face the task of winning over the existing employees. “It’s a challenge to convince not just the business owners, but all the people working at a company,” said Nelson Morales, the executive director of the group. “But through the years, we’ve realised that people are opening up. Part of our work is making sure that society and business owners understand the [gang] phenomenon.” For Morales there’s a simple logic to the approach. “Any social reintegration programme is incomplete if it can’t provide people with a way of making a living that is respectable and socially accepted,” he says. Henríquez has faced resistance in his new life. “There are many people who don’t believe that gang members can change,” he says. “But they can, I’ve seen it in myself and I’ve seen it in other people as well. If there are opportunities, I know that a gang member can change and be different.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "From providing fresh food for the community to regenerating unused spaces, urban food-growing projects have flourished in the US. In Minnesota, fish and green vegetables are farmed in a former brewery by Urban Organics; in New York, Brooklyn Grange grows produce on the roof of its office. In Dallas, Texas, in an area designated as a food desert, meaning access to fresh fruit and vegetables is difficult, Big Tex urban farms have donated 85,000 servings of fruit and vegetables to the community since 2016. Developed for and funded by the annual State fair of Texas, the project consists of mobile beds in car parks and a hydroponic greenhouse which allow plants to grow without soil. “The majority of the population in this area relies on small corner stores that do not provide access to quality produce or healthy foods,” said Jason Hays, the fair’s creative director. “Access to modern grocery stores can be inhibited due to pricing, transportation and education. The city tried to lure a large grocer with financial incentives but had no luck. “Access to fresh food options can have a profound effect on the health and wellbeing of individuals, which can transform communities. I believe everyone should have equal access to healthy options as well as education to improve eating habits.” One recipient, Glenda Cunningham, of the Baylor Scott and White health and wellness centre, praised the project’s work. “The community looks forward to the Big Tex urban farm delivery each week. The food is fresh, free and beautiful,” she said. Learning about life through gardening In Orange, Connecticut, the food production company Watson’s fellowship garden has been running for four years. The company grows produce for food banks and had extra space available, so it decided to expand and has opened its garden to a centre helping children with autism spectrum issues. Christina Cole, 47, a graphic designer at Watson, said: “The plot for Milestones Behavioural Services, which includes a pumpkin and melon patch, gives kids with autism and developmental disabilities the chance to not only have fun and be outside, but also learn life skills and take home what they grow and learn to cook with their families. With the garden season kicking in, we’re getting ready to put in a corn maze.” According to the Connecticut food bank, one in eight people in the state struggle with hunger. “We feel no one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from,” Cole said. The company provides 4,800 plants each year, and those not used are donated to the food bank for use in its gardens. Watson hopes the garden will not only help children but also address food insecurity facing older generations. “Those who are elderly and on a low income used to get vouchers from the state to access fresh fruit and vegetables, but the programme has been cut due to a lack of funding. With our garden we hope to work with the community and help with such issues. Everyone should have access to food, much less something fresh,” Cole said. She said shops were willing to donate food in West Haven but did not have the resources to do so. “I’m in the process of trying to organise the logistics of starting runners to help businesses get food to those who need it most. We’re hoping it will help reduce food waste in the area.” Rose Majestic, the executive director of Wheat, which provides food to people in crisis, said: “The people who comes to us can’t afford fresh produce so Watson’s weekly deliveries go a long way in helping them. We hope other businesses that have yards that can be dug up and used for feeding the hungry in our community start to do the same.” Watson is hosting an event in June to try to get local businesses to start their own community food-growing projects. “In light of the world nowadays, we should all get back to learning to grow our own food. It is the essential basis for survival. It can only further us all to know how to feed ourselves healthily and it’s a great help to have an alternative food source for our neighbours.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/india-heat-wave-deaths-public-health-measures",
    "date": "2018-06-02",
    "transcript": "One morning last week, Mohammad Javed wheeled an air conditioner on to the pavement outside his catering business in Delhi, placed his chair a metre away, sat down and did not move all day. When the machine ran out of water, he asked passing boys to fetch a bucket. When he had to give directions to workers in the building across the lane, he shouted. Every few minutes, he took a long swig from his water bottle and spat the contents on to the ground without swallowing. “Ramadan,” he explained. Northern India, like neighbouring Pakistan, is in the grip of a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 47C. A blanket of hot air has settled on Delhi clearing pavements across the usually busy capital. India is particularly vulnerable to temperature increases associated with climate change. Since 1992, about 25,000 Indians are estimated to have died because of heatwaves. Yet the country is quietly optimistic that it can prevent at least some of those deaths. In the past two years, the numbers dying from heat-related illnesses has fallen sharply, from 2,040 in 2015 – when roads melted in the searing heat – to half that the following year and to a little over 200 in 2017, according to government data. Public health advocates say this has been a triumph of common sense. A combination of public awareness campaigns, training for medical staff and simple policy changes – such as unlocking the gates of public gardens during the day –have averted thousands of deaths for little cost. The catalyst was a heatwave in May 2010 in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western state of Gujarat, that killed more than 1,100 people, and prompted authorities to seek help. “The first thing was making people aware that heat can kill,” said Parthasarathi Ganguly, a professor of public health and former World Health Organisation official. “India is a tropical country, so people are used to heat: they take it as a natural phenomenon. They say, it will be hot – what’s new?” Under Ahmedabad’s action plan – first implemented in 2013, when temperatures rose so high it risked triggering organ failure – school days were reduced, government work programmes ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas. White reflective paint was applied to roofs in slum communities, cutting temperatures in homes by up to five degrees. In hospitals, staff were trained to identify early signs of heat stroke, including dizziness or severe diarrhoea. Instead of waiting in stifling wards, patients were rushed to dedicated cool rooms equipped with fans, ice packs and, electricity supply permitting, air conditioning. “Doctors don’t go on vacation any more when it’s hot,” said Anjali Jaiswal, of the US-based National Resource Defense Council, which advised on the plan. “They watch the temperature and make sure the hospital is staffed.” Ahmedabad already had plenty of charities willing to distribute water. “They see it as an act of god,” Ganguly said. The city government simply allocated each charity a zone, to ensure the whole city was covered. The gates of city gardens, usually closed in the daytime, were opened so that hawkers, traffic police and rickshaw pullers could seek shade. “The council didn’t spend a rupee,” Ganguly said. The first test of the new system was in May 2014 when, he says, temperatures again reached the levels that had killed so many. “According to our initial estimates, 800 fewer people died,” he said. “In terms of cost per lives saved, it is one of the most effective interventions in public health until now.” Since then, 11 more cities have adopted similar heat action plans, and one is currently in the works for Delhi. India’s national disaster management authority is aiming to reduce the death toll from excessive heat to zero. So far this year, government officials say, the heat has killed 11 people. Temperatures will drop across India at the end of this month with the arrival of the monsoon rains.

    "date": "2018-06-01",
    "transcript": "Below a mottled sky, a lone sea craft cuts across the water towards Kapiti Island. It’s been forsaken by people and gifted to the rare and vulnerable birds of New Zealand to forage undisturbed. Kiwi stepping carefully up the beach at midnight. Kokako waking no one with their shrill calls. And hihi flitting freely through the dense native bush. With no predators allowed, the birds are confident and thriving. “New Zealanders are a shy and reclusive bunch, the kiwi is a bird we identify with,” says Paul O’Shea, an administrator for Kiwis for Kiwi, a conservation group set up to save the bird from extinction. “It’s as vital to protect the kiwi in New Zealand as it is to protect the orangutan in Borneo, the sumatran tiger in Indonesia, and the panda in China. Losing these species from the planet might not affect your day-to-day life, but it is a loss to the human experience.” There are 68,000 kiwi left in the country, and they are declining at the rate of 2% per year . A century ago, there were millions. Outside the predator-free zones, kiwi chicks and adults are killed and eaten by dogs and cats, attacked by possums, stoats and rats, and hit by cars at night. These ancient, flightless and nocturnal animals are a wonder to conservationists the world over. They are descended from a “proto-kiwi” that lived about 50 million years ago, they hatch eggs so large they take days to exit their bodies, and are related to the extinct moa, the tetchy cassowary and the emu in Australia (known as the ratite family). On Kapiti, just 40 minutes by car and ferry from downtown Wellington, Emma Neill, state conservation worker, wanders awestruck through the bush. The birdsong is cacophonous and musical, the way mainland New Zealand used to sound. Predator-free islands and sanctuaries are the highest conservation ranking for protected land in New Zealand, Neill explains. They are patrolled by rangers who live and work alone on the island, poised to tackle any threats: stoats which manage to “raft” over (on driftwood or debris after a storm), rats that stow away on boats, or Argentinian ants in picnic baskets that breach the natural moat, and can swarm on chicks in the nest. If an invader is detected on the island, they are tracked by trained dogs, trapped and then baited using the controversial 1080 poison. “Having done conservation projects for so many years, humans tend to react only when there’s a crisis, and the crisis point is often too late to save anything,” says the wildlife presenter Michaela Strachan, wearing a set of kiwi earrings cut from paua shells. Strachan has teamed up with cider company Old Mout to help save the kiwi, a project she was drawn to because of the bird’s unusual charm. “But this reaction seems to be happening before we’ve reached a crisis point, so I think it will make a difference. There is something about them that is just so full of character. I think because they’re flightless and vulnerable, human beings warm to things that are vulnerable.” In 2016, the government committed to making New Zealand pest-free by 2050. Every rat, stoat and possum is to be wiped out. Sceptics abound: Strachan calls the goal “unbelievable”, O’Shea from Kiwis for Kiwi says it’s “ambitious”, while Neill hopes she’s still alive to see the dream come true. This month, the new Labour-coalition government announced the most significant funding increase for the Department of Conservation in 10 years, with NZ$80m (£41.9m) flagged for pest-eradication efforts. Brent Beavan, programme director for Predator Free 2050, says the biggest hurdle to saving the kiwi is domestic cats and dogs. But that’s a touchy subject in New Zealand, which has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. To achieve the 2050 goal, a range of new technologies will have to be deployed in addition to pest-trapping and baiting, says Beaven. Drones, bio-chemical agents and genetic modifiers are all being considered. “It feels a bit like Everest at the moment, but I think we can have a really good whack at it. Momentum and enthusiasm is really building,” says Neill. “New Zealanders have grasped it, and have started to act in their everyday lives.” Across the country, volunteer groups that set and check pest traps in conservation areas are growing in number, and traps are increasingly appeating in backyards. In Northland, people offer to take their dogs to kiwi aversion training: an electric shock is administered to dissuade them from stalking kiwi. More people are locking their cats indoors at night. Neill reckons the Maori worldview is becoming part of the New Zealand identity: we aren’t here to dominate mother nature, we’re here to protect it. “We have something special here in New Zealand, we need to be careful to protect what we have,” she says. “We don’t just want our kids to have to look at our native birds on a chart in a school classroom – of what New Zealand once had.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/how-chopping-off-their-horns-helps-save-rhinos-from-poachers",
    "date": "2018-05-31",
    "transcript": "Armed with a dart gun in a helicopter hovering above Somkhanda game reserve in South Africa, the vet Dr Mike Toft has just shot a powerful cocktail of drugs into the massive white rhino below. The 2,000kg (315st) bull starts to stagger and sinks slowly to its knees as the drugs take effect. Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels. After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off. Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn – for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols – drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world. Worldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa’s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000. These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers’ prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced. The strategy has produced dramatic results in several reserves. Chris Galliers, chairman of the Game Rangers Association of Africa, analysed 2010-15 poaching statistics from the south-eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal and found that nearly a quarter of rhino deaths were on private reserves. But over the past two and half years, coinciding with the intensive dehorning efforts, that has dropped to 5%. Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. “This is not something we want to do. It’s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,” says Galliers, noting that it costs about £580 to safely dehorn a rhino. The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally. Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull. The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood – and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly. Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers. For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.

    "title": "Return of the bison: herd makes surprising comeback on Dutch coast",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/return-of-the-bison-herd-makes-surprising-comeback-on-dutch-coast",
    "date": "2018-05-28",
    "transcript": "Eighty years after they were hunted to extinction, the successful reintroduction of a herd of wild European bison on to the dunes of the Dutch coast is paving the way for their return across the continent. The largest land-living animal in Europe was last seen in the Netherlands centuries ago, and was wiped out on the continent by 1927. Despite successful efforts to breed the species again in the wilds of Poland in the 1950s, and renewed efforts in the last decade in western Europe, the European bison remains as endangered as the black rhino. The 7,000 bison, or bison bonasus, that exist in Europe today are often given supplementary feed by rangers to get through the winter months. Yet a study of a herd of 22 bison living in Kraansvlak, 330 hectares of dunes and natural ponds making up part of the Zuid-Kennemerland national park in north Holland, is now offering a more optimistic assessment of the bison’s chances of survival. A series of research papers from the Dutch study further questions the belief that European bison are forest-dwelling creatures, a development that opens up their reintroduction to a whole host of new European environments. Nature organisations in Sweden, Switzerland and the UK are looking on with interest, and knowledge is being shared with established projects in Spain, France and Germany. “People thought, ‘Bison on dunes? The crazy Dutch’,” said Yvonne Kemp, the bison project leader in the Zuid-Kennemerland park, and the co-author of the latest published research. “But it is working, you can see the herd, they are having calves and doing well. “The general view for decades was that European bison were a forest animal. But we were not so sure. We believed that they are not so suited to forests because today, still in winter time, in lots of areas, they feed the bison. They come to the hay, which is not super natural.” Three bison were first introduced into the Kraansvlak, in the municipality of Bloemendaal, in April 2007, and a further three in 2008, at the start of a 10-year attempt to fight back against encroaching grasses and shrubbery stamping out the area’s biodiversity. Managed by the water company, PWN, which exploits the natural filtration system of the dunes to supply north Holland, there was a pressing need for grazers to eat back the vegetation. And the appetite of bison is legendary. “The bison is the largest terrestrial animal in Europe and it needs a lot of food and it needs not only grasses, but quite a lot of intake year round of weed species,” Kemp explained. “The thinking was that, combined with roe and fallow deer, cattle and rabbits, they could stop the encroachment [of the vegetation].” The chief finding of the study was that European bison can survive without supplementary feeding, even in relatively small nature reserves, by grazing on grasses, herbs and woody plants. And, as their success in Europe’s most densely populated country shows, they can also live close to humans. “Those are wild animals and this is a very urban area so at first we didn’t know what it would take [to reintroduce the herd],” said Kemp. “We had fences of 2.2 metres like a military zone. They are really big, they can jump, they are very powerful ... so we thought we would need really high electric fences. But we have learned what it takes; we have a fence now of 1.2 metres. “At first we would come into the area in cars, but now we have a bison trail for the public to follow. There is a general rule not to go within 50 metres of them, and that’s sensible. But it is safe, and the bison are not stressed.” The bison’s work is evident on the undulating dunes, which are situated between the Zandvoort racing track, whose stand is visible from the highest points, and the city of Haarlem to the east. The animals are impervious to the scratchy hawthorns that would cut up other grazers, and with an average weight of 610kg (96 stone), debarked trees are felled with ease as the bison roam, opening up areas of dense growth for other species. They leave a calling card in the shape of tufts of their winter coat on stumps and bushes. “It is also exciting to see how nature adapts here,” Kemp said. In sub-Saharan Africa the oxpecker has a symbiotic relationship with the buffalo, picking off the parasites in their coats. “Here we have seen magpies doing that job, standing on the bison.” East of Amsterdam, a re-wilding project on the Oostvaardersplassen, where red deer, horses and cattle roam free on low-lying marsh, has been criticised for allowing the grazers to reproduce to such a degree that food became scarce and animals shot to avoid starvation. The Kraansvlak keeps a tight control on numbers, and rotates the bulls, of which they currently have two, with other projects internationally. “These are wild animals, we never forget that, and we are learning all the time,” Kemp said.

    "date": "2018-05-25",
    "transcript": "Most nights of the week, Tanille Geib can be found wandering through drunken crowds on a dance floor in the western Canadian city of Victoria. She’s not a bartender or a bouncer – she’s there to help patrons navigate the sometimes murky world of flirting, dating and hooking up in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Geib was hired by the Victoria Event Centre last month as a “consent captain” – a position believed to be the first of its kind in the country. The job joins a raft of other initiatives around the world aimed at fighting back against sexual harassment and assault – but also guiding those who are struggling to move forward. “Since the #MeToo movement, we now know what sexual assault is, and we’re like, ‘OK, we really don’t want to do that any more,’” she said. “But then there’s this whole grey cloud area around what acting in consent and consensual relationships are.” Geib – who has worked as a sex health educator across North America – came up with the position after attending a few dance parties held by a local collective at the centre. After hearing a raft of “icky” stories , she put her skills to work, creating a position where someone would be on the floor to address the issues as they happened. Then the Victoria Event Centre, which hosts everything from live concerts to burlesque shows, made contact. “They started noticing that our dances were better, more safe and more inclusive and accessible to folks,” she said. “So they approached me, saying: ‘Hey, would you want to come and do this for all of our events? What would that look like?’” The collaboration has transformed the space, which is now adorned with posters on consent and signs that spell out the house policy on the issue. Towards the beginning of the night, Geib often hovers by the door, introducing herself to people as they enter and letting them know that she’s there to chat or answer any questions about consent. Anyone who experiences behaviour that makes them uncomfortable is encouraged to speak with her. “Whether it’s a stare or a physical touch or dancing too close, they can come to me,” she said. As the night continues, she checks on those who seem heavily intoxicated, making sure they’re safe and offering to get them a glass of water or help them into a taxi if needed. In the few short weeks that she’s been on the job, she’s fielded complaints ranging from inappropriate comments to more explicit harassment. Her response depends on those who report the issues; Geib always asks whether they want her to speak to the people carrying out the offending behaviour. If they do, she launches into action. Often she starts by asking how their night is going and whether they need any support. “Depending on how those two questions go, I introduce myself, ‘I’m Tanille and I’ve just gotten some feedback about your behaviour. You’re making someone uncomfortable, do you want to have a conversation with that?’” Some have simply thanked her, saying they didn’t realise how their behaviour was coming across. Others have turned hostile, refusing to listen to her and forcing her to turn to her security team for backup. “We’ve had to kick out a couple of people,” she said. “But I always try and give them my card, and be like: ‘Hey, if you want to chat again, please do so and we would welcome you back into this space.’” Geib stressed that she’s not there to police people’s behaviour. “I’m not here to check in and make sure everyone has full consent. That’s not fun and I would not want that job.” So far the position seems to be having an impact, she said. “The biggest change that we’ve seen is more conversation around consent culture and how to have those conversations normally – without shame and guilt.” The idea has also faced some backlash: a male caller in a recent radio show suggested that she’s taking all of the fun out of a night out. Geib was quick to correct this view. “People are just scared, they’re thinking that all these rules mean no fun,” she said. “But actually the whole point is that I want people to have more pleasure and connection in their lives.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-05-22",
    "transcript": "When he was 14, Govind Gyan Chand started attending the large school near his village. In the first week, some upper-caste boys took him aside and asked him about his caste. He told them he was Dalit, considered the lowest caste in Indian society. When he left school for the day, the boys were waiting outside, and flogged him. “I don’t know why they did it,” he says. “All I know is the upper caste likes to torture us. I wanted to give up school – somehow I didn’t.” Now 22, Chand divides his time between classes in college, working, and teaching English and maths to the Dalit children of his village. He is a volunteer for Bhim Pathshala, a network of free after-school coaching classes for Dalit children run by Bhim Army, an organisation that works for the education and rights of Dalits. Every day, Chand teaches about 20 children between the ages of four and 15 in the courtyard of a temple in Sona village, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, an area that was in the news last year for violent caste riots. When he signed up to be a teacher for Bhim Pathshala two years ago, Chand had to read up on Dalit icons and the history of oppression of his people. The temple where the after-school classes are held is dedicated to Guru Ravidass, a 14th-century poet and saint revered by Dalits; when Chand arrives, the children call out “Jai Bhim”, a greeting used by Ambedkarites, followers of Dalit icon and social reformer Bhimrao Ambedkar. He asks the older children about Jyotirao Phule, the 19th-century anti-caste social reformer, and Deepak, 12, replies with easy confidence, “He fought against the caste system.” “I’m doing this for my community. We have to help each other and knowledge is our only weapon,” says Chand’s friend Siddharth Rajesh Kumar, a college student who also teaches on the project. Bhim Army, which has emerged as a dominant voice in Dalit politics, burst upon the scene in 2015 in Saharanpur in western Uttar Pradesh. The rise of Bhim Army has coincided with the ascent of a new, aggressive form of Dalit politics in India steered by young and dynamic leaders. Bhim Army is led by Chandrashekhar Azad, a young, charismatic Dalit man who achieved notoriety when he put up a signboard outside his village that said “The Great Chamar” – Chamar is used as a pejorative term for “untouchables” – incensing members of the upper caste. In the last two years, there have been increasing instances of large nationwide protests staged by Dalits. At the same time, cases of violence against the community have increased. As Bhim Army has grabbed national headlines, its education project for children, which involves an estimated 400 pathshalas (schools) running after-school classes across Uttar Pradesh, has been steadily working to bring change. Local community members contribute to the costs of running the after-school classes, and the children are provided with stationery and textbooks. “They were set up to support Dalit children, most of whom cannot access good education and come from families where parents are illiterate and cannot afford private tuition,” says Vinay Ratan Singh, president of Bhim Army. Bhim Army admits that it is inspired by the right-wing nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which trains its cadre from a young age through a network of schools. Bhim Army hopes the students in these classes will go on to become leaders in their communities and change the situation for Dalits. The pathshalas also tap into the need for mentoring that Dalit children rarely find. Discrimination begins in the classroom, with studies showing Dalit children are segregated and excluded, forcing them to drop out of school. “The very idea of going to the countryside and telling Dalit families to focus on educating their children is revolutionary,” says Chandra Bhan Prasad, a Dalit writer and entrepreneur who created a temple to the “Dalit Goddess of English”, to inspire his community to use education as a form of resistance. Lalita lives in Sona village. Her daughter Ritika never misses a class in the pathshala andsince starting there is doing better in her normal school classes as well. Ritika says that while she feels scared of asking questions to the teachers in school, it is easier to ask Chand, whom she calls bhaiya (older brother). “We are labourers, but we want her to study and have a different life,” says Lalita.

    "date": "2018-05-18",
    "transcript": "Maria Lenaerts was seven years old when she came home from school one day to find a stranger at the kitchen table. It was September 1942 in Nazi-occupied Belgium. The young man looked afraid. He did not say a word to her. “He was sitting at the table like this,” she recalls, hiding her head in her arms. “He didn’t understand anything.” This was her first encounter with Jefkae Harbant, then an 18-year old with a learning disability and no place to call home. He was born in the French-speaking part of Belgium and did not speak a word of Dutch. Neither Maria nor her parents knew any French. Despite the language barrier, Maria’s parents, who were cattle farmers in the Flemish lowlands, had decided to take the young man in. This was not only an act of wartime charity, but came from a centuries-old tradition of stretching out a hand to people on the margins of society. For hundreds of years, residents in the Belgian town of Geel have been giving a home to strangers with severe mental health problems or learning disabilities. This is not a bed for a night or a few weeks. Many boarders stay with the same family for years, often decades. Somehow a tradition from the age of Chaucer has survived and evolved into part of Flanders’ state healthcare system. In 2018, 205 people are Geel boarders, although home care is now only for those with mental health problems, not learning disabilities. In an age that is more aware of the crushing toll of mental illness, the homecare system has made this small town near Antwerp a curiosity. One in four people will experience mental health problems in their lives, according to the well-known World Health Organisation estimate, while a majority say their pain is deepened by stigma. Geel’s model of acceptance and “radical kindness” – to cite one medical journal – has stirred interest around the world. Academics and journalists have flocked to the small Flemish town searching for inspiration from an “innovation” that is 700 years old. Geel traces its boarding tradition to the 13th century, when people with all kinds of illnesses made a pilgrimage to the local Saint Dymphna’s church. According to the brutal legend, Dymphna was an Irish saint who was murdered in the town. Pilgrims travelled many miles to her church in Geel, searching for miracle cures. When there was no more room in the church sick bay, locals gave them a place to stay. The Geel homecare tradition was incorporated into the state in the 19th century, eventually ending under the umbrella of the Psychiatric Care Centre (OPZ). Most boarders have severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or personality disorder. “They have a long history of disease and referrals. They are not capable of living alone,” says Mieke Celen, a psychiatrist at OPZ, who oversees the matchmaking process between foster families and patients. Foster families are never told the patient’s diagnosis, although they do get warning about behaviour that they might expect: can they live with someone who smokes or walks around the house during the night? Dr Celen says few relationships break down. One study of 17 foster relationships over five years, by the Belgian academics Eugeen Roosens and Lieve Van de Walle, found that only two families dropped out of the programme during the period. Geel’s medical professionals say the system makes a lot of sense. Boarders have better outcomes than patients in hospital: they take less medication and have fewer acute episodes, says Celen. Success means “having a life as normal as possible”, says Wilfried Bogaerts, an OPZ psychologist. “The programme is about life. It is not a miracle cure, it is not a magic system, but it is about finding this person the right place to live at the right time. “Very often there is a severe chronic problem that cannot be cured completely, so we try to make the best of it. We accept the limitations but then try to make the life of a boarder as good as possible.” For advocates, Geel’s forte is seeing the person, not a bundle of stigmatised labels straight from a medical textbook. Boarders are given responsibilities in the household, says Bogaerts: “They take care of the dog, go to the shop, do the dishes … so patients are needed and wanted.” For some observers, there is not enough evidence that the scheme really works. “There has been very little evaluation about the impact of this,” says Professor Sir Graham Thornicroft at King’s College London. “In terms of outcomes for individuals, we don’t know about readmission rates, or satisfaction rates, or quality of life, or things we would normally want to assess for people with long-term needs.” Jefkae Harbant is exceptional, even by the standards of Geel family care. When the Guardian visits, his 94th birthday is only a few days away. A cake has been ordered. Friends invited. There will be a family party. He still remembers the day he arrived on the family farm nearly 76 years ago. “He was not afraid, but it was difficult for an 18-year-old boy who came to an unknown environment,” recounts his care worker, Michelle Lambrechts, who acts as an interpreter. Maria is now 82 and has lived with Jefkae nearly all her life. When her father died in 1982, she became his foster “mother”, even though she is younger. After decades under the same roof, legal formalities have melted away. He is really a brother, she says, speaking through an interpreter, sitting in the house she has lived in all her life. There was was never a question that he would leave the family. Harbant’s foster father is Maria’s husband, Jules Teunkens, a retired glass-factory worker, now 86. Maria and Jules married in 1957. A 60th wedding anniversary mug bearing their black and white younger selves is sitting on a shelf crowded with bric-a-brac. While her husband worked at the factory, Maria Lenaerts brought up their three children and worked on the family farm. And Jefkae helped, milking the cows and tending vegetables. The family are rarely apart. Although social services offer respite care for holidays, Harbants does not like to stay at the hospital, recounts Lambrechts. “When Jefkae went to the ward, he cried a lot. He cries and he cries for hours because he doesn’t want to sit on the ward – he wants to be at home.” The number of families who take in boarders is in sharp decline, as Geel’s rural, churchgoing traditions fade into the past. More women are working. Fewer people farm the land. The traditional foster family is disappearing. Demand from patients is also falling. People with severe mental health problems no longer face the stark choice of hospital or boarding; many are opting for other kinds of residential care. Geel reached its peak on the eve of the second world war, when 3,736 borders lived in the town. The numbers have been falling ever since and the decline has accelerated in the last two decades: in 2006 there were 46o borders, today 205. Younger families are proving hard to attract. The OPZ thinks the Geel model can survive, but would like the state to increase payments to families from the current maximum of €600 (£535) a month. “The openness of the community is pretty high,” Bogaerts says. “We should compensate families more so it is more attractive.” Maria Lenaerts would recommend taking in boarders, yet she doubts that the system fits with how people live now. “It won’t last,” she says. “People have a lot of activities and recreation – they don’t have time.” None of her children or grandchildren have taken in any boarders.

    "transcript": "Tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood of Beirut, Helem, the first community centre for LGBTQI+ people in the Arab world, opens its doors every day from midday to evening. Everyone is welcome. Inside, in a study bathed by the afternoon sunshine, Wael Hussein, a 24-year-old gay man, is chatting with Naya, a transgender woman, ahead of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOTB) on Thursday. Behind the two is a bookcase filled with donated titles, including Les Amantes by French lesbian writer Jocelyne François. “This is my other home, I consider people here as my family,” says Wael. “Many come to find friends – outside, they find it difficult to be accepted.” Compared with other countries in the Middle East, such as Iran where homosexuality is punishable by death, Lebanon has a relatively thriving LGBT community. During a recent dinner at Em Nazih, a trendy cafe in Beirut’s Gemmayze district, stereos blared the indie rock band Mashrou’ Leila, whose frontman is Muslim and openly gay. But life is not without its hazards. On Wednesday Hadi Damien, the organiser of Beirut Pride, the only event of its kind in the Arab world, announced the festival had been suspended after authorities interrogated him and threatened him with prosecution. A roster of events that would have featured poetry readings, a storytelling night and a talk on sexual health had been cancelled, he said. For those still facing discrimination, obstruction, and even violence, Helem is a lifeline. “I’ve been coming here for a year now. I’m alone and I come here to talk to people,” says Suzy, a 41-year-old trans woman with a bruised left eye sitting on the organisation’s balcony. “Two weeks ago, I was in the disco. Two people riding on a motorbike stopped and punched me in the eye, stole my bag, money and my phone.” Wael joined Helem (which means “dream” in Arabic) two and half years ago as a volunteer before becoming one of only three paid staff seven months ago. He is a case worker, dealing mainly with those who have fallen foul of Lebanon’s infamous article 534, which criminalises “unnatural sexual acts”. In his bag he now carries a mobile phone that serves as a 24-hour emergency hotline. But the work is not all about crises. Wael also runs makeup workshops. “Some people have just found out about their gender identity, and they are intrigued to use makeup to intensify it, like trans women,” he says. “It makes me smile. When they see themselves in the mirror, their eyes start shining and what they can see in the mirror, they feel this person looks much more like the way they see themselves.” Helem was set up as an underground movement nearly 20 years ago and, despite never having received official registration by the authorities, has clung to life. The authorities neither rejected nor approved the request, said Genwa Samhat, Helem’s executive director, in a sign that meant “‘we won’t reject you but we will make your work really hard that you’d eventually stop’. But on the contrary we just kept on working.” Since then Helem’s reputation has spread beyond Lebanon throughout the Arab world and several similar organisations have been set up, including the NGO Shams in Tunisia, fighting for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Afsaneh Rigot of British human rights group Article 19 said Helem was “an important and necessary LGBTQ oasis in the Middle East and North Africa region” and “a refuge for some of the most marginalised people in Lebanon”. But progress has not been straightforward. When Samhat, 31, joined four years ago, the organisation was almost moribund. Her arrival coincided with a Lebanese security forces raid on a local bathhouse, the Hammam al-Agha, which resulted in the arrests of 36 people. “When I joined, it was a trial to see if things would work again or not. Helem had lost its community centre, its offices, all of its funds. It had zero dollars in its bank account,” says Samhat. “It felt impossible at one point to get this going again, but with the Hammam Agha raid it was my first incident with such an arrest file … and it was a major push to try to do something about it.” Most of the people rounded up in the raid were sent to the Hbeish detention centre, and Helem’s ensuing work highlighted torture there. Such physical mistreatment appears now to have stopped. Today, at least 17 people are detained in Hbeish, mostly transgender people. “Trans people face the most discrimination – they’re visible,” Samhat said. “They were mostly arresting trans women who never ever got the opportunity to find a job, who were kicked out of their family houses, they were homeless for a long period of time, who actually dropped out of school because they were bullied at some point. We believe in personal freedoms and if people choose to be sex workers, it’s their right and we will defend them, but we do have to realise a lot of people do it out of survival reasons.” Naya, 21, heads Helem’s seven-member trans committee and says it is serving as an umbrella that makes people like her “feel stronger and let us make things we couldn’t do before – like offering hormones”. The organisation also provides more essential help. Aside from the study, there are places to sleep, a bathroom and a kitchen with basic appliances – a fridge, a gas stove and a washing machine. Its sister organisation, the sexual health clinic Marsa, provides free HIV tests, and charges $100 (£74) for comprehensive screening including for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Nearly 260 people visit Marsa each month – of whom two or three on average test positive for HIV. “A lot of people don’t seek medical assistance, because they can’t tell doctors [about their sexual orientation]. If they look effeminate, they’d get humiliated, kicked out of hospital,” says Diana Abou Abbas, 36, who runs Marsa. “Marsa is a safe place, free of judgment and discrimination, people can talk about their practices without worrying that they would be judged.” Back at Helem, Joseph Aoun, 33, is busy working on Helem’s campaigning week before IDAHOTB. He used to be the manager of Bardo, Beirut’s most famous gay bar, before joining Helem, an experience he says has opened his eyes to the discrimination faced by those from deprived social backgrounds. “It’s a constant struggle against the odds,” he says. “You have a lot of frustration but when you look back you see you’re impacting people’s lives and this is beautiful.” This year, IDAHOTB coincides with Ramadan, and Dana Darwish, a transgender lesbian, plans to go to Helem for iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily fast during the holy month. “Islam is the religion of peace,” said the 31-year-old. “Helem makes iftar every week and it’s a wonderful feeling that this year Ramadan falls on the same day as IDAHOTB.”",

    "date": "2018-05-17",
    "transcript": "It seems a straightforward offer: swap your resident’s parking permit for a bit of greenery in the freed-up space, a lawn, a sun terrace or somewhere for the children to play. However, if any further proof was needed of the west’s destructive love affair with the car, the furious reaction to a pilot project in one of the Netherlands’ biggest cities has been all too telling. Streets have been divided, angry complaints made and Walter Dresscher, the organiser of the council-backed scheme in The Hague, given what he admits was a verbal going-over during a fiery public meeting. However, Dresscher’s determination remains undimmed: “We can’t go on like this. This has been a great success already because people are thinking.” The drama was sparked by the Dutch municipality’s proposal to residents in six streets in Segbroek, a suburb in the west of the city, to voluntarily swap their parking permit for six months and replace it with something green and pleasant on their street. Their vehicles would be stored in a car park for free, and those participating could choose between themselves how to use the vacant space. The long-term aim, beyond greening the city, is to encourage people to use car-sharing schemes, if they really need a vehicle, or switch to public transport and bicycles. Globally, most cars are said to be parked 95% of the time. Dresscher, an architect by training, said opposition from many residents in the selected areas illustrated how deeply people were attached to their cars, even in the Netherlands, which is often a pioneer in terms of green transportation. The idea of a parking space being lost from a street was too much for some to bear. “I was a bit like a boxing guy, I took everything,” he said of the public meeting attended by 200 residents. “If I was to respond, like I would in a personal conversation, the meeting would not have finished very well ... Everybody took – and this in the Netherlands is more rare than in other countries – very opposite positions. Normally, we are a country where we have a dialogue, we talk to each other. “The idea was to get people together but it didn’t. Why? If there is one that is very angry and starts mobilising the whole street then you have a problem. “But if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But physically a car is getting out of the street. Nobody is losing anything.” Dresscher insisted the initial hostility has abated but, as yet, only six householders have signed up to the scheme, with their cars due to be removed in June. Two residents have, however, pre-empted the scheme by putting flower-filled tow-carts in front of their homes, much to the irritation of some. Drivers have been known to shout abuse as they drive by. Dresscher, who has €60,000 of funding from the council and charities, is still confident that more people will come round to his thinking, and is glad that a debate has been started. Rembrant Frerichs, 40, and, Wolfert Brederode, 44, both pianists, and neighbours on Newtonstreet, said they believed it was an important first step in changing the nature of their road, but were yet to decide how to use the space in front of their homes. Brederode said: “I just don’t think I need the car outside my house all the time and I’m going to see if we need it at all. I don’t think there is any reason. “People have this belief that they have a right to have a car, a right to have a parking space. A car is like a second home to people but it isn’t rational.” Dresscher said the project had been inspired by the experience of being forced to push his baby’s pram on the road when living in Amsterdam because cars were blocking the pavement. “I looked at these cars and there were actually plants growing under them. They hadn’t moved for three or four weeks. I started thinking: does anyone know how many cars are used or not?” Dresscher’s response from the Amsterdam municipality suggested that 25% of those cars used by residents were only driven once a week on average. Around 60% used their cars less due to fears that they would lose their parking place. “This is a completely ridiculous situation,” he said. “I want to get rid of unused cars. The municipalities of Netherlands cannot keep going like this. One day they will come and take away that right, I am sure about that. But this is chance for people to change their behaviour themselves.” A spokesman for The Hague municipality said: “People get the opportunity to choose themselves what they want to do with the public space. They can park their cars in the street or start sharing cars and fill up the free parking spots for other purposes like green, bicycle parking or picnic tables. “We want to see the effect of this approach. Will this bottom-up approach work, where people get a direct effect of their choice to get rid of their car, or is it still necessary to make top-down policy to manage the amount of parked cars in public spaces? It’s a project that, when it succeeds, can easily be scaled up to other streets and neighbourhoods. We think that’s why this pilot is worth funding.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "date": "2018-05-12",
    "transcript": "When Abu Bakr al-Rabeeah and his family arrived from Syria to the Canadian city of Edmonton, his to-do list was dauntingly long: English lessons, learning how to cope with the long, bitterly cold winters and how to best get around his strange new home. But the teenager had a secret dream, which he confided to a teacher. One day he would tell his story, challenging those who saw his family only as refugees, defined by the war they had survived. Eight months later, he became a published author. His book, Homes: A Refugee Story, is set to be officially released on Saturday 12 May by a Calgary book publisher, after being self-published last year. “It’s unbelievable, to be honest,” says Abu Bakr, 17. “I can’t believe it.” The book captures his experience of growing up in the Middle East. He was nine when his family moved from Iraq to Syria to escape escalating tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims. A year later civil war broke out in Syria, punctuating memories of being surrounded by family and playing video games with the horror of car bombings, attacks on schools and late-night explosions. “I really want people to know about what’s happening back home,” says Abu Bakr. “Not just about the war, we also had some good times with family and friends. Even in the hard times we had some good memories.” He wrote the book with Winnie Yeung, the schoolteacher with whom he first shared his dream. Initially they planned a short presentation for his peers. “I could tell he was feeling quite alienated,” says Yeung. “He was saying that his fellow classmates really had no idea where Syria is, or what’s going on in the Middle East. They were asking him: ‘Do you have chairs in classrooms there?’” With permission from his parents, the pair got to work. Using the few English words he knew at the time, he began sharing all he could remember of his childhood. Yeung soon realised that their project was bigger than a class presentation. “I wanted to write it out as a story, so that I could put it in his hands and say: ‘This is your life, you can move on from this,’” she says. “This is part of a really important past and you should be proud for living this life and living it so well.” During lunch hours and after lessons, Yeung would frantically scribble notes as Abu Bakr recounted his childhood. Struggling to navigate the language barrier between them, they got creative. “There was a lot of charades and pantomiming,” says Yeung. “I got a lot of things wrong, we misunderstood each other quite a bit. It took so long to get the stories right.” Google Translate became their go-to app. They looked up events on YouTube and news websites, transporting Abu Bakr back to the streets of Homs through Google Earth’s street view. The two spent hours browsing through mobile phone photos, selfies and online images, trying to identify key details. “Especially with the weaponry, Abu Bakr didn’t know the English words, or even the Arabic,” she says. “So we would look at a bunch of different images online and then he would go: ‘This one.’ And I would learn what it’s called.” Yeung, who learned “the most basic” Arabic, also spent hours interviewing his family in order to contextualise his experience. Born and raised in Edmonton, the project became a crash course for her in conflict. “I barely even watch war movies,” she said. “Part of my late-night internet research would be: OK, how do soldiers carry the AK-47? What are the parts of that weapon? I found myself reading army field manuals.” At times the stories pouring out of Abu Bakr, a young man with an easy smile and warm laugh, left her in shock. The horrors of war were woven into the fabric of his childhood memories: flying homemade kites amid the rubble of destroyed buildings, playing with bullet casings he found on the street. “It was so matter of fact for him, so normal.” His story, she realised, was not just one of living through a war, but also of the deep bonds that sustained his family through their turbulent journey. For Abu Bakr, the book became an anchor as he worked to find his place in his new home, helping him improve his English and meet residents from across the city. He hopes the book will help keep attention on the crisis unfolding in the Middle East, offering a glimpse into the personal experience of one refugee at a time when the number of people fleeing war and persecution around the globe has reached record highs. “I really hope people will read my story and enjoy it,” he said. “And I hope they will get the main idea of it – how hard it is leaving home and how hard it is to live in a civil war.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "One of the obvious consequences of climate change is that our reservoirs of fresh water are running out. As global temperatures continue to rise, people around the globe will have to figure out how to manage with less water. This week we looked at how one city united to tackle its water crisis, and found other tales of people coming together and turning around bleak situations. When Cape Town announced it was rapidly approaching “Day Zero”, the moment it would turn off the water supply to a million homes due to drought, the news made headlines around the world. Four months on and the taps are still on – for now. Krista Mahr visited South Africa’s second city to find out how they did it, and what lessons can be learned by cities facing up to similar emergencies. There’s certainly no shortage of rain in the north of England, but austerity has taken a toll on community spirit there and villages and towns have fallen into disrepair. In Todmorden, residents got their hands dirty and found a solution. Naomi Larsson visited the tiny Yorkshire town from which a global movement has grown. In nearby Sheffield, Kate Lyons met some people tackling the taboo of adults with few friend when you’re an adult. Studies regularly tell us we’re feeling lonelier than ever, largely due to the decline of traditional meeting places such as churches, pubs and bricks-and-mortar workplaces. Could “speed mating” fill the gap? What we liked: Two great pieces in the New York Times caught our eye, the first on the rocks in Oman that could help save the planet, and the second on news that humpback whales near Antartica are having a baby boom. What we heard: My local community got permission to turn disused land surrounded by houses into a community garden. It started off very basic, with just some raised planting beds growing some veg. We’ve now got a poly tunnel, a brick pizza oven and barbecue and another bit of land just around the corner which we’ve planted as an apple and pear orchard. We get the local primary schools involved, and the local care home too. We grow far more food than we can eat ourselves so we hold public open days and donate excess to the local community centre, who distribute it to those who need it. Commenter Cade writing below the line on our piece about guerilla gardening It’s fantastic that they averted this, but surely one of the takeaways is that people are capable of living with less and moderating their habits if they understand the consequences – or if the consequences are severe enough. From golf courses in the middle of the desert in Phoenix to people watering their lawns at noon in Los Angeles to growing water-thirsty crops like alfalfa – why do we need to wait to start behaving more sensibly? Thomas1178 writing below the line on Cape Town’s comeback from water disaster Where was the upside? In Moscow, where the Street Child World Cup begins today involving more than 230 homeless and street-connected youth from 20 countries.

    "transcript": "A deep mist hangs over Todmorden on a chilly spring morning. Only the birdsong and a few daffodils give the sign of spring. This doesn’t seem to bother a group of 20 volunteers from the Yorkshire town who have gathered together armed with spades, trowels and litter pickers. Instructions of which patch to attack are distributed, while children as young as three are given high-vis jackets with the name Incredible Edible printed on the back. These are Todmorden’s radical gardeners, a group of food freedom fighters who’ve been planting in this town for a decade. It’s a simple idea: take over unused or unattractive bits of public land to plant food to feed the community. What is not so simple is where they’re doing it. Todmorden is an old mill town in Yorkshire’s Calderdale valley. It rains a lot, there’s not a lot of sun, and it has experienced major flooding in recent years. But still, the town’s residents continue to grow fruit and vegetables as best they can for locals to pick and eat. “We do say that if you can grow it in Todmorden, you can grow it anywhere,” says Estelle Brown, one of the founding members of Incredible Edible Todmorden (IET). This motto has turned out to be true beyond just growing food. Since a group of a dozen residents began gardening in March 2008, hundreds of people from around the UK and abroad have travelled here to see how the “Toddies” do it. The word spread through media coverage and IET committee members touring to give talks. They’ve had calls and visitors from New Zealand and Japan, to France and Germany, and there are now as many as 500 community food growing groups across the world using the Incredible Edible name. No one is trying to clone what Todmorden does but the model is adapted to suit different needs. “If you’re doing it for your community it’s got to be for your community,” says Brown. In Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the group supports farmers and street children, helping them get documentation and educating them about food. “Food autonomy and eating organically, that’s what inspired us,” Addico Charly of Incredible Edible Kinshasa writes by email. In France, the movement has taken root as Les Incroyables Comestibles, with 300 groups around the country. There are sister groups in Israel, Palestine, Colombia and Brazil – all growing food to share with others. The Toddies didn’t set out to start a food-growing revolution, they wanted to bring their small town together at a difficult time for communities throughout the UK. “Ten years ago it was the beginning of the worldwide economic decline, there was a lot of worry about climate change, but nothing was really happening,” says Mary Clear, chair of IET. “And in this town we were starting to see the squeeze on public services – there was more litter – and we thought, how can we do something that will create stronger communities?” Growing food was their answer. Clear, now 63 and retired, who previously worked in child protection, lowered one of the walls in her front garden, removing rose bushes to make a bed with herbs and signs saying “help yourself”. The group then turned their minds to the grass verges which seemed to only attract dog poo, and turned them into herb gardens too. IET now has approximately 70 sites around the town, from vegetable patches outside the police station to herb planters at the train station. Every first and third Sunday of the month, in rain, shine or snow, IET volunteers (of which there are an estimated 300 in the town of 16,000) get together for a morning of “guerilla gardening” as it has been dubbed. We walk down the canal, following children carrying litter pickers. Every so often they pause to pick up cigarette butts or chocolate wrappers. Incredible Edible is driven by the attitude that it’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission. Any IET signs nailed to walls around town were done without permission from the council, benches emblazoned with their logo were installed without asking. Even the beds outside the police station were put together and maintained without formal permission. “You can do nothing and obey the rules, or you can say ‘I’m going to make a difference regardless’. And, you know, the prisons are full. They’ve got enough on without getting a load of grannies for cleaning up,” says Clear. The Incredible Edibles say they’re inspired by Todmorden’s own history of activism. It was home to John Fielden who campaigned for the protection of child workers leading to the Ten Hour Act of 1847, reducing the hours for factory workers. “Todmorden is a unique place,” says Brown. “We call it ‘Odmorden’ as we’re all a bit odd.” Todmorden is still scarred by the memory of its declining industrial past. Buildings lie abandoned and decayed, almost 20% of residents are income deprived, and an estimated 28% of children in the town live in poverty. IET aims to be inclusive for people of all backgrounds. IET has brought an influx of people to the town. It’s perhaps the only place known for vegetable tourism. But local businesses are doing better as a result: a 2017 survey of residents found more than half of respondents (54%) buy local food at least once a week, compared with 41% of consumers across the UK. A 2013 study also found 57% had begun to grow their own food due to IET. But not everyone is happy with the work they have done. Talk in the local pub suggested it’s seen as a sign of outsiders coming in and changing something that isn’t theirs. In a survey of residents last year, some expressed concerns about gentrification and IET increasing the desirability of Todmorden. Volunteer John Rice, 53, has only been living in Todmorden for a few months. “There’s a few people here today who’ve got no money whatsoever, and they get stuff out of it. They enjoy it. I didn’t know poverty like that existed but it does, and it’s good for them, they feel like they belong to something. As I do, you belong to this movement.” Three volunteers with learning disabilities are sweeping up – they say they come to every gardening Sunday no matter what the weather. “It gets me out the house,” Stephen tells me. “They are nice people, and I like gardening.” Gardening done for the morning, we meet back at the church before lunch is served – locally sourced and free for anyone to eat. “Things have changed hugely in the past decade,” says Clear, her fingers still dirtied with soil. “But the real culture change is about kindness. There’s no need to be a victim in this trumped up shitty time. People doing stuff for each other, for their town, bringing a tiny bit of joy – that’s important. With each person contributing a tiny bit, you can do huge things.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "On a sunny afternoon in south London, a group of girls are training for a world cup in Russia. The ultimate goal for these players isn’t a trophy, however, but getting off the streets. The girls who will play in Moscow are doing this as a step towards changing their lives, which have been marked so far by school exclusion, deprivation and in some cases homelessness. The tournament, which starts on Fridaywill involve more than 230 homeless and street-connected youth from 20 countries. “Which team do I most want to meet? For me, it’s the Russians, because it’s their country and I want to see what it’s like,” says Kate, 16, who will play in midfield for the team, organised by homelessness charity Centrepoint. Like most of her teammates, Kate is a few weeks into Centrepoint Street Football Team England, a six-month programme to help socially excluded young people. She has not experienced homelessness herself, but was drifting without direction after being excluded five times from school. “It has really helped me, to focus on the football,” she says. “We want them to meet young people from around the world and get some knowledge of others’ situations, but we also want them to think about themselves: how did I get here, what have I overcome to be here? And to come home with some skills and inspiration from taking part in an international event,” says Jack Badu, sports operations and engagement officer at Centrepoint, who will take the girls to the tournament, called the Street Child World Cup. “It’s about aspiration.” Centrepoint partners with professional football clubs to support marginalised young people in its England squad and give them the chance to compete in international tournaments across the globe. The Street Child World Cup, held ahead of the FIFA World Cup, is one of four such tournaments; another is this year’s Homeless World Cup in Mexico. The girls will be competing against teams from countries including Brazil, India, Mauritius, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Zimbabwe. None of the squad of 42 have been been chosen solely due to their skills on the pitch, but because all of them have been participating in social inclusion programmes and proved their willingness to change their lives. Like Kate, Verona, 17, had been excluded from school several times before joining a college run by Arsenal FC that partners with Centrepoint. “I didn’t get along with my teachers and was always having arguments,” she says. “It’s only when I started going to Arsenal college that everything started to go uphill. This is an opportunity I couldn’t have imagined taking two or three years ago. At school all the teachers see you as just another person to tell off. Here, you’re an individual. “I have always played football, ever since I was nine or 10. I prefer to go to the Arsenal college and come here to train than just sit at home doing homework.” She hopes to be a physiotherapist when she is older. Over the six-month training period, the girls willtrain regularly at St George’s Park, home of the Football Association. At their most recent session, they were given the shirts they will wear in Russia. It was a proud moment, says Kate, who follows the England national women’s team and wants to work in the sport. They have also trained with Afghan footballer Khalida Popal, who fled the Taliban “because they told her it was a man’s sport and she couldn’t play, but she played for her country,” says Kate. In addition to helping develop their resilience, the girls’ Russian adventure has another dimension, says Badu: “We hope they will think about the issues that other young people face … that they’ll tell young people in Africa and elsewhere there are young people in the UK who care about them. From feeling that ‘no one supports me’, they’ll go to feeling they are part of a large community of young people from all over the world supporting each other.” The girls will return to London with £10,000 from the Vitol Foundation to effect social change in their communities. The team think they may spend it on a project to tackle knife violence or spaces for excluded young people to play sport amid cuts to youth services and rising youth homelessness. After the six-month development programme ends, Centrepoint will work to find them further opportunities such as coaching and mentoring. All the girls can take part in a player progression programme that involves mentoring next year’s England squad. Given British-Russian tensions in recent weeks, aren’t they a bit nervous? “We’ll take it all in our stride,” says Badu. “There is a lot of scaremongering but I think it’s great that the Russians want to support this tournament for street children.” “I am excited and nervous,” says Verona, “but nervous in a good way.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Olivia has no friends. Or at least she has no friends in Sheffield, where she moved nine months ago. She had spent the previous decade teaching in Cambridge but last July she and her husband moved north. And while Sheffield has provided a great job and an affordable home, one thing the notoriously friendly city has not provided is mates. “No one talks about the process of making friends at our age,” she says. Olivia has tried. She bonded with someone in her Zumba class, but weeks later the woman got a job in another city. Her job has not helped. “There aren’t a lot of people in my stage of life at work, and anyway, as a teacher you spend the whole day in a classroom full of teenagers.” And so Olivia is taking a proactive step – she is going speed mating. Billed as “Tinder for friends, but in real life” the initiative is the brainchild of Megan Griffith, co-founder of the arts collective Girl Gang. The Sheffield event is held at the Leadmill nightclub. About 40 people turn up, almost all of them women (men are welcome, says Griffith, but need to know they will be in the minority). They range in age from early 20s to mid 40s. On arrival everyone is given a sheet with spaces for names, email addresses and phone numbers. Olivia’s original goal for the evening was to get one person’s number. “But then I thought, maybe that’s unrealistic so I’ve lowered my expectations. I’ve just got to see it as having a fun evening, and even if it goes badly, at least it’ll make a good story in the staff room.” The “Speed Mate-ing” event begins with “person bingo”, then people pair up and ask quick-fire questions for five minutes. Next they pair up with someone else to ask “would you rather?” questions, and a third person for “snog, marry avoid”. Kerry Chase and Aimée White are paired up and quickly move on from talking about the suggested questions to chatting about White’s time living in Serbia. A newcomer to Sheffield, White bemoans how tricky it is to make friends as an adult. “It’s not like when you’re a kid,” she says. “You can’t just say: ‘Let’s go play’. It’s like: ‘I’m not being creepy, but I just want a friend.’ Yeah, that’s creepy.” For several hours people chat, debate current affairs in small groups, make outfits out of newspaper and participate in various “organised fun” activities, all the time sussing each other out as potential friend material. After the first event in Manchester in October 2016, Girl Gang has run a dozen speed mating nights across Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, and has had requests to start them up everywhere from York to Leamington Spa. However, they often sell more tickets than they have guests. Griffith says: “They’ve obviously booked a ticket thinking ‘I would really benefit from this event’, but then when it comes down to it, they can’t quite make themselves go.” Still, she thinks the event’s appeal comes from the fact that admitting to having no friends is taboo, so activities do not exist to help people build friendships. “I think romantic relationships get given a lot of airtime in society and friendship less so,” says Griffiths. “There are structures in place to meet somebody [romantically] ... which don’t seem to exist so much for friends.” A 2013 analysis of 277 peer-reviewed studies on social relationships found that the size of people’s friendship networks increased until young adulthood and then decreased steadily from that point, suggesting that making friends becomes, if not more difficult, then at least less common. This could be for many reasons, such as family, jobs and time, according to Rachel Boyd of the mental health charity Mind. “Friendship groups can become more established, so it can feel even harder to meet new people if they already have their own groups of friends.” Moving home can represents a particular challenge. “Certainly it can be really difficult if you’re in unfamiliar territory to know how to meet people,” Boyd says. The Jo Cox commission on loneliness found that 9 million Britons always or often feel lonely, largely due to the weakening of traditional community spaces, such as churches, trade unions, pubs and workplaces. “In the last few decades, loneliness has escalated from personal misfortune into a social epidemic,” the Labour MP and commission chair, Rachel Reeves, said in a speech in December. “More and more of us live alone. We work at home more. We spend a greater part of our day alone than we did 10 years ago. It sometimes feels like our best friend is the smartphone.” However, technology, while often being blamed for social disconnection and isolation, may also form part of the solution. Bumble, the dating app known for not allowing men to contact women first, launched Bumble BFF in 2015, allowing people to find potential friends, after users said they wanted to use the origninal app for that purpose. “Within six months [of launching Bumble], women in relationships or even people who had met someone on Bumble came to us and said: ‘I am moving across state or going to university and I don’t know anyone in that city. I don’t know anyone in that area ... you guys should think about launching something,’” says Louise Troen, international brand director for Bumble. But using an app or going to an event like speed mating to find friends is not without its stigma. Olivia is a pseudonym because she knows that if she used her real name and her students read this article “basically they would take the mick out of me”. When she told people she was going to a speed mating event, reactions were mixed. “I made a real effort to be vulnerable, so I told a few people I was doing this. Some people thought it was a bit weird, some people thought it was a great idea, others thought it was sad that I didn’t have friends, but then they offered to be friends with me,” she says, laughing. After the event, Olivia says she is exhausted: “I didn’t expect it to be so full-on.” “I felt like there were two groups – people who had gone with someone and were maybe approaching it as a fun chance to meet people, and people who I thought were in a similar position to me. “It’s also just reassuring to know I’m not the only person to feel like this. It’s not sad and it’s not pathetic, being 29 and not having friends in a new city.” Olivia has exceeded her goal for the evening, collecting three people’s numbers. The next day, she says she has been exchanging banter-filled texts and organised to go for a drink with one woman she met. A week later, she has had an offer to go to a comedy gig with a group, and a drink with someone else. “I’d say it’s absolutely been a success,” she says. “The other thing I’ve found is I’m more confident approaching people and suggesting meeting up. I think it’s given me a bit of a boost.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/04/back-from-the-brink-how-cape-town-cracked-its-water-crisis",
    "date": "2018-05-04",
    "transcript": "Late last year, as the South African government faced the prospect of its largest city running out of water, they took an unprecedented gamble. The government announced “day zero” – a moment when dam levels would be so low that they would turn off the taps in Cape Town and send people to communal water collection points. This apocalyptic notion prompted water stockpiling and panic, caused a drop in tourism bookings, and raised the spectre of civil unrest. It also worked. After years of trying to convince residents to conserve, the aggressive campaign jolted people into action. Water use was (and still is) restricted to 50 litres per person per day. (In 2016, average daily per capita use in California was 321 litres.) Households that exceed the limit face hefty fines, or having a meter installed in their home that shuts off their water once they go over. Capetonians started showering standing over buckets to catch and re-use that water, recycling washing machine water, and limiting loo flushes to once a day. “It was the most talked about thing in Cape Town for months when it needed to be,” says Priya Reddy, the city’s communication director. “It was not a pretty solution, but it was not a pretty problem.” Cape Town’s water use dropped from 600m litres per day in mid 2017 to 507m litres per day at the end of April. That’s still short of the 450m the city should be using, but Reddy says it couldn’t have been achieved otherwise. “We really did need to make it alarming enough, otherwise day zero would have happened.” “The day zero campaign made us all think twice about water,” says Sue Fox, after collecting several litres of drinking water for her household from a natural spring in Newlands, an upmarket Cape Town enclave. “We’ll never, ever, ever take water for granted again.” As global temperatures continue to rise, cities around the world will have to figure out how to do more with less water. The Western Cape’s multi-pronged response to its water crisis – from farming innovations to reducing urban water use to diversifying water supply sources – could serve as a blueprint for cities that find themselves, like Cape Town, looking at near-empty dams. “We have pushed the limits far more than most other cities,” says Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson, who is in charge of the city’s water crisis response. “Millions of people have responded – literally millions.” But it’s not all positive stories of innovation, responsibility and altruism. Farmers in the drought-affected area have had to abandon as much as a quarter of their crops, by some estimates, and tens of thousands of agricultural jobs have been lost in the fray. “This is the one that makes me the most depressed,” says Derick van Zyl pointing to a long row of parched trees in his apple orchard. These trees on the Esperanto Farm produce Pink Lady apples, a coveted variety exported thousands of miles to the UK and Europe. They haven’t been watered in months. Esperanto is one of hundreds of fruit farms in South Africa’s Western Cape province that has had to get creative to cope with the drought. Despite Esperanto’s dams being at 28% capacity as of last October, most of its orchards have been luckier than these bedraggled Pink Ladys, thanks to water-saving hacks like night-time irrigation, mulching and concentrating water around the trees’ roots systems. Production is down, but not as much as it could be. Finding ways to farm with less water is the new normal, Van Zyl says. Even if the Western Cape’s drought ends with the upcoming rainy season – and that’s a big if – climate change means warmer temperatures are on the way, he says. “There isn’t going to be more water. We’ll have to make do with what we’ve got.” The combination of measures appears to have averted water armageddon - for now. The City has pushed back the day zero date to 2019. The move met with a heady mix of relief and exasperation. People wondered whether it had been a hoax, or an attempt for the city to make money off higher water fines. The city has also faced criticism that it allowed political turmoil within City Hall – Mayor Patricia De Lille has been under fire for months – to slow down its response to the water crisis. Neilson, the deputy mayor, says the decision to call off day zero came down to transparency. “It was about being honest with the public,” Neilson says. “People would quickly call us out if we didn’t tell the truth. Our credibility would be lost.” Now the city is charged with the onerous task of making sure residents don’t slip back into their old habits. Though day zero is out of the immediate picture, the major dams that supply water to the Western Cape are still only about 20% full. If the rains don’t show up during the South African winter, day zero could still happen. By then, however, the city hopes to boost the city’s water supply through methods that don’t rely on rainfall, like repairing water delivery infrastructure, drilling boreholes to access groundwater, desalination, and water re-use. A lot of ideas about how to bring more water to Cape Town have come past Neilson’s desk, including cloud seeding, harvesting water from the air and even towing a 100-million-tonne iceberg from Antarctica. “When somebody first tells you about it, you think it’s a crazy idea,” says Nick Sloane, a ship salvager who has been pitching the idea of the iceberg plan. “But the more you learn about it, it’s like, ‘Why not?” Just telling an entire city no one can ever take a bath again, Sloane says, is the “wrong answer.” Others would like to see the city look for long-term solutions closer to home. Christine Colvin, a water expert with the World Wildlife Fund, has been pushing the government to eliminate thirsty invasive species like pine, eucalyptus and wattle, which deplete dam reserves. By clearing non-native plants that are sucking up 38 million cubic metres of precious water each year, Colvin says Cape Town could be getting 7% more water annually. WWF has been saying this for awhile, but when the dams were full, nobody was listening. “There wasn’t really a case for it,” Colvin says. “Now, our dams are running dry.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/02/offshore-secrecy-inside-the-movement-to-crack-it-open",
    "date": "2018-05-02",
    "transcript": "When British MPs moved this week to force Britain’s Overseas Territories to abolish corporate secrecy by the end of the decade, it was a big moment for anti-corruption campaigners everywhere. But for one group working towards building a vast, open, global register of who owns what, it was just the beginning. Open Ownership was created in late 2016 by seven anti-corruption organisations. Although it is small and not-for-profit, it has large ambitions: it wants to open up the murky world of offshore havens to scrutiny, so that individuals can no longer hide ill-gotten wealth behind inscrutable facades of clandestine jurisdictions. “Every jurisdiction that commits to openly publishing beneficial ownership information brings us closer to our goal of creating a truly global, open register,” said Zosia Sztykowski, Open Ownership’s project lead. “The more data we can link, the fewer places there are left for money launderers to hide.” There can be legitimate reasons to use offshore jurisdictions. But kleptocracy – egregious and globalised grand corruption – is enabled by anonymous companies, which strip the fingerprints off stolen money and, having done so, hide it under the cover of supposedly respectable corporations. Once all traces of the money’s origin have been removed, the thieves can spend it on New York property, European passports or western politicians, and they do it in vast quantities. Global Financial Integrity estimates illicit financial flows were well over $1.1tn in 2013, and the total is growing fast. Many of these companies came from the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla and the other pink dots left on the map of the world, which is why Tuesday’s vote in parliament was so celebrated. But in order for openness to become truly useful, Sztykowski says, data needs to be pooled so that investigators – police, journalists, anti-fraud teams – can literally follow the money across borders. If an individual has hidden his ownership of an asset behind a chain of companies, each registered in a different country, then officers require cooperation from counterparts all over the world just to discover who owns something. Often this takes so long that the criminal has escaped before the task can be completed; other times, the information can’t be obtained at all. “Our intention is not just to open up the data, to make it accessible, but also to make it usable and used,” said Sztykowski. Her team (which is funded by the UK’s Department for International Development) has created a standardised format for registries to follow so that when they do publish ownership data they will be consistent with each other, and their data can be automatically compared with information that is already public. So far only a handful of countries are properly on board. The UK, Denmark, Slovakia and Ukraine have already implemented beneficial ownership, though Denmark is not yet integrated with the Open Ownership system. In addition, members of the European Union, as well as a handful of countries elsewhere, have promised to join up. The hope is that British overseas territories will be forced to follow suit by 2020. By having one central database, Open Ownership hopes the data will be searchable, creating something greater than the sum of the parts. “I am always hesitant to talk about a magic bullet for a problem as huge as kleptocracy and corruption, but we know that shell companies are used en masse in grand corruption cases,” said Nienke Palstra, a researcher from Global Witness who specialises in cracking open anonymous companies. “No doubt as they become more transparent there will be new innovative ways that kleptocrats and others find to launder their money, but it would be a huge step towards addressing that problem. “Having a global beneficial ownership registry where all countries make public the beneficial ownership of companies in their jurisdiction, that would be a massive improvement and a big step towards solving the problem of shell companies and money laundering.” Data about Danish companies will be added to the Open Ownership database next, followed by the ownership information for companies that have bid for high-value World Bank contracts, and information from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a group of countries committed to improving governance in the resources sector. Sztykowski said she was in talks with authorities in Nigeria, Kyrgyzstan and other countries, which is all very well, but still means that – Britain apart - the registry lacked any of the really important global databases. This is why parliament’s decision to force Britain’s remaining colonies to adopt corporate transparency is so significant. Companies from the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Anguilla, Gibraltar and Bermuda have been involved in some of the most egregious corporate profit shifting, tax-dodging and money-laundering schemes ever discovered, and now those companies’ owners will be visible to everyone. With these registries added to those of the UK and the other European countries, we will begin to approach a time when, if real-life McMafia villains slip their billions from country to country to evade detection, we will be able to follow them. The addition of the 400,000 companies from the British Virgin Islands alone could be a revelation of greater consequence than even the Panama Papers, to which can be added the secrets of Gibraltar, Cayman, Anguilla and elsewhere. Of course, dozens of jurisdictions will still sell secrecy – Delaware, Panama, Nevis, the Seychelles, etc – but the more that do join Open Ownership’s database, the more abnormal the holdouts will appear. “We want to see a world where anonymous company ownership just doesn’t exist anymore, where it’s completely normal for anyone to be able to access ownership information, that this information is expected by potential business partners, banks, procurement agencies and so on, and entities that don’t reveal their beneficial owners are subject to intense scrutiny, denied access to finance, public procurement and other business opportunities,” said Sztykowski. Last week it looked like a dream. This week, it begins to look possible. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-05-02",
    "transcript": "“Attention ladies and gentlemen, come closer! The circus – and your favourite radio show – is about to start,” says a French-Canadian veteran journalist in French. He turns to his co-host, a Syrian storyteller, who repeats the words into her microphone, this time in Arabic. In the tiny downtown studio of a student radio station in Montreal, Bernard Derome and Marya Zarif are recording a radio show for Syrian refugee children. Launched in 2017 with the support of the Canadian Commission for Unesco, Radio-Dodo, or Sleepytime-Radio, has already broadcast 37 episodes online and through Radio-Rozana, a Syrian radio station based in Paris. The weekly bilingual show mixes stories, songs and segments about everything from tying your shoelaces to why your milk teeth fall out. The aim is to help Syrian refugee children around the world forget about their worries and fall asleep at night. The woman behind the show is Brigitte Alepin, a French-Canadian tax expert whose Syrian grandfather immigrated to Canada in the early 20th century. When the Syrian war erupted in 2011, Alepin said she felt shocked and helpless; only a few years earlier, she had visited her grandfather’s hometown of Aleppo with her young son. Throughout the trip he had played with local children; now, she couldn’t help wondering about them. “I asked myself, how is it that life makes it possible for my boy – who had been in Aleppo – now to be safe at home in Quebec?” she said. “I told myself I would never be able to feel good about myself again if I didn’t find a way to help.” For a while, Alepin wondered how she could help Syrian refugees half a world away, but as she discussed the problem with a friend, an idea formed: radio waves could cross borders and reach an audience anywhere around the world. “We were talking and a little while later, I had an intuition: I would try to make a radio show for children,” said Alepin. She gathered a small team of Syrian, Algerian and Canadian volunteers to help her organize the show, find content and sign up storytellers. Prominent Canadian writers including Kim Thuy and Wajdi Mouawad, and former Canadian Olympic athlete Marie-Ève Marleau have appeared on the show to read stories or discuss their jobs. Most of the audience is in Turkey and Quebec. One regular listener is Rahaf, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee from Damascus who came to Montreal in 2016 with her two brothers and their parents. Rahaf uses her brother’s laptop to listen to the show as she falls asleep; her favourite story so far was about a dog taking the bus by himself. “I just listen on my bed and I sing along,” she said in French, her new language. Rahaf’s mother, Basma – who asked for the family’s surname to be withheld – said that her husband and sons escaped to Jordan first. But when Basma and Rahaf attempted to follow, they were arrested and jailed for 18 months. After being released, she and her siblings lived in a refugee camp in Jordan for three years; conditions were harsh, and there was no chance for the children to go to school. Now Rahaf is getting used to her new life, going to school during the day and playing at home. “I like telling myself stories and when I have a new book, I read it to myself,” she said. Alepin says she wants to continue spreading love and joy to refugee children and plans to further expand her project. She has recently found a partner radio station in Mali to broadcast her show to children in the French-speaking country, and hopes that eventually Radio-Dodo can become a global radio show for child refugees around the world.

    "title": "Can VR teach us how to deal with sexual harassment?",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/01/sexual-assault-training-program-vantage-point-virtual-reality-video-games",
    "date": "2018-05-01",
    "transcript": "Through the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, I find myself in an industrial, light-strewn office space – a far cry from the windowless basement office I’m sitting in. There are four “co-workers” with me – a woman, Rachel, and three guys – talking about an upcoming conference in Las Vegas. The conversation takes a locker room turn, with the men joking about afterparties, vodka and Jacuzzis. Rachel tries to bring the conversation back to her presentation. Suddenly the boss grabs her arm and says: “Rachel, one very important note. Remember it’s a party, pack something … fitting.” Rachel snatches her arm back and is noticeably uncomfortable. Suddenly, I receive a text message from my co-worker Chris on a virtual cellphone I’m holding (actually the VR controller). He’s noticed Rachel’s discomfort and asks: “So that just happened. Should we say something?” This scenario is part of a corporate sexual harassment training program called Vantage Point, created by the entrepreneur Morgan Mercer, a two-time survivor of sexual violence. It uses the immersive properties of VR to place people directly into scenes that illustrate the subtleties of grooming, harassment and discrimination in a visceral and interactive way. At a time of #MeToo, Mercer is hoping human resources departments will stop seeing sexual harassment training as a box-ticking exercise and start seeking real results. Research indicates that people who go through virtual reality training – as opposed to videos, PowerPoint or in-person seminars – retain significantly more information. “We want to make it as immersive as possible – because the closer you can get to actual embodiment of the character, the more likely your response will reflect what you would do in a real-life situation,” Mercer said. In the case of the aforementioned “should we say something?” question, there were four possible responses to choose from. The answers are ranked from best to worst, with the best answer being “We should ask how she’d like to handle it”, followed by “We should report this to HR”. Depending on how you respond to the multiple-choice questions sent via text, the narrative branches in different directions – either escalating or de-escalating. Repeated wrong answers are met with “empathy training” in the form of a phone call where Mercer explains where you slipped up. The training program – designed for both men and women – covers three “modules”: bystander intervention (which I did), identification of sexual harassment and learning to respond to harassment when it happens to you. “We’re trying to teach communal accountability. It’s not enough to say: ‘I didn’t sexually harass anyone; my hands are clean,’” Mercer said. “If you see it, speak out. Either to the person doing it or the receiver of inappropriate attention.” Mercer wants Vantage Point’s VR training to become the gold standard for companies and is drawing on scientific research to develop best practice guidelines. There are no existing standards – the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sets regulations, but only three states in the US require any sexual harassment training. Vantage Point is currently carrying out pilot research with the first “bystander” module with the fintech startup Tala and the payroll platform Justworks, with plans to roll out the service by the end of the year. In Chicago, gaming is used to start conversations with young people In the hopes of changing attitudes and behaviors that allow sexual misconduct to happen in wider society, others, from health professionals to indie game designers, are turning to another immersive technology – video games. “When we first started talking about games and sexual assault, it just doesn’t sound right on the ear, but having this interactive space where you can explore an issue that’s slightly outside of yourself is really helpful,” said Melissa Gilliam, an adolescent obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Chicago. Gilliam has found video games can be a much-needed catalyst for conversations about these tough issues through work with her team at the Center for Interdisciplinary Inquiry and Innovation in Sexual and Reproductive Health (Ci3), which she founded to study sexual and reproductive health problems, especially in underrepresented communities. The center’s Game Changer Chicago Design Lab (GCC) is currently researching the efficacy of Bystander, a comic book-style game in which teenage players encounter four episodes of harassment and assault, including teachers making inappropriate comments and feeling pressured to have sex with your partner. Throughout the game, rape myths – such as: “I’m not the type of person this happens to” – are presented, and players must decide how to respond. There is no penalty for players who make the wrong choice in a given situation. They are simply retaught earlier lessons. The episode outlines were developed through discussions with youth advisers, who also ensured the adult game designers accurately captured teen language. “We saw where young people took it and they often were telling stories and events from their lives, and they said you finally gave us the space that enabled us to have these conversations,” said Gilliam. “It was almost as if the young people drove us to yes, you can deal with these issues in this context in this medium.” The game was first implemented in two 12th-grade classrooms in November 2016. Of the 46 students who participated in the study, 97.6% found the game presented valuable information, which 60% said was personally relevant, according to the pilot study. Researchers are analyzing data from the most recent implementation round, which brought the game to 1,000 students aged 14 to 18. Efforts to teach sexual assault and harassment prevention through games have largely been aimed at university students or as therapeutic tools for victims. The University of Chicago team said its early research showed these interventions should be starting at an earlier age. “When we talk about intervening at the college age, we have to seriously consider that we’re perhaps four years or more too late,” said Jennifer Rowley, who oversaw implementation of Bystander at four Chicago high schools in the summer of 2017. While students were initially skeptical about Bystander, Rowley said it quickly provided an opportunity for the teenagers to discuss sensitive issues for the first time, such as how they define consent. Rowley said it was also clear these things had been on their minds before. “We saw 14-year-olds who had very formed opinions about sexual violence and harassment and what was appropriate and what wasn’t and who is to blame and who wasn’t,” Rowley said. The four-day curriculum began with lessons by violence prevention educators and counselors from the Young Women’s Christian Association of Metropolitan Chicago (YWCA), who were also available to students who disclosed incidents of sexual harassment or assault. These educators complimented lessons taught in the game, which is named after the bystander approach, a method of sexual harassment and assault prevention which gives the community, not just the victims, a role in preventing this behavior. “Sexual harassment is a large enough cultural problem that we need a broad suite of interventions to tackle it in the coming years,” said Patrick Jagoda, who co-founded GCC with Gilliam and is a professor at the university’s English and cinema schools. “So for me, something like the bystander approach is a piece of a larger cultural puzzle. We’re not claiming the four episodes in the game are covering every topic in sexual violence and sexual harassment.” The extensive research and development of the GCC stands in contrast to a smaller scale effort to capture sexual assault in a game by Nina Freeman, an indie game designer based in Seattle. Freeman was a graduate student when in March 2015 she published a semi-autobiographical game about sexual assault, Freshman Year. “This is my story and I hope it can inspire people to tell their stories if that’s empowering for them,” Freeman told the Guardian. The game’s format is typical of her work – artistic vignettes loosely depicting personal experiences. The game takes only a few minutes to play, but in that short time, the eerie music and lush colors transport the player past their computer screen into the shoes of a college student whose fun conversation with a friend turns dark. With the help of two collaborators, Freeman evokes an atmosphere that is surreal yet anchored by concrete details. The most concrete being that no matter what decision the player makes in the game, which is still available to play online, the result is the same. Freeman said she received almost universal positive feedback to Freshman Year, but emphasized she was trying to capture a personal experience and does not intend for the game to be a grand statement about sexual assault. “I know every woman’s experience is different depending on race and class and everything, and this is very specific to me,” Freeman said. “It’s not supposed to be an everywoman story.”",

    "transcript": "This week, The Upside has been focused on hopeful news about the environment, which will be a welcome reprieve for anyone who read Mayer Hillman’s interview in the Guardian in which he concluded that climate change meant “we’re doomed”. As part of the Arctic Dispatches series, reporting from Alaska, Oliver Milman asked whether the catastrophic melting of Arctic ice could be reversed using an unlikely substance – sand. It’s a compelling read that explores unusual ways technology and creative thinking could be employed to slow the effects of climate change. Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels. It’s a good idea, but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing. Steven Desch, lead physicist Last week it was announced that the British government would consider a ban on cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics, following the success of the 5p plastic bag charge. But compared to the plastic bag ban introduced in Kenya last year – which threatens up to four years’ imprisonment and fines of up to $40,000 (£31,000) for anyone producing, selling or even carrying a plastic bag – Britain’s actions look like child’s play. Jonathan Watts has been in Nairobi and writes about the impact of the Kenyan ban eight months after it was introduced. Winners of the Goldman environmental prize were announced this week, celebrating six remarkable success stories – five of them driven by women – of individuals or groups who have taken on powerful vested interests. Among the winners were Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid, who took on Jacob Zuma and Vladmir Putin in a legal challenge over nuclear power and won, and Claire Nouvian, a journalist turned activist who, inspired by the vampire squid, is fighting for less destructive fishing practices. What we liked This article in the Christian Science Monitor about teenage girls in rural India who got sick of waiting for the adults to fix things and took over their town. Among their successes so far: getting a library and bus stop in their community. What we heard One of the side effects of the introduction of the plastic bag is that it killed off centuries-old crafts all over the world. When I was growing up in Somaliland, every mother (or servant, for the rich) took these beautiful baskets made of wicker-like material to markets every morning. The baskets were reusable and handwoven exclusively by women who made a decent living from their craft. And then one-time-use plastic came. The art of basket-weaving died off. I don’t think there is a single skilled basket-weaver left in Somaliland today. SomlanderBrit, commenting below the line on our Kenyan plastic bag story Where was the upside?

    "transcript": "Waterways are clearer, the food chain is less contaminated with plastic – and there are fewer “flying toilets”. A year after Kenya announced the world’s toughest ban on plastic bags, and eight months after it was introduced, the authorities are claiming victory – so much so that other east African nations Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and South Sudan are considering following suit. But it is equally clear that there have been significant knock-on effects on businesses, consumers and even jobs as a result of removing a once-ubiquitous feature of Kenyan life. “Our streets are generally cleaner which has brought with it a general ‘feel-good’ factor,” said David Ong’are, the enforcement director of the National Environment Management Authority. “You no longer see carrier bags flying around when its windy. Waterways are less obstructed. Fishermen on the coast and Lake Victoria are seeing few bags entangled in their nets.” Ong’are said abattoirs used to find plastic in the guts of roughly three out of every 10 animals taken to slaughter. This has gone down to one. The government is now conducting a proper analysis to measure the overall effect of the measure. The draconian ban came in on 28 August 2017, threatening up to four years’ imprisonment or fines of $40,000 (£31,000) for anyone producing, selling – or even just carrying – a plastic bag. In Nairobi’s shanty towns, one immediate impact was on the practice of defecating in a plastic bag, tying it up and then throwing it on to the tin roofs, a convenience known as “flying toilets”. “I don’t know when the flying toilets started, but they are not good,” says Johnson Kaunange, a wheelchair user. “You never know where they are going to land or where they will fall when it rains. My wheelchair often rolls over the bags and splits them, and then the stink on the wheels is disgusting.” In the Mathare community, this is good news. Since the ban was introduced, many more people are using a communal toilet, which charges 5 Kenyan shillings (4p) for single use or 100 shillings for a month-long family pass. The facility is on the bustling thoroughfare leading down into Mathare valley. One of the administrators Caleb Omondi said he has already noticed a difference now that flying toilets are effectively prohibited. “The number of users is now much higher. We used to get about 300 people a day. Now it’s over 400,” he said. “I’m overjoyed. This is making the community cleaner and we get more income.” In broader society, the ban appears to be working, albeit imperfectly. Among the hundreds of people who walk the street, there are only two who are carrying or selling plastic bags. Elijia, who preferred not to give his family name, is a young man who says he has to use a plastic bag to carry his beloved khat because it keeps the moisture far more effectively than a paper bag. “I’m worried about the police, of course, but I’m not a bad person,” he says. The other is Esther, a stallholder who sells fried chips for 20 shillings (15p) a bag. She sighs when the subject is mentioned. A clutch of red, orange and green biodegradable fibre bags pinned to the wall behind her show her efforts to meet the conditions of the ban, but it is clearly eating into already slim margins. The new bags are six times more expensive than plastic. Customers refuse to pay extra and there are no subsidies from the government so she has to swallow the extra cost. “My business is badly affected,” she complained. “I’m not against a plastic ban, but there should be a cheap alternative.” Of course, any indiction has to come with enforcement, and this has not always been pretty. In the eight months since the ban was introduced, local media have charted the crackdown on “plastic bag dealers.” In February, more than 50 people were arrested in raids in Mombasa, Kisii, Keroka and Bomet. Authorities also shut down Nairobi’s Burma market for widespread noncompliance. In Mathare, a group of slums home to half a million people, one local trader, nicknamed Onya, was arrested after police caught him using plastic bags to sell chicken heads. The judge fined him 15,000 shillings (£110), much lower than the maximum penalty but equivalent to six weeks’ work. “That seems harsh for a new law,” said one of his customers. Other stallholders are asking their customers to bring plastic bowls or traditional bags made from sisal fibre. This has led to complaints. The bowls spill easily. The sisal bags are expensive because the plants, which were once common, have been replaced by cash crops. There has been push-back. On 1 March, the manufacturer, Hi-Plast filed a lawsuit against the government for compensation and argued the ban has been selectively implemented. In Kenya as a whole, the prohibition on plastic bags has caused headaches for retailers and manufacturers. “The ban has shaken the economy. In several areas, business is at a standstill,” said Samuel Matonda of the Kenyan manufacturers association, who complains that the policy should have been introduced gradually. He estimates 80% of member companies are affected and close to 100,000 people have been laid off because the outlawing of flat plastic bags has been very broadly interpreted to include almost all packaging, which hurts exporters of food and flower products to Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour, as well as producers of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Matonda is now part of a panel that is working with the government to create more exemptions and put a greater emphasis on improving waste management. “It’s a stimulus,” he says. “The ban has undoubtedly aroused more public awareness of the need for a clean environment. We have achieved more in six months than in the previous five years.” The environment ministry says the attitude of manufacturers has changed. “The companies are now coming by themselves to offer solutions,” said Ong’are. With PET bottles next in the government’s sights, companies are proposing a self-management scheme to organise collection and recycling. There is still a long way to go. The ban could add to problems not just for rich manufacturers but for poor communities unless there are policies to provide cheap alternatives. But at Mathare, a football ground once covered in six feet of plastic waste is testimony to the benefits that can flow from an improved environment. As in other countries with similar bans, the policy is still being refined, but it has support. “It should definitely encourage other countries around the world, and not just in Africa, to ban plastic bags and other single-use plastics,” said Dr Arnold Kreilhuber, head of international environmental law at UN Environment. “It is however important to engage in as much public consultation as possible to ensure a smooth transition through the ban to implementation. Banning plastic bags is a big win, but it’s just the beginning. We need more investment in waste management to guarantee Kenyans a clean and healthy environment.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/23/graphene-a-game-changer-in-making-building-with-concrete-greener",
    "date": "2018-04-23",
    "transcript": "The novel “supermaterial” graphene could hold the key to making one of the oldest building materials greener, new scientific research suggests. Graphene has been incorporated into traditional concrete production by scientists at the University of Exeter, developing a composite material which is more than twice as strong and four times more water-resistant than existing concretes. Unlike previous attempts to use nanotechnology in concrete, which have focused on modifying the existing components of cement, the new technique allows a layer of graphene to be suspended in water. The method produces a high yield of concrete without defects, which can be used in conjunction with modern manufacturing techniques and could be scaled up, the researchers believe, at a relatively low cost. The composite could be used directly on building sites, enabling the construction of strong and durable buildings using less concrete and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using graphene meant the researchers were able to roughly halve the amount of materials used to make concrete. Its water resistance makes it suitable for construction in areas that are hard to reach for maintenance, while the strength of the composite will make buildings more resilient to future shocks and strains, researchers say. In addition, the technique could be copied in incorporating other nanomaterials into concrete construction in the future, which could pave the way to further innovations in the industry. Monica Craciun, professor of nanoscience at the University of Exeter’s engineering department, said: “Our cities face a growing pressure from global challenges on pollution, sustainable urbanisation and resilience to catastrophic natural events. This new composite material is an absolute game-changer in terms of reinforcing traditional concrete to meet these needs.” Graphene is a form of carbon first reliably produced at the University of Manchester by researchers in 2004, work which led to two Nobel prizes. It is made up of a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice. Its structure gives it important physical qualities, including efficient conductance of heat and electricity and unusual strength. Concrete has been used as a building material since the Romans, some of whose concrete structures still stand today. It is the commonest building material, along with steel, but greenhouse gas emissions from concrete and cement-making remain stubbornly high, in part because of the energy used in their creation but also because the chemical processes required involve the break-up of limestone and release of carbon dioxide. Cement-making accounts for 6% of global carbon emissions, and manufacturers must make sharp reductions if the Paris climate goals are to be met, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project, in a recent study. The University of Exeter research, in a paper entitled Ultrahigh Performance nanoengineered Graphene-Concrete Composites for Multifunctional Applications, is published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, and was funded by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The samples of the composite tested so far all come up to British and European standards, so getting the composite material into use should be possible. Dimitar Dimov, lead author of the study, said: “Finding greener ways to build is a crucial step forward in reducing carbon emissions around the world. This is a crucial step in the right direction to make a more sustainable construction industry.”",

    "title": "Could sprinkling sand save the Arctic's shrinking sea ice?",

    "date": "2018-04-23",
    "transcript": "As a test location for a project that aims to ensure the livability of Earth, a frozen lake near the northern tip of Alaska could seem rather inauspicious. While the North Meadow Lake near Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, may be relatively nondescript, it will be the staging ground this month for an ambitious attempt to safeguard the Arctic’s rapidly diminishing sea ice and stave off the most punishing effects of global warming. Tiny spheres of reflective sand will be sprinkled upon the lake to see if this can prevent the lake ice from melting or slow the process down. Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice – equivalent to the size of Costa Rica – with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change. “The ice in the Arctic isn’t going to come back by itself,” said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. “And we don’t have much time left.” Field, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore’s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. “It hit me like a train,” she said. “The importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me. “I looked at it and thought: ‘What if this is a materials problem?’ You go through the list of things that aren’t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it’s a fairly short list. I’ve been through a few options and this one has legs.” For the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota. Testing is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqiaġvik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra – there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer. “Leslie is kind of a one-off,” said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. “I think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that’s realistic and is going to save the world, I don’t know.” Field is attempting to resurrect the reflectivity lost by the Arctic as sea ice has receded due to a warming atmosphere and ocean. Sea ice is being lost at a rate not seen in at least 1,500 years, with Nasa calculating it is disappearing by about 13% a decade. In March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles – the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s. As sea ice is lost, it locks the Arctic into a downward spiral. Less stark white reflective surface, or albedo, means more dark ocean, which absorbs sunlight rather than repels it, thus speeding up the warming process and spurring further melting. Older multi-year ice, 10ft thick in places, accounted for just 1% of the winter ice pack last year, meaning the sea ice that remains is now largely composed of newer, thinner and less reflective ice. Field claims that her solution could save what’s left. Tiny balls of silica, measuring less than the breadth of a human hair, should reflect 90% of the sun’s heat. This “emergency first aid” is framed as a chance for the world to be afforded more time to slash greenhouse gas emissions. The cost and logistics are daunting, however. It’s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft. Field isn’t targeting the whole Arctic region – instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard – but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour. The continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn’t certain as yet, despite a “large-scale launch” of ice covering earmarked for 2020. “It’s not chump change, but compared to other options it’s cost effective,” she said. “It’s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.” Ice911 isn’t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic. A team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic’s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze. “Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,” lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. “It’s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.” In the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won’t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed. No such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option “soft” or “eco” geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough. There is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun’s heat away from Earth; or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to “brighten” them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia’s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin “sun shield” to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching. A separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the “StratoCruiser” – a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard’s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources. These and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive. János Pásztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored. In a speech to Arizona State University, Pásztor singled out Keith’s experiment. “Some time within the next year, we may see the world’s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,” he said. “We urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society’s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.” Some scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas. “I think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,” said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. “I don’t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.” Bitz said she was “not very optimistic” about Ice911’s plan as it creates “very small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems”, despite Field’s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. The silica material will average 60 micrometers, which is “well out of the range of danger” caused by particulates that are typically smaller, at 10 micrometers or less, according to Roman Decca, who works on strategy and engineering at Ice911. “You could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,” said Bitz. “The idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it’s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive. We need to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, first and foremost.” Even if the silica proves benign to the Arctic environment, keeping a lid on warming in the region could backfire anyway, according to Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “Weather patterns and ocean currents bring excess heat to the poles to balance out the planet, so you might invigorate those warming systems,” she said. “It might all be a bit futile.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "It was a vampire squid that inspired the European winner of this year’s Goldman environmental prize to successfully challenge the devastatingly unsustainable practice of bottom-trawling. More than a decade before Blue Planet, Claire Nouvian was researching this rare creature – a living fossil that is found 4,000m below the surface of Monterey Bay – for a French television company, when she first realised the extraordinary variety of life and colour on the deep ocean floor. The joy of that discovery was quickly followed by horror when she realised how quickly this landscape – formed over centuries – was being turned into a desert as a result of industrial fishing. Deep-sea bottom trawlers drag heavy nets with steel doors and roller gear across the ocean floor, decimating ancient coral, mussel colonies, sponges, sea worms and many species that live long and breed too slowly to replenish their numbers. The technique has been compared to the clear-cutting of forests because the heavy doors – some of which weigh several tonnes and are marketed as canyonbusters – scrape the tops off of seamounts and rugged terrain. Determined to challenge this, Nouvian switched from journalism to activism, founded the Bloom Association in 2005, and began a campaign that recently resulted in a major policy shift by the European Union. She describes her strategy as an application of investigative journalism. She first identified the problem, honed in on the causes, interviewed the major players and then sieved through reams of data to expose the ecological and economic flaws of the business. “Deep-sea bottom trawling applies the most destructive fishing to the most fragile ecosystem,” Nouvian told the Guardian in an interview ahead of the Goldman award ceremony. “The seafloor has intricate features that form over years, like cities. Bottom trawling wipes it out.” Nouvian initially focused attention on a fishing fleet owned by Intermarché, a French supermarket chain. Her association sifted through years of corporate accounts and discovered that the fleet was chronically unprofitable even with public subsidies. In partnership with other NGOs, they also canvassed former fishing communities in France and the UK to see how fishing port communities were being ruined by industrial trawling. This was followed by a petition calling on the government to ban a practice that was environmentally destructive and economically unviable. With the help of a viral cartoon on the subject by acclaimed French illustrator Pénélope Bagieu, more than 900,000 people signed up, forcing first Intermarché, then the French and UK governments, then the European parliament and council to agree on restrictions. From June 2016, European fleets have been banned from bottom trawling at depths of more than 800m. Nouvian is now targeting pulse fishing, which uses electric currents to stun fish or induce spasms that force sole and plaice from the sediment. The European commission banned this practice – along with fishing with poison and explosives – in 1998, but eight years later accepted a Dutch proposal for an exemption for 5% of trawlers to conduct “scientific research” into whether this form of fishing is less destructive than other types of trawling. Nouvian says 84 Dutch ships have been fitted with electrodes, which is more than 30% of the fleet, and they only started collecting data after Bloom challenged them in 2016. “This is terrifying. If we electrocute fish, we also electrocute eggs and everything else. All life in a certain space is wiped out. It sounds like science fiction, but it is real.” Under pressure from Bloom, other NGOs and small-scale fishermen’s groups, the European parliament voted to prohibit pulse fishing inside EU waters earlier this year. But she says it continues on a wide scale because the European commission is failing to enforce regulations while the EU institutions make a final ruling on whether pulse fishing should be prohibited. Nouvian has called on supermarkets to refuse to stock electric-caught fish but so far in the UK only Waitrose, Co-op and Morrisons have agreed, while Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Marks and Spencers have not replied. French retailers – who have learned not to cross this formidable campaigner – have been more responsive. The prize-winner – who complains there is only 20 hours to work in a day – is also working to ban shark-finning in Asia and lobbying the World Trade Organisation and governments around the world to end subsidies for destructive industrial fishing and to give more support to small-scale fishing communities. “There are way too many big fishing vessels and they are kept afloat with public subsidies. But there are fewer fish so they have to go further, enter deeper waters and take more types of fish,” she said. “We have the means to wipe out other species and us with it, but just because we can it does not mean we have to.”",

    "transcript": "Two grassroots women activists – one black, one white – stand together against two of the world’s most powerful men – one black, one white – over a secret, undemocratic, multibillion dollar nuclear deal. If this was the plot of a Netflix series, it might be dismissed as too neat, too perfectly symbolic and symmetrical. But this is the true story of the two South African winners of this year’s Goldman environment prize who tapped their roots in the anti-apartheid struggle to take on and beat an agreement by their nation’s recently deposed leader Jacob Zuma and Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid were the sole signatories of a successful legal challenge against the plan for South Africa to buy up to 10 nuclear power stations from Russia at an estimated cost of 1tn rand ($76bn). After a five-year legal battle, a high court outlawed the deal last April and accepted the plaintiffs’ claims that it had been arranged without proper consultation with parliament. Aside from the immense geopolitical ramifications, the ruling was a vindication for the civil society movement that aims to expand public participation, especially by woman, in energy decision-making. There were risks in confronting the president, the electricity utility and the interests of a foreign power. The two women were warned they could face violence and attacks on their reputation, but they signed the legal papers regardless. “It is important that this campaign is led by women,” Lekalakala said in an interview in Cape Town. “We are getting this [Goldman] prize because we really sacrificed ourselves by putting our names on the line. Others were shit-scared. But we’ve been through so much that we were willing to take the risk.” McDaid, who works for the Southern African Faith Communities’ Environment Institute, said the campaign was a recognition that grassroots action can work. “Governments everywhere like to give the impression that citizens have no power. That’s not true. We have checks and balances and we need to use them.” Both cut their activist teeth in the anti-apartheid struggle of the 1980s. McDaid, then a teacher, was caught up in the Trojan Horse massacre in Athlone, Cape Town. She hid students sought by police in her house and used her car to block troops chasing students. Lekalakala grew up in Soweto, the heartland of the black consciousness movement. She served as a shop steward in a department store when she was 19 years old. She also witnessed some of the worst of the violence, both from the white authorities and black-on-black factional conflict. In the late eighties, an era when alleged apartheid collaborators were being punished with “necklaces” of burning tyres, she was woken by screams in the middle of the night and ffound bodies on the floor in the morning. “That was the hardest time of my life,” she recalls. This background has made the two women relatively fearless. They have both been threatened and suffered break-ins in which alarm systems were expertly dismantled and only their laptops (rather than valuables like jewellery or cameras) were stolen, suggesting the intruders were after information rather than money. “It’s harassment,” said Lekalakala. “But I’m very forceful. I’m used to threats.” The two began working together in 2009 when they joined Earthlife, a group designed to encourage women to become more involved in energy and climate policy-making. For Lekalakala, it was an eye-opening experience. “When I started at Earthlife I was one of the only black women. I thought that was wrong. It is poor black women who are most affected but it is rich white men making all the decisions.” They have proved influential, providing input into the National Energy Act and the climate energy policy. They challenged the long-held view that energy is a technical, engineering matter for specialists rather than ordinary people. “We broke that barrier and we are continuously breaking barriers,” said Lekalakala, who has also campaigned against plans for a coal mine at Thabametsi. They were tipped off about the nuclear deal by the Russian group EcoDefence. Although the South African government had not told the public about the plan, its business partner, state-owned Rosatom initially posted an announcement on its website. This was quickly taken down but not before Earthlife made a copy that they used to rally opposition from environmentalists, faith groups, lawyers, and, the media. Their court victory was a major setback for Putin’s plans to increase Russia’s income and influence, and may have contributed to the fall of Zuma after nine years in power. The president had reportedly fired two finance ministers in part because they were unwilling to approve the $76bn cost of the project. It was also a focus of corruption claims by political enemies and rivals in the ANC, given reports that Zuma’s son was a director of the sole mine that supplied uranium. The new government has signalled a shift in direction. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Davos this year that the plan to add 9.6 gigawatts of nuclear energy was off the table. More recently, energy minister Jeff Radebe has signed deals that will promote wind and solar power. “The political signs are good that nuclear is not going ahead any time soon,” said McDaid. “But I think this is just a step on the path to a nuclear-free South Africa. There is a long way to go. Success would be for our one existing plant to be decomissioned and for the government to make a nuclear-free declaration.” Lekalakala agrees on the need to stay vigilant because coal - along with nuclear - remains a concern and the government will revisit its energy policy in five years. “Civil society can claim some credit for ensuring the government didn’t run along a nuclear path that would have bankrupted the country,” she said. “We’ll use the Goldman award to further our struggle and build a new generation of activists.”",

    "transcript": "The grass may be greener on the other side – but is death? Growing numbers of people who spend their lives recycling their plastics and watching their air miles are wondering about the most environmentally sound way to deal with their mortal remains. Now, help is at hand from a funeral industry increasingly tuned in to the varied and exotic last wishes of the “consumer”. At a packed funeral expo in a church in Amsterdam last weekend, exhibitors included a flat-pack coffin that you construct and decorate yourself which has just won the first Dutch “final footprint award” with its designs for a “CO2-neutral” casket. “Environmental awareness needs to extend to everything we do,” says Cor Geijtenbeek, co-owner of the design firm Coffin in a Box Company. “We separate our plastics. We think about the car we drive. We also need to think about the choice of our last journey.” Death is a growth business. More than 100 people die every minute on – 56 million in 2015 according to the World Health Organization, which predicts a 25% increase to 70 million in 2030. Geijtenbeek reckons burial is better for the environment than cremation. But in the UK, even though three-quarters of people choose cremation, space in graveyards is running out, with almost half of local authorities expecting their cemeteries to be full by 2033. The Dutch answer has been to allow graves to be reused, with old bones buried much deeper when a new coffin arrives for interment. This presents a problem: many modern coffins are not so biodegradable. “In the past, people used wooden coffins made only of wood, sometimes containing cloth, but now it’s only chemically treated wood products, with synthetic glues in the casket and often paint and varnish for a high-shine effect,” says Geijtenbeek. “In no way are these coffins biodegradable and they are often made in China or eastern Europe and transported.” He added that sometimes when a grave is cleared and the bones buried deeper to make space for the next occupant, these synthetic coffins are completely intact while the bodies have decomposed. “Cremation isn’t necessarily better for the environment as it uses a lot of energy and raises the carbon footprint,” he adds. “Simple burial with biodegradable products is better for the environment.” And so his firm, which already produces the low-carbon flat-pack poplar coffin, is now working in conjunction with the company Ecor on a model with sides made from recycled cellulose fibres. He has sold a couple of hundred of his initial poplar wood model, sent through the post and costing €289 (£250) or £299 to people in Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland – estimating that the CO2 footprint of each is 4kg, compared with 25-30kg for a standard coffin. He wasn’t alone at the Dutch fair. As well as a controversial “Sarco” euthanasia coffin, FAIR coffins was also offering eco-friendly shrouds, partly recycled and biodegradable coffins, made by people with disabilities – while across the world you can find coffins made from Hainsworth’s wool, willow and cardboard. These kinds of biodegradable coffin are preferred by “green cemeteries” and Prof Douglas Davies, director of Durham University’s Centre for Death and Life Studies and author of dozens of books and studies, points out that more and more people are interested in a “wet” forest burial over a “dusty” graveyard. “There are as many natural burial sites in the UK as crematoria,” he said. “A woodland burial is somewhere dynamic, associated with life, activity, and hope.” He adds that eco-friendliness has taken on the same kind of positive associations as the pioneering “hygienic” cremations first proposed in late 19th century: now, the UK has 281 crematoria, according to the Cremation Society of Great Britain, and more than 270 natural burial sites. In Davies’s view, the proliferation of small ventures offering alternatives from banana-leaf caskets to having your ashes scattered in space, and word-of-mouth recommendations via social media are completely changing our funerals. At the Dutch funeral conference, a greener coffin was definitely appealing to Mieke van der Ploeg, 66, an undertaker from Den Dolder. “More and more people want eco-friendly coffins; my husband manages a natural cemetery with about 150 spaces and he wants only eco-friendly caskets,” she said. For the consumer, the very Ikea-style process of building and decorating a coffin has emotional benefits, according to Paula Kemper, who used one to cremate her 95-year-old mother. “We ordered this coffin, put it together with my husband, and we made a very nice painting of the tree of life. My mother had seven children and more than 30 grandchildren and great grandchildren, so the children all made a flower for a branch. It helps you in your grief to do something.” Kate Dyer and Kate Tym, celebrants who run funeral services, have held two Coffin Clubs for people to decorate their own Earth to Heaven cardboard coffins. They have enjoyed trying to build the Coffin in a Box and believe this kind of innovation is vital to give people more control over funeral processes. “There’s no thinking out of the box,” said Kate Tym. “We have got completely stuck in the Victorian era with men dressed as characters out of Dickens and I think the next generation isn’t going to want that.” Cremation is ever more popular, but even Geijtenbeek concedes that the latest process, resomation or “water cremation”– a process used in the US and Canada where the flesh is broken down by an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide and then the skeleton pulverised – has been shown to have an even lower carbon footprint. But for religions such as Islam and Judaism, burial is the only option, and Britain is yet to hold its first water cremation, thanks to fears over what happens to the liquid byproduct. If Shakespeare’s gravedigger in Hamlet was pretty casual about chucking poor Yorick’s skull around, we are apparently more sensitive about death nowadays. And we’re probably busier. Linda Drenth, 39, from Veendam in Groningen, who is studying to be a funeral director and was one of the throng at the Amsterdam conference, said: “It’s a negative if you have to make your coffin yourself, when you are already busy organising a funeral.” The British furniture maker William Warren, though, is all for building DIY, green coffins in good time. He has sent out more than 1,000 open-source designs – for all weights and sizes – for his Shelves of Life, a bookcase that becomes a coffin, and his future tombstone is currently weighting a grandfather clock. “It’s comforting, like writing a will,” he says. “We are all going to rot down or burn up and be added back into the great cauldron. “Although,” he adds, as an afterthought, “I’m not sure I’m living the kind of lifestyle to be particularly good compost.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "'Taste the difference': Farm-to-fork movement takes off in urban Flanders",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/taste-the-difference-farm-to-fork-movement-takes-off-in-urban-flanders",
    "date": "2018-04-19",
    "transcript": "Flanders, famed for its medieval cities and motorways that can be seen from space, is one of the most urban corners of Europe. Yet this densely populated area is seeing a mini-boom in a new type of agriculture where farmers sell direct to consumers. The movement, known as community-supported agriculture, is the antithesis of the sprawling global distribution chains of modern industrial food production. CSA farming means no supermarkets, no fertilisers and no monoculture. Advocates say the most important feature is the direct link to consumers, who pay upfront and often pick the produce from the fields. This model of farming – sometimes referred to as farm-to-fork – originated in the United States and the Netherlands, but has quickly taken off in the Belgian region of Flanders. More people are eating CSA-grown food in Belgium than in the more populous UK, according to a 2016 report by Urgenci, the international CSA network. Since the first Flemish CSA farmer struck his spade into the soil in 2007, at least 45 similar businesses have sprung up in the region. Koen Tierens, a plant biologist, is one of the newest on the scene. Tierens swapped his desk job as an agrarian expert for the 5.30am harvests that come with running his own vegetable farm. He has a 1.2-hectare (2.96-acre) plot in the village of Kampenhout just outside Brussels, where the rich, loamy soil is ideal for growing. Tierens’ father, a retired farmer, was sceptical when he outlined his plans; a small holding, no fertilisers and a few old-fashioned, second-hand tools: “My father told me, ‘Koen what are you doing? You studied at university, you have a PhD! Are you going to be an ancient Belgian farmer doing how they did it in the middle ages?’” Tierens says there is nothing primitive about his business, and stresses he is not against conventional farming or fertilisers. “The market is evolving in this [CSA] way,” he says, describing the combination of care for the environment and close connection to the customer, allied to marketing and a website that allows consumers to choose their vegetable boxes. Now in his second growing season, Tierens has 72 households paying him to grow their vegetables and hopes to increase this to 90. His father is now convinced, he says. He grows 200 varieties of vegetable in a year – a much wider range than typical farmers. As well as the more common peas, carrots and potatoes, he grows less familiar varieties – purple cauliflowers, green zebra tomatoes, black radish, salsify and cardoon. But Tierens does not grow Belgian endive, the most emblematic vegetable in the national cuisine. Although he farms in a region that is famed for the bitter white lettuce, he decided it would be arrogant to grow his fellow farmers’ best-known crop. Another big difference with conventional farming is the limited use of subsidies, although he received EU funds to start his business and cover the costs of gaining organic certification. Other things are constant – the unpredictability of the weather and early starts. Tierens works in his field every day, wearing a head torch on dark winter mornings. During the peak growing season from May to October, he works 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week. His customers share the risk of a storm or a bad harvest. “It would be a disaster for them as well, but the chance of that happening is not that big because I grow 200 types of vegetables,” he says. Unlike most CSA farms in Flanders, Tierens’ customers do not pick their own vegetables. In the UK, a quarter of such farms are pick-your-own, but in Flanders, 85% fall into this category. Belgium is an enthusiastic latecomer to CSA farming, which traces its roots to the biodynamic movement launched in the US in the 1980s. But there were other inspirations. The first known CSA farm in Europe was Les Jardins de Cocagne, an organic vegetable cooperative near Geneva founded in 1978. Japanese farmers were experimenting with similar models at around the same time. “It is not only about the food, it is also about the community and being outside,” says Nele Lauwers, a policy adviser at the Flemish farming union Boerenbond. She belongs to a CSA cooperative near Ghent and describes harvesting days as “a weekly outdoor trip” for her children. Demand for pick-your-own vegetables is growing among medium to high earners, she says. But price may limit its appeal. “It’s quite a different market. You have to pay in advance and it is not possible for everybody, although some CSA groups may offer social prices.” CSA farming is therefore likely to remain marginal to food production – 0.1% of the population of Flanders are paying customers. Land is also limited. Pepijn de Snijder, an independent expert, says would-be CSA farmers face competition from nature reserves, traditional farming, horse paddocks or city sprawl. “If we don’t change anything by 2050, 50% of the area of Flanders would be paved concrete,” he says. The Flemish government has agreed a ban on new urban development from 2040 unless an equivalent area of land is returned to nature. Another feature of CSA produce is that it takes longer to prepare. Vegetables arrive in customers’ kitchens with earth clinging to roots and leaves, rather than shiny and neat in plastic packaging. “Not everyone likes to bring soil into their kitchen,” says Tierens. “With me you need to invest a little bit more time, but you can taste the difference.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "With her missing feathers, bald patches and hunched demeanour, Sweet Pea was not what anyone would describe as a healthy chicken. Fast-forward four months and she is sporting a full set of golden red feathers and happily laying eggs for her new family in Devon. The remarkable transformation has been made possible by a rehoming project that saves factory-kept chickens from being slaughtered and gives them a new life with families across the country. The British Hen Welfare Trust has rehomed 629,289 chickens so far – roughly 50,000 hens a year. It’s part of a movement driven by increasing concern about animal welfare and also “people wanting a slice of the good life”, says Francesca Taffs, a spokeswoman for the charity. Many of the chickens come from farms where they share cages with up to 90 other birds. They never see daylight or green grass, and at 18 months, when their egg-laying drops off, they are deemed useless to suppliers and sent to slaughter. The charity works with farms and factories to rescue chickens in batches of around 200 and match them with new families. One of the key motivations behind rehoming chickens is to raise awareness about animal welfare. The BHWT says increasing numbers of consumers “now want high-welfare as well as high-quality” chicken and celebrates the fact that more than half of British eggs are now free-range, a figure higher than anywhere in Europe. However, an estimated 16m chickens a year still live out their lives in small cages to satisfy consumer demand for cheap eggs. While the 2012 ban on battery cages was celebrated as a step forward in bird welfare, the charity would like to see all laying hens be given access to the outdoors and living in small, free-range flocks. Testimonies from those who have adopted the rescue chickens suggest they get more out of it than just fresh eggs. “My hens filled my empty nest with joy when my children left,” said one owner. Another went fully vegetarian after the birds arrived. Multiple people said they helped with depression or bereavement. One said their hens were providing support for their autistic son, who “cuddles them when overwhelmed”. The BHWT also has a scheme placing chickens in schools and has found them homes in prisons and care homes.

    "transcript": "A bow slides across cello strings, setting up an atonal motif. Drumsticks clatter staccato beats against the rim of a snare drum. An accordion’s bellows contract and swell. Dry ice fills the packed theatre. The performers, a five-piece puppet cabaret group, chant at the gathered crowd: “Fear. Death. Cold. My dear.” At the Dakh theatre in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, young creatives gather daily to telegraph anxieties, hopes and frustrations. In a country facing toxic post-Soviet problems – war in the east, corruption, poverty and an economic perma-crisis – Dakh provides artists with the space to question the world around them and their place in it. And four years after the start of the war between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces, there is much to question. In recent weeks, the venue has hosted a Russian spoken word performance, a Polish-directed production exploring language and identity, and the five-piece puppet cabaret group, TseSho. Often playful, but also mournful and even foreboding, TseSho explore issues such as social media overload, alcoholism, love, social alienation and war. “Our performances are like a mirror of things that are happening,” says Marusia Ionova, the group’s cellist. Each member, dressed in a colourful beanie and orange overalls, has a puppet in their likeness, conveying a child-like quality. Much of their music is cyclical, relying on repetition and drone. “It is eclectic music,” says Dakh’s founder and creative director, Vladislav Troitskyi. “It is a very strange story because I don’t know notes. We sit and we begin to create. We discuss what we want to say and then we compose together.” In a recent performance informed by the war in Ukraine’s east, the lights fade to pitch black. A red glow begins to emanate from the stage as discordant melodies and the group’s screams fill the theatre. Europe’s largest country by area, Ukraine has teetered on the east-west faultline since it gained independence in 1991. The conflict that began in 2014 is not its only problem. Ukraine ranks 130th in the global Corruption Perceptions Index; health indicators from longevity to HIV are woeful; the currency has plunged against the dollar, prices have surged, and the economy has stuttered following the loss of the industry-rich Donbass region. “We have realised that we all lived in a different Ukraine,” says Kateryna Petrashova, TseSho’s saxophonist. Some of the group’s members grew up in the west and centre of the country, another in the sprawling Soviet-style city of Zaporizhia. The government has banned books and popular Russian social media sites, attempted to force schools beyond primary level to teach exclusively in Ukrainian – angering Hungary, Poland and Romania – and pursued a policy of “decommunisation”, part of a push to chart an independent national course that also carries hints of revisionism. “People are thinking about their identities,” says accordionist Marichka Shtyrbulova. “Who are we in both the global and national contexts? It is something we have to understand.” Fascist elements are visible in Ukraine, particularly in the country’s west, but do not appear to have broad public support. “Across Europe we see rightwing forces becoming more popular. Younger people have forgotten the story of world war two and that is a very dangerous story,” says Troitskyi. “But I believe the Ukrainian mind is practical – people are afraid of a radicalised society.” The Dakh theatre was founded 25 years ago, after the communist collapse, and is best known as the place where the popular Ukrainian folk group DakhaBrakha was founded. Framed photographs of various performances decorate the foyer, as do ghoulish papier-mache masks. Antiquated brass instruments – trombones, tubas and trumpets – hang from the ceiling. A tiny bar serves wine and whisky. “There is a lot of creative energy here, but it hasn’t crystallised,” says Troitskyi. “It is really sad, but we have two forces in Ukraine,” says Shtyrbulova, speaking of one that tries to “change things for the better” and another that “drags you down”. Certainly, endemic corruption is dragging the country down. The murder of the lawyer Iryna Nozdrovska – found beside a river in Kiev in January with stab wounds to her neck after working to prosecute the nephew of an influential judge – has proven a potent symbol of the government’s failure to seriously address corruption. “It is every day,” says Nadiia Golubtsova, TseSho’s double bass player. “If you go to the hospital, you know that you will have to pay to get attention.” A video teaser for TseSho’s performances features Golubtsova with the top of her head sawn off. A robotic Ionova plunges in needles. “It’s kind of about cleaning your mind,” says Ionova. “We want our music to be like an injection for people’s minds.” This article is part of a series on efforts to address to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "“When I’m working, I think about the people who wore these lifevests,” says Ramzi Aloker. “Who were they and what happened to them? I also remember my own journey. The dark sea and the steep Greek mountains.” Back in Damascus, Aloker, 46, designed girls’ clothing. Now, he sews together laptop sleeves and tote bags in a workshop on the outskirts of Amsterdam. The bright orange and black bags are made from lifejackets worn by refugees as they crossed the Mediterranean sea. More than 850,000 people arrived in Greece by sea in 2015 alone, with more than 500,000 of these arriving on the island of Lesbos. As well as dealing with large numbers of refugee arrivals, islanders were also faced with an unusual problem: hundreds of thousands of life vests that were left on Greek shores. When the people behind the Dutch social enterprise Makers Unite heard about the problem, they decided to bring 5,000 lifejackets to Amsterdam. Over the past year, as part of a six-week coaching programme to help refugees establish careers in the Netherlands, 71 refugees have been involved in making and selling the bags, including 13 who have joined a team of tailors to create the upcycled products. “We give both the newcomers and this waste material a second chance,” says Thami Schweichler, the director and co-founder of Makers Unite. He also believes the material will spark a much-needed discussion. “We hope our products will create awareness about refugees and at the same time help them build a future.” The tailors receive €150 (£131) a month for their eight hours of weekly volunteer work, in addition to unemployment benefits. Among the tailors are Eman Haj Omar and her husband, Ammar, who made the sea voyage together in 2015. Back in Aleppo, Ammar used to work with an electronic embroidery machine in her father’s company. When a bomb was dropped on their children’s school, it was time to leave. They paid a smuggler €3,000 (£2,623) for the crossing from Bodrum to the island Kos in a small rubber boat; the journey took four hours. “We were terrified it would sink,” she says. “It was dark. Our children were crying.” In the beginning, working with the life vests was a painful reminder of their trip. “It made me think of the children who have drowned,” says Ammar. “That boy on the beach we saw on TV in Greece, the one with the red T-shirt.” His wife tells him the boy’s name is Alan Kurdi – the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a Turkish beach, pictures of whom caused outrage around the world. The couple are used to working with the orange fabric now, and say the workshop is a great place to get to know locals and to practise Dutch. So far, Makers Unite has found paid jobs for about 10% of the participants in their programme. Others have found internships and education or have started their own businesses. Ramzi Aloker, who dreams of starting a girls’ clothing brand, will soon be starting a two-month training programme prior to taking a job as a tailor at the Dutch clothing brand Suitsupply. Makers Unite sells about 100-200 products every month, mostly through its website. Orders come primarily from the Netherlands, the UK and the US. The products will also be available in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from 7 May. “Customers like that we’ve created something positive out of such a difficult situation,” says Schweichler. “I think many buy our products as a statement against their governments’ anti-immigration policies.” “These bags can tell people about the tragedy taking place between Damascus and Europe,” says Aloker. “It might get people thinking about the dangers we faced and why we are here.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/worlds-first-electrified-road-for-charging-vehicles-opens-in-sweden",
    "date": "2018-04-12",
    "transcript": "The world’s first electrified road that recharges the batteries of cars and trucks driving on it has been opened in Sweden. About 2km (1.2 miles) of electric rail has been embedded in a public road near Stockholm, but the government’s roads agency has already drafted a national map for future expansion. Sweden’s target of achieving independence from fossil fuel by 2030 requires a 70% reduction in the transport sector. The technology behind the electrification of the road linking Stockholm Arlanda airport to a logistics site outside the capital city aims to solve the thorny problems of keeping electric vehicles charged, and the manufacture of their batteries affordable. Energy is transferred from two tracks of rail in the road via a movable arm attached to the bottom of a vehicle. The design is not dissimilar to that of a Scalextric track, although should the vehicle overtake, the arm is automatically disconnected. The electrified road is divided into 50m sections, with an individual section powered only when a vehicle is above it. When a vehicle stops, the current is disconnected. The system is able to calculate the vehicle’s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user. The “dynamic charging” – as opposed to the use of roadside charging posts – means the vehicle’s batteries can be smaller, along with their manufacturing costs. A former diesel-fuelled truck owned by the logistics firm, PostNord, is the first to use the road. Hans Säll, chief executive of the eRoadArlanda consortium behind the project, said both current vehicles and roadways could be adapted to take advantage of the technology. In Sweden there are roughly half a million kilometres of roadway, of which 20,000km are highways, Säll said. “If we electrify 20,000km of highways that will definitely be be enough,” he added. “The distance between two highways is never more than 45km and electric cars can already travel that distance without needing to be recharged. Some believe it would be enough to electrify 5,000km.” At a cost of €1m per kilometre, the cost of electrification is said to be 50 times lower than that required to construct an urban tram line. Säll said: “There is no electricity on the surface. There are two tracks, just like an outlet in the wall. Five or six centimetres down is where the electricity is. But if you flood the road with salt water then we have found that the electricity level at the surface is just one volt. You could walk on it barefoot.” National grids are increasingly moving away from coal and oil and battery storage is seen as crucial to a changing the source of the energy used in transportation. The Swedish government, represented by a minister at the formal inauguration of the electrified road on Wednesday, is in talks with Berlin about a future network. In 2016, a 2km stretch of motorway in Sweden was adapted with similar technology but through overhead power lines at lorry level, making it unusable for electric cars.

    "title": "The Brazilian villagers turning plastic pollution into profit",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/the-brazilian-villagers-turning-plastic-pollution-into-profit",
    "date": "2018-04-12",
    "transcript": "Maria das Gracas started collecting her plastic bottles after she saw the body of her neighbour floating past her house, carried along with the pollution that helped cause the deadly floods. She stores them by the front door of her one-story home, which sits on the litter-strewn banks of the Tejipió river in north-east Brazil. When she has enough she will take them to the local storage skip, where a litter collector will pay her two reals for 50 plastic bottles – about 40 pence. She’s not just doing it for the money. She’s doing it to stop the tide of plastic drowning this community. Every day Maria and other residents of Coqueiral, a poor neighbourhood in the city of Recife, feel the impact of the world’s plastic binge. It is visible in the waters of the river that once flowed freely through the area. Fifty years ago when Rildo Wandray was a boy, he would jump into the Tejipió and swim, while his friends fished beside him. Today the river is stagnant, obstructed at every tributary by a tide of plastic waste; Coca-Cola and Fanta bottles, water containers, crisp packets and wrappers. Globally, some 2 billion people live in communities with no rubbish collections. While international attention has focused recently on the marine plastic litter crisis, the devastating impact of plastic waste on the world’s poorest is no less destructive, causing flooding, disease, and hundreds of thousands of premature deaths from toxic fumes caused by the burning of waste. In Recife the plastic waste is exacerbating already devastating flooding from rising sea levels caused by climate change. And those living around the Tejipió have grown tired of waiting for the government to act. For das Gracas, the tipping point came when flooding took the life of one of her neighbours. “I was trapped inside my home with my son,” she said. “There was nothing we could do, the water came up and we could not get out. I looked out and saw a body float past. She was face down, I could see the hair. That night the flood nearly took me too. Ever since then I have collected my bottles, I wanted to try and do something to reduce the waste going into the river.” Organised and supported by the local baptist church through its project Instituto Solidare, local communities are mobilising: street protests, public meetings, awareness campaigns. They are also trying to build a network of entrepreneurs who can make a living out of collecting the waste, and turning it into products they can sell. The Recife campaign is supported by Tearfund, the international NGO which is lobbying for global development funding for waste projects to be increased from 0.3% to 3%; a move which would push waste higher up the international agenda, reduce global plastic littering, help cut marine litter and improve the environment and the lives of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. On Thursday – in advance of the Commonwealth Summit in London next week – international development secretary Penny Mordaunt is expected to address the need to increase UK funding globally to tackle plastic pollution, after lobbying from Tearfund and other bodies. In Recife, Evandro Alves, who leads Instituto Solidare, says the world’s poorest are suffering the most from the plastic waste crisis. “The situation here in this community, where life is already incredibly hard, has been getting worse,” he said. “We are are seeing more and more plastic being used and thrown away, and it stops here in their community. So we decided to mobilise.” The movement in Coqueiral, Alves believes, could be replicated across the developing world; taking the idea of a circular economy and localising it to empower the people to press for government action, but also to take advantage of the opportunities waste creates. “The waste is a problem but it is also an opportunity for people to earn a living, to create a circular economy for themselves,” he said. “This could be transformative and improve the quality of life for people in the poorest areas of the biggest cities. This is a battle for everyone and everyone needs to be part of it. We understand this is not a short fix, this is a long fight.” At public meetings, and marches through the streets residents hold placards aloft, demanding “Clean River, Healthy City,” and “Salve Orio Tejipió e suas communidades.” (Save the River Tejipió and our communities) Young people in Recife are at the forefront of the campaign, eliciting support and mobilising on social media. In one direct action, pupils whose school is on the riverside, removed some of the waste from the Tejipió; a sofa, plastic bottles, a TV, tables, plastic chairs and built a house on the banks which they called Casa Lixo – House of Trash. Another post saw children holding a fashion show from clothes created out of plastic bags and cups. Some women are involved in an enterprise making handbags, jewellery and toys out of the plastic and other waste collected from their communities. It provides them with employment and a small income – and in a small way builds the kind of circular economy which a 2010 Brazilian law promised but failed to create. Olga Gomes, one of the women who works in the group Seleta, said: “We are putting a lot of work into researching the market and looking at trends and trying to make sure we can make a business out of what we are doing. For me it is empowering – it has given me work and given me a social life.” Her optimism is shared by all the women, some of whom have been helped to flee violent relationships through the work provided and the social support of the Seleta project. For Gomes, the task for the future is clear. “I want to see my grandchildren swim in the river like I did and I want this work to take me across the ocean.” The movement is being adopted by some of the poorest communities across the world. In Jos in Nigeria and Maputo in Mozambique, other groups have formed. They are driven, as in Recife, by young people, who use their knowledge of digital media to spread the fight against waste across the globe. Naomi Foxwood, senior campaigner for Tearfund, said: “This crisis is growing as disposable items – plastic bottles, disposable nappies, single-use polystyrene containers – are increasingly being used in quickly urbanising low- and middle-income countries. “Young people, in particular, are at the forefront of this. They have energy, organising power, and a great sense of justice. For them it is a justice issue because often municipal waste is just dumped in the poorest communities, whereas it is collected from the more wealthy areas.” For those in Recife, there have been small victories. Last year the state government responded to the pressure and dug out the river upstream of Coqueiral to improve the river flow. The result is fewer floods so far this year. But the residents know the battle will be a long one. Carol Santos who lives on the banks of the river with her three children understands the need to take personal responsibility for the waste she creates. But she also believes her community has been abandoned by the state and that large multinationals like Coca-Cola – whose plastic bottles are clearly visible in the mass of waste blocking the Tejipió, could do more to clear up the pollution their products create. “The company could help to collect the waste and support the community to recycle it, but it doesn’t. We don’t see them,” she said. Her home is flooded several times a year. “When the rains come the flood destroys everything. It is a desperate situation – at least nine times a year I lose everything, my children get sick from diarrhoea when it floods, its awful for them. We live here because we have nowhere else to go.”",

    "transcript": "Things are bad, and it feels like they are getting worse, right? War, violence, natural disasters, corruption. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer; and we will soon run out of resources unless something drastic is done. That’s the picture most people in the west see in the media and carry around in their heads. I call it the overdramatic worldview. It’s stressful and misleading. In fact, the vast majority of the world’s population live somewhere in the middle of the income scale. Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated. Perhaps not on every single measure, or every single year, but step by step, year by year, the world is improving. In the past two centuries, life expectancy has more than doubled. Although the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress. The overdramatic worldview draws people to the most negative answers. It is not caused simply by out-of-date knowledge. My experience, over decades of lecturing and testing, has finally brought me to see that the overdramatic worldview comes from the very way our brains work. The brain is a product of millions of years of evolution, and we are hard-wired with instincts that helped our ancestors to survive in small groups of hunters and gatherers. We crave sugar and fat, which used to be life-saving sources of energy when food was scarce. But today these cravings make obesity one of the biggest global health problems. In the same way, we are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. This craving for drama causes misconceptions and helps create an overdramatic worldview. We still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world. If we sifted every input and analysed every decision rationally, a normal life would be impossible. Just as we should not cut out all sugar and fat, we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions. But we need to learn to control our drama intake. It is absolutely true that there are many bad things in this world. The number of conflict fatalities has been falling since the second world war, but the Syrian war has reversed this trend. Terrorism too is rising. Overfishing and the deterioration of the seas are truly worrisome. The list of endangered species is getting longer. But while it is easy to be aware of all the bad things happening in the world, it’s harder to know about the good things. The silent miracle of human progress is too slow and too fragmented to ever qualify as news. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved. But in online polls, in most countries, fewer than 10% of people knew this. Our instinct to notice the bad more than the good is related to three things: the misremembering of the past; selective reporting by journalists and activists; and the feeling that as long as things are bad, it’s heartless to say they are getting better. For centuries, older people have romanticised their youths and insisted that things ain’t what they used to be. Well, that’s true. Most things used to be worse. This tendency to misremember is compounded by the never-ending negative news from across the world. Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and affect millions of people. And thanks to increasing press freedom and improving technology, we hear about more disasters than ever before. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite. At the same time, activists and lobbyists manage to make every dip in an improving trend appear to be the end of the world, scaring us with alarmist exaggerations and prophecies. In the United States, the violent crime rate has been falling since 1990. But each time something horrific or shocking happened – pretty much every year – a crisis was reported. The majority of people believe that violent crime is getting worse. My guess is you feel that me saying that the world is getting better is like me telling you that everything is fine, and that feels ridiculous. I agree. Everything is not fine. We should still be very concerned. As long as there are plane crashes, preventable child deaths, endangered species, climate change sceptics, male chauvinists, crazy dictators, toxic waste, journalists in prison, and girls not getting an education, we cannot relax. But it is just as ridiculous to look away from the progress that has been made. The consequent loss of hope can be devastating. When people wrongly believe that nothing is improving, they may lose confidence in measures that actually work. How can we help our brains to realise that things are getting better? Think of the world as a very sick premature baby in an incubator. After a week, she is improving, but she has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it’s both bad and better. That is how we must think about the current state of the world. Take girls’ education. When women are educated, the workforce becomes diversified and able to make better decisions. Educated mothers have fewer children, and more survive. More energy is invested in each child’s education: a virtuous cycle of change. Ninety per cent of girls of primary school age attend school; for boys, it’s 92%. There are still gender differences when it comes to education in the poorest countries, especially in secondary and higher education, but that’s no reason to deny the progress that has been made. Remember that the media and activists rely on drama to grab your attention; that negative stories are more dramatic than positive ones; and how simple it is to construct a story of crisis from a temporary dip pulled out of its context of a long-term improvement. When you hear about something terrible, calm yourself by asking: if there had been a positive improvement, would I have heard about that? Even if there had been hundreds of larger improvements, would I have heard? This is “factfulness”: understanding as a source of mental peace. Like a healthy diet and regular exercise, it can and should become part of people’s daily lives. Start to practise it, and you will make better decisions, stay alert to real dangers and possibilities, and avoid being constantly stressed about the wrong things. • Hans Rosling was a Swedish physician, academic and statistician, who died in 2017. This is an edited excerpt from his posthumously published book Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong about the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think (Sceptre), written with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund",

    "transcript": "From Tuesday rough sleepers and people at risk of homelessness in England will have a legal right to help from their local council. The Homelessness Reduction Act has been described as the “most significant legislation” to tackle the issue for 40 years. It is hoped it will mean more early intervention and a reduction in rough sleeping, where numbers have risen 169% in England since 2010. It’s good news for those who would otherwise be refused help by their local authorities but for some it’s too little, too late from the government. Where official bodies have failed to help, communities have been supporting those who have experienced all forms of homelessness. Just off Silicon Roundabout in east London, named so because of the large number of tech businesses near Old Street, I meet members of Beam, a crowdfunding platform which allows those who have been homeless to seek donations towards the training and qualifications they need to work. Tarquin, who now works while training to be a gas safety engineer, raised just under £4,000. His parents were drug users and he started at 14. He points outside and says: “I grew up down the road with Tony (another member of the group) and heard how Beam helped him out. His story inspired me.” Tarquin was in hostels and on the streets for more than half his life but has been drugs and alcohol free for nearly four years. “We get these cards from anonymous donors with words of encouragement like: ‘My husband was a gas engineer, we live a good life and we want to help out.’ It builds your esteem up,” he says. Founded by Alex Stephany in September 2017, Beam has funded 20 campaigns and raised over £43,000 for a range of industry-recognised qualifications. Defined as a social impact business, Stephany not only wanted to address the homelessness crisis but also “use technology to solve big real world problems”. “In short, a social impact business makes money by doing good - and in a way that can be measured,” he says. Working with charities, Beam helps individuals who have been referred by preparing a fundraising campaign, breaking down the costs and helping them crowdfund online. Supporters are kept up to date with a member’s progress and often, when in stable employment, members choose to pay back the money raised and help fund other members’ campaigns. One member, Jordan, tells me he wants to become an electrician. After leaving the armed forces he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. “Structure is important for me,” he says. “Without Beam I would be stressing about how my addiction would take hold of me again.” Hana, a refugee from East Africa, has recently trained as a beautician. She says it was difficult when she was homeless. “Beam has been my compass.” Tony was one of the first people to benefit from the scheme and is dubbed its “poster boy” by Tarquin. Over the last 10 years he has sofa surfed, lived in hostels and slept in cars. “I was a bit apprehensive and thought it might not work but it’s more positive change than I was expecting. There used to be no light at the end for me, but the Beam’s shining bright now.” In Cambridge, those who are homeless – and not averse to cycling – can return to work with the help of Overstream Clean. It was developed in 2014 by Rachel Newell, 40, social enterprise manager for the charity Wintercomfort. People receive training then are given work in cleaning and gardening. “One of the problems for those living on the streets is that most people don’t have the documentation needed to work,” says Newell. “We help pay for birth certificates but for a bank account you need an address. It can sometimes be tricky to break the cycle.” Overstream Clean, which only employs homeless people, uses bikes to get around the city. At the moment, 10 people work in cleaning with one person offering gardening services. An average of 20 to 30 people get involved annually with 60% of those who move into work afterwards remaining in employment. “We don’t market ourselves as a social enterprise but as a professional cleaning company and it’s great to see people feeling an affinity with what we do,” says Newell. She says the scheme has attracted a lot of interest and they’re hoping to grow and scale up operations. “There are a lot of people who want to work. Our gardener used to live under a bridge when he started volunteering with us. Now he works full time and has bought a motorcycle which he takes on holiday. People are just trying to make a go of things and we want to help where we can.” Salisbury made headlines in March with the nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. A month on and there are signs of recovery but Austin Cohen says businesses are still being affected. “It’s a small city,” he says, “and everyone knows each other, and after the recent news we wanted to do something positive.” In 2017, the rate of those sleeping rough in Wiltshire was 72% higher than the previous year, with 2015 seeing the worst crisis in the last eight years with a 156% change compared to the year before. Cohen, 33, left his job as an accountant manager to set up a charity working with the homeless, vulnerable and elderly. “I lost my parents when I was nine and I received a lot of kindness from people because of it,” he says. “I’ve been brought up in a way where it’s natural to give back and help others.” With freezing temperatures brought by the “beast from the east” in February, Cohen wanted to help those who were street homeless. In March he came up with the idea of offering hot drinks in mugs but with free refills at local cafes and churches. “We found that a lot of homeless people weren’t really welcome in establishments,” says Cohen. “We wanted to change that … It’s not just about offering a warm cup of tea or coffee but feeling like a part of society.” The mugs have been donated by Mole Country Stores and several commercial and church cafes offer free refills seven days a week. So far 23 mugs have been handed out and Cohen hopes to launch similar schemes in Southampton, Birmingham and Bristol. “We managed to deliver this project by just getting people to work together and I don’t think it will need any funding. It started off as a community project and I hope it stays that way. “I once gave a mug to a girl at church and she was so thankful. She said: ‘Sometimes all I want is just someone to look at me, acknowledge me and see me.’ That stayed with me. It’s not much to say hello to a homeless person. Sometimes people just want someone to talk to.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/being-cash-free-puts-us-at-risk-of-attack-swedes-turn-against-cashlessness",
    "date": "2018-04-03",
    "transcript": "It is hard to argue that you cannot trust the government when the government isn’t really all that bad. This is the problem facing the small but growing number of Swedes anxious about their country’s rush to embrace a cash-free society. Most consumers already say they manage without cash altogether, while shops and cafes increasingly refuse to accept notes and coins because of the costs and risk involved. Until recently, however, it has been hard for critics to find a hearing. “The Swedish government is a rather nice one, we have been lucky enough to have mostly nice ones for the past 100 years,” says Christian Engström, a former MEP for the Pirate Party and an early opponent of the cashless economy. “In other countries there is much more awareness that you cannot trust the government all the time. In Sweden it is hard to get people mobilised.” There are signs this might be changing. In February, the head of Sweden’s central bank warned that Sweden could soon face a situation where all payments were controlled by private sector banks. The Riksbank governor, Stefan Ingves, called for new legislation to secure public control over the payments system, arguing that being able to make and receive payments is a “collective good” like defence, the courts, or public statistics. “Most citizens would feel uncomfortable to surrender these social functions to private companies,” he said. “It should be obvious that Sweden’s preparedness would be weakened if, in a serious crisis or war, we had not decided in advance how households and companies would pay for fuel, supplies and other necessities.” The central bank governor’s remarks are helping to bring other concerns about a cash-free society into the mainstream, says Björn Eriksson, 72, a former national police commissioner and the leader of a group called the Cash Rebellion, or Kontantupproret. Until now, Kontantupproret has been dismissed as the voice of the elderly and the technologically backward, Eriksson says. “When you have a fully digital system you have no weapon to defend yourself if someone turns it off,” he says. “If Putin invades Gotland [Sweden’s largest island] it will be enough for him to turn off the payments system. No other country would even think about taking these sorts of risks, they would demand some sort of analogue system.” In this sense, Sweden is far from its famous concept of lagom – “just the right amount” – but instead is “100% extreme”, Eriksson says, by investing so much faith in the banks. “This is a political question. We are leaving these decisions to four major banks who form a monopoly in Sweden.” No system based on technology is invulnerable to glitches and fraud, says Mattias Skarec, 29, a digital security consultant. Yet Sweden is divided into two camps: the first says “we love the new technology”, while the other just can’t be bothered, Skarec says. “We are naive to think we can abandon cash completely and rely on technology instead.” Skarec points to problems with card payments experienced by two Swedish banks just during the past year, and by Bank ID, the digital authorisation system that allows people to identify themselves for payment purposes using their phones. Fraudsters have already learned to exploit the system’s idiosyncrasies to trick people out of large sums of money, even their pensions. The best case scenario is that we are not as secure as we think, Skarec says – the worst is that IT infrastructure is systemically vulnerable. “We are lucky that the people who know how to hack into them are on the good side, for now,” he says. “But we don’t know how things will progress. It’s not that easy to attack devices today, but maybe it will become easier to do so in the future.” The banks recognise that digital payments can be vulnerable, just like cash. “Of course there are people trying to abuse them, but they are no more vulnerable than any other method of payment,” says Per Ekwall, a spokesperson for Swish, the immensely popular mobile payments system owned by Sweden’s banks. “From a macro perspective Swish has made it safer, and cheaper,” he says. There is little point in fighting a trend that customers themselves are driving, the banks argue. But an opinion poll this month revealed unease among Swedes, with almost seven out of 10 saying they wanted to keep the option to use cash, while just 25% wanted a completely cashless society. MPs from left and right expressed concerns at a recent parliamentary hearing. Parliament is conducting a cross-party review of central bank legislation that will also investigate the issues surrounding cash. The Pirate Party – which made its name in Sweden for its opposition to state and private sector surveillance – welcomes a higher political profile for these issues. Look at Ireland, Christian Engström says, where abortion is illegal. It is much easier for authorities to identify Irish women who have had an abortion if the state can track all digital financial transactions, he says. And while Sweden’s government might be relatively benign, a quick look at Europe suggests there is no guarantee how things might develop in the future. “If you have control of the servers belonging to Visa or MasterCard, you have control of Sweden,” Engström says. “In the meantime, we will have to keep giving our money to the banks, and hope they don’t go bankrupt – or bananas.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/30/mumbai-beach-goes-from-dump-to-turtle-hatchery-in-two-years",
    "date": "2018-03-30",
    "transcript": "Hatchlings from a vulnerable turtle species have been spotted for the first time in decades on a Mumbai beach that was rejuvenated in the past two years by a massive volunteer cleanup operation. At least 80 Olive Ridley turtles have made their way into the Arabian Sea from nests on the southern end of Versova beach in the past week, protected from wild dogs and birds of prey by volunteers who slept overnight in the sand to watch over them. Versova has undergone what the United Nations has called the “world’s largest beach cleanup project” over the past two years, transformed from a shin-deep dump yard for plastics and rubbish to a virtually pristine piece of coastline. The man who leads the ongoing cleanup operation, the lawyer Afroz Shah, said he started anticipating the turtle hatchings two months ago when farmers on the southern end of the two-mile (3km) beach reported seeing turtles in the sand. “The moment we got that news I knew something big was going to happen,” he told the Guardian. Last Thursday, some of his volunteers called to say they had spotted dozens of baby Olive Ridley turtles emerging from their nests. He called the forest department and then went down to the beach with about 25 others, guarding the area while the tiny creatures hobbled across the sand, “making sure not one hatchling suffered a death”, he said. The Olive Ridley species, thought to be named for the olive-green hue of its upper shell, is the smallest and most abundant sea turtle in the ocean, but is still classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Mothers of the species lay eggs in an enormous mass-nesting process known as arribada. Last month on the coast of the eastern Indian state of Odisha, a record 428,083 Olive Ridley turtles nested simultaneously at the Rushikulya rookery. Though they nest elsewhere in Mumbai, none had been sighted on Versova beach in decades, due to the acute pollution problem there, Shah said. “I had tears in my eyes when I saw them walking towards the ocean.” Sumedha Korgaonkar, who is completing a PhD on Olive Ridley turtles with the Wildlife Institute of India, said it was possible small numbers of the turtles had been nesting on the beach in past years. “We can’t say for sure since regular patrolling for turtles nests is not done in Mumbai,” she said. “Beach cleanups definitely have a positive effect on nesting turtles. Many beaches which are major nesting sites are cleaned prior and during the nesting season by villagers, which increases the chances of getting nests [there].” For more than two years, Shah has been leading volunteers in manually picking up rubbish from Versova beach and teaching sustainable waste practices to villagers and people living in slums along the coastline and the creeks leading into it. About 55,000 people live along the beach and the waterways that feed it in the crowded megacity. Shah said he taught them by example, offering to clean communal toilets and pick up rubbish himself before he ever sought their help. “For the first six to eight weeks, nobody joined,” he said. “Then two men approached me and said, very politely, ‘Please sir, can we wear your gloves?’ Both of them just came and joined me. That’s when I knew it was going to be a success.” He said the team had cleaned 13m kg of debris from the beach in the past two years and are still going, though their campaign was briefly abandoned in November because of “administrative lethargy” and harassment of volunteers. India has some of the most polluted waterways and beaches in the world due to rapid, unplanned urbanisation, overpopulation and neglectful attitudes, including to public littering. “There has been a loss of a sense of belonging,” Shah said. “You can have laws, policies, regulations in place, but if the community doesn’t have a sense of belonging, you can see what happens.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/29/heck-it-was-productive-new-zealand-employees-try-four-day-week",
    "date": "2018-03-29",
    "transcript": "On the first long weekend of her employer’s experiment with a four-day working week, Kirsten Taylor freaked out a little bit. Like a housework hurricane, she got through mounds of clothes-washing, weeded the garden, cleaned the windows and mowed the lawn. It had been lovely to spend extra time with her 21-month-old son, but by the end of the third day off she was shattered. “I actually found that day really hard. I ran myself ragged,” laughs Taylor, who is a solo mother. “I hadn’t yet programmed that routine into my life. I thought: I don’t know when the next one of these is coming, I better get everything done. I don’t think I did it well, but heck it was a productive day!” Taylor is one of 200 employees at New Zealand trustee company Perpetual Guardian, which is halfway through a six-week long trial which could have profound implications for the future of labour. Staff are working four days a week but getting paid for five. The experiment began in early March and will conclude in mid-April, after which productivity data will be collated and analysed. Employees will find out if the new routine will be adopted full-time in July. New Zealanders work an average of 1,752 hours a year, making them close to average compared with their OECD peers. Germans spend the least amount of time working annually, closely followed by Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, while Mexicans, Koreans and Costa Ricans clock the most. Luxembourg is the most productive country in the world, despite its workers toiling away for an average of only 29 hours per week. Last year the Autonomy Institute made renewed calls for the implementation of a four-day week, saying it would help even out the unhealthy distribution of work and shift the focus to producing better work in a shorter time. Christine Brotherton, head of people and capability for Perpetual Guardian, said many employees brought a similar level of focus to making the most of the extra day off as they would apply to their work. “People have been thinking quite hard about that third day off and how best to use it so it can change their life. Some people come back to work and are incredibly energised,” says Brotherton. “People have been training for marathons, going to the dentist, getting their car serviced, or doing the shopping for their elderly parents. All the stuff that has been put on the back burner, but either helps themselves or their family. Life administration. “But some people haven’t quite realised that if we have three days off, the four at the office have to be very productive, and we need to address that,” she adds. For the last two years a Swedish care home trialled a six-hour work day, with mixed results. Benefits included a 10% drop in sick leave and higher job satisfaction, but overall increased costs by 20%. Amazon is also reportedly piloting a 30-hour work week for some employees. Whilst workers on the 30-hour work week receive the same benefits as full-time employees, they earn 75% of the salary – and results aren’t in yet on the pilot’s outcomes. KPMG and Deloitte offer four-day work weeks to some employees (with certain conditions attached), while Google allows some employees full control over 20% of their working week, hoping that the creative freedom will lead to new ideas and innovations. Perpetual Guardian’s CEO, Andrew Barnes, a Briton, says the experiment is generating interesting data, which will be analysed by academics at two leading New Zealand universities before a decision on extending the trial is made. According to Barnes, some employees have found the reduced time to complete their work stressful. “People were really positive going in, then a bit negative, then positive again,” says Barnes. “In general terms, people are more positive because they are suddenly able to do things that they otherwise couldn’t do.” Supporters of reduced working hours have been cheering on the trial. “I don’t feel the pressure for it to succeed, but I think my staff do. People are telling me: we have to make this work for New Zealand,” says Barnes. “From my point of view, it’s very difficult as an owner of a business to see any way that this is not positive for me at the moment.” But he expressed disappointment at the lack of interest in the trial shown by the New Zealand government, despite its potential implications for addressing issues from work/life balance and the gender pay gap to the health and mental wellbeing of working New Zealanders. Having survived her day of housework, Kirsten Taylor has now settled into the new routine. She loves spending more time with her son, saving money on childcare and getting through her to-do list. Her personality and “head down, bum up” work style suit the arrangement perfectly, she says. While her colleagues still socialise during the work day, the office space is quieter and more concentrated, and “water-cooler chats” are briefer. “I am feeling significantly better equipped when I begin the work week now,” she says. “[The trial] was definitely more pressurised than I would ever have expected. But now I am nervous about when it ends. I don’t know anyone who wants to return to the old routine.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "It’s the stuff of nightmares. You wander down a road where most of the shops are boarded up. The bookmakers is open, but reeks of desperation, with gamblers hunched over fixed-odds machines. Next door, the payday loans place looks quiet, as does the pawnbroker. Moving on swiftly through a rising tide of discarded takeaway food containers, you reach the only entertainment in town: the tanning parlour. You start running now. Even the charity shops have closed down. The pound shop has a sale. You wake in a mucksweat, praying that this is not a vision of the future for the British high street. The figures, however, suggest these dystopian scenes are uncomfortably close to reality. According to the Centre for Retail Research, more than 11,000 major high street outlets have gone bust since 2008, affecting almost 140,000 employees. And, although the years 2008 and 2012 were the worst, the last 12 months have been traumatic, too. Agent Provocateur, Jaeger and Store Twenty One have gone under, and it’s not only clothing retailers: photo studios, ice-cream parlours, pet-grooming centres, toyshops and bike shops have all buckled. Even the sex-toy industry is feeling the pinch: the Warrington-based chain Nice ’n’ Naughty briefly went into administration in January 2018. The latest victims, not unexpectedly in business circles, have been Toys R Us and Maplin. Mothercare is restructuring its finances, Debenhams is considering closures, Claire’s has declared bankruptcy and Jones Bootmaker has closed branches and been rescued for the second time in a year. The one consolatory note of recent times has been that cafes and restaurants were doing well. No more. Earlier this year, it was reported that Jamie’s Italian and Byron Burgers are losing a third of their roster, more than 30 outlets. That news was quickly followed by the announcement that Jamie Oliver’s Barbecoa had gone into administration, as has Square Pie. Prezzo is closing 94 restaurants. The accountancy firm Moore Stephens reports more than 1,500 restaurant insolvencies in the UK in 2017, and says that almost 15,000 others are under threat. One group not going out of business appears to be the experts commissioned to report on the decline. The average British high street would sink under the weight of all the pie charts and sage advice. A typical comment goes: “Higher spending can be generated by a diverse town centre which can satisfy customers’ needs for immediate purchase of the goods they want.” In other words: if it’s in stock, people might buy it. Among all the reports on high streets, the one that stands out for its clarity and intelligence comes from the retail guru Mary Portas. In 2011 she laid out the problems – supermarket sprawl, out-of-town shopping, the internet, and poor communication between councils, traders and landlords. She concluded, in a typically forthright manner: “We have sacrificed communities for convenience.” What is certain is that the traditional high street of the last 50 years, founded on chain stores and well-known brands, is undergoing a brutal transformation. There are also, however, signs of what might emerge from this period of revolutionary change. In York’s Bishopthorpe Road – Bishy Road to the local community – I settle down in the window of a high-street cafe-restaurant-bakery. Beppe Lombardo’s Sicilian food outlet, Trinacria, is full of people having a mid-morning coffee; some are sampling the impressive range of homemade pastries and cakes, while a clutch of small children linger near the ice-cream display. “When I came to York in 2001, there was no good ice-cream,” says Lombardo, his expression hinting at the profound shock he had felt. “Not like proper Sicilian ice-cream.” He waves to a friend outside on the pavement. Lombardo waves a lot. He not only brought Sicilian ice-cream to York, he also brought a high standard of sociability and friendliness. He is involved in plans to stage a street Olympics and a dog show, and to use street art to engage with visitors. Does he worry about the economic downturn? “We are doing OK here. I don’t think we need any more cafes and restaurants, but things are OK.” Bishopthorpe Road is one of a few high streets around the country that have bucked the downward trend, managing to revive and reinvent itself during one of the harshest retailing recessions ever. That is in stark contrast to York’s premier shopping strip, Coney Street, where 20% of units lie empty. What really hurts is that some of these outlets are the most beautiful storefronts in England: when Jones Bootmaker closed nearby, it shuttered the windows on the magnificent, gabled birthplace of explorer Thomas Herbert, a man who witnessed another brutal revolution in his time, standing behind Charles I on the scaffold in 1649. Less than a mile away, a stroll down Bishopthorpe Road reveals many of the elements that are on everyone’s wishlist for a decent local high street: a handful of excellent cafes and restaurants, hardware shop, chemist, baker, two greengrocers, a brace of small supermarkets, pub, bike shop, deli and butcher. Most are independent, and many have won awards. The street was voted Britain’s best high street in 2015. “Bishy Road fully deserves the title,” said Marcus Jones, minister for high streets at the time. “We’ll be sharing Bishy’s top tips with other high streets across the country to make sure others learn from their success.” What is really fascinating about this success is that it is not a glamorous location, a street laden with tourist attractions or backed by upmarket housing; it is a socially mixed area and, at first glance, a very ordinary British shopping street. How did it pull off such a trick? I go to see Johnny Hayes, local councillor and co-owner of Frankie and Johnny’s kitchenware shop, and Andy Shrimpton from the Cycle Heaven bike shop. Both have lived and worked in the area for more than 30 years and were instrumental in turning Bishopthorpe Road around. “It was quite depressed back in the late 70s,” says Hayes. “The council had a plan to bulldoze a dual-carriageway ring road through the area – you know, the car was the undisputed king in those days. The plan was never implemented, but it created uncertainty.” By 2008 a fifth of shops were empty, several others were hanging on, and even the bargain booze shop was struggling. “When the post office closed, I really thought we were in trouble,” says Hayes. “In fact it was the start of the upswing. Two things happened. We got the Pig and Pastry cafe opening – local owners who knew everyone and worked damn hard to make a brilliant little place to eat – and then in 2010 Andy came to me with an idea.” “I was inspired by cycling trips to Copenhagen,” says Shrimpton. “There was a sense of neighbourhood and community … I thought, why can’t all cities be like this?” It was a simple plan. Gather all the shops together under one banner, or more precisely one website, and launch it with a street party. “It was a eureka moment,” says Hayes. “At 6pm we closed the road to traffic. There was hardly a soul about. We put up some bunting and set out a few stalls. By 6.20 there were 3,000 people out there. The butcher gave away burgers, there were bands, people were dancing. I could not believe it. I realised there was so much goodwill. I thought, ‘We are going to be all right.’” What Hayes was witnessing, on a grand scale, was the creation of what urban planners call “a sticky street”. The phrase was popularised by the Canadian planner Brent Toderian, who has helped redesign cities all around the world. “Our conversations about streets were always about movement for cars, or movement for people,” Toderian says. “The measurements for success from engineers were about how many cars or people we could move through a space as quickly as possible. But there was very little conversation about how people actually use, enjoy and love streets, and how lingering should actually be a measurable definition of success for a great street.” Toderian has a refreshing, real-world practicality. He cites the visionary Danish architect and designer Jan Gehl, who in the early 1960s synthesised psychology and architecture to reboot the planners’ approach to city living. Gehl railed against “bird shit” architecture and towers dropped in from the heavens by globe-trotting architects, and championed the pedestrian and the cyclist. A couple of years ago, back on Bishopthorpe Road, the cafe owners had spotted a bit of potential “stickiness” for themselves. The Victorian architects who had raised the terraced houses here back in the 1860s had given each property a forecourt garden. The houses had soon become shops and the gardens were lost to the pavement. Now the cafes claimed it back, putting in chairs and tables to create an opportunity for visitors to stick around. Something about this reminded me of old Calcutta. Amid the exuberant vitality of that city, cars and people certainly move slowly, but the space is often creative, sociable and hugely enjoyable. In comparison, I recently sailed down the Thames through London, noting the sterile apartment towers thrown up by speculative builders. At the foot of each was an empty space – clean, manicured and without any human presence. Dr Johnson needs rephrasing: when London is tired of man, London is tired of life. Of course, nostalgia for a supposed golden age of the high street could be misleading. But, I wondered, was there ever a heyday for the high street? Local York historian Sue Major is cautious about suggesting Bishopthorpe Road street life was better in Victorian times. But, she says, “It might be argued that with heavier traffic along the street in the last 50 years, people have been less likely to spend time there for leisure.” Looking through the pages of the York Herald newspaper, there are plenty of suggestions that street life was more colourful and boisterous than today. In the narrow streets behind Bishy Road you could find a brewery, a dye works, a shipbuilding yard, a steam-powered chocolate factory, a candied-peel maker, and a wooden type manufacturer. There were regular galas, parades and occasional trips over the river to witness a hanging. At Martinmas, every November, Wombwell’s menagerie would come, the wagons full of wild beasts hauled by elephants. Some of the lion collection had been born in York’s Parliament Street in 1856. The whole panoply of Dickensian street life was present, including the threat of “pocket pickers” and the possibility of destitution. One local musician, Joseph Sherwood, kept a diary that shows how, struggling to make ends meet during the 1880s, he turned his Bishopthorpe Road house into a newsagents, which is now the Pig and Pastry cafe. High streets may have been livelier back then, but they were a school of hard knocks for business. The photo record for Bishopthorpe Road shows how shops were founded, thrived and foundered in an endless bout of retail creation and destruction. The piano-dealer and beer-seller became an estate agent, then a florist; the Dainty cafe became a baker, then a hairdresser. Others have stood the test of time: the fish and chip shop, for example, is Victorian vintage. Pete Kilbane, manager of the Angel on the Green bar and restaurant, is a stalwart of the social-ownership movement, having started a community garden, cinema and nightclub, as well as the Golden Ball pub (which has over 180 local shareholders). He thinks social ownership has a part to play. “It takes away some financial pressure and means we can have events that are beneficial, but not money-making.” The bar at the Golden Ball tells its own story, selling eggs, bread and pies from local suppliers as well as real ales. Some locals have been coming to the folk music sessions for over 45 years. Kilbane knows the importance of preserving an area’s informal spaces. “We’re slow to get to know one another, aren’t we? So people need places where they have a valid reason to be. Working together on the community garden, doing the composting – that created the relationships that went on to buy the pub.” Having spent years creating venues for interaction, he is now eyeing up the newly available empty shop across the road from the Angel – a rare occurrence on Bishopthorpe Road. “I want it to be another bar,” he laughs. “Then we’ve got a scene, haven’t we?” In the past people went to the high street for shopping and work, just like today, but they also went for entertainment and leisure. That state of affairs may be returning. York’s smaller shopping streets, once shabby and depressed compared with the centre, are now in better shape than ever. With support from the council on road closures, historic streets like Micklegate and Fossgate are holding events that attract crowds. The independent movement has spawned a city map and website. The strength of smaller high streets has not gone unnoticed. Figures from business research analysts LDC show that the number of independent outlets has risen all over England in every region during the past year, while chain stores have declined. When Portas wrote her report in 2011 she highlighted the lamentable case of Ely, a Cambridgeshire town that seemed to be deliberately strangling its own high street, building out-of-town shopping with a free bus service. But since then independent shops have moved in, accounting for 89% of retail growth, and making Ely high street a success story akin to York’s Bishopthorpe Road. Gehl’s influence is apparent in healthy cities all around the world. After his redesign of Melbourne, the number of street cafes rose 12-fold. “A good city,” he says, “is like a good party – people stay longer than really necessary.” On a smaller scale, applying that motto to British high streets appears to be bearing fruit. Portas came to similar conclusions. “We need,” she declared, “to put the heart back into the centre of our high streets, reimagined as destinations for socialising, culture, health, wellbeing, creativity and learning.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "In 1985, one of the world’s greatest scientists rang the alarm. After a career in biology, Edward O Wilson was convinced that Earth was being stripped of its variety of life. Scientists hadn’t even counted all the species sharing the planet, yet they were already disappearing fast. In a paper soon to become seminal, he set out the looming catastrophe. The chopping down of tropical rainforests meant that, within a century, about 12% of all bird species in the Amazon basin would be lost for ever. This was a mass extinction – “the most extreme for 65 million years”. Titled The Biological Diversity Crisis, his essay helped give birth to a shorthand: biodiversity. This new discipline began from the premise that all species matter – indeed, that when one dies out they all suffer. An expert on the unphotogenic ant, Wilson wryly acknowledged “the natural human affection for big organisms”, for sleek dolphins and cute chimps. But he also knew that even a mouse “is richer in information than a Caravaggio painting, Bach fugue, or any other great work of art”. Although an environmentalist, his warning applies to post-industrial Britain too. Because our economy has become more and more unbalanced, with our fortunes hitched to a few industries in one corner of the country, while we let other sectors, such as manufacturing, slide. That last sentence is not mine, but taken word for word from David Cameron’s very first speech upon moving into No 10 in 2010. And he was right: the UK’s lack of economic diversity led it to be utterly flattened by the banking crash. Shamefully, despite identifying the problem, he did almost nothing about it. A decade after the crash, finance grips London more tightly than ever. No longer penned into the Square Mile and Canary Wharf, it now gropes its way along the South Bank and has turned Mayfair into a shadow-banking quarter. The rest of the city centre provides butler services to the super-rich: luxury developers and estate agents, fad restaurateurs, tax-loophole spotters, reputation launderers in PR. For Cameron’s Conservative colleagues, this is success, to be celebrated. In 2014, the capital’s then-mayor, Boris Johnson, rejoiced: “London is to billionaires what the jungles of Sumatra are to the orangutan. It is their natural habitat.” Groovy for the great apes, not so fun for us worker ants. Economic diversity in the heart of the capital now hides out in some unlikely places. Go to Bermondsey, just a tube stop away from London Bridge. Follow the signs to the old further education college, whose students and teachers have long gone. Upstairs is a former home economics kitchen, the kind in which you tried and failed to cook an apple crumble. Except now it’s a farm. Over by the windows, mealworms are breeding. Running along the walls are tanks of fish. In the middle is a mini-greenhouse with huge water tanks where tomatoes and squash will sprout. Any free space is crammed with leafy green plants. And just wait till you hear the plans for a trout farm. Here, slap-bang in the middle of the capital, lies agriculture. Nestling in this abandoned college are a whole bunch of companies. And the laser cutters and 3D printers make it a manufacturing site too. Most of all, it’s a challenge to Britain’s crocked model of how to shape a city, how to a run an economy, and how to affix value. As challenges go, it’s rough and ready, and a tad dog-eared – but it demands attention. This deserted campus was spotted by a not-for-profit company called 3Space, which convinced the landlord to give it the keys until demolition day. Since then it has made it a base for an army of eager startups, who pay a modest rent. This income then subsidises other rooms that go free to non-profits. And one day in 2016, 3Space boss Andrew Cribb rang up a guy he’d met a while back. “Hey, Ande. Remember your crazy green idea?” he said. “Fancy doing it?” Cribb was wrong: Ande Gregson didn’t have one crazy idea – he had a couple. The green one came from reading about food. He’d see numbers, like the UN forecast that, by 2050, 9.8 billion people would share the planet, and he’d worry: how are we going to feed all of them? Then he’d read how 1.3bn tonnes of food are wasted every year, and he’d think: I’m going to help fix this. Him. Without government backing or a multinational’s budget. Him. With no background in food or environment. When he was nine, Gregson wanted to be a marine biologist – but as a child of the 1980s he was given a Commodore computer, and from that point it was technology all the way. His CV was peppered with names such as Apple, BT and Sky. What did he know about public sanitation? That was a big obstacle, which he hurdled with yet more unusual thinking. He opened a laboratory – called Green Lab – which others could use to invent solutions to the looming crisis in food and waste. He wouldn’t employ any of them, but they’d share the space and the hi-tech equipment, and make their own ideas fly. Green Lab is a makerspace, and Britain has more than 150 of them. But You can find thousands of others from Barcelona to Shenzhen. Gregson’s approach is the makerspace ethos in action. Rather than rely on big institutions to solve the food crisis, he just dived in, displaying the same bloody-mindedness that led him to compete in the Marathon des Sables (the “toughest footrace in the world”) not once but three times. Instead of snaring himself some qualifications, he brought in a pool of expertise. And when things got mucky, he got his hands dirty – clearing the kitchen of years of debris and turning old timber into benches and tables. Makerspaces are full of such stories – of begging and borrowing, of just doing it, of fools rushing in where angel investors fear to tread. “Animal spirits” is how John Maynard Keynes referred to it, the bullishness that gets businesses investing and consumers spending. In his canonical The Maker Movement Manifesto, Mark Hatch writes: “Make. Just make. This is the key. The world is a better place as a participatory sport. Being creative, the act of creating and making, is actually fundamental to what it means to be human.” Britons get their furniture from Ikea, their lunch in Pret and their love lives off Tinder. We buy, break and junk – and to hell with the environmental consequences. Instead of that pre-digested individualism, Gregson and other makerspacers want to improvise, recycle and collaborate. Gregson calls Green Lab a “Willy Wonka factory”: a crew of enthusiasts pursuing their own outlandish projects, all to do with making the most of our food supply and reducing waste. Fish skins are turned into leather; tiny green vegetables are grown in repurposed airducts. At Entocycle, black soldier flies are bred on spent grain from local breweries to turn them into a high-protein meal for salmon – a possible replacement for the far more land-intensive soya beans. This work has social value, yet most of the people here wouldn’t get space to do it elsewhere in the capital. The fish tanner, Anoushka Cole, is going through the same London hell as most other 28-year-olds: the only way she can afford her small flatshare on the city’s outskirts is by cramming three people into two bedrooms. A former cycle courier, Jon Katona spent half a decade carting around heavy, urgent deliveries on a precarious contract with no sick pay or holidays – a work-history that leaves him with little cash to get his sustainable drinks business off the ground. Gregson has a solution: outfits such as Entocycle, which has gained funding, can use Green Lab but “silver will cross my palm before you walk through the door”. Others such as Katona pay nothing, but are expected to help out with the composting system. Politicians in Westminster and London’s City Hall have essentially created a business model for the capital in which young people are expected to live and work in intolerable conditions; that in turn starves the city of the new ideas and energy on which it relies. Makerspaces are usually found in rundown buildings, with rudimentary toilets and equipment straining under all that shared use. They are small-scale factories, run not by a big company but by communities of the idiosyncratic and inventive. They are also oases of cheapness in a city that extorts money from its residents – and the great urban theorist Jane Jacobs knew the value of cheap. “For really new ideas of any kind – no matter how ultimately profitable or otherwise successful some of them might prove to be – there is no leeway for such chancy trial, error and experimentation in the high-overhead economy of new construction,” she wrote in The Death and Life of Great American Cities in 1961. “Old ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.” Green Lab bears that out to the letter: it’s a home for the genuinely speculative in an economy that thrives on financial speculation. Politicians love makerspaces – for all the wrong reasons. They coo over their digital technology and are wowed by their occupants’ relative youth. Yet they overlook how makerspaces’ tolerance for the uneconomic makes them so important – and so fragile in a city with galloping rents. Green Lab runs on borrowed things – most of all, borrowed time. By the end of this year, it will be booted out of that college, which will itself be bulldozed to make way for new flats and shops – and London will have lost a bit more of its economic diversity. In just the seven years to 2013, the capital saw almost 604 hectares – about 750 football pitches-worth – of industrial land disappear to make way for housing. The simple-minded assertion that London needs more houses, so often chanted by politicians and pundits alike, takes little account of how affordable they should be and where their occupants are meant to work if the space for employment has been magicked into concierge towers. Gregson is “building a piggybank” to move elsewhere, but is resigned to being edged out of the centre. This is happening to makerspaces across the city. Some die natural deaths: their animal spirits only carrying them so far. But others suffer the lethal blow of runaway rents. Machines Room is about to lose its east London home because its rent has doubled. “We’ve been talking to people for ages about possible new sites,” says Nat Hunter of Machines Room. “Just. Not. Happening.” David Cameron promised Britain that “the new jobs, the new products, the new ideas that will lift us up will be born in the factories”. Although they will never create thousands of jobs, makerspaces do fit the “new ideas” bit. Britain now does proportionately less research and development than Slovenia, but a place such as Green Lab is full of experiment and innovation. If politicians really do want to do more with makerspaces than use them for photo-ops, they could do so cheaply and relatively easily. Local councils could identify empty sites for makerspaces to set up, and could collect registers of residents and other businesses who are willing to help with accounts and marketing and old kit. Most of all, they could lean on Ikea, DFS and other retailers to tell their shoppers about these nearby scrappy little places (who pose no threat to such giants), where kitchens and furniture can be customised by young artisans who are inventive, and a damn sight more interesting to talk to than a self-service checkout. None of that requires money – just some of the effort and inventiveness shown by the makerspaces themselves. The reward would be young people getting a start in their careers, and a city retaining a bit of economic diversity. • We’d like to hear about your experiences of makerspaces, or similar.

    "transcript": "The detention centre sits on the border. Once a low-security prison, it is in a depressing state of disrepair. The private company running the government facility plans improvements, but the flood of desperate “residents” has pushed these firmly on to the back burner. Residents are not prisoners, but a perceived scarcity of social resources means public opinion towards them is volatile; in response, the government has set an extremely small immigration quota. Residents undergo rigorous assessment in order to have their immigration applications even considered. The border is with Wales. The refugees are from England, Scotland, Ireland and parts of Europe whose economic status has crashed post-Brexit. The setting is the near future, and this is a game. Live action role play, or larp, is a combination of re-enactment, storytelling and gaming – players are given a role and act out their character’s actions within an overarching story. These interactive games can last a few hours or spin out over months and years, with players adopting familiar characters time and time again. If you’ve come across larping before, you might associate it with orcs, elves and swordplay – a dynamic offshoot of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons. But although mythical creatures can be involved, a growing number of larp games explore situations, stories and characters as a form of activism. The creators of a new experience, The Quota, decided to use larp to tackle one of the most fraught issues facing the world today: the refugee crisis. Halat Hisar, a Palestinian-Finnish larp, explores life under occupation. Other larps include the seminal Just a Little Lovin’, set in a fictionalised New York in the early years of the Aids crisis. Even a recent Jane Austen-inspired larp had lessons to teach on social inequality – alongside dancing and witty conversation, of course. One worry is that these larps involve people of comparative privilege “playing” at being refugees or people with Aids. Helly Dabill, one of The Quota’s creators, understands the concern. “We acknowledge that people who are not familiar with larping, or whose idea of it remains firmly entrenched in fantasy games with orcs and goblins, are often shocked at the topics that larp is willing to explore.” But, she adds, people also write novels about difficult subjects, or plays, or make feature films. “All of these things can be harrowing, powerful and informative. They make people think. Most importantly, they start a dialogue about difficult subjects.” The Quota’s charitable partner, the Refugee Council, agrees. “Thousands of people, including children, are deprived of their liberty and detained arbitrarily in the UK every year,” says the council’s chief executive, Maurice Wren. “The Refugee Council is hugely supportive of events and productions which, like the Quota, aim to raise awareness of this terrible wrong in an original and creative way.” Larp creation often begins with personal experience. Dabill has worked in Israel with displaced Palestinians, as well as with child refugees. Halat Hisar is run by a creative team that includes four Palestinians living on the West Bank, while Just a Little Lovin’s designers, Tor Kjetil Edland and Hanne Grasmo, are HIV and Aids activists. The impetus for all these creators is to educate through empathy. “Larp is a medium of personal, direct experience. The things that happen in a larp happen specifically to you. It feels different to actually walk through a checkpoint rather than just read about it,” says Kaisa Kangas, one of the people behind Halat Hisar. Grasmo agrees: “We want [participants] to build stronger communities, to understand how it was and is to be queer, whether they are themselves or not. I personally hope that when having experienced how easy it can be to express and accept your desires, the black emotions of fear of death, the hard dilemmas over what to do with their fictional lives and friendships, they will think about what is important in their own life.” But can larps really be transformative? Andreas Lieberoth, associate professor of education at Aarhus University in Denmark, believes so. He says: “The more I study larp and the learning sciences together, the more I become convinced that larps can hold immense educational potential.”. And learning though role play is not a modern phenomenon, he stresses. “Since the 1930s, social psychologists have been aware that we are more open to new ideas, and willing to give ideas that may seem irrelevant or even contrary to our own beliefs fair consideration, if we are asked to take on the role of a person holding such beliefs.” Larp is even used in some schools, including one in Denmark where all teaching is achieved through immersive “learning games”. The Quota is recruiting its final players before the game takes place in May. Dabill says she hopes the experience will change its participants. “You will deepen your understanding of the ties that bind people together and their ability to withstand the forces of dehumanisation and alienation – and, above all, the costs to everyone when these bonds break.” That detention centre on the Welsh border may not be real, but it’s clear the stakes are high. The Quota takes place on 24-27 May in Rutland, UK.

    "transcript": "For one hour every March since 2007, darkness has swept the globe as grassroots environmentalists, schools, offices and those responsible for some of the world’s most iconic landmarks switch off lights in a symbolic call for more action on climate change. This year, the WWF, which manages the initiative, hopes to build on its growing success and says millions of actions will be taken in at least 180 countries and territories. A record 187 countries took part in the event’s record breaking 10th year. An hour is not going to save the world – but a key message in publicising the event is that every action counts and that energised individuals can make genuine change to the way we think about human impact on the planet. The WWF says highlights of its pushes for new legislation include the banning of all plastics in the Galapagos in 2014, planting 17 million trees in Kazakhstan and pushing new laws for the protection of seas and forests in Russia. Here, readers tell us how they are going further than the hour (you should switch off the lights from 8:30-9:30pm local time) with gestures such as refusing plastic, leaving the car at home and hosting events to inspire others in 2018. ‘It is wrong to think we as individuals can’t achieve something meaningful’ – Jen Gale, 40, Wiltshire I’m making my own promise for the planet and refusing plastic cutlery when eating out, and I’m asking all the members of my 15k-strong Facebook community to join in, make their own pledges on 24 March and spread the word. When faced with huge issues like plastic pollution and climate change, it can feel overwhelming, as if we as individuals could never hope to achieve anything meaningful, but this is so wrong! Earth Hour is a brilliant event to raise awareness of the plight of the planet and allows people to show that they care. If everybody who makes a promise carries through with it, and the changes continue beyond Earth Hour, it really will make a difference in reducing the amount of plastic and carbon overloading the planet. ‘We will need to look at every part our lifestyles’ – Tim Eggins, 50, Chard, Somerset I am part of a local community group called Sustainable Chard. We have organised a day of events called Earth Hour Chard, including events aimed at the younger members of our town where they can learn about upcycling, renewable energy, planting and growing. During the afternoon there will be eco talks and workshops where people can learn how to reduce their impact on the planet with topics on travel, food, the home and carbon footprints and in the evening we have assembled live bands, musicians, poets, green traders and therapists for an Earth Hour extravaganza. We aim to engage as many people as possible, showing that the event is more than just switching off the lights: if we are to make any impact on climate change we will need to look at every part our lifestyles. ‘I’ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car’ – Tehya, 18, Zurich I am not just going to turn the lights off for an hour, I want to try to live in as environmentally friendly way as possible for the day. I will tell as many people as possible at school and locally to convince them to contribute to the effort. At home, I’ll unplug all electrical devices and lights during Earth Hour. I’ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car and to use public transport instead. I will not buy any plastic (food in plastic wrappings, bottles etc) or meat (which I don’t do anyway, as I am a vegetarian). In the evening when it’s dark I will try to not turn on any lights and use candles for light instead. ‘We hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation’ – Eric Engle, 32, West Virginia Our voluntary organisation Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action has convinced Parkersburg city government, the county government and the federal buildings to turn off all the lights that they can. We’ll have a candlelit event with acoustic music at a park in the midst of dimmed downtown on the night. We hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation and energy efficiency and to educate on anthropogenic global climate change while encouraging environmental and climate activism and continued coalition-building. ‘Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility’ – Jo Harper, Leamington Spa At the school where I teach, we all wrote promises for the planet and hung them on our “promise tree”. I made 120 vegan flapjacks so that we could have a plastic-free breaktime and the children brought wild cuddly toys to school to raise money to sponsor four endangered animals. At home I am holding a candlelit Earth Hour dinner for 12 people, for which none of the ingredients can have been packed in plastic or use unsustainable palm oil. It’s quite a challenge! Earth Hour is largely symbolic, but it gets people thinking about the environment and what they can do personally. My message is that if we all do something, together we can make a big difference. By making promises about what we can do ourselves, it forces us to consider our own impact on the environment and our own responsibility. Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility. By holding the dinner party and asking some of my guests to make a plastic-free pudding, we have all become more aware of how plastic surrounds almost everything we buy. I now look at my shopping in a different way and I hope that other people will do so too. ‘Our Guides are spending a whole evening without electricity – Amy Billington, 23, Bangor I run a Guide unit in Groomsport, County Down, and we are participating in this year’s Earth Hour by running the entire evening in the dark, with no electricity. We are doing an environmental scavenger hunt around the local area as we meet beside the sea, gathering items such as plastics and litter to clean up our village a little bit, toasting marshmallows under tealights and trying to draw pictures in the dark. We hope to raise awareness of both Earth Hour itself and the WWF aims and values locally within our community. We want to do our bit in helping save the planet and show the Guides that you do not need to use so much electricity. We hope this event will inspire other local Guide, Brownie and Rainbow units to do the same and make this an annual event. ‘We’re hosting a community evening, cooking rescued surplus food from local farms’ – Charmaine Jacobs, Kent I run a social enterprise called the Gastro Hub in Folkestone aiming to connect people through sustainable food, cooking, conversation and communal dining experiences. Our overall mission is to reduce avoidable food waste and carbon emissions by preventing surplus food from going to landfill, through a community-led infrastructure to divert and transform this food into delicious and nutritious meals. For Earth Hour we are hosting a community candlelit supper serving warming soup made with surplus vegetables rescued from farms by the Gleaning Network in Kent. We are hoping to spread awareness of the individual and collective power we have to affect change on our environment. By bringing local people together in a way that demonstrates simple actions we can all take to reduce our carbon footprint, we hope that it will inspire a positive behaviour shift-change in others.",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/hoe-street-central-bank-walthamstow-london-debt",
    "date": "2018-03-23",
    "transcript": "First there were the banks. Sending credit cards through the post, offering easy loans. They overstretched, teetered. Then came the billion-dollar bailouts, recession, austerity, poverty and payday loans. Then, slowly, came the movement: a piecemeal, sporadic effort to buy back the debt of ordinary people. Now in north-east London, an enterprise that is part art installation, part stunt and part charitable endeavour, has brought all the threads together: a bank that prints its own money, sells it for real tender and uses the proceeds to buy back the debt. Hilary Powell and Dan Edelstyn have taken over an old Co-op bank on a high street in Walthamstow and are printing money featuring the faces of people behind four local services – a primary school, a foodbank, a youth project and a soup kitchen. As well as raising money for those projects, Hoe Street Central Bank aims to raise enough money to buy out £1m of debt owned by people within the E17 postcode, in a London borough ranked 35th most deprived in the country. “We see it as a community heist taking on the economic discourse,” says Powell. One of the delightful ironies of the undertaking is that the ‘bank’ could only have to raise as little as £20,000 to buy out £1m of local debt, because bad loans are often written down to a fraction of their face value in the secondary market. “The system forces people into debt for basic needs,” says Powell. “We are the forerunners of what we hope will be a bigger movement for debt abolition.” As the bank did its unusual trade this week, schoolchildren were invited in to watch a batch of £5, £10 and £20 notes, all designed by artists, roll off the presses. After all, it’s not every day that you see your headteacher’s face on a fiver. Bank notes featuring Tracy Griffiths were pegged onto string across the space to dry. The husband and wife creative partnership were influenced by the Strike Debt and Rolling Jubilee initiatives in the US, which started to buy debt and abolish it for ethical reasons. In 2014, Strike Debt bought $3.8m worth of students’ loans, and spawned other ad hoc initiatives: in 2016 TV host John Oliver bought and wrote off $15m of medical debt held by 9,000 people. The Rolling Jubilee campaign has raised over $700,000 – enough to buy back over $30m debt. One of the artists who is working as a money printer at the Walthamstow ‘bank’ (paid at the London living wage) on the project was drawn to it because he’s local and had personal experience of debt. “My parents lost their home during the recession,” says Alistair Gentry. “Anyone can get into debt. It doesn’t matter how rich you are to start with... It feels really good to roll up your sleeves and literally get inky, but also metaphorically, to do something about it. Not just sit around and having a moan.” The bank is open until Sunday 25 March. Artists will print money in the day and there will be a series of talks in the evenings. Edelstyn and Powell are making a film about the project, debt and the economic system called Bank Job. “Imagine if we could get it on every economics course at every university or every sixth form economics,” says Powell. “Then the reach of this goes beyond this high street to all over the country.” The project has had the offshoot benefit of helping to strengthen community bonds as most of the people involved are local. “We live just down the road and that’s a real attraction to it,” says Edelstyn. “I used to feel like I didn’t have time to know anyone in the community. We’re all so stressed just trying to make ends meet. The idea of political engagement with groups in your community seemed like a nice idea but slightly scary and unachievable. “But when I started to research this and get in touch with local projects, I found that everyone has a good sense of humour and they’re all normal human beings. We created this conversation across the borough, and connected different people together. That’s basically what this is. It’s just a way of talking.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "date": "2018-03-22",
    "transcript": "When developers came calling in Oxfordshire with plans to build homes, the locals found the most useful weapons to fight the proposal were not picket lines and bullhorns, but binoculars and cameras. “I’ve photographed birds for a long time in this area,” says Roger Smith, 71, a retired garden photographer and avid birdwatcher. Surveyors claimed there were just five species of bird at risk from the development. “We can show that in Curbridge village there are at least 50 species,” Smith counters. And he has proof: a large black photo album filled with photographs of birds, some of which are threatened species, taken by him and other villagers. He flicks through it. “Here’s a kestrel, buzzard, stock dove, wood pigeon, collared dove, barn owl, tawny owls, green woodpecker, greater-spotted woodpecker, jay, magpie, jackdaw, rook, blue tit, carrion crow, coal tit, song thrush, swallow, house martin, long-tailed tit, bullfinches ... ” Smith believes that bird life has not been factored in by developers eyeing land in Curbridge, a village of 160 homes, where 14 additional homes are currently under construction and a further 85 are proposed by another developer for the green space at the heart of the village. This is on top of huge development to the north of the village, on grassland where locals used to walk their dogs and watch deer roam, where 1,000 homes are being built as an expansion of the town of Witney. All of this is part of a plan to build 15,950 homes in the west Oxfordshire district council area by 2031. In an ecological survey commissioned by the developer for the building already underway in Curbridge, just five species of bird were identified as living in the area. But Smith’s group have counted up more than 50 species and the British Trust for Ornithology confirmed they have recorded sightings of 63 different species for a 2km area that covers Curbridge. Concerns about habitat have increased after French researchers announced this week that bird populations have fallen by a third across the French countryside in the last 15 years, due to the use of pesticides which have killed off the insects on which birds feed. German scientists have also reported a stunning decline in insect numbers in nature reserves. The concern is that modern agriculture and urban development are having a catastrophic impact on species across the natural world. “The loss of that one field in Curbridge might not send shock waves through the natural world, but there are thousands upon thousands of them being lost all over the countryside and that is scary,” says Roselle Chapman, the community ecologist for Wild Oxfordshire. Driven by concern for their birds, and the changing character of their village, Smith and other members of the village have spent the last six months fighting to ensure residents’ voices are heard about the plans. As part of this effort, Smith has written his own ecological survey using the observations of local twitchers. This collecting of records is exactly what communities who want to protect their land should do, says Chapman. “One of the problems is that the public thinks that there are people out there who know what species and habitats are where and that this information will automatically feed into the planning system,” she says. “The sad truth it that some parts are well surveyed. But the rest of it, the bits that aren’t protected or farmed, which still provide habitat for many species and recreational space for people, is very poorly recorded and therefore it looks as though nothing lives there.” She says her basic advice to communities when it comes to land is “use it or lose it”. “If you value a green space in your parish then work with your parish council to survey it, create a management plan for it and manage it ... Don’t wait for the developers to come knocking.” Further east, in Buckinghamshire, the developers are knocking, but their work might actually provide a net gain for biodiversity. Aylesbury Vale district council has teamed up with the developer Barratt Homes and the RSPB to make sure Kingsbrook, a new development of 2,500 homes near Milton Keynes, had wildlife concerns at its heart from the beginning. This involved a range of measures to make the area friendly for birds and animals. Holes are cut in the bottom of fences for hedgehogs, some houses have swift and bat bricks built into them - hollow bricks which they can nest in. Additionally, lighting is bat-friendly in areas where bats are known to feed, fruit trees have been planted in front yards, ponds have been built to replace habitat for the great-crested newt, and, crucially, 60% of the development is green space. “That’s how it needs to work: to have a really wildlife-friendly development these aspects need to be planned from the start,” says Mike Pollard, the RSPB’s project lead for the Kingsbrook project. “It is counter-intuitive, but we’re looking with this project to show that new development needn’t lead to a loss of nature, it can lead to a benefit if it’s done in the right way.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "title": "‘They are our salvation’: the Sicilian town revived by refugees",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/sutera-italy-the-sicilian-town-revived-by-refugees",
    "date": "2018-03-19",
    "transcript": "When the phone call came asking the Sicilian townspeople if they had any room in their graveyards, the answer was a reluctant no. A boat full of migrants had sunk in the Mediterranean. Almost 400 people were dead and they had to be buried somewhere. But the Sicilian town of Sutera, almost entirely populated by older people, had long since filled up its cemeteries. Yet although there was no room for the dead, there was plenty of room for the living. All but a few hundred people had moved out of the town to find work in bigger cities, leaving behind empty houses. Now there was a chance to repopulate. And so, since 2014, Sutera has augmented its fast-dwindling population with dozens of asylum seekers. The school has been reborn; the butcher and grocer are happy with the growth in turnover; the birthrate has rocketed. “In the 1970s, Sutera had more than 5,000 inhabitants,” the mayor of the town, Giuseppe Grizzanti, tells the Guardian. “By the 1980s we were 4,000, and 3,000 in the 90s. Every year Sutera lost 300 citizens, due to unemployment. The houses emptied, the shops closed and [we] risked becoming a ghost town.” Sutera comes from the ancient Greek soter, meaning “salvation”. Tucked into the slopes of a remote mountain, it made an ideal refuge during times of war. Now that ancient purpose is being revived. To Italy’s surging anti-immigrant right, the community represents a 21st-century catastrophe: the displacement of Italians by foreigners. But to local people, it represents an older Sicilian story: of migration and flight from war, and the commercial opportunities those movements bring. It was one of the Mediterranean’s deadliest migrant tragedies that created the opportunity. On 3 October 2013, a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa, 368 people died when a fire broke out in the boat as it neared the shore. Rome asked the nearby municipalities to bury the victims in their cemeteries. Sutera was unable to help, but it had another idea. “I thought that if we could not host the dead, at least we could do something for the living,” says Grizzanti, who in 2014 agreed to let the Italian state settle asylum seekers in his community’s vacant homes. Sutera joined a resettlement programme that funds towns to host a certain number of people. Deborah, 26, a Nigerian victim of trafficking, is one of 50 asylum seekers currently living in the town. She has been housed in a modest first-floor apartment in a quaint area of small chalk houses. “I could not believe my eyes,” she says. “In my country I did not even have a bed. Here we have heating and medical care.” Deborah spent six months in Libya, where she was raped by traffickers. Her daughter Sophia, born in Sutera, is now a year old. Before the arrival of the refugees, the church of Sant’Agata hosted far more funerals than baptisms, but that imbalance is starting to correct itself: in 2016, seven children were born in Sutera, six of them to asylum-seeking families. As recently as 2012, authorities were considering shutting the local school, a massive complex of more than 1,000 sq metres whose entire student body numbered 10. It is thanks to children from Ethiopia, Pakistan and Nigeria that the school’s pupil numbers are now sufficient for its survival. The refugees are also helping to support the businesses of the butcher, grocer and baker. Sutera has become a symbol of integration, with its model emulated by other Sicilian municipalities at risk of disappearing. The neighbouring towns of Mazzarino and Milena have followed suit, settling their own asylum seekers. Nunzio Vitellaro, the coordinator of the association that helps choose applicants to the programme, says: “Sutera shows how the integration process not only has an ethical purpose, but is also an opportunity for work for many young people who, without this project, would have left the island.” To supporters of the far right, the town is a naive project, financed by the EU, for the “replacement of the white race”. But to the townspeople – including the emigrants whose homes have been given to the new arrivals – it shows what Italy’s ailing countryside most needs: new life. Gaetano Nicastro, the son of Sicilian emigrants, sees a neat symmetry in the programme: “Here we have been dealing with integration for 2,000 years, and if then Sutera was the ‘salvation’ for many foreigners, well, guess what? Today, the true salvation of Sutera is the refugees.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/16/teenage-fun-club-how-childrens-centres-were-saved-from-austerity",
    "date": "2018-03-16",
    "transcript": "A decade of austerity has not been kind to Britain’s young people. An extra 1.5 million children will be living in poverty by 2021 as a consequence of government cuts, according to a study of the impact of tax and benefit policy by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Since 2010, more than 500 children’s centres in England have closed. In the West Midlands, 33 youth clubs run by Staffordshire county council were shut in 2014 in an attempt to save £2.6m. Months later, all employees of the council’s youth service were made redundant or redeployed. But there is a chink of hope. Communities have stepped in to fill the gap. If the young people of Lichfield and Burntwood didn’t have Fun Club, they would either be cooped up at home or out in the cold. “The council left the general public to pick up the pieces and we wanted to carry on the work we had been doing,” says Liz Bacon, co-founder of the youth club for 10- to 16-year-olds. Bacon and her co-founder, Kerry McCabe-Crowley, are youth workers who have continued to run Fun Club after being made redundant by cuts. The club, supported by the county’s police commissioner, is a safe space where up to 60 children can gather, twice a week. “We count ourselves as a family,” says Bacon. “We get kids from different cultures and backgrounds mixing when they normally wouldn’t. It’s great to see young people who identify as gamers and enjoy playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons socialising with the skateboarders. Here, they all come under one umbrella.” Elisha Atkinson, 15, is a volunteer at the club. “I have been a part of Fun Club since the very beginning and it has been very positive,” she says. “My self-confidence and social skills have grown, and I don’t know where I’d be without it.” In June, the club is organising a community get-together as part of the Eden Project’s Big Lunch and hopes to expand its work into more rural areas. “We’d be open every night if we had the funding for it,” says Bacon. Less than a mile away, mothers and babies are making good use of Spark Burntwood’s early years provision. Esther Allen, Shevonne Hodson-Walker and Philippa Davies used the local children’s centres before more than 40 of them closed; they founded Spark to maintain the two centres in Burntwood. “We ran them out of necessity because there were no other options for us,” says Allen, a part-time music teacher. Spark offers a mixture of activities and groups, helping mums with postnatal depression, supporting parents who want to get back to work and running a group for dads. “We need to be responsive to the needs of the community and act on those needs quickly. But, more importantly, the community must be involved in the ‘doing’ at every level,” says Allen. Linda Riddet remembers walking into a baby group at Spark for the first time; she knew no one and was ready to leave. “Shevonne came over to speak to me and just chatting to her about my daughter made me want to stay,” says Riddet. “Step one for many mums is leaving the house. Step two is often actually talking to someone. As far as I am aware, Spark is one of very few in the country where the people of a community took a stand against the cuts and said, ‘We need these services.’ I know I am not the only one who feels this way.” Those involved with Spark are clearly proud of what they have achieved in the past few years, but concern remains over the current state of early years provision. “We don’t know where Spark will go next, but we hope we are making a difference for local children and families,” says Allen. “It is absolutely scandalous what is happening to children’s centres nationally. Closing them is a short-term saving that will create lasting and expensive problems to address later in a child’s life.” In Cumbria, a locum veterinary surgeon and mother of two preschool children, Mhairi Helme, is creating a multi-use indoor space with her husband, John. Kendal has virtually no provision for children’s indoor play. Helme hopes her charity, Outside-In, will be able to offer a role-play market town with mini versions of local businesses and services, plus a soft-play castle and a cafe. “We’d like to promote the area’s heritage and establish ourselves as a service to the community,” she says. Initial costs were funded by South Lakeland district council and by committee members, who volunteer in between work and looking after their children. Helme is grateful to the council as well as to the local MP Tim Farron, who tabled a supporting motion in parliament in January. “I know the council would love to see such a facility in town, and it has really helped with business advice and suggesting available grant opportunities,” she says. Set to open in early 2019, with a target of raising £100,000 by then, Helme is confident Outside-In will be ready. “We want to ask the community to come together to make this happen for Kendal,” she says. “We want to create an atmosphere at the centre, by involving local businesses, charities, volunteers and families, that helps to reduce stigma around disability, age, poverty and mental health.” In the south of England, Yvonne Bailey has been helping young people in east London for 20 years, working on self-confidence and overcoming stereotypes. Aimed at four- to 21-year-olds from socially deprived areas in Waltham Forest and neighbouring boroughs, Kreative Culture Klub (KCK) provides workshops and activities for young people primarily from African-Caribbean backgrounds. “We often get people coming back and sharing their success stories with the younger generation,” says Bailey. The club runs an annual Young, Gifted and Black awards ceremony to celebrate achievement in academia and the arts. One previous winner, Jevanni Letford, 28, hopes to DJ at the royal wedding after giving his business card to Prince Harry when he and Meghan Markle visited Reprezent, a radio station in Brixton where Letford presents a show. “Another young man, Kwarteng Sarfo, who’s studying to be a surgeon at Imperial College London, told me that in the morning when he can’t get out of bed, he looks at his KCK trophy and it motivates him,” says Bailey. “He said he remembers everyone applauding and how much that meant to him. He asked me how he could pay back, and I told him to come back when he’s a surgeon and share his experience. If our young people can see what people like them can achieve, then anything is possible.”",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/16/mostar-rock-school-bosnia-herzegovina",
    "date": "2018-03-16",
    "transcript": "Back in the days of Yugoslavia, they used to call music “the seventh republic” – a great unifier in a region prone to division. Today, in a small schoolroom in Mostar, it is still bringing people together. Here, the curriculum is rock’n’roll, the pupils are from both sides of a still-divided city, and the professors are stars. “Music can be used as a tool to connect people, to strengthen the trust between them,” said Orhan Maslo, the 39-year-old director of the Mostar Rock school. “You cannot come into a war zone with a guitar and stop the war,” Maslo added. “But after the war, if there are groups that hate each other ... music can do a lot to reconstruct.” Mostar, once a paragon of ethnic tolerance, suffered brutally during the 1992-95 Bosnian war and has become a place of uncomfortable coexistence. The west bank of the Neretva river is home to the Bosnian Croat population while the east is dominated by Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks. Maslo founded Mostar Rock school (MRS) in 2008 in collaboration with Dutch NGO Musicians Without Borders. There were 16 students in the first class. This year, there are 128 enrolled and 80 more on the waiting list. Students take lessons in guitar, drums, bass, keyboard or vocals and play together in bands. “We pick students of similar ability from the east and west [sides of the river] and form bands,” Maslo said. They have 40 days to rehearse before MRS hosts a concert showcasing the bands to the public and providing a space for the student’s families to mingle. The concerts draw a diverse crowd. “You have someone in the audience holding a three-year-old child in their arms, but also a grandpa with an old camera recording their grandchild [on stage],” Maslo said. “It’s not just about learning the music,” said Semin Merzic, 24, rock school graduate, guitar instructor and guitarist for Floridus, the first band formed at MRS. “It’s a place where everyone can come and they are welcome …believe me, there are not very many places like this in the Balkans.” The contemporary music scene in Bosnia is dominated by turbo-folk, a blend of regional folk music and electronic pop that originated in Serbia in the 1990s. It often features sexual, misogynistic and nationalistic lyrics. MRS is a refreshing antidote, part of a counterculture movement led by Bosnian musical artists protesting against the divisive atmosphere created by ruling ethnic nationalist elites. Many young MRS students are tired of being defined by their ancestry and events before they were born. “We don’t think about [ethnic] backgrounds. We all hang out, play music and drink beer,” said Josip Palameta, 21-year-old vocalist in jazz band Smooth Groove. “The war was 25 years ago.” Music has always played a big role in Bosnia - then and now. Three weeks before war broke out in Bosnia in 1992, a Serbian rock supergroup called Rimtutituki released an anti-war song in Belgrade, Serbia’s capital city, which quickly became popular in Bosnia. “For them, it said that not all the people in Serbia went mad,” said Yugoslav rock critic and journalist Petar Janjatović. During the 44-month siege of Bosnia’s capital city, Sarajevo, music helped keep spirits up. “We didn’t have electricity, food or anything and the snipers were shooting all the time,” said Samir Hodovic, Sarajevo native and vocalist of the band Velahavle. “The bands at that time put everything into the concert. You didn’t have tickets because there was no money. People who could come came if they could run through the streets,” he said. Musicians were among the first to cross the new borders between the former Yugoslav states and re-establish the lines of cultural communication after the war. “It helps when people are chanting songs they like from other regions,” said Jovan Matić of Del Arno Band, a Serbian reggae group. “The elite aren’t doing much for reconciliation, the international community is not doing much … it’s up to us small people to try and reconcile,” he said.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/what-to-do-with-those-divested-billions-the-only-way-is-ethics",
    "date": "2018-03-15",
    "transcript": "Divestment has become a trillion-dollar topic in recent years – boycotting companies considered harmful has never been more popular: Israeli exporters, arms makers, and fossil fuel producers, among others. Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. But where do investors put their money instead? Are companies that benefit thriving? In short, is ethical investing making a difference? Definitions of this sector vary, as do monikers – ethical, environmental, sustainable. But they can be broadly categorised as “socially responsible investment”, or SRI. Among the many estimates of the power of private investment, the most plausible is that this kind of investment jumped to 10% of private funds under management in recent years, after slumming along at long-term levels of below 4%. Institutional investors are also getting in on the act: two decades ago about £300m a year was considered “socially responsible” investment; today it is, by one estimate £23bn. And yet this is still a drop in the ocean compared to all global funds under management, estimated at about $85tn (£60tn). Green bond issues are expected to double this year, but will still be less than one percent of the global bond market. Despite being comprehensively overshadowed by conventional investment, however, there is sober but considerable optimism about the future of SRI. Proactive investors – and the wider public conscience – are pushing governments, and in turn regulators, to demand better practices from business – cleaner air, less obesity, reducing use of fossil fuels. “I would not feel comfortable gaining from somebody else’s misery,” explains company owner and private investor Rebecca Hughes. Institutions too are heading in the same direction: nearly 80% of investors across 30 countries told last year’s Schroders’ Global Investor Study that sustainability had become more important to them over the last five years. “While profitability remains the central investment consideration, interest in sustainability is increasing,” said Jessica Ground, Schroders’ global head of stewardship. “But investors also see sustainability and profits as intertwined.” UBS’s Doing well by doing good report claims more than half the UK public would pay more for goods or services with a conscience. Many more people will want better ethical standards, even if they don’t want or can’t afford to pay for them. “It’s in my upbringing: you treat others in the way you’d like to be treated,” says Hughes. More active financial investors are also taking the issues seriously. Several have indices to track the value of shares in companies which are not doing ‘bad’, or actively doing ‘good’. One is Morgan Stanley, whose two environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices – also covering weapons and women’s progress – were worth $62bn by last summer. UBS reckons “impact investing” – where investors actively seek out companies doing good – is a “force to be reckoned with”. One of the key reasons is the other big driver of the sector: shareholders no longer have to choose between their conscience and profits. Hughes’s £170,000 increased in value by 26% last year – notably more than conventional investments. “It started driven by values, it’s now definitely [driven] by value,” says Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment Forum. While Richard Mattison, CEO of environmental data firm Trucost, says investors such as pension funds now see such investments as a “no brainer”. Is this sea-change having any effect on the issues that investors want to improve? Shareholders and the wider public have won many causes in recent years – reductions in unsustainable palm oil, reduced packaging, new coal plants ditched, high street shops such as Sports Direct embarrassed over treatment of workers. But some of the biggest winners on the stock markets last year were bêtes noires of ethical investors – tobacco, car makers and aerospace and defence companies. Energy stocks have risen by one third in the last two years. And in November 2017 scientists revealed global carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, reached a record high. However, ever-rising demand to invest in companies pioneering and popularising technologies to create carbon-free energy, reduce waste landfill sites, reduce aircraft noise and other improvements to living standards, should make a considerable difference over time. At the same time, existing companies, across the spectrum, from manufacturers to media, are being forced – by regulators, investors and public opinion – to reconsider how they will do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, especially with regard to carbon emissions. “This is going to reverberate across every part of the economy,” says Andy Howard, Schroders’ head of sustainable research. “This is going to be painful for some [but] there are big opportunities for people who get it right.” In the meantime, says Hughes: “If I’m investing into a company that’s helping the environment, or helping women, I’m happy with that. That’s all you can ask of anyone.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

    "transcript": "A vacuum cleaner, a hair straightener, a laptop, Christmas lights, an e-reader, a blender, a kettle, two bags, a pair of jeans, a remote-control helicopter, a spoon, a dining-room chair, a lamp and hair clippers. All broken. It sounds like a pile of things that you’d stick in boxes and take to the tip. In fact, it’s a list of things mended in a single afternoon by British volunteers determined to get people to stop throwing stuff away. This is the Reading Repair Cafe, part of a burgeoning international network aimed at confronting a world of stuff, of white goods littering dumps in west Africa and trash swilling through the oceans in huge gyres. The hair clippers belong to William, who does not want to give his surname but cheerfully describes himself as “mechanically incompetent”. He has owned them for 25 years, but 10 years ago they stopped working and they have been sitting unused in his cupboard ever since. He sits down at the table of Colin Haycock, an IT professional who volunteers at the repair cafe, which has been running monthly for about four years and is a place where people can bring all manner of household items to be fixed for free. In less than five minutes, Haycock has unscrewed and removed the blades, cleaned out some gunk from inside the machine, oiled the blades, and screwed it all back together. The clippers purr happily. William looks sheepish; Haycock looks pleased. “I wish they were all that simple,” he says. Today, the repairers will divert 24kg of waste from going to landfill and save 284kg of CO2. Some items can’t be fixed on the spot – notably a hunting horn split in two, which requires soldering with a blow torch – but very little needs to be thrown away. Gabrielle Stanley, who used to run a clothing alterations business, says she was drawn to volunteering at the repair cafe to combat the “throwaway culture” she sees. “You go into certain stores...” - she throws a dark look - “how they can sell clothes for that price, when I couldn’t even buy the fabric for that much? And then you hear about things that happen [in the factories] in the far east.” An estimated 300,000 tonnes of clothing was sent to landfill in the UK in 2016 and a report from Wrap puts the average lifespan for a piece of clothing in the UK at 3.3 years. Globally, the amount of e-waste generated is expected to hit 50m tonnes by the end of 2018. This is partly driven by consumers’ eagerness for new products, but there are also concerns about built-in obsolescence, in which manufacturers design products to break down after a certain amount of time and are often difficult or expensive to fix. In December, Apple admitted to slowing older models of phones, though it claimed it did this for operational not obsolescence reasons. Repair cafe volunteer Stuart Ward says that when fixing items is actively discouraged by manufacturers, repair becomes a political act. He is vehement about the “right to repair”, a movement opposed to the practices of companies like the machinery company John Deere, which, under copyright laws, doesn’t allow people to fix their own equipment or take them to independent repairers. “You own your equipment, you’re allowed to take a screwdriver to it and play with it,” he says. “It’s something fundamental.” Teaching people how to fix their own gear is at the heart of the Edinburgh Remakery, a store on the main street of Leith that is part repair shop, part secondhand store, part repair education centre. “We do the repair in front of a customer, not out in the back, not hidden,” says Sotiris Katsimbas, the lead IT technician at the Remakery. To do this, Katsimbas and his team conduct one-to-one IT repair appointments for a small fee, as do their colleagues who specialise in sewing and furniture repairs. “It’s a matter of confidence. It’s not magic. Someone put it together, someone can take it apart, you only need a Phillips screwdriver and some knowledge,” says Katsimbas as he shows Daniel Turner how to open up his laptop so he can clean out the fluff and dust that is causing the machine to overheat. Since it opened in 2012, the Remakery has diverted 205 tonnes of waste that would have ended up in landfill. But the Remakery is unique in that, unlike much of the repair movement, which is volunteer-led, it is a viable business, employing 11 staff and 10 freelancers. Last year the shop had an income of £236,000 – 30% from grants, 70% generated through sales of furniture and electronics, workshops and repair appointments. The financial viability of the shop makes it attractive as a model. In the last year, Sophie Unwin, the co-founder of the Remakery in Brixton and the founder of Edinburgh Remakery is setting up the Remakery network to replicate the work internationally. She has had 53 inquiries from groups interested in setting up similar enterprises in the US, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, Austria, Ireland, Germany, Australia and elsewhere in the UK. The network will provide toolkits and advice to groups who want to recreate what she has done in Edinburgh. Unwin hopes that these resources will allow other groups to do in two years what it has taken eight years of trial and error and extremely hard graft to achieve. For repairers, fixing things is a way of doing something about an obsession with consumerism that Unwin calls “a kind of sickness in society”. “This is our little attempt to push a little bit in this direction,” says Ward. “To say, we can fix this, we can repair things, don’t give up hope.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "The National Theatre and Tate Modern are to join an initiative offering people free tap water refills as part of the mayor of London’s plans to reduce purchases of single-use plastic bottles in the capital. Shops and businesses including Costa Coffee and Leon have also signed up to the trial scheme, which will involve more than 65 outlets in five areas of London. They will be listed on a free app and website along more than 5,700 additional refill locations across the UK, and will also advertise the service with stickers in their windows. London is following cities such Bristol and Bath which have spearheaded the Refill movement. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: “A free tap water scheme is long overdue in London and I welcome all of the retailers and business who have shown their strong commitment to reducing unnecessary plastic waste by joining the scheme.” Last year the Guardian reported that one million bottles are sold around the world every minute. In the UK, 38.5m plastic bottles are used each day, just over half of which make it to recycling. More than 16m are put into landfill, burned, or leak into the environment and oceans. The Refill London scheme will initially operate in Greenwich town centre, Lewisham high street, the Southbank and Bankside, Regent Street and London Bridge (the More London complex). The zoological society of London will evaluate the first phase of the scheme, which will feed into plans for a wider rollout as early as the summer. The average adult in London buys more than three plastic water bottles a week, amounting to 175 bottles a year. The production of bottled water is around 500 times more carbon-intensive than tap water. Khan is keen for Londoners to adopt small changes that can have a big environmental impact. There are also plans for a new generation of public water fountains to encourage people to reuse. “We all need to try harder to cut the excessive use of single-use plastic bottles, cups and cutlery that can end up pointlessly overflowing our landfill sites, finding their way into our oceans and harming our environment,” Khan said. The pilot of the Refill London scheme is run by Thames Water and City to Sea, a charity that aims to help stop ocean pollution as part of a wider national initiative backed by the water industry. The Refill campaign, which started in Bristol, aims to create a network of high street retailers, coffee shops, businesses and local authorities offering to refill water bottles in every English town and city by 2021.",

    "transcript": "It had all been going so well. In this smoothest of seductions, John Clark and Alistair Miller hadn’t had to do a thing. There they were, itching to sell their business and get on with retirement. Then one day in the middle of 2015, this American firm – big-time, way out of their league – swung by the factory outside Glasgow and asked: what price do you have in mind? This was followed by an invitation back to the multinational’s European headquarters in the home counties. So off popped Miller. The two sides were inching towards the dotted line when he casually inquired what the Americans would do with their new Scottish premises. This one question sent the needle screeching across the record. As soon as the managing director across the desk started talking about “exploring possibilities” and “transferable technologies”, Miller knew what she meant. Their Scottish operation would run for another six months, a year tops. Then it would be shut – and the order book and the technology shifted down south. And when the factory disappeared, so too would the jobs and the livelihoods of 60-odd workers and their families. Selling up would hand the owners a huge cheque, and leave their staff on a tiny giro. “You’d be sitting back with your piles of cash,” says Clark, “but at some point you’re going to bump into those guys. Some of them have been there longer than me. I know their families.” “Those guys” helped to build this place. Since its launch in 1986, Novograf has gone from printing signs for vans to working with some of the biggest chains in Britain. It has become expert in the branding that envelops you while shopping, eating or holidaying, but which you never take in. Walk around a Co-op supermarket, and the signs guiding you to the wine and beer or fruit and veg aisles will be Novograf’s. Pop into a Pizza Hut and the wood-look flooring will have been made and laid by Novograf employees. Stay at an Ibis Styles hotel and the big fat number on your room door probably comes from their East Kilbride factory. Then there’s Greggs, Iceland, Tesco, Waitrose … Miller and Clark hadn’t poured six decades of their combined lives into this venture only to leave a plump carcass for others to feed on. But the two sixtysomethings had run smack into one of the central problems of British capitalism: how to ensure a company’s owners look after it. Pretty much any spiv with a chequebook can buy a business in the UK and ruin it as they want. Westminster will ask few questions, expect even less accountability, and never learn any lessons. That fanatical British adherence to open markets and property rights leaves the staff, the suppliers and the public counting for little. The publisher of Horny Housewives, Richard Desmond, bought the Express stable in 2000 without New Labour ministers raising an eyebrow. A once-great paper was wrecked and hundreds of journalists lost their jobs, but Desmond pocketed nearly £350m before he sold it to Trinity Mirror this year. In 2005, Manchester United football club was snapped up by the Glazer family, who paid for it by borrowing hundreds of millions that they loaded on to the club’s balance sheet – before shifting its headquarters to the tax haven of the Cayman Islands, a 10,000-mile round trip from the club’s Old Trafford stadium. Philip Green may strip BHS bare; Cadbury can be ravaged by Kraft; Australian investment bank Macquarie can run Thames Water into the ground then, as a reward, get the public’s Green Investment Bank. Each time owners damage a business, employees and often customers get shafted, and local economies suffer – while a handful right at the top cash in. But Miller and Clark can tell you how much depends on the simple fact of ownership. It helps shape the business model, the ethos and culture of a company. However, even as they tried to secure a careful owner for their business, all the plausible options were a no-go. Sell to a rival? Their staff and values would be discarded like used wrapping paper. Cash out to private equity? A green light for a corporate ransacking. Neither man’s children wanted to trudge in their dad’s footsteps, and senior management were not in a position to buy them out. Just then, a postcard flopped on to the doormat. “Thinking of exiting your business?” it asked. When the man from Scottish Enterprise, an agency of the Holyrood government, told them about worker ownership, he got blank faces. The biggest employee-owned firm in the UK, John Lewis, was a Novograf customer, yet all Clark knew about its structure was that once a year the company would be on the news for paying “partners” a tax-free bonus. Which was lovely, Clark and Miller thought, but what did that have to do with them? Employee ownership is as simple as selling a company to its staff. Over 300 British firms have done it, from Arup architects to Waitrose. But it is as radical as giving the people who create a business’s wealth the right to share in it. That wealth is no longer handed over to remote shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. When Clark and Miller “got off our butts” and visited a few of the 95 Scottish firms now owned by their employees, “we learned that their productivity was higher, that they were more resilient in bad times, that they were more inclusive of all their staff”. Giving workers control over their companies doesn’t just make the firms more successful, it also makes the workers a lot better off. Last year, the California-based National Center for Employee Ownership analysed US jobs figures and found that younger workers who are worker-owners enjoy 33% higher wages and 92% higher median household wealth than those who aren’t owners. The British government knows much of this, because it commissioned a report that told it so. The very first line of Graeme Nuttall’s 2012 review reads: “Employee ownership is a great idea.” After lobbying by Liberal Democrat ministers, two years later chancellor George Osborne scrapped capital gains tax for employers who transferred a majority share of their business to workers. This was back when Osborne and David Cameron would hymn “the John Lewis model”. Just like “the march of the makers” and the “big society”, the fad has left little trace. Of the 2,617 full-time equivalent civil servants at the Department for Business, not one is dedicated to promoting worker ownership, as advised by the Nuttall review. The same report also recommends “the appointment of a minister responsible for promoting employee ownership across government”. Yet this department confirmed to me that not even its most junior minister holds any such brief. That silence partly explains why employee ownership remains so exotic. When Clark and Miller announced their idea for selling the company to their staff, they hired a local hotel, put on fancy nibbles and gave a great presentation. “The very first question we got was, ‘Have we still got a job?’” remembers Clark. “Nobody had a clue what it meant,” recalls factory technician David Anderson. “People assumed that everyone was going to have to get a mortgage to buy the company.” Four hundred miles north of Whitehall, the far smaller Scottish Enterprise employs eight full-time staffers to promote and advise on worker ownership and other “inclusive models” of organising companies. The SNP government is full-square behind it, and the Herald, the Record and the Scotsman newspapers trumpet this Isle of Arran holiday resort or that Hebridean jewellers being taken over by its employees. Just two decades ago, newly devolved Holyrood paid through the nose for inward investment and prayed that the multinationals would repay their lavish subsidies with lasting jobs. They rarely did. Hewlett Packard, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and many others pulled the corporate equivalent of a one-night stand. Holyrood can still relapse – such as when it gifted Amazon £2.5m of taxpayers’ money and got back a distribution warehouse in Dunfermline. But Scottish Enterprise’s Sarah Deas talks of fostering a Mittelstand – a German-style dense network of medium-sized businesses that think long term and honour their social obligations. Which is a reminder that British business is not some political monolith – that it can break left as well as right. White-haired Clark is appalled at “the FTSE guys”, the chief executives paid 100 times the average wage of their workers. “What are they doing to deserve that?” Clark is not, he says, “some paternalistic capitalist” or a “crusader”. He’s “hardnosed”, and with Miller got a fair price for Novograf. But they’ve also taken big risks to ensure their workers could afford it. It proved impossible to raise cash upfront for the purchase price. “Not one of the major banks was interested. Not even our own.” So Clark and Miller turned themselves into a bank – handing over the company shares while allowing employees to pay them back over a few years, with interest. And with conditions: as long as the pair retain an interest in the firm it cannot relocate more than 200 miles away, “because that would defeat the entire purpose of the deal”. At the end of 2016, all the shares in the company were transferred from the two original owners into a trust held on behalf of all staff. Just over a year later, the all-new, same-old Novograf still feels eggshelly, as if everyone is trying to gauge what’s changed. Its new managing director, Jennifer Riddell-Dillet, has to tell employees: “Remember you’re an owner.” She both manages and works for her staff, one of whom sat on the panel that interviewed her for the job. Novografers like to tell you that this isn’t “some socialist paradise”, that there are still bosses and workers; but the priorities have changed. Formerly a senior manager for two PLCs, Riddell-Dillet says: “Public companies are only about external shareholders. There, employees are the asset of the business – but they’re a sweatable asset. Here, you think, ‘If I just drive them into the ground it will be less fulfilling, less rewarding and it will be more ruthless.’” Everyone received a decent tax-free bonus last year, and also took part in the first-ever staff survey, which led to sick pay and leave entitlement becoming more generous. Anderson, a Novograf lifer, says: “The people on the factory floor definitely feel more in control than before. Anybody can now say, ‘I don’t see why things have to be done that way’ – and someone’s got to answer.” That power requires some growing into. Production manager Michael Carr has become a director of Novograf, and has struggled to get his head around the accounts. And with no previous experience, Anderson and business development manager Margaret Nelson now make up half the trustee board. The other two trustees will be Miller and Clark, until they’re finally paid off. “It’s obvious that they know what they’re talking about and we don’t,” says Nelson. “Challenging your old boss is an intimidating thing.” But employees will challenge on their expert subject: their daily work. Just last week, an employee showed Carr a cheaper and quicker way of assembling signs. They would never have spoken up before, he says, yet that one simple thing could save “a few thousand pounds in man-hours and material”. In its first full year of employee ownership, Novograf’s sales shot up 20% and the company took on an extra 22 people. That success followed on from a strong performance in 2016, but Riddell-Dillet reckons their direct stake in the outcome did drive employees to put in “the blood, sweat and tears”. Not all the savings are strictly necessary. Not so long ago, now-chairman John Clark, while washing his hands in the gents, reached over to the soap dispenser. He remembers a thin jet of lotion flying out – “Whoosh ... it hit me amidships” – all over his stomach. He charged over to the man responsible for ordering in supplies and told him the new soap was far too thin. While Clark stood dripping, the man nodded. “Aye, that was me,” he said. “I’ve watered down the soap by half to save money.” • We’d like to hear about your experiences with employee ownership.

    "transcript": "Before Viola Simic had a son in 2015, she considered going part-time to spend more time with her child. In the end she decided that the risk of jeopardising her career was too great. An IT manager who also sits on Mercedes Benz’s workers’ council, Simic knew too many colleagues who had taken a foot off the gas in the early stages of motherhood only to find out later that the door to full-time employment had shut behind them. Thanks to a deal struck by Germany’s metalworkers’ union earlier this month, employees who want to take some time out to look after their children or ailing parents may not face the same dilemma in the future. From January 2019, workers represented by IG Metall can expect not only a 4.3% pay rise, but also the option to reduce their working week to 28 hours for a total of two years – and claim the right to full-time employment afterwards. On Tuesday the union called on Germany’s new government to enshrine the right to return to full-time employment in law, citing Federal Statistical Office figures which state that 1.44 million employees in the country are currently working part-time against their will. “It’s always nice to have a bit of extra cash in your pocket, but for me the core win the union managed to gain was the new work-time model,” said Simic, who is now planning to take the 28-hour option when her son starts primary school. “At last we are seeing that employers are taking into account the priorities of a new generation of worker.” The idea that flexible working is not just an inconvenience imposed on employers but a right that unions should demand for their workers is beginning to spread to other sectors of the German economy. In the coming weeks, workers at the German postal service Deutsche Post will decide whether to accept a deal, brokered by the services union Ver.di, that allows them to choose between either an accumulative 5.1% rise in wages or an additional 102 hours of holiday over the next two years. “The argument that there is less work around and we need to rethink how to spread it around has been around for a good 10 years,” said Ver.di’s spokesperson, Günter Isemeyer. “But IG Metall’s achievements on the 28-hour working week have certainly made our employees think about it more.” Before the latest round of negotiations between the services union and Deutsche Post, Ver.di for the first time commissioned a wide-ranging survey of 37,000 employees to discover their priorities in negotiations, rather than relying on representatives. Almost 80% of the workers consulted identified “free time” as an important part of their union’s negotiations. Ver.di, Germany’s second-largest union, with about 2 million members, last year won employees at Deutsche Bank’s call centres the right to reduce their working hours if they worked on Saturdays. Workers represented by the railway and transport union EVG already have the opportunity to choose between wage increases and more holidays. In 2018, more than half of employees at Deutsche Bahn will stay on vacation for six more days than in 2017. Last July, 56% of employees at the rail company voted in favour of boosting their holiday allowance; only 41% chose to increase their wage by 2.72%. To some economists, the results of recent negotiations make Germany a trailblazer in how to face the challenges of the 21st century workplace. To avert the threat of mass unemployment in the face of human workers being replaced by robots and algorithms, they argue, employers need to reduce working hours and spread them more evenly among the population. Others warn that workers’ new flexibility is undermining the competitive advantages of the Europe’s biggest economy, and threatens to exacerbate German industry’s shortage of qualified workers. While the 28-hour working week deal has caused little outcry among employers’ associations, Holger Schäfer of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research warns against enshrining the right to return to full-time employment in national law. “If you create more flexibility for employees, then you need to also give companies more instruments to react to a more fluid and unpredictable situation,” Schäfer said, suggesting there was room to loosen constraints around working hours. German unions’ new strategic priorities are also finding some critics on the left of the political spectrum. Heiner Flassbeck, an economist and former state secretary at the German finance ministry, likens IG Metall’s flexible-working deal to a “smokescreen”. “I don’t have any ideological objections to reducing working hours – my problem is that it doesn’t work,” Flassbeck said. “A booming economy like Germany’s should make compensatory wage adjustments. And there’s no evidence that you can increase wages while simultaneously reducing working hours.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/how-99-strangers-in-a-dublin-hotel-broke-irelands-abortion-deadlock",
    "date": "2018-03-08",
    "transcript": "Ninety-nine random strangers, a North Dublin hotel and a lot of cups of tea and coffee – not exactly the stuff of political revolution. Yet little more than a year later, it appears that an unlikely assemblage of housewives, students, ex-teachers, truck drivers and others has brought Ireland to the brink of radical change to its abortion laws. They met as a Citizens’ Assembly at the end of 2016, a mix of pro-lifers, pro-choicers and undecideds whose views broadly reflected opinions in the wider Irish population. In all, it took five weekends. But at the end of it, they voted for change. In doing so, they did not just pave the way for an abortion referendum in May, details of which were announced today. They showed the world what democrats can do with a little imagination. In a world in which democracy desperately needs revitalisation and new ideas, innovators point to Ireland. They see the move to randomly select a jury to thrash out the issue before a public vote as a breakthrough moment. “Many people were concerned this would be a can-kicking exercise; that proved not to be the case,” says Colm O’Gorman, the executive director of Amnesty International Ireland. A referendum was scarcely imaginable when the idea of an assembly was first mooted in 2016. Back then, few politicians dared even raise the subject of a public vote, let alone voice support for abortion rights. To do so risked electoral oblivion, or so the conventional logic went. As a result, Irish women faced the perpetuation of some of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws, under which at least 170,000 women travelled abroad for abortions in the years since 1980, mainly to England and often in secret. The citizens’ assembly helped break the deadlock. “I think this issue, in Ireland, could never have gotten to the point we’re at today, were it not for the citizens’ assembly,” says Fine Gael’s deputy, Kate O’Connell. “I think we would have been years getting there, if we ever got there.” During five weekends of meetings over five months, much of it broadcast live on the internet, the jury of 99 citizens broke open taboos around sex and women’s reproductive health. Passionate speeches in favour of and against liberalising abortion laws were heard, including from medical, legal and ethical experts. They also witnessed audio testimonies by women who had faced crisis pregnancies. O’Connell has her own story of a crisis pregnancy. She faced the prospect of having to abort her 20-week foetus due to a potentially fatal abnormality, an illegal act in Ireland. After tests, and consulting with medics among friends and family, the pharmacist carried her pregnancy to term. Her child, a now healthy boy, will turn eight in September. Many Irish women would have struggled to find the advice she got. “There is huge value in people telling their stories,” O’Connell says despite the sometimes brutal responses she and others have endured by going public. A majority of assembly members ultimately recommended amending the Irish constitution to allow lawmakers to address the issue of abortion access. Almost two-thirds also recommended legalising abortion without restriction up to certain gestation limits. An all-party parliamentary committee charged with considering the work of the citizens’ assembly subsequently recommended legal abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Proponents of citizens’ assemblies highlight their use of random selection to create representative samples of any given society. That contrasts with narrower, more elite gatherings of elected representatives. Supporters also vaunt the deliberative process that is cultivated, with members responding to what is presented and listening to others’ responses. That diversity of views, so often missing in elected parliaments, helps deepen collective understanding. Participants feel less pressure as there are no elections, and this in turn improves the quality of their decisions. In Ireland’s case, voters can access all the assembly submissions and recommendations before casting their ballots next May. Assembly participants certainly seem delighted to have taken part. Of more than half a dozen consulted, chosen from those who agreed to speak to the media, all were hugely positive. “I’m almost sad it’s coming to an end. It’s been a life-changing experience for me,” said Liz Connell Jones, 63, a retired teacher and mother-of-two from Wexford, southeast Ireland. She doubted she would have ever considered abortion herself but was pleased the assembly recommended reform. “I look back to my mother’s generation, my mother had 11 children, she never had a choice. She didn’t want to have 11 children, she even said it wasn’t right that women had to have children as they did.” While Ireland prepares for its referendum, and likely a rancorous campaign, others look to what is already won. For Oliver Escobar, a lecturer in public policy at Edinburgh University and the co-director of What Works Scotland, Ireland’s effort was singular and significant. “It’s quite a milestone in the field of democratic innovations. This is the first time this has been part of everyday politics,” he says. Elements of representative, deliberative and direct democracy came together via parliament, the citizens’ assembly and referendum. “When these things are combined, you have a democratic system that’s more powerful.” You can view a short documentary about the Irish citizens’ assembly by following this link.

    "transcript": "The fury rippled across Europe during a summer from hell in 2017. In Barcelona, they held up a tourist bus and slashed bike tyres. In Venice, they marched against the cruise ships and raised rents. In some Spanish cities, the writing was on the wall quite literally, as locals told travellers in the boldest fonts: “Tourists go home.” So now, with the summer season just around the corner, tourism bosses across Europe are frantically trying to implement new measures that will keep locals happy and economies afloat. “Someone said there is no overtourism, only undermanagement,” said the World Tourism Organisation secretary general, Zurab Pololikashvili, when asked how the industry could move forward. “What we are facing is the clear need to step up the governance of tourist flows on the ground, especially if we look at growing tourist numbers in general and growing flows to urban destinations.” The range of solutions floated at a tourism conference in Berlin on Wednesday included tightening up on Airbnb rentals, better management of tourism flow and widespread use of digital tools. Spanish officials have already introduced an online ticketing system for the fortified Islamic palace of Alhambra, offering its 2.7 million annual visitors pre-booked slots to balance the crowds. There are hopes in Italy’s Cinque Terre that a similar system could reduce the visitor masses pounding the venerable cliff paths every year. Although not obligatory, its capped entry cards include services such as rail connections and are linked with an app giving real-time information on the numbers of visitors in each pastel-hued village – a subtle nudge to avoid bottlenecks. Venice, Amsterdam and Dubrovnik are likewise trying to nudge visitors away from hotspots, while one veteran cruise ship destination shows how technology and community engagement can gel. Gloria Guevara Manzo, World Travel &amp; Tourism Council president and CEO, points to Miami, where residents receive SMS alerts if there is the chance of congestion from visitor arrivals. “Miami Beach residents can plan accordingly and not be impacted.” At the ITB travel convention in Berlin – the world’s biggest gathering of industry insiders – representatives from Dubrovnik, Barcelona and Amsterdam shared solutions with a packed conference hall. Amsterdam has already banned banned beer bikes, coaches, new tourist shops and cruise ships from its historic city centre. It has Airbnb paying tourist taxes and is considering flat-rate lodging levies that would discourage budget travellers. Barcelona has cracked down on illegal unlicensed apartments for rent, though its tourism director, Joan Torrella, insists that authorities have to work with digital upstarts such as Airbnb, not just confront them. Dubrovnik’s mayor, Mato Franković, hopes 2018 will be an easier summer for visitors and local people because of a new arrangement to stagger cruise ship arrivals. “In previous years we had overcrowding in the old city, over 10,000 at the same time which we can’t handle, so what we’ve done for 2018 is spread that,” Franković said. “So actually we as a destination can handle more tourists from cruise ships than we previously had, which were before concentrated just on three days.” The Greek island of Santorini is also limiting the number of cruise passengers to 8,000 per day this year, while Venice is wrangling a ban on floating resorts in its lagoon by 2021. Justin Francis, founder of the travel agency Responsible Travel, sees the “overtourism crisis” getting worse before it gets better, and doubts that tourism management on the ground will suffice in the face of the growth. In 2017, there were 1.3 billion tourist arrivals around the world, half of them in Europe. More than two-thirds of international travellers go to just 20 countries. “Managing tourism more responsibly can help, but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that,” said Francis. “The world’s a very big place, and the absolute numbers of tourist are manageable, but not if we all want to go to the same places at the same time.” Taxation, demarketing, limiting accommodation – Francis says these ideas have been around for decades. While many destinations still need more visitors for their local economies, it’s largely a question of where and when. Case in point, Iceland. Tourism was a sudden saviour for post-recession Iceland earlier this decade, helping it to revive its economy with record visitor growth, which just as quickly threatened to swamp its capital, Reykjavík, and some high-profile national wonders. In 2017 tourists outnumbered Icelanders about seven to one. But Inga Hlín Pálsdóttir, director for tourism and creative industries at Promote Iceland, says such numbers have led to the misunderstanding “that the country is flooded”. Iceland in 2015 began with marketing efforts to tempt visitors outside of Reykjavík and its nearby natural attractions of the Golden Circle, something she says has paid off. “There’s been an increase in tourism distributed all over Iceland, and we’ve had our general peak, but we think that it’s going to be a slower and healthier growth,” said Pálsdóttir. “We have a whole-year industry in Iceland now: 60% of tourists come in the off-season.” And with Icelandic tourism generating more revenue than its fishing and aluminium export industries combined, she argues that keeping this balance is vital for the economy, the environment and for locals. While it’s clear that solutions for creating such balance do exist, one question remains: will they arrive in time for summer 2018?

    "transcript": "It was a modest ceremony for such a significant victory: it is not every day that the descendants of enslaved people are given the title to their land. But there was no doubt of its importance at a time when the protection of Brazil’s traditional rural communities is threatened by a conservative government in league with powerful agribusiness interests. This weekend, Simão Jatene, the governor of Pará state, signed a document giving land titles for more than 220,000 hectares of Amazon forest to an isolated community populated by descendants of enslaved people who escaped centuries ago. The 500 inhabitants of Cachoeira Porteira have spent 23 years trying to get legal rights to their territory. “It has a very important meaning for us,” said Valterlane Souza, 34, who was born and raised in the community. “Everyone was too emotional to talk.” Some 950km from the state capital, Belém, Cachoeira Porteira is a “quilombo” – a rural settlement founded by descendants of enslaved people, of which there are some 6,000 in Brazil, said Denildo “Biko” Rodrigues, national coordinator of quilombo association Conaq. “Where there was slavery there was resistance. Some quilombos were formed by those who escaped the slave house and others by those who fought and took the plantation,” he said. Brazil has struggled to come to terms with its brutal legacy of slavery. Some 4.5 million people were forcibly brought here between 1600 and 1850, when Brazil ended the traffic, though domestic slavery was only abolished in 1888. Even today, 76% of the poorest Brazilians are black, compared with 55% of the general population. Under Brazil’s 1988 constitution, quilombola and indigenous people were given rights over their ancestral territories. Leftwing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva issued a decree regulating the procedures in 2003, but so far just 170 quilombola territories have been given their full land rights, according to Conaq – 62 of those in Pará state. President Michel Temer’s administration is closely allied to powerful agribusiness lobbies and has eroded protection for Amazon forest reserves. Last year, his government suspended new demarcations of quilombo territories pending a supreme court ruling on a legal action that argued that Lula’s original decree was unconstitutional. But in a landmark judgment on 8 February, the supreme court voted to uphold Lula’s decree. “It was a significant victory,” said Rodrigues. But he cautioned that the government body charged with the regulatory process has had its budgets slashed as part of austerity measures and is barely able to operate. Anthropologist Emmanel Farias Júnior participated in a project to map the limits of Cachoeira Porteira’s land and said the community lives in close harmony with the forest, living by harvesting Brazil nuts, subsistence farming and fishing. Five guest houses offer eco-tourism visits. “They have this very strong relationship with the place,” Farias Júnior said. At Saturday’s ceremony, a song written for the occasion was sung and women performed an Afro-Brazilian dance called the Maculelê, spinning fluidly and clashing pieces of wood. “The titling ceremony was wonderful, simple as it was,” said another resident, Claucivaldo Souza, 44. “It was something that many people no longer believed in, but it happened.” Ivanildo de Souza, 46, president of the Cachoeira Porteira association, cried as he described years of struggle to secure the title, during which the community resisted illegal loggers who attempted to buy their way into the area and plans for a hydroelectric dam project and highway were drawn up, then abandoned. He told how two centuries ago escapees from plantations would climb up the treacherous Cachoeira Porteira waterfall – “Waterfall Gate” – beyond which overseers sent to capture them could not pass. De Souza said the community was committed to protecting the forest that sustains them. “This is our objective,” he said. “We want to guarantee the nature. We struggled for this.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

    "transcript": "Barely a day goes by without a new anti-plastic initiative: the Dutch supermarket with a plastic-free aisle; the Bali inhabitants sweeping the island for jetsam, the moves to get plastic out of teabags - and even out of Lego. And that was all just this week. But can we - or should we - aim to move beyond plastics altogether? What are the alternatives to a material that has dominated packaging for 70 years? Promising new technologies are vying for attention, but plastic is so ubiquitous – and so useful – that it will not simply disappear. Rob Opsomer, systemic initiatives lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation believes that 50% of plastic packagings could be recycled if they, or after-use systems, were better designed, and 20% could be tackled by reuse schemes. However about 30% of plastics need a fundamental rethink to prevent them ending up in landfill. It’s a sentiment that is gathering pace, with small businesses, laboratory scientists, corporate giants and individual innovators scrutinising every aspect of the plastic problem, from product design to sophisticated new biodegradable bioplastics. New materials Among those exploring alternatives to traditional plastics is Jeffrey Catchmark, professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Penn State University, who is plumbing the potential of naturally occurring polymers. Among the team’s successes are waterproof coatings made from cellulose and chitosan – the latter a material made by treating the shells of crustaceans. Not only are these coatings compostable, and break down in the environment, but they offer other benefits since they also act as adhesives, making the recycled products even better than the virgin packaging. “In fact [the waterproof coating] is completely compatible with the processes that the recyclers use to treat the paper pulp in order to prepare that for the next product that is made,” says Catchmark. Israel-based Tipa is one of the packaging companies focussing on bioplastics, and is developing their own flexible packaging. While the company admits their products are more expensive than traditional plastic, the approach could tackle one of the big problems with plastic wrappers, such the films that surround your tomatoes. “That plastic is not recyclable because it is three different plastics,” said Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at University College London. Tipa claims that its material – produced from a combination of biological and synthetic materials – breaks down rapidly in a home composter, unlike most so-called compostable plastics which only properly degrade in industrial treatment facilities. “Just imagine that all flexible packaging will be treated and will behave the same way as organic waste,” said Daphna Nissenbaum, CEO of Tipa. “What we offer is a packing solution that on the one hand is similar to conventional plastic, it brings us as consumers the same benefits as plastic, but on the other hand, [it is] fully compostable.” However Miodownik is cautious, noting that for compostables to catch on, the starting materials have to be sustainable or otherwise make use of abundant waste materials, such as waste oil, whereas recycling means resources can be used again and again. Nonetheless, so far Tipa’s flexible packaging has been embraced by businesses including snack-company Snact and fashion designer Stella McCartney. Others, meanwhile, have embraced a golden oldie: cellulose. Made from the plant polymer, cellophane is the wrapping that got us hooked on the idea of “seeing what we buy” but ended up being usurped by cheaper films made of plastic with a host of attractive properties. Now some, including Nestlé’s Quality Street are going back, using cellulose films from UK-based firm Futamura for their wrappings. Andy Sweetman of Futamura said its NatureFlex range is made from sustainable raw materials and can be industrially or home composted. And while the toxic chemical carbon disulphide is still used in manufacturing, this is now fed back into the system, tackling environmental concerns. Packaging made from seaweed promises another alternative to sachets and wrappers. Jakarta-based Evoware say both food-grade and packaging-grade products are available, with the focus on use in the food and drink, beauty, jewellery and electronic industries. One use, they note, is to package seasonings for instant noodles, with the sachets breaking down in hot water. Seaweed-based packaging has even been deployed for water, with London-based start-up Skipping Rocks Lab developing Ooho: squidgy liquid-filled balls that last for a few days and can be eaten. Among others keen to see their packaging eaten is Peggy Tomasula of the US Department of Agriculture whose team has used proteins from milk to make films which are claimed to be better than plastic at keeping oxygen out. Improved product design From coffee cups to drinks packaging and juice cartons, solutions are proliferating. A host of companies have taken-off, selling reusable alternatives to single-use coffee cups, and many cafes now offer discounts for their use. Others are redesigning single-use products, like the Triocup – a paper coffee cup which folds over at the top, removing the need for a plastic lid. Triocup co-founder Tom Chan said the ultimate aim was to remove the plastic lining too, making the vessel compostable or recyclable. UK-based FrugalPac, is also looking to tackle drinks packaging, with easy to recycle juice cartons and a coffee cup that, it claims, “can be recycled in any UK paper mill”. Rather than using paper with a tightly bonded plastic layer, the cup is made from recycled paper that easily breaks down at the mill, while the waterproof plastic lining floats free and can be scooped off, or removed by filters. “We should be making it a lot easier for consumers to be recycling these products and the way to do it is to redesign them so that they will go in existing recycling streams,” said Martin Myerscough, founder of the company, adding that eventually the team want to replace the plastic lining. Back to basics New materials take time to develop, and the pressing challenge for supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles, or go plastic-free all together, means some are turning to existing alternatives. Iceland has pledged that its own-brand items will be plastic-packaging free by 2023, embracing “a range of packaging comprising paper and pulp trays along with paper bags”. Tesco, which has set its target at 2025, has reduced the amount of plastic in some of its packaging – including meat trays – as well as making supportive noises about the much-mooted deposit-return scheme. Plastic water bottles – possibly the epitome of single-use plastic waste – have already been replaced in venues, including London Zoo which now uses recyclable aluminium cans. Although still single-use containers, cans are recycled at higher rates than plastic bottles, and each is largely made of recycled metal. “Aluminium is the most infinitely recyclable material on the market – as long as you recycle your can it will come back as another can and sometimes in as little as six weeks,” says CanO Water’s co-founder Ariel Booker. “Most plastic gets downgraded, it can’t be formed into another plastic bottle.” While the resealable cans make use of a plastic lid, these are separated during the recycling process, he adds. But new innovations are also afoot: M&amp;S which already has 90% recyclable packaging is among those looking to find new types of black plastic for its ready meals, since the dyes in current packaging mean it cannot be sorted using existing tech and usually ends up in landfill. Clothes While once the idea that a fleece jumper could be made out of recycled plastic was considered eco-friendly, recent revelations about the extent of microplastic pollution from synthetic fibres has resulted in a u-turn, with the majority of modern clothes guilty culprits. Traditional textiles, including wool, cotton, hemp and flax are all alternatives, however that hasn’t stopped new companies springing up with fresh approaches. Among them is Ananas-Anam, which produces a natural fibre from pineapple leaves, while Bionics makes fibres from reclaimed ocean plastic and wraps them or blends them with natural fibres. There is even a new alternative to leather, made from the grape by-products of the wine industry. In summary, there is no shortage of promising technology in the pipeline. But plastic is simply too good at its job to be completely phased out any time soon. “Plastics have come into being because they meet a lot of our needs as people, as humans, and I don’t think we are going to row back,” says Miodownik.

    "transcript": "Martin Rühl never imagined this fight would define the rest of his life. Not for a moment did he reckon it would become so epic in length, in scale, in consequences. He just thought his speck of a town should run its own electricity supply. A modest proposal, but in the Germany of 2003 it was highly unusual. Gerhard Schröder was still chancellor and, although a social democrat, was pushing through more privatisations of public assets than any other leader in German history. This was in a Europe that had learned from Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan to stop worrying and start loving the private sector. Now here, swimming against history’s current, was one orderly, slightly anxious engineer. On Rühl’s side were evidence, arguments and expertise. What he lacked was his multinational opponent’s money and firepower. The mismatch produced a battle that lasted years, that set off ripples around Germany and whose lessons should be pondered by anyone who wonders whether Britain could improve how it runs its electricity and gas, its water, its train services. And it kicked off in Wolfhagen, a somnolent town whose biggest previous claim to fame was that one of the Brothers Grimm had stayed in one of its half-timbered buildings. Fifteen years ago, Wolfhagen was like thousands of other German towns and cities in leasing its electrical grid for its 14,000 residents to one of the world’s largest energy companies, E.ON. But two things made this place different. First, it still had a Stadtwerke, or municipally owned electricity supplier. Second, it had Rühl, who’d only recently become the Stadtwerke’s boss. Rühl spotted that E.ON’s 20-year licence was approaching its expiry. Rather than just sign again on the dotted line, he thought Wolfhagen ought to reclaim the grid for itself – and pressed the case repeatedly upon the local council for months. For all the legal and financial advice he’d garnered, Rühl was not at all sure he’d persuade the politicians. “Lots of people were saying something totally different.” Yet, “I knew it was legal and correct, and morally right.” Perhaps it was his passion that enthused councillors, but “everyone said, ‘Well if it’s good for Wolfhagen, it’s good for us. Let’s do it.’” Now this small-town hick had to tell one of the giants of the energy world that the council no longer needed their services. How did E.ON take it? “Well … ” He remembers a scrap of English understatement: “They were not amused.” The Germans have a name for what Rühl was about to do: Rekommunalisierung. One of those satisfyingly ungainly bits of Deutsch, it denotes a town or city reclaiming ownership of its public utilities. The term was partly spread by Wolfhagen’s epic fight for control over its power supply. The British have their own word: lunacy. No matter how bad our privatised utilities get, any politician who suggests taking them back into public ownership may as well count the hairs on their palms. Rail franchises can collapse in a single afternoon. Energy giants (including E.ON) face accusations of overcharging the public. Water companies can deny the taxman his dues and the public their investment, while shovelling billions into the pockets of shareholders. For decades, Britons have paid through the nose for someone else – often based thousands of miles offshore – to rip them off. Now a clear majority of voters, even true-blue Tories, want public ownership of basic utilities. Yet to call for that very thing, as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn does today, is to face the molten wrath of the rightwing press, the trade lobbyists and the Conservative party. To resist the ideological extreme that the private sector must always run our public services is to be denounced as an extremist ideologue. Rühl faced his own denunciations from E.ON. “They said we couldn’t do it. That the lights would go out. They said we were uneconomical … either the town would have to subsidise energy or residents would have to pay more.” All “bullshit”, he says. Yet the fight brought sleepless nights and days besieged by worry that he wasn’t up to the job. He realised he was attacking E.ON’s business model. “For them it was like, ‘If [Wolfhagen] want their grid back then maybe everyone does.’ I was part of the breaking of the dam. So they had to give it their all.” And the amount they wanted to be compensated for the grid was far higher than the town’s starting bid. Approached for comment on these and other issues, E.ON said: “Wolfhagen was one of the first cases of remunicipalisation in Germany. Many commercial, technical and legal questions were not clarified. That’s why both sides negotiated for so long.” The multinational went back and forth with Rühl for three years, before compromise was reached in 2006. E.ON’s payoff was cobbled together by loans for local banks. His town had won control of its own grid. One epic battle had ended, but many more were to follow, across Germany. A two-hour train ride from Wolfhagen lies Frankfurt, where I met the closest thing Germany has to a professor of privatisation studies. Tim Engartner can list the family silver flogged by his country – the airline Lufthansa, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom. But, crucially, unlike their Westminster counterparts, German politicians don’t privatise because they believe it will lead to better services. They mainly want the euros. “Selling public assets gives them a huge windfall to spend on roads or social projects.” This lack of dogmatism has two major consequences. First, it gives half a chance to any Martin Rühl who can show that public control will yield even more euros for those essential works. Second, when a privatisation leads to worse services or higher prices, politicians can be pressured into reversing it. In the east German city of Potsdam, the privatisation of water pushed charges up by a third within two years – so it was cancelled. City after city has taken back bin collection in-house. And then there’s energy. In 2005, Wolfhagen was into the final straight of taking its grid into public hands. Since then 284 municipalities, including the second-biggest city ofHamburg, have followed suit. Such cases don’t get much of a showing in the British press. The pundits and policy wonks who equate public ownership with Red Robbo, Bakelite phones and stale British Rail sandwiches never mention that across Europe there have been 567 instances of public services being taken into public ownership since the year 2000. Everything from care homes for the elderly to bus companies is now run by continental towns and cities. In the 1870s, Birmingham was the birthplace of municipal socialism: the city’s then-mayor, Joseph Chamberlain, bought the gas and waterworks and ran them for a public profit. Nearly 150 years later, Europe is pioneering a new form of municipal socialism, while Theresa May’s ministers try the most motley methods to keep the failed East Coast mainline out of the public sector. Even so, Wolfhagen stands out. It’s where the Japanese and South Koreans fly in just to take lessons. Visit the Stadtwerke today and Rühl’s successor, Alexander Rohrssen, will list its achievements. A profit every year, which has not only paid off the bank loans but funds the town’s kindergartens. Generally cheaper electricity than most competitors, including E.ON. The number of staff has almost doubled and this still-small enterprise has won national prizes for its innovation on reducing energy use. But to see the real difference made by public ownership you need to head into the middle of the town, to a small cinema that opened in 1948. Kai Mellinghoff is the third generation of his family to run it. He barely remembers the battle with E.ON: “It was in the paper, but people weren’t moved by it.” A few months afterwards, however, Rühl came to him with a proposal. He wanted to hire the cinema to screen environmental films. It was 2006, the year of Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth. Tickets were either free or cheap, all 90 of the red plush seats were filled. This was an event. After the film, there might be a speaker on climate change or electric cars, and the audience would be invited on to Mellinghoff’s terrace. He shows me its postcard view of the timber rooftops of his town and the woods beyond. Out here, the townspeople would clutch glasses of wine and discuss the film, the environment and what part they could play in preserving it. Rühl wanted the now-public Stadtwerke to go 100% renewable by 2015; these evenings were his way of spreading the idea. Renewables meant a forest of solar panels, and giant wind turbines on the mountain that overlooks Wolfhagen. The prospect split the town in two: opponents of the wind farm produced mock-up posters of turbines looming out of a napalmed forest and leering down at locals. The Ancient Greeks would have known what to call Mellinghoff’s terrace. It was an agora, a place for citizens to discuss politics. For all its fury, the debate turned the Stadtwerke from a company under new management to an asset in which everyone had a stake. That bond got closer after Wolfhagen had adopted the renewables pledge. To raise the millions needed to build the wind farm, the town sold a quarter of the energy firm’s shares to locals in a citizens’ co-op. The co-op has seats on the board of the company, giving residents a direct say over how their utility is managed. Even after all the years of fighting, I ask, would Rühl recommend Britons do the same with their utilities? He ponders all the failures of British privatisation – with a special, sad mention of “your rail system”. (Every German I meet uses the same regretful tone about British trains, as if discussing a child with behavioural problems.) Then he says something that sounds uncannily resonant to anyone in Brexit Britain. “Germans say we can’t make decisions because everything is decided in Brussels or by big companies. If you can improve your standard of living and make your own choices, that has to be good.” One snowy afternoon, Iris Degenhardt-Meister walks me up the mountain to see the wind turbines up close. Over the couple of kilometres uphill, she laughs while rehearsing the charged town debates of a decade ago, as if remembering university pranks. A civil servant, she’s also a co-op director. The shares give her a decent dividend, albeit capped by a Gierbremse, or greed brake. As for the turbines: “We love them!” She can identify each one. That way lies eins, over there is vier. I ask a question that would be absurd in privatised Britain: does she feel they belong to her? “Yes!” A pause to consider the size of the co-op’s stake. “After all, we own a quarter of them.” Additional reporting by Josie Le Blond • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist.

    "title": "After the 'sunrush': what comes next for solar power?",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/after-the-sunrush-what-comes-next-for-solar-power",
    "date": "2018-02-28",
    "transcript": "Some people call it the “sunrush”: a 25-year period in which solar power has grown exponentially, transforming the technology from rarefied oddity to the world’s fastest-growing energy source. This surge, which saw 100MW of capacity in 1992 rocket to more than 300GW in 2016, has been largely driven by falling costs, which plunged 86% between 2009 and 2017. China, the world leader in building and installing solar panels, added a record-breaking amount of capacity last year. The technology is even setting records in the grey UK: at one point last summer even providing more power than the nation’s nuclear power stations. But with some experts asking whether the cost reduction curve of solar is drawing to an end, there are questions over whether stratospheric growth can be maintained. And while more energy from the sun hits the Earth’s surface in an hour than humanity uses each year, can today’s silicon-based solar meet our long-term power needs? To meet these challenges, researchers around the world are racing to explore new materials which can eke out more energy from the sun’s photons and be used more flexibly than today’s panels. The most abundant mineral on Earth has become the frontrunner, promising more efficient and lighter solar panels, which could even be made semi-transparent for use as windows. “Perovskite currently has taken the lead among emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies,” says Varun Sivaram, fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations. His upcoming book on solar says the crystal has made a meteoric ascent in academic circles, describing it as: “a material that could enable manufacture of cheap, highly efficient solar coatings that could be unspooled from a printer much as newspaper is printed.” One firm born in Oxford, England, is at the vanguard of the race to develop and scale up perovskite for commercial use. Founded in 2010, Oxford PV initially spent years exploring an alternative, dye-sensitive cells. But Henry Snaith, the firm’s co-founder, changed tack in 2012. “I discovered perovskite could be extremely efficient in PV cells. We realised this was where the real opportunity lay.” The British- and German-based company’s big idea is to piggyback on the success of silicon, which Chinese manufacturing scale and efficiency has made so cheap. Perovskite captures energy from a different part of sunlight’s wavelength than silicon, so Oxford PV’s plan is to layer it atop silicon, to maximise electricity generation. “We find ourselves in a position that we are not fighting a $35bn industry [silicon], we are enhancing it. The idea is use the existing assets. If you do something completely different it will fail. This can complement the existing cell,” said Frank Averdung, the company’s CEO. Working with a major but unnamed solar panel manufacturer, the firm hopes to have a product ready for market by 2019. While the price of silicon-based solar panels has fallen from more than $350 per megawatt hour for a largescale farm in 2009 to more than $50 in 2017, some in the sector think such dramatic reductions have come to an end. Artur Kupczunas, co-founder of Poland-based perovskite firm Saule Technologies, said the cost cuts had bottomed out: “We saw a very rapid fall of the prices. [But] there are technology obstacles [for it] to go down as rapidly as it did since 2013.” Saule, which is in talks with Japan’s space agency, is developing inkjet printing for its perovksite-based solar modules. Today it can only print them at A4 size, but the company’s 25-strong team hopes to expand that to one square metre by the year’s end. Kupczunas is most excited about the prospect of incorporating the solar panels in fabric of new buildings, both in the walls and - because it can be made semi-transparent - as windows. “You can use it in the whole building,” he said, noting silicon was too heavy for such applications. Perovskite is what as known as a third generation solar cell. Silicon is first generation, while a group of other rivals including thin film are the second. Compared to silicon, which needs to heated at more than 1,000C during manufacture for solar cells, perovskite does not need to be processed at high temperatures. That means it is less energy-intensive and is less costly to make. A typical silicon-based solar cell converts around 21-22% of sunlight into energy, and the material’s limit is 29%. Oxford PV thinks that its approach of perovskite-on-silicon can get that efficiency up to around 25%. “What it means is out of same cell, you get 20% more power. That is significant,” said Averdung. Paul Coxon, a physicist in materials science at Cambridge University, thinks that combining silicon and perovskite could be a good way to commercialise the new technology and overcome the limits of the older one. “No matter how cheap they [silicon-based cells] become that limit [of 29% efficiency] will still apply. As humanity’s need for electricity grows, continuing with this single technology this limit might pose a tricky hurdle to overcome,” he said. Coxon said the potential for perovskite is huge, and research is growing fast, as evidenced by nearly 4,000 scientific papers being published on it last year alone. However, he expects silicon will continue to dominate in large, utility-scale solar farms, with the new technology used in smaller, constrained spaces. “I think we may see perovskite cells used in solar tiles in domestic and smaller scales and maybe even in space-based PV arrays,” he said. Some might question the need for more efficient solar cells, when China has made silicon-based ones so cheap. But experts believe there are still good reasons to ramp up efficiency through materials like perovskite. Michael McGehee, professor of materials science at Stanford University, said: “As the cost of solar panels has come down over the last 10 years, the situation has arisen where a little more than half of the cost of putting in a collection of panels is the installation itself. “For that reason, it is highly desirable to improve the efficiency of the panels so that the number of panels that needs to be installed is reduced. Indirectly that lowers the installation costs. That is why continuing to improve the efficiency is still very important.” Of course, there is no guarantee perovskite will succeed as solar’s new wonder material. Academics and companies repeatedly emphasised to the Guardian that development is at very early stages, and Oxford PV and Saule both have technical and production challenges to overcome. Other third generation materials are competing too. “Although perovskite is the lab leader, it does have potential drawbacks, and it isn’t the only promising solar material out there. Other approaches - including organic and quantum dot solar cells - come with their own unique advantages,” said Sivaram. But the biggest obstacles are likely to be financial ones, such as skittish investors who were burned by previous boom-and-bust cycles in clean technology. Sivaram said: “As long as investors and the solar industry continue to ignore academia, perovskite and other new solar technologies could well remain lab-bench novelties.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "date": "2018-02-23",
    "transcript": "Overwhelmed by tides of waste and decades of mass tourism, to some, the Indonesian island of Bali is a paradise long lost. This weekend, however, thousands of people will join in an effort to rid its coastline, rivers and jungles of rubbish and restore its natural beauty. The mass cleanup is the initiative of One Island One Voice(OIOV), an umbrella movement of organisations and individuals wanting to reduce waste and create a “greener, cleaner Bali”. The movement includes groups such as Bye Bye Plastic Bags, an NGO founded by two Balinese teenage sisters, Melati and Isabel Wijsen, who want Bali to ban plastic bags. “This event is not only a cleanup action, it is a chance to raise awareness and understanding about what really happens in Bali,” said Rima Agustina, one of the coordinators. She said the action was as much about changing attitudes as cleaning up beaches. “All it takes is one or two hours of picking up trash and for most people the mindset is completely transformed. They would start thinking that those single-use plastics give more harm than benefits to community.” Bali’s beaches have been swamped by unsightly mounds of rubbish for months, much of it plastic washed in from neighbouring Java during the annual rainy season – or what Balinese call rubbish season. The waste has become such an issue that tourists are being scared away. “Many tourists have reported that they don’t want to come back to Bali after seeing how bad the trash is,” said Sara Craves, an OIOV spokeswoman. Indonesia is the second-largest plastic polluter in the world after China, with 200,000 tonnes of plastic flowing into its oceans via rivers and streams each year. The initiative echoes other movements around the world trying to tackle the steady burial of the earth’s beauty under mounds of consumer jetsam. Volunteers in Mumbai have been waging war on detritus on the city beaches for several years. Readers of this series, The Upside, have been in touch to point to local initiatives everywhere from Devizes in England to Lodwar in Kenya. The OIOV initiative will collect tonnes of rubbish in every region in Bali and take it to village-scale and industrial sorting centres. Some will be upcycled or turned into EcoBricks. The significant quantities of waste that flow over from Indonesia’s larger islands are one element of the problem in Bali. A small island ill-equipped to cope with endless hotel developments and the millions of tourists that visit each year, Bali alone produces about 5,000 cubic metres of waste a day. With five legal rubbish dumps on the island, only about 25% of its waste is collected through official channels. The rest is burned, or dumped on roadsides and mountains and in rivers and the ocean. Harriet Burrows, a British teacher from Bali’s Green School, will be attending cleanups on Saturday, accompanied by kindergarten and high school students and their parents in what she says is a whole-community event. “People can take part in three cleans in one day, which is pretty incredible,” said Burrows. “So you can go from where you live to the beaches where you walk your dog, to the beaches where you surf, so it’s the idea of really focusing in on places that make up this experience of living in Bali.” Saturday’s event even has its own theme song, Satu Pulau Satu Suara, or One island one voice, a collaboration between local and international musicians that calls for the island to be left “just the way we found her”. The cleanup organisers say they do not expect to turn Bali’s rubbish woes around overnight. “Cleanups are not the solution,” said Craves. “They are just the way to raise awareness and a way to bring people together, and get them involved in the problem so we can start to find solution.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/21/hundreds-of-rough-sleepers-in-scotland-to-be-offered-homes",
    "date": "2018-02-21",
    "transcript": "At least 600 of Scotland’s most vulnerable rough sleepers are to be provided with homes and the continuing support they need to sustain their tenancies, in the largest commitment of its kind in the UK. The Scottish social enterprise Social Bite, which has previously attracted celebrity support from George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, will take a minimum of 600 people out of homelessness over the next 18 months, alongside fully funded wrap-around support for clinical issues, such as mental ill-health and addiction, and more practical concerns such as finding furniture and arranging refuse collection. Following the death of a homeless man in Westminster last Wednesday, the Social Bite co-founder Joshua Littlejohn said it was inevitable that more rough sleepers would die if the status quo continued, adding that he hoped that the project might have “significant lessons for the rest of the UK”. Scotland, which had almost eliminated street homelessness after pioneering legislation passed by Holyrood in 2003, has recently experienced an increase in rough sleeping as welfare cuts have tipped more people into domestic insecurity. According to Shelter Scotland, there are now an estimated 5,000 rough sleepers across the year. Rough sleeping in England has increased for seven consecutive years, with official figures showing 4,751 people slept outside overnight in 2017. Littlejohn said: “The system at the moment doesn’t make sense in terms of compassion for individuals, like that man who died, in the most acute housing need. Nor does it make sense economically because the status quo is very expensive, and all the international evidence shows that we save money by getting these individuals into mainstream tenancies.” From founding, in 2012, the Social Bite sandwich chain, which has formerly homeless people making up a quarter of its staff, Littlejohn has become a leading advocate for Housing First. This radical model places the most entrenched rough sleepers in permanent housing before they have dealt with their addiction, mental illness or other challenges. It works on the assumption that people make most progress when based in a stable home rather than a hostel or shared temporary accommodation. Following success in the US and Finland, the Westminster government last November pledged £28m for pilots in the West Midlands, Manchester and Liverpool. A government-funded study in Liverpool concluded that Housing First could save £4m, compared with current homelessness services in the area. Littlejohn credited the Scottish government with a “new sense of urgency” after it announced a £50m fund to tackle rough sleeping last September. Since then, he has been working to bring local councils and chief executives of the largest housing associations on board with the plan, which was welcomed by Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, on Wednesday. A combined total of 500 properties have been offered in Edinburgh by Edinburgh council and a range of housing associations, and in Glasgow and the Central Belt by the Wheatley Group. Dundee council has also pledged 100 homes with partner housing associations. The first homes will become available this spring, with around 33 properties being added each month up to September 2019. The comprehensive support package for new residents will be funded mainly through money raised by Sleep in the Park, billed as the world’s largest sleep-out, which entailed more than 8,000 people braving freezing temperatures to sleep outside in Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh last December. Social Bite will invest £1.5m into funding these support costs over the first year of the project, and a further £1.5m over the second year alongside other funders. The intention is to collect sufficient evidence of positive outcomes – in terms of tenancy sustainment, mental health improvement, and cost savings – to convince the Scottish government and local authorities to mainstream the support funding after two years.",

    "title": "'Equality won't happen by itself': how Iceland got tough on gender pay gap",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/20/iceland-equal-pay-law-gender-gap-women-jobs-equality",
    "date": "2018-02-20",
    "transcript": "On the face of it, Iceland is a good place to be a woman. For nearly a decade, it has been rated the world’s most gender-equal country. It was the first to directly elect a female president, nearly half its MPs and company directors are women, and first-class daycare and parental leave help ensure almost four in five women have jobs. So it came as a shock for Fríða Rós Valdimarsdóttir to learn, when she was managing a key team of 10 home carers at Reykjavik council a few years ago, that male colleagues in other departments, with far fewer responsibilities than her, were being paid a great deal more. “It has been illegal for decades, for jobs that are worth the same, to pay people differently because of gender, but still it happens – it’s simply been allowed,” says Valdimarsdóttir, who is now the chair of the Icelandic Women’s Rights Association, in her bright offices in the country’s capital. Despite an equal pay act that dates back to 1961, Icelandic women still earn, on average, between 14% and 20% less than men. So Valdimarsdóttir and her association were one of many campaign groups to back a plan that finally resulted, last month, in the island becoming the first country in the world to legally enforce equal pay. Within four years from January 2018, any public or private body in Iceland employing more than 25 people that has not been independently certified as paying equal wages for work of equal value will face daily fines. “The legislation will take some time to bed in, of course,” Valdimarsdóttir says. “There will be challenges. But it’s possible, and we can do it. Mainly, I’m just so proud we actually made it happen.” Rósa Guðrún Erlingsdóttir, head of the equality unit at Iceland’s welfare ministry, says equality “won’t come about by itself, from the bottom up alone. Our experience is that you need legislative measures to move things forward. People accept that; we saw it with mandatory quotas for women on company boards. If politicians want to wait until no one opposes it, it will never happen.” Some in Iceland still do oppose it, albeit cautiously. The new law requires employers to show, through certification by an accredited auditor, that their pay management system complies with a national equal pay standard modelled on the international ISO environmental management standards familiar to all companies. The standard was published in 2012 and welcomed by Iceland’s trade unions and employers, who helped design it. Hannes Sigurðsson of the Business Iceland confederation says it was considered sound business sense, likely to “improve a company’s image in the eyes of its customers, and make its workforce a whole lot happier”. It was, however, designed to be voluntary. “It was a carrot, win-win,” Sigurðsson says. “The government has turned it into a stick.” The process – assessing the worth of very different jobs, classifying and ranking occupations, analysing salary structures, collating and recording data, making sure the new system meshes with collective labour agreements – is “quite complex”, he says. “You need to put resources into it. It’s easier for big companies, with whole HR departments.” As it stands, the legislation is staggered over four years. Large firms and institutions such as government ministries and the national hospital, with workforces of more than 250 people, have until the end of this year to become certified; those with fewer than 90 employees but more than 25 have until the end of 2021. The fine for those that do not comply is ISK50,000 (£350) a day. And the public shame, it is hoped, will be worse. None of Business Iceland’s members have openly criticised the new law, Sigurðsson says. “It’s quite difficult to come out publicly against a measure that enhances gender equality. But I think it’s clear there is opposition to the method. We would have preferred the process to be bottom-up.” Others, however, are delighted. “This will not eliminate the gender pay gap overnight,” says Maríanna Traustadóttir, an equality adviser at the Icelandic trade union confederation ASI. “But it is the best toolbox I have seen, and it will make a big difference. It will force employers to think differently.” It will not be straightforward, she concedes. “Deciding the relative value of a canteen worker and a driver, for example. Documenting and justifying everything ... But we now have clear guidelines to follow, courses to go on, specialist software, new consultants to help. It’s doable. Several companies already have.” Traustadóttir cites Reykjavik Energy, the parent company of Iceland’s largest power provider, which was forced to fire one-third of its workforce in the aftermath of the financial crash, but seized on its subsequent restructuring as an opportunity to become a fully gender-equal employer. Within five years, by “putting the gender glasses on before taking every single decision”, it had boosted the proportion of women in management positions from 29% to 49%. Over the same period, its adjusted gender pay gap shrank from 8.4% to 2.1% – and now stands at 0.2% in favour of women. The company’s chief executive, Bjarni Bjarnason, says the net outcome has been “more open discussions, higher productivity, greater job satisfaction, improved decision-making, higher morale, and an all-round far better atmosphere”. For many, the legislation reflects the fact that more than 40 years after 90% of Iceland’s women famously went on strike for a day, the country “is not quite the gender-equality paradise it’s often painted”, says Annadís Gréta Rúdólfsdóttir, an assistant education professor. “That WEF index is fairly crude. It doesn’t reflect the pay gap, or gender-based violence. We have our fair share of toxic masculinity. #MeToo was as shocking here as anywhere.” Her colleague, Berglind Rós Magnúsdóttir, says a broader “re-engineering” of society is still needed. “This won’t fix the huge gap between typically male and typically female sectors,” she says. “Between engineering, for example, and nursing or teaching. Anything to do with care or education is paid less.” But there is confidence the legislation is a major step in the right direction. “The pay gap was hidden behind a lack of transparency,” says Magnea Marinósdóttir of the welfare ministry’s equality unit, noting that the standard could be used to justify a pay difference as much as to eliminate it. “Employers can take into account experience, qualifications – it’s just that it now has to be transparent, and justified,” Marinósdóttir adds. “The standard is simply designed to eliminate factors that are irrelevant by law – such as gender. It could equally be used to eliminate discrimination by race or disability.” Legislation, she is convinced, “can impact attitudes and behaviour. We’ve seen that time and again. We still live in a very gendered reality in Iceland. Even here, the patriarchal culture, a male sense of entitlement, is deep-rooted. This can be a real impetus for change.” Erlingsdóttir says the Icelandic model could also be adopted elsewhere: Portugal is exploring doing so, raising the possibility that Iceland’s equal pay standard could eventually become a European one. “The information is there, and the education is there,” she says. “Now we need the effort.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/15/wanted-digital-cures-for-mental-illness",
    "date": "2018-02-15",
    "transcript": "Will Tanner is building a web hub for those who care for the mentally distressed. Billie Quinlan wants to make women happier with a digital sex guru. Rajshekar Patil is devising tools to help children moderate screen time. Rachel Thomas aims to change how people think using online modules. In a speed-pitching session (like Dragon’s Den on fast-forward with better coffee and fewer self-interested billionaires) these and 20 similar propositions are rattled out by teams of two or three people who met only weeks ago. Other ideas include proposals for improving maternal mental health, revamping social care and getting people active, as well as various “digital assistants” to help prevent burnout, manage money or plan retirement. The proponents are an ultra-qualified class of 2018 – 55 people from 19 countries, doctors, data scientists, software developers and serial entrepreneurs who have been selected for an intense six-month programme under the aegis of Zinc, a business incubator with a social mission. The aim is ambitious: to rethink the world’s approach to mental health treatment. And how it needs rethinking. Mental illness has emerged as a ubiquitous, universal scourge in recent years. No country or social group is immune. Nowhere has got to grips with how to treat the millions who fall ill every year. Health systems are stretched to helplessness. Mental health is still a poor relation of physical health. Pills are a scattergun approach. Therapy is costly, woefully inaccessible, even in rich countries. In short, this is a crisis that is ripe for innovation. That’s where Zinc comes in. “We believe that too many important social problems are left to governments and charities to fix, and too many of them don’t get fixed,” says Paul Kirby, who founded Zinc last year with venture capitalist Saul Klein and marketing strategist Ella Goldner. “Solutions often rely on individuals, families, local communities, employers and other having the motivation, opportunities and capabilities to change things for themselves,” Kirby added. One thing people who suddenly succumb to mental illness often complain about is not just the lack of clinical help but the paucity of information on what is available – locally, nationally, publicly, privately. Jim Woods reckons the answer is a proper platform for services – a sort of “moneysupermarket.com for mental health” as he puts it. The bewildered sufferer will get guidance on treatments, counsellors, self-help communities, apps, peer support and literature. “We want to build a whole new global system for mental health. A platform with answers for people rich and poor,” says Woods, an entrepreneur and former CEO of the Yo! group. The aim is to offer prevention as well as cure, and Woods expects businesses to sign up to the platform because of the growing interest in preventing staff becoming sick. “The NHS can only do reactive, fixing illnesses,” Woods says. “Prevention is the cheapest way.” Others are more interested in the physical manifestations of mental unease. Take IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. Gastro specialists admit there are few treatments for sufferers. Some doctors believe it is caused principally by a surfeit of stress. “IBS is all about stress, and with technology we can deliver tools that can alleviate symptoms,” says Jossy Onwade, a 27-year-old Nigerian doctor, who left his home and family and came to London for the first time to take on the challenge. Indeed, many of the participants have left homes, jobs, spouses, children behind to pursue their ambitions. Aziz Lalljee left his wife in America for six months to try to realise his plan for “a new model of domiciliary social care that dignifies the carer and delights the receiver”. “I’m here for as long as it takes for this to succeed,” he promises. Of course, not all the ideas will get off the ground. Some do not seem terribly original: you wonder, for example, whether a world that already has a proliferation of mental health apps such as headspace and woebot needs any more or whether shattered minds in need of rest really need more digital stimulus. The fact that these are businesses could also prove controversial: some will fail; some may make profits – from the mental discomfort of others. Entrepreneur and investor Tuvi Orbach is already mentoring several groups with a view to buying stakes. “I will invest in a few of these companies because I believe they will be successful,” he says. Zinc aims to run 15 such programmes over the next five years, hoping to create as many as 200 new businesses to tackle pressing social issues in the developed world. It is currently raising money to support its programmes. “We are relying on a lot of goodwill,” says Kirby. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world’s biggest problems.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/14/kenyas-erin-brockovich-defies-harassment-to-bring-anti-pollution-case-to-courts",
    "date": "2018-02-14",
    "transcript": "Eight years after her baby was lead-poisoned through breast milk, Kenya’s most prominent anti-pollution campaigner is set to finally get her day in court in a case that the UN hopes will prove a landmark for environmental defenders across Africa. Phyllis Omido has been threatened by thugs, arrested by police and forced into hiding for organising opposition to a lead-smelting factory in Mombasa, which allegedly poisoned residents in the neighbouring shantytown of Owino Uhuru. But the NGO she founded, the Centre for Justice, Governance, and Environmental Action, has already forced the closure of the plant and is now pushing the courts to secure compensation for the victims and a clean-up of the community. They have gathered thousands of local residents in a class action against the government and two companies – Metal Refinery EPZ Ltd and Penguin Paper and Book Company (no connection with the global publishing company) for 1.6bn Kenyan shillings (£11.5m) compensation and a clean-up of contaminated land. Two years after the suit was launched, the plaintiffs will be called as witness for the first time on 19 March in the environment and land court. “This is the biggest step since we started,” Omido told the Guardian. “The victims will finally get to tell their story in court. That’s crucial in making people realise what happened. We hope our case will be something that every environmental defender in the world can refer to when they raise issues of accountability.” Progress has been perilous. Following assaults and intimidation, the United Nations has called on the Kenyan government to protect Omido and her fellow activists. A special rapporteur, John Knox, said in a statement last year that two homes had been burned, death sentences had been issued and a 12-year-old son of one activist was kidnapped for three days. The plant has been closed. Former director Hezron Awiti Bollo declined to respond to the allegations. “I cannot comment. This is a matter that is in the courts,” he told the Guardian by phone. Sometimes referred to as the “east African Erin Brockovich”, Omido was a co-winner of the Goldman environmental prize in 2015 along with Berta Cáceres, the Honduran activist who was murdered a year later. Omido also lives under constant threat. She has had to go into hiding several times and carries a panic button that can alert international supporters and trace her whereabouts if she is abducted. “I face threats to my life because of this case,” she told the Guardian. Before its closure, the EPZ refinery recycled car batteries, using chemicals to extract the lead. Former workers said they were given only a flimsy face mask as protection. Neighbours said noxious smoke billowed out from the factory chimney, blackening and corroding the tin roofs of the shanty town; toxic waste leaked into a stream that ran through the village. “People used it for cooking and washing,” said the local pastor, Anastasia Nambo. “We sometimes drank it even though it smelt rotten because we don’t have any alternative. We had no idea it was dangerous. “Nobody told us for several years. We want compensation for those we know are affected and tests for those who do not yet know their status.” Omido – who worked in the company office – was the first to make a connection between the factory and health problems. She started to grow concerned in 2010 when her baby son fell ill. Blood tests showed the amount of lead in his blood was 35 times above the the World Health Organisation’s level of concern, she said. Assuming this had been passed on when she nursed him, she then arranged for three more children to be tested, all of whom proved to have been contaminated. Locals also complained of unusually high numbers of miscarriages and respiratory disease. After the factory refused to relocate and the environment ministry ignored her warnings, Omido organised demonstrations by thousands of residents, who blocked the main road between Mombasa and Nairobi with burning tyres. Many were arrested by police or beaten by factory security guards. Since then the group’s tactics have grown increasingly sophisticated as they built networks of support across the continent and the globe. The East Africa Society provided pro bono legal advice. Foreign NGOs including Frontline Defenders and Human Rights Watch provided advice and media support. When the Kenyan authorities refused to close the plant, Omido went over their heads by appealing to the East Africa Community. This regional body banned lead from Kenya, forcing the closure of more than a dozen smelters, including the one at Owino Uhuru. In 2013, the Kenyan authorities approved tests for 50 residents. All came back positive, with the highest reading 420 micrograms per deciliter of blood - more than 80 times the point considered a health concern. The community is still dealing with the aftermath. One mother, Janeth Jardine says she used the stream that runs through the village to wash her children and clean food. Now she blames it for the flaking rash that covers the hands and legs of her two-year-old daughter, Josephine. “They never heal. I’ve taken her to hospital six times. They give cream, but it makes no difference,” she says. “This is common in this village.” Many of those who developed rashes later died or suffered repeated bouts of illness. One man blames the death of two of his children on the contaminated soil they used to play in. Others remember Linet Baraza, who died with lead levels of 238 micrograms per deciliter of blood. They are also warned that their children may suffer lower IQs unless they can get the expensive treatment needed to purge the lead from their blood. The UN Commission on Human Rights is helping to fund the legal claim for compensation. And UN Environment has raised their appeal for treatment, remediation and justice at international forums. “Phyllis has shown what can be achieved when victims of pollution get access to even basic information,” said Erik Solheim, the executive director of UN Environment. “Now it is up to the courts to show that the law is on the side of environmental defenders.” Omido hopes it will just be the start. “There are 17 other communities fighting for compensation for lead poisoning. We want to set a precedent for them,” she says. ‘We want to show environmental defenders can use litigation as a tool and we want the UN to build up the capacity to enforce environmental law in courts around the world. Defenders are often treated as criminals or people who are hostile to development. That is not the case.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world’s biggest problems.

    "transcript": "A strange thing happens when you write about something going right. People take notice. They read to the end. They share it with their friends. They create rare pools of wellbeing on social media. They write to thank you. Eighteen months ago, the Guardian launched a pilot project to see how readers would respond if we deliberately sought out the good things happening in the world. More than 150 pieces of journalism later – in which we have examined the relative merits of everything from dog turds to ketamine, the blockchain to microhouses, and gardening to exoskeletons – we have proof of concept. Reader numbers for this kind of journalism have proven remarkably robust throughout the project, with almost one in 10 readers on average sharing stories on social media. News doesn’t have to be bad. The planet is complex. Away from the horror and conflict, the shouting and the skulduggery, away from the tragedy, disaster and zero-sum misanthropy, there is a wide world of answers and improvements, of win-win and mutual support, of selflessness and curiosity, of movements and innovations. And when you write about it, people tend to respond positively. They do so because while audiences have always been riveted by bad news (it serves as both an early warning system and a reassurance about the comfort of their own lives), they are tired of the avalanche of awfulness. They are switching off. That is a bad thing. If people just shrug at news because they feel there is little they can do, nothing will change. Journalists in the US, Europe and the UK are waking up to this by publishing what is variously described as constructive journalism, solutions journalism or, somewhat misleadingly, positive news. Now the Guardian is deepening its commitment to this type of work. Our new series, The Upside, launched this week with support from the Skoll foundation and a sprightly determination to show readers all of humanity, not just the bad bits. This does not mean we will reduce our efforts to uncover wrongdoing, to hold the powerful to account. It does mean that, in addition, we will be looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might, innovations whose time might have come. As our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, promised in a speech on the future of the Guardian recently, “we will develop ideas that help improve the world, not just critique it. Despair is just another form of denial. People long to feel hopeful again – and young people, especially, yearn to feel the hope that previous generations once had.” It is something our readers and members consistently ask for. Our request this week for ideas from readers resulted in more than 1,000 responses and suggestions from more than two dozen countries. “You are on the right track - we need more articles like this,” said Marti Mahoney of Albuquerque, in response to Jon Henley’s article on why Finland always seems to have answers to modern social problems. “More about kindness, discoveries and innovations that are improving society, please,” wrote Lorraine Simpson, from Edinburgh. “Some positive reflections on data trends too; for example I read yesterday that war and violence have decreased across the globe over the past century, which was a pleasant surprise.” Nick Marchant, from Dublin, wrote in: “I really support your intention to publish positive stories, I’ve been looking for it for a long time. I find a lot of news coverage very negative, and it makes me switch off various issues.” “Recently I have been thinking about the psychological aspect of being bombarded by negative news stories and although they are important I feel that without optimistic news stories to contrast them you leave readers feeling punch-drunk and depressed about the world,” Simon Taylor wrote. “I understand there are some positive news stories on the Guardian site but it would be brilliant to have a dedicated section for moments of ‘oh god show me something to be happy about!’” Perhaps curious is a better word than happy. Not everything we cover will necessarily change the world for the better, but it will offer the promise of doing so. There are some ground rules. We won’t jump at every piece of puff and PR that comes our way. We will set a high bar, looking for things that appear replicable, robust and confront the big challenges of our times – the environment, health (particularly mental), atomised communities, flagging democracy, gender discrimination and technology. We will attempt to find the communities trying to solve some of these problems and, ideally, this will take us to places we rarely visit, broadening our reach and our understanding. And we are encouraging readers to take part. Let us know what you want to see from this series, where you see the hope.

    "transcript": "When a small town in Devon banned plastic bags a decade ago, it started a global movement. When a county in Oregon found itself a wildfire risk, it took action to mitigate it. When a small Welsh town pulled together to find a home for Syrian refugees, the outcome was heart-warming and uplifting. When Mumbai residents sickened of the sight of trash on their beach, they rolled up their sleeves. Solutions don’t have to be top-down. More often than not they come from local people who want to take matters into their own hands. Like the Scottish islanders who recently took control of efforts to bring new inhabitants in to their community. There is a lot of strength in communities - and the world has never needed that strength more.

    "transcript": "The Guardian is launching a new strand of journalism to seek out people, innovations and movements that promise answers to some of the world’s most intractable problems. News doesn’t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on antagonism, disaster and confrontation risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do. This series is an antidote, an attempt to show there is plenty of hope. A team of journalists will delve into big global topics such as science, technology, health, the environment and gender issues. They will be looking for examples of invention, local solutions and inspirational leadership that offer something different and that try to improve the world in some way. Sign up to our email updates and each week we will summarise the best articles, look for good counterparts from other publications, and we’ll be asking readers to nominate pieces and projects they have come across. *** Explore all our newsletters: whether you love film, football, fashion or food, we’ve got something for you *** The Guardian’s newsletters include content from our website, which may be funded by outside parties.

It is supported, in part, through a grant to theguardian.org by the US-based Skoll Foundation, which is dedicated to accelerating entrepreneurial and innovative solutions to the world’s most pressing problems. All of the journalism is editorially independent, commissioned and produced by our Guardian journalists. You can read more about content funding on the Guardian here. The series seeks out the people, innovations and movements that offer the promise of answers. From social entrepreneurs to scientists, environmental champions and unsung heroes, we go looking for invention, solutions and inspirational leadership. All our journalism follows GNM’s published editorial code. The Guardian is committed to open journalism, recognising that the best understanding of the world is achieved when we collaborate, share knowledge, encourage debate, welcome challenge, and harness the expertise of specialists and their communities. The only restriction to the Guardian’s coverage is where the Skoll Foundation is prohibited under US law from directly funding or earmarking funds to: (a) influence the outcome of any domestic or foreign election for public office; or (b) support lobbying or other attempts to influence legislation (local, state, federal, or foreign). This means any communications to the public in which a view is expressed about a specific legislative proposal, and the recipients of the communications are urged through a “call to action” to contact government officials, must provide a reasoned, objective consideration of facts and issues in a full and fair manner that enables third parties to develop their own positions on any legislation that may be discussed.

    "transcript": "Maternity pack Finland’s “baby box” was introduced for poor mothers in 1938 and extended to all in 1949, when it held fabrics, a sewing kit, baby clothes, nappies and a mattress (the box itself doubled as a cot). The contents has changed over time (it now includes a duvet, quilted suit, bonnet, socks and gloves) but it remains hugely popular: 95% of mothers choose it over a cash alternative. Child day care Since the 1980s, Finnish parents of children under three have been able to choose between local authority daycare and a parental “home care allowance” of about €330 a month for the first child (plus a means-tested extra of up to €180). Half as many Finnish toddlers are in daycare as in other Nordic countries. Xylitol Finland began researching the natural sweetener Xylitol and its capacity to dramatically reduce dental plaque in the early 1970s and developed and launched a Xylitol chewing gum – arguably the world’s first health-improving food product – in 1975. Paternity leave Paternity leave was introduced in Finland in 1978. A parental allowance is now paid for 263 working days, with the first 105 paid to the mother and the remaining 158 to either the father or mother. Fathers are also entitled to a “father’s month” off under certain conditions; around 35% take it. National suicide prevention project Finland has halved its suicide rate from 30.3 per 100,000 in 1990 to 14.2 last year after introducing the world’s first national anti-suicide strategy in the late 1980s. Exhaustive research to understand the causes of hundreds of cases produced a nationwide preventive programme. Integrated health centres Finland’s unique all-inclusive, integrated, municipal healthcare centres, introduced in 1972, offer community preventative, diagnostic and curative care; a dental service; GP-level (non-surgical) hospital care; home nursing services; mental health care; rehabilitation and occupational healthcare and ambulance services. Principle of transparency Finland has had a freedom of information act, stating that everyone has a right not just to access government documents but to copy them, since 1766. Documents are public unless ruled otherwise. Restrictions to the general rule must be legislated by parliament, and refusal to make documents public can be challenged in the courts. Committee for the future A long history of coalitions has encouraged stable government with an eye for the long term and the collective interest. But the Finnish parliament is also unusual in having, for the past quarter century, a permanent committee for the future in which MPs study and report on major social challenges for the coming decades. Finnish free comprehensive education Finnish law guarantees a free, high-quality, nine-year basic education (to age 15) in municipal-run schools to every child, regardless of where they live or the wealth of their parents, declaring it an essential human right. Half then go to high school or polytechnic, and half into vocational education, which is also free – as is further and university education. All school teachers have at least a university master’s degree. Veikkaus The national state-owned gaming company has the exclusive right to operate all gaming and gambling in Finland (including online gambling on the country’s largest webstore), and the responsibility for mitigating gambling risks. It employs 2,000 people and raises €1bn a year for health, social welfare, cultural, youth and scientific projects, distributed by the relevant ministries.",

    "transcript": "Western Europe’s last naturally caused famine ended 150 years ago this winter. In a poor and backward part of the Russian empire called Finland, more than a quarter of a million people – nearly 10% of the population – starved to death. Last year, on the centenary of its independence, Finland was ranked, by assorted international indices, the most stable, the safest and the best-governed country in the world. It was also the third wealthiest, the third least corrupt, the second most socially progressive and the third most socially just. Finland’s judicial system is the most independent in the world, its police the most trusted, its banks the soundest, its companies the second most ethical, its elections the second freest, and its citizens enjoy the highest levels of personal freedom, choice and wellbeing. The Nordic country’s 5.5 million inhabitants are also the third most gender-equal in the world and have the fifth lowest income inequality. Their babies are the least underweight, their kids feel the most secure, and their teens perform the second best at reading (only third at science, though). In a century and a half, they seem to have done rather well. And so, as the Guardian embarks on a new series investigating the things that are going right in the world, it feels natural to start in Helsinki. “If you look at where we were then and where we are now, I think, absolutely, you can talk about a Finnish miracle,” said Bengt Holmström, a Helsinki-born Nobel prize-winning economist not much given to exaggeration. “How and why did it happen? Now that’s a question.” There are limits, of course, to the usefulness of this kind of exercise: no two countries – their circumstances, their histories, their people – can be the same. Learnings may not be transferable. The magic sauce that made Finland would not produce the same results in, say, France. It is true, too, that shown the long list of social and economic measures by which their country can only be judged a success, many Finns snort: emerging slowly from a long recession, with unemployment at 8% and a populist, nationalist party garnering up to 20% of the vote, the country’s not what it was, they say. Often, the response – only semi-joking – is, “You mean other countries are worse?” But inquiring after the sauce’s recipe of, among others, an economist, a philosopher, a sociologist and an ex-president, intriguing ingredients emerge. To begin with, the geography – and its consequence, the climate. “We live,” Tarja Halonen, Finland’s president from 2000 to 2012, says carefully, “in a cold, harsh and remote place. Every person has to work hard for themselves. But that is not always enough. You have to help your neighbours.” Bruce Oreck, who served as Barack Obama’s ambassador to Helsinki (he liked it so much he stayed), says this has been “a profound, long-term influence. It’s made Finns self-reliant, private, but also dependent on a highly cooperative society, where rules matter. It’s cultural, but it’s become part of the chemistry.” Of all the Finnish words that are hard to translate into English, the one Finns cite most is sisu: a kind of dogged, courageous persistence regardless of consequence. It is what, in 1939-40, allowed an army of 350,000 men to twice fight off Soviet forces three times their number, and inflict losses five times heavier than those they sustained. But there is another that is, perhaps, more revealing, says Sirpa Kähkönen, an award-winning historical novelist. Talkoo means “working together, collectively, for a specific good”, she says. “Getting the harvest in, stocking wood, raising money. It’s about cooperating. Everyone together, equally.” Cooperation, but also relative equality, are recurring themes. Ruled for almost 600 years by Sweden and a further century by Russia, Finland was “generally and democratically poor”, says Kähkönen. “There were no serfs, but no wildly wealthy aristocrats either. Society was not hierarchical.” Since long before independence in 1917, says Riitta Jallinoja, a sociologist, “gaps between the social classes in Finland have been smaller than usual. Even the industrial revolution here was modest: no Rothschilds, no Fords, not even a dynasty like Sweden’s Wallenbergs.” Even in today’s clean, functional, visibly prosperous Helsinki, that still sort of holds. “You can be walking down the street next to the richest guy in town, and you really wouldn’t know,” says Oreck. In Finland, insists Halonen, “You don’t look up at people, and you don’t look down. You look level.” The country’s most successful current firm, games studio Supercell, creator of Clash of Clans, paid over €800m in tax, producing seven of Finland’s top 10 income tax payers in 2016. Along with the rest of the country’s highest 10,000 or so highest earners, the amount they pay is published in an annual list, on “national envy day”. Finland is big on civic duty, but also on transparency. The success of the country’s free national education system, established before independence in 1866 and regularly ranked among the world’s best, also has its roots in a more egalitarian society, says Jallinoja: “Education was the key to advancement.” Not only that, says the philosopher and professor emeritus Ilkka Niiniluoto, but the whole country is actually “a social construction created by university professors.” The academics who led the country’s nationalist movement “created Finland as a nation: its language, history, literature, music, symbols, folklore. The nationalist leader was a philosophy professor.” Since independence, nearly 30% of Finland’s heads of state and government have been university professors, including half its early prime ministers. “They shaped the country as we know it,” says Jallinoja. “But vitally, they also created confidence in social mobility, and real belief in education. That history comes with us.” If, however, Finland has been rated the world’s most literate country, it may also have something to do with a 19th-century decree that a couple could not marry in the Lutheran church before both passed a reading test. “Quite an incentive,” observes Halonen, “to learn to read.” Gender equality, similarly, was baked in. In 1906, Finnish women became, if not quite the first to win the vote, the first to run for electoral office. Nearly 10% of MPs in Finland’s first parliament were women (the figure is now 42%); as early as 1930, up to 30% of university students were women. “Women in Finland took their rights seriously, and men accepted it,” says Halonen. Other ingredients have since added to the sauce. Finland benefited enormously from wise wartime and postwar leaders, insists Holmström: “They thought about the good of the country; took big, sensible decisions. And the consensus backed them, because everyone knew we were fighting for our existence.” Responsible choices were made, invariably by continuity-conscious coalition governments, on big industrial and infrastructure investments, that have paid dividends many times over. More recently, today’s high-tech, startup-friendly Finland was born of record investment in research and development in the 1990s, nearing 4% of GDP. Steady growth – through war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and a deep recession in the 1990s, Finland’s economy has expanded over the past century at a rate equalled only by Japan’s – has bolstered trust in the nation’s institutions. “People criticise the government constantly, and often for very good reason,” says Kähkönen. “But fundamentally, they do trust it.” As they do, on the whole, their welfare state – on which Finland spends 31% of its GDP, the second highest proportion in the OECD. (“If you’re going to have a welfare state,” says Halonen, “the only real way to it is so well that there’s no point having a private alternative.”) But Finns also trust each other more than most, says André Chaker, a Canadian-born lawyer and public speaker who has lived in the country for 25 years. Corruption and organised crime are all but nonexistent. “That feeds into the business environment,” he says. “Things get done here faster, more reliably.” And it is trust that breeds confidence, and a willingness to innovate: the World Economic Forum ranks Finland the most innovative country, per capita, in the world. For years dominated by monolithic mining and forestry firms, then by the once-mighty Nokia, Finland today is close behind Silicon Valley in the number of startups per head. The magic sauce, then, seems based mainly on basic virtues: self-confidence, cooperation, equality, respect for education, trust. At bottom and in practice, says Anu Partanen, a Finnish journalist who now lives in New York, it boils down to a different quality of relationship. She calls it – since it is shared to a greater or lesser extent by Sweden, Norway and Denmark – the Nordic theory of love. “In the family, it’s realising that relationships can only really flourish between individuals – parents, children, spouses – who are equal and independent,” Partanen says. “In a society, it means policy choices aimed at ensuring the greatest possible degree of independence, freedom and opportunity for everyone.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world’s biggest problems.
