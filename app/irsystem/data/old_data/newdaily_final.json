Guy Robertson from Penguin, in the state\u2019s north-west, has turned his business over to deliveries after losing all of almost his usual sales at traditional farmers\u2019 markets and festivals, restaurants and in on-farm experiences overnight because of the COVID-19 outbreak. \u201cThe first week was the sleepless week,\u201d Mr Robertson said. \u201cThen we realised we could put everything online.\u201d The Mount Gnomon Farm website was born \u2013 and Mr Robertson is now busy selling meat, vegetables, and fruit online, as well as products from other local artisan producers. But it was a post on social media that landed him in hot water with the French. He has been including in-season rhubarb in his produce boxes, and suggested anyone who had too much should treat themselves, as he had, by brewing some homemade rhubarb bubbly, which he termed champagne. A couple of days later, he answered the phone to a French official. \u201cIn the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action about the farm\u2019s production of rhubarb champagne,\u201d Mr Robertson wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cI never thought that 10 litres of rhubarb cordial for our own consumption would be on the radar in France.\u201d  Yesterday in the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action\u2026 Posted by Mount Gnomon Farm on\u00a0Monday, April 6, 2020 The French official told Mr Robertson that organisations such as the Comit\u00e9 Champagne protect and promote the Champagne brand. \u201cHe was a really nice guy, he said: \u2018I know it\u2019s a really bad time around the world at the moment, but our legal team takes it very seriously\u2019,\u201d Mr Robertson told ABC Radio. \u201cHe said he has been doing it for three years and it\u2019s his job to make sure everyone complies and nobody markets their bubbles as champagne unless you come from the Champagne region in France. \u201cIt was a funny moment for me, I just couldn\u2019t believe I had a call from France in the current climate about 10 litres of home brew that we aren\u2019t even marketing.\u201d Apparently, among Mount Gnomon Farm\u2019s thousands of social media fans is a French person, who was concerned by Mr Robertson\u2019s post. The post was reported \u2013 and the man in France then followed it up. \u201cThey take their job very seriously,\u201d Mr Robertson said. \u201cIt made me laugh and laugh. \u201cIf I ever go into the production of rhubarb champagne, I\u2019ll have to call it something different.\u201d In other respects, Mount Gnomon farm is proving resilient. Mr Robertson said he was delivering food boxes throughout Tasmania. \u201cThe most encouraging thing is the community support,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to focus on what we can do rather than what we can\u2019t do.\u201d For Easter, he has 70 deliveries around the state\u2019s north-west, 50 to Launceston and 60 to Hobart \u2013 all driven by himself.

It\u2019s a view endorsed in at least two Australian states. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said the Easter Bunny fitted into the same category as health care workers, military personnel, transport and freight specialists, and MPs, and would be allowed to get on with his job despite the island state\u2019s strict coronavirus travel bans. \u201cI\u2019ve actually had a number of emails \u2026 one from a delightful young fellow whose brother was taken out of school [and had to] self-isolate because he had an underlying health condition,\u201d he told the Nine Network. \u201cHe wrote to me, an eight-year-old \u2026 wanting to know whether or not the Easter Bunny would come. \u201cIt\u2019s my personal view, based on a discussion with Public Health [Services] \u2026 that the Easter Bunny can be classed as an essential traveller and therefore will be in the state over Easter and able to deliver Easter eggs.\u201d It\u2019s a similar situation in Western Australia \u2013 which has closed its borders to try to halt the spread of the virus. Premier Mark McGowan said he\u2019d also been hit up by concerned kids \u2013 and had decided to allow the Easter Bunny free travel throughout the state. Over the ditch in New Zealand, where the nation will head into its third week in a strict lockdown at the Easter weekend, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also given the all-clear for the busy bunny \u2013 and another essential co-worker. \u201cWe do consider both the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to be essential workers,\u201d she said on Monday. Ms Ardern said 2020 had already been particularly tough for the Easter Bunny. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be potentially quite busy at home with their family as well and their own bunnies,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I say to the children of New Zealand if the Easter Bunny doesn\u2019t make it to your household, then we have to understand that it\u2019s a bit difficult at the moment.\u201d -with AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Outback roadhouse flies beer and pizza to cattle stations in lockdown", "date": "2020-4-3", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2020/04/03/coronavirus-outback-pizza/", "transcript": "When the Northern Territory\u2019s strict coronavirus travel restrictions slowed passing trade to a trickle, a Top End roadhouse decided it was time to try something new. The Dunmarra Wayside Inn, 315 kilometres south of Katherine, is owned by pilot Gary Frost. Most of the surrounding cattle stations were now in lockdown \u2013 so he had little choice but to take to the skies to keep the locals in high spirits. \u201cNobody can go anywhere, they\u2019re limited to how they get their supplies and refreshments,\u201d Mr Frost said. \u201cWe thought we might do something to help them out a little bit. \u201cWe make pizzas at Dunmarra roadhouse anyway, so we thought we would get all the pizzas together and see if they were interested, if we can fly them out, so they don\u2019t have to leave the properties.\u201d Hot food and alcohol has already been delivered to stations within a 100 kilometre radius of the roadhouse, with plans to extend the once-a-week service to properties up to 400 kilometres away. With prices remaining the same as in-house orders, the idea has been well received. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting quite a good response actually \u2013 everybody is quite excited about it,\u201d Mr Frost said. \u201cIts something unique I suppose, I don\u2019t know of anyone else who has ever done it probably in the world, as far as I could research. \u201cI suppose the cost of it is prohibitive as a commercial venture, but we\u2019re not doing it as a commercial venture. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing it as a friendly gesture to try and help people out and create the right atmosphere.\u201d The takeaway products, along with mailbags for the stations, are delivered in a fixed-wing plane, which has plenty of room for the extra cargo. Mr Frost said he was also willing to throw a few extra toilet rolls in the back, if needed. \u201cAs long as they don\u2019t come loose in the back of the plane, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he said."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "April Fools Day cancelled? Yes, if you believe Google", "date": "2020-4-1", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/04/01/april-fools-day-cancelled/", "transcript": "April Fools Day is cancelled this year. That\u2019s if you believe search engine overlord Google, which is apparently hitting pass on the trickery of April 1, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The revelation came via a leaked email from Google\u2019s chief marketing officer Lorraine Twohill, to all staff saying pranks would be put on hold this year as the platform has more important duties \u2013 like keeping the searching masses informed on the most relevant COVID-19 information. Seems legit, but only time will tell. Usually, April 1 is fraught with danger for the general public and the media. News outlet inboxes are flooded with \u2018clever\u2019 pitches from PR companies, trying to trick over-tired, unwitting journalists into running their brand name in headlines. Apparently this year, we can just be our gullible selves, no need to be on high alert. In lieu of any trickery, here\u2019s a round-up of some of the best (and most outlandish) April Fools Day pranks we\u2019ve seen in Australia over the years. It\u2019s a shame Google isn\u2019t (allegedly) participating this year \u2013 the company is pretty much the undisputed king of pranks.  About a decade ago, Google announced it was getting involved in the AFL, launching a partnership for the gBall: An AFL ball built-in with the best of Google\u2019s tech, to measure location, accuracy and torque of every kick. You could download all this data and more, to keep improving your game. Sounds like every budding Gary Ablett\u2019s dream, right? Google probably tipped the joke over the edge when it claimed the gBall shared its intel with scouting agents. If they were interested and wanted to contact the ball owner, the ball would buzz. National icon Vegemite got us good in 2015, when it announced a Big Vegemite was being erected in Melbourne. Have you heard? Something BIG is coming to Melbourne in the shape of a 60m tall interactive Vegemite jar. Who's keen? pic.twitter.com/86N7Fsjepo \u2014 Vegemite (@Vegemite) March 31, 2015 What made this prank more memorable was that it caught out pop culture news site pedestrian.tv, which not only ran with the pitch, but broke the embargo to get it out first. Thankfully they\u2019re a funny bunch, and took it on the chin. This served as a lesson for media outlets around the country for the next few years. The media of old knew how to prank. Without the sharp minds of the internet ruining everything with one tweet, news outlets could get hours of mileage out of their April 1 exploits. ABC program\u00a0This Day Tonight\u00a0 ran a harmless yet humorous trick in 1975, when it made the declaration Australia would be converting to metric time. What\u2019s metric time? According to the program, there would now be 100 seconds per minute, 100 minutes per hour, and 20-hour days. Seconds were now to be referred to as millidays, minutes centidays and hours decidays. Then deputy premier of South Australia Des Corcoran gave the report more weight by praising the new time system on the broadcast. It was topped off by rendered images of the Adelaide town hall displaying a metric time face. Boom-tish. Virgin Money Australia proved you don\u2019t have to go all out to get a launch.  In 2005 it announced it was launching scratch \u2018n\u2019 sniff credit cards, which Australians could travel with overseas and rub a little nail on when they wanted to be reminded of home. The cards\u2019 scent was barbecued sausages. Dick Smith cemented himself in Aussie lore in 1978 with his monumental prank. For weeks, he\u2019d been advertising that he was going to tow an iceberg all the way from Antarctica into Sydney Harbour. Why? He\u2019s an entrepreneur. He was going to park it next to the Opera House and chip off small wedges to passersby, selling them for 10 cents a piece. The \u2018Dicksicles\u2019 would improve the flavour of whatever beverage they were added to. And lo, April 1 sprung. There was Dick Smith towing his promised iceberg. The public went wild. The press were stirred into a frenzy. And then the heavens opened. The \u2018Dickenberg 1\u2019 began to melt and was revealed for what it really was: A layer of shaving cream and firefighting foam over a structure of plastic sheets. Dick Smith said afterwards he was pretty happy with the prank \u2013 it only cost him $1450 to pull off."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Why this cat\u2019s hiding place is confusing all of the internet | The New Daily", "date": "2020-3-26", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/03/26/hiding-cat-toys-bed/", "transcript": "Meet Obi the cat.

Both Beenleigh Rum Distillery and Bundaberg Rum Distillery are using existing production lines and staff to make the hard-to-come-by liquid. Queensland Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning Cameron Dick thanked the distilleries for stepping into the breach to supply sanitiser to schools and frontline workers. Australian cricket great Shane Warne halted production of gin at the SevenZeroEight distillery that he co-owns to make medical-grade hand sanitiser for hospitals. \u201cThis is a challenging time for Australians and we all need to do what we can to help our healthcare system combat this disease and save lives,\u201d Warne said on his Instagram page. Tasmanian gin distillery, Southern Wild, says it is ready to shift its entire business to a not-for profit producer of hand-sanitiser-for-schools if it gets the go ahead from the state government. Southern Wild owner George Burgess on Friday said the company was well positioned to begin making sanitiser immediately. The Bellarine Brewing Co in Victoria says it is ready and able to start producing hand sanitisers, and is hoping the Australian Taxation Office can fast track the required permit. Brewing Co director Tim Page-Walker told News Corp the move would allow the business to keep afloat, provide work for its local casual staff, and also assist the community so desperate to find hand sanitisers as supermarket shelves are stripped by selfish hoarders. The developments come as US distilleries have also switched to making the alcohol-based disinfectant. Pennsylvania\u2019s Eight Oaks Farm Distillery filled its first 20 bottles on Monday, according to The Associated Press, sending the batch to charitable groups that get hand sanitiser due to the coronavirus pandemic. The family-owned distillery reportedly plans to dramatically boost production as it distributes the bottles to charities, offers them at farmers\u2019 markets where it sells its alcohol, and via its website. \u201cWe are in a national emergency,\u201d brewery founder Chad Butters, was quoted as saying by AP. \u201cWhat\u2019s the right thing to do? The right thing to do is support this community by providing something that is in desperate need. We\u2019ll flood the valley with hand sanitiser and drive that price right down.\u201d Green Mountain Distillers in Vermont is giving away a hand sanitising solution, while North Carolina\u2019s Durham Distillery is donating a solution to hospitality colleagues.

I discovered last year I am an extrovert. My best friend \u2013 a psychologist \u2013 snorted when I told her I\u2019d only just worked this out. I thrive on having a calendar chock full of social engagements where I can swill wine with my friends, throw my arms around them and speak utter dross for hours on end. I always, always feel connected. The pub is my spiritual home. So solo isolation is not working out well. I\u2019m cooking meals for myself and I\u2019ve discovered it\u2019s hair-tearingly boring. Cooking is only fun when it\u2019s shared: if you cook a good meal and another soul doesn\u2019t get to appreciate it, did it actually happen? I guess that\u2019s the question Instagram has been answering since it began. Even though it hasn\u2019t been long since I started flying solo I\u2019ve been oddly emotional. Obviously the constant stream of doomsday news isn\u2019t helping. The internet \u2013 that singular tool for telling ourselves we\u2019re connected \u2013 is only serving to add to the turmoil. Waves of sadness and emptiness and disconnection roll and crash throughout the interminably long days. But I pull myself out by reminding myself that this is (hopefully) temporary, and maybe this spell will be good for me. I might finally do some of the chores that have been on my to-do list for the past decade. Like get on that ancestry website and see if I have some wildly fascinating heritage. Or go online and do that thing where you try and find your missing superannuation. The only time I\u2019m really allowing myself out of the house is taking walks around the park. Yesterday I saw a man in his 80s doing a slow shuffling jog and I instantly burst into tears. Standing next to the empty football fields I was overcome by the realisation that this sense of loneliness I\u2019ve felt for all of five minutes is something so many in our ageing community experience on a daily basis. And it\u2019s not just the elderly. There are young widows and bullied teens and people with crippling anxiety and folks working remotely who battle loneliness on a daily basis. Hell, you don\u2019t have to be part of a certain subgroup. There was this guy who lived by himself in the building where I used to live in Sydney. Coming and going, he was always there, determined to grab me for a chat. And, of course, I\u2019d avoid him \u2013 duck out a different way, keep my head down, sneak away \u2013 because I thought he was odd (and I was usually rushing off to hang with my gang). But now I think about how obviously lonely he was, how little he was asking for, and I feel absolutely gutted. Social isolation and loneliness are a huge problem in Australia. The impact it has on both mental and physical health is well documented. In fact, it\u2019s been identified as a \u201csignificant public health and wellbeing\u201d issue.

How heartening that when there\u2019s a crisis, we step up. But what about when social isolation is no longer a hot topic? What about the people for whom loneliness is their everyday reality? My fear is we\u2019ll just go back to business as usual. That period where we nearly gave ourselves an aneurism stifling a sneeze on a packed train and genuinely washed our hands (instead of just turning on the tap so people didn\u2019t think we\u2019re gross) will just become the stuff of nostalgic anecdotes. So I am making this deal with whichever deity is currently drunk at the wheel: on the other side of this whole thing, when physical distancing is a lonely memory, I\u2019ll do regular volunteer work with The Red Cross companionship and social support program. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Glad you asked. Basically they pair you with someone in the community who is lonely and socially isolated. You visit for a cup of tea, go on an outing, chat on the phone, or go for a walk. It\u2019s for older people who have few social connections, people with a disability, or people recovering from mental illness. I mean, look at the photo they use to illustrate the program. The stuffed toys in the cabinet. The joy on the face of the lady with the nice beaded necklace. Stick a fork in me, I\u2019m done. I am not announcing this to make myself look like a top sort. I\u2019m writing it here because it\u2019s the kind of promise I\u2019ll make in my head, and when the pub is open again I\u2019ll dance off gaily into the sunshine and forget the deal I made. Writing it in public makes me accountable. I\u2019ve had but the tiniest taste of loneliness, and the impact leaves me breathless. How lucky that when we come out the other side, most of us will have people to reconnect with. Not everybody is that lucky.

You can join in a chat via desktop, laptop or smartphone (or big screen if you can airplay it to your telly) and have online chats with the group as well or private chats with some people on the call. The only limitation is a 40-minute window for free use, so make your meeting quick or schedule one after the other. The free version of the app allows unlimited meetings. What better time to be sampling the great wines on offer from around Australia (and delivered straight to your door) via well-established companies including Vino Mofo, Tipple, Jimmy Bring, Naked Wines and, of course, your local wine store.

Last year, the canals were swarming with tourists and revellers for the famous Carnival, but on February 23, authorities cancelled the festival\u00a0amid coronavirus concerns. Italy is the world\u2019s worst-hit country after China, with 35,713 cases and a death toll of 2978 due to the global pandemic. Since the Italian government announced a lockdown earlier this month banning all non-essential travel, silence and clean air replaced the loud noise of tourists overcrowding the narrow alleys of the lagoon city and the pollution caused by powerful engines of motorboats used by residents and workers. Venice has been struggling with a high volume of tourism in recent years and recently banned large cruise ships from docking in the canals, in an attempt to preserve the city\u2019s infrastructure. But since the drastic reduction of water traffic and tourism, residents have observed the usually muddy canals run with bright, clearer water with swarms of fishes and the canal bottom clearly visible. \u201cThere are no boats, there is no traffic. Definitely, it is cleaner,\u201d Venice resident Serguei Michtchenko said. However, while it may look nicer, the city\u2019s mayor\u2019s office told CNN that the improved water visibility does not mean the water quality improved. \u201cIt\u2019s because there is less boat traffic, [which] usually brings sediment to the top of the water\u2019s surface,\u201d a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CNN air quality in the city has improved due to the lockdown. Several decades have passed since Venetians were used to swimming in the lagoon water, due to the intensified ferryboats and motorboats traffic in the canals and the increasing volume of commercial and tourist ships stopping at the Venice Passenger Terminal. The coronavirus shutdown is the latest problem the unique lagoon city had to deal with after it was\u00a0hit by its worst flooding in 50 years in November. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Coronavirus good deeds: Kindness acts and heartwarming scenes", "date": "2020-3-18", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2020/03/18/coronavirus-good-deeds-italy/", "transcript": "It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the panic and fear being fuelled by the coronavirus outbreak, but there\u2019s a wave of good deeds and positivity that\u2019s keeping the sickness at bay.

The village of Rappville, south of Casino, was hit by a firestorm in October that destroyed 15 homes, and is in the buffer area of the newly formed cane toad biosecurity zone. Tamar Cohen, of the Border Ranges Richmond Valley Landcare Network, said the community needed to work together to eradicate the feral amphibians that could travel as far as a kilometre in one night. \u201cBurnt land makes it easier for toads to travel as they\u2019re basically lazy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen a bushfire comes through and it clears out a lot of the undergrowth and logs, we\u2019re finding that cane toads can move much quicker through those landscapes. \u201cSo the concern with Rappville, as with other towns impacted by the bushfires, is that cane toads can now move in much easier than before.\u201d Ms Cohen said the toads picked easy pathways, such as roads and mowed lawns, but found it difficult to move through natural vegetation because they were not good jumpers. Ms Cohen said cane toads had been found on properties near the Richmond Range National Park. This was causing concern because the national park was one of the few remaining forests in the area that had not been destroyed by the fires and was home to threatened species that were vulnerable to cane toads. \u201cWe\u2019ve got native frogs and small reptiles that are already struggling to survive, so we don\u2019t want them killed by the poisonous cane toads,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first thing property owners see with cane toad invasions is dead red-belly black snakes, dead pythons and dead freshwater turtle species.\u201d A special Rappville team has been established to control the pests and Sydney dog trainer Steve Austin has been using his English springer spaniels, Tommy and Becky, along with cocker spaniel Emma, to help hunt them out. \u201cThe dogs have a high degree of hunting ability,\u201d Mr Austin said. \u201cThey can find the toads by scent and stand and point with their nose to alert me they are there. \u201cAll three dogs are conservation dogs, which means they have been trained in a passive response. \u201cThey stop and stare at their catch, but do not hurt it.\u201d Like many Rappville locals, Cathy Cook is upset many native species were lost in the bushfires. She believed any remaining species must be protected. \u201cEveryone is spewing about losing the natives but when the first lot of rain came, the first thing you heard was a bloody cane toad,\u201d Ms Cook said. \u201cThere were millions of cane toad eggs in our dam and that was two weeks between the rain \u2013 so I was armed with my butterfly net to get them.\u201d Ms Cook was concerned the toads would also move into Bungawalbin and Whiporie. \u201cWe\u2019ve built our place for native birds and we have a lot of native flowers and trees,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also look after our dams for the native frogs to live in. \u201cI love hearing the native frogs croaking away in summer and then you hear \u2018brrrr\u2019 start up amongst it all, and it\u2019s like \u2018You weren\u2019t invited, toads, so go away\u2019.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Family accidentally buys 2300 toilet rolls prior to national panic", "date": "2020-3-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/03/06/family-mass-toilet-rolls/", "transcript": "This is what 12 years\u2019 worth of toilet paper looks like. Toowoomba\u2019s Janetzki family have thousands of rolls of Australia\u2019s most sought-after product, after mistakenly ordering 48 boxes of 48 rolls instead of their usual box of 48 rolls from online delivery service Who Gives A Crap. They received 2304 rolls and were charged $3264 instead of $68, something that went unnoticed until the two-pallet order showed up on their doorstep days later. The family estimate it is enough to last them 12 years. The accidental hoarders made the purchase in early February, weeks before fears relating to coronavirus sent the country into a toilet paper-buying frenzy. Now, they\u2019ve got more toilet paper than most supermarkets have on the shelves. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a while to live down,\u201d said Haidee Janetzki, who placed the order. \u201cWe\u2019ve told our three daughters that if we\u2019ve still got all this toilet paper when they get married this is what they\u2019ll have as their wedding decorations.\u201d The Janetzkis have been ordering one box of 48 rolls every 12 weeks for the past two years. After Christmas, they decided to change product and set up a new subscription. \u201cIt asked for the quantity and I wrote 48 thinking I want a box with 48 rolls in it,\u201d Ms Janetzki said. \u201cA couple of days later, I got an email saying the order was on the way, and that was all good. \u201cOn a Monday there was a knock at the door at it was the courier. He said, \u2018I\u2019ve got two pallets of toilet paper for you.\u2019 \u201cWe checked the credit card statement to try to figure out what\u2019d gone wrong and turned out I\u2019d ordered 48 boxes, so it was legitimately my mistake.\u201d Ms Janetzki said she had paid off her credit card the day prior to being charged, and only checks her statement once a fortnight. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t notice there was a large amount on the card and it didn\u2019t max it out,\u201d she said. Husband Chris Janetzki said he could not quite believe the size of their order. \u201cAt the time I thought, \u2018Holy crap,'\u201d he said. Little did they, or anyone, know that weeks later a toilet paper shortage would make national headlines. Both Woolworths and Coles have limited the amount of toilet paper rolls customers can buy. Toilet paper manufacturers have also ramped up production to meet demand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that people have been mass-buying toilet paper like that. I still don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Mr Janetzki said. \u201cI\u2019m a pastor of a church and so a friend said, \u2018How prophetic are you to be able to see the future and know there was going to be a toilet paper shortage?\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a laugh out of it for a while.\u201d Unable to contact the online-only company via phone, the Janetzkis had no choice but to accept the delivery. The Janetzkis eventually sent off an urgent email about their unusual purchase and the company responded with an offer to take back the unwanted boxes. But by that time, the family had come up with a cunning plan. The family is now selling their excess toilet paper to help raise money for their daughter\u2019s school. Ms Janetzki said she jokingly offered up the toilet paper as a fundraising initiative for the school\u2019s trip to Sydney and Canberra later this year. Days later it was a go. \u201cLots of people we know offered to buy them off us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting lots of jokes though now. Every other order form I\u2019ve put in for other fundraisers people have said, \u2018Just check the quantity, make sure she\u2019s ordering just one, pie not one box of pies.'\u201d WGAC has also refunded $400 in postage for the boxes, which the Janetzkis have put towards their daughter\u2019s trip. \u201cIt really has worked out for the best for us in the end,\u201d Ms Janetzki said. While they wait for stock to sell out, the family have been having fun with it \u2013 building a wall in their garage, and then a throne in their lounge room. A spokeswoman for WGAC confirmed the Janetzkis\u2019 story. \u201cHaidee and Chris were so patient about this situation. I can\u2019t even imagine what it would have been like to have a whole pallet of toilet paper turn up at my front door,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cI can imagine there\u2019d be some folks around Australia this week who wouldn\u2019t mind it right about now.\u201d The spokeswoman said the company was unable to check all orders manually. \u201cWhen we were a smaller business, we\u2019d run manual checks twice a day on all the orders we received and a mistake like this would usually jump out during that process,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThen we\u2019d reach out to the customer before sending the order to the warehouse to make sure it was correct before shipping. \u201cBut as the business has grown up, we\u2019ve had to automate how we process orders.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Delighted residents welcome return of Darling River after three dry years", "date": "2020-3-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/03/06/darling-river-flowing-2020/", "transcript": "After a three-year wait, the community of Wilcannia in far-western New South Wales is celebrating substantial Darling (Baaka) River flows.

Short lens? How do they work with the light, with the subject? We like to reward a different eye.\u201d The Best News Picture of the Year was awarded to Laurel Chor for her image of a woman screaming at police officers in Hong Kong during the pro-democracy protests. The political and social unrest in Hong Kong was the \u201cbiggest sustained story\u201d of 2019, Ms Trotter said. \u201cThat image of a woman screaming at police \u2026 that image encapsulated it. \u201cIt gives you the feeling that the people aren\u2019t happy.\u201d In second place for Best News Picture of the Year was a photograph of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern embracing a Muslim worshipper after a right-wing extremist opened fire and killed more than 50 mosque-goers in Christchurch. Ms Trotter said the image, captured by Wellington-based photographer Hagen Hopkins outside Kilbirnie mosque, was a \u201cstand-out\u201d in the eyes of the judges. \u201cCapturing something like that is an art,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have time to go, \u2018Is the background perfect?\u2019 Instead he thought \u2018I\u2019m going to get down lower, I\u2019m going to get to the level of the people, trying not to disturb\u2026 I need to be here for this, I want this to capture what I\u2019m feeling\u2019.\u201d The powerful image has been painted on a silo in Brunswick in inner-city Melbourne. The third Best News Photograph of the Year was awarded to American journalist Paula Bronstein for her image of Pope Francis visiting young Catholics in Thailand. \u201cThis photograph demonstrates access and years of experience,\u201d Ms Trotter said. \u201cKnowing the Pope is coming, you could stand in front, or shoot from the side, but this photographer thought, \u2018I could get above and shoot from an angle\u2019. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about it, the hands reaching in, and the shape it creates.\u201d Other award-winning photographs include an image of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam, a woman wearing an Australian-themed hat at Oaks Day in Melbourne, and Nick Allbrook of the band Pond performing at the Splendour in the Grass music festival."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Quaden's family donate to local charities after declining crowdfunding Disneyland trip | The New Daily", "date": "2020-2-28", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/02/28/family-of-bullied-murri-boy-to-donate-to-local-charities-after-declining-crowdfunding-disneyland-trip/", "transcript": "The family of a Murri boy will donate more than $600,000 to local charities after declining a crowdfunding trip to Disneyland. Young Quaden Bayles, 9, who was born with Achondroplasia, the most common form of Dwarfism, was visibly distressed in a Facebook video his mother posted last week after he had been bullied earlier that day. In it, he was in tears and wanted to kill himself: \u201cGive me a knife\u2014I want to kill myself\u201d, he said. His mother Yarraka decided to share the video to show what her son had endured since he was three years old. American comedian Brad Williams, who also is a dwarf, set up a GoFundMe page on February 21, attracting almost $720,000 from 20,000 global donations for a trip to Disneyland. He wrote: \u201cThe bullying was so severe \u2026 I\u2019m setting up this GoFundMe to let Quaden know that bullying will not be tolerated, and that he is a wonderful human being who deserves joy. I want to fly Quaden and his mother to America, get them a nice hotel, and bring them to Disneyland\u201d. However, Quaden\u2019s Aunty Mundanara Bayles told NITV News that \u201cwhile it\u2019s a touching example of goodwill, the family will skip the all-expenses paid trip as they want to focus on the bigger issues at play\u201d. \u201cWhat kid wouldn\u2019t want to go to Disneyland, especially if you have lived Quaden\u2019s life. To escape to anywhere that is fun that doesn\u2019t remind him of his day to day challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my sister said \u2018you know what, let\u2019s get back to the real issue\u2019. This little fella has been bullied. How many suicides, black or white, in our society have happened due to bullying.\u201d \u201cWe want the money to go to community organisations that really need it. They know what the money should be spent on, So as much as we want to go to Disneyland, I think our community would far off benefit from that.\u201d \u201cWe need to come together and work out how to make sure young people like Quaden don\u2019t have to deal with what they have been dealing with,\u201d Ms Bayles said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had seven kids at the Murri School in Brisbane, where I am on the board, take their lives in the last ten years,\u201d she told NITV News. Mr Williams announced on Friday that about $100,000 will be donated to six local charities with the remainder going towards \u201ca fund for future medical and support expenses for Quaden\u201d. The charities Born This Way Foundation, STOMP Out Bullying, Dolly\u2019s Dream, Dwarfism Awareness Australia, Gallang Place and Balunu Healing Foundation are the likely recipients. The rest of the crowdfunding will go towards direct medical help, education, accommodation costs, food to feed the family, and for donating to any additional charities of their choosing. \u201cI have been in close communication with Quaden\u2019s family and fully respect their needs and the needs of Australian First Nations people who are experiencing bullying and discrimination at extremely high rates. \u201cBecause of this, I\u2019ve decided that the donations will be best served going to charities focused on helping individuals affected by bullying and discrimination,\u201d he wrote.  Meanwhile, Yarraka Bayles is pushing for a new law called Quaden\u2019s Law to be introduced into state and national school curriculums. \u201cWe discussed a care plan for Quaden if/when he chooses to return to school, or when we feel the time is right. We are working with the school to introduce an educational tools for schools package around disability awareness, diversity and inclusion,\u201d she told NITV. \u201cIt went okay \u2026 They were all very supportive in helping to move forward.\u201d Since Quaden\u2019s story, he has gone from despair to \u201chigh spirits\u201d as the family continued to just get on with their lives, according to Ms Bayles. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit overwhelming but we are doing good considering. It\u2019s pretty full on but we are strong enough to get through especially with all the mobs support and unconditional love,\u201d she told NITV News. \u201cQuaden is ok. He is spinning out a bit, we just have to protect our boy as best we can. We\u2019ve got a good team around us now.\u201d His Aunty said: \u201cHe\u2019s just an amazing kid that\u2019s larger than life.\u201d -with agencies"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "'Senate has voted to wish the baboons well': Runaway primate gets snip", "date": "2020-2-27", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2020/02/27/runaway-baboon-snip-senate/", "transcript": "A baboon that was on his way to a vasectomy when he and his two female companions escaped a Sydney hospital has had the big snip \u2013 and a mention in the Senate.

It was later revealed they were from the National Health and Medical Research Council facility in Wallacia, about 50 kilometres away in Western Sydney. According to Humane Research Australia, there were 272 primates used in medical research in the country in 2017. Of those, 165 were in NSW. Research at the lab has been used to tackle priority medical issues identified by the federal government, including diabetes, kidney disease and complications arising from pregnancy. Professor Annemarie Hennessy, a senior adviser at the facility, said the animals lived in an environment that resembled their natural habitat. \u201cThey would have been completely terrified outside their comfort zone in a world they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said of their escape on Tuesday. She said the facility had used baboons in \u201cimportant biomedical research\u201d in Australia for at least 30 years \u2013 justified only when there was \u201cno alternative\u201d. Mr Hazzard said the baboons were part of research programs that covered a whole range of health issues. When the program has finished with them, they are returned to their colony. NSW Police had earlier said there was no immediate danger to the public but people were advised to avoid the area. Footage shared on social media showed three baboons running in the car park as people took surprised double-takes. Animal activist and former GP Kevin Coleman said the primates\u2019 escape was a \u201cmajor concern\u201d that could raise biosecurity issues. \u201cIf an animal the size of a baboon can escape, how many mice have escaped? How many other animals have escaped,\u201d he asked. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know and this is the problem. We have to have transparency on these issues.\u201d NSW Animal Justice Party MP Emma Hurst said the baboons were \u201cmedical experimentation survivors\u201d who were trying to flee \u201cfurther painful procedures forced upon their bodies\u201d. \u201cThese are the hidden faces behind animal experimentation in this country,\u201d she said. The three primates were returned to the Wallacia facility late on Tuesday, and the male has had his vasectomy postponed. Baboons are known to be violent if threatened, but Mr Hazzard said the animals had \u201cbehaved impeccably\u201d. An investigation has been launched into why the truck\u2019s lock broke. The Sydney Save Animals in Laboratories spokesman said he thought experts were doing research into human-baboon hybrid organs to address the transplant crisis.

In the first officially recorded appearance of a live Bulwer\u2019s petrel in Australia, the bird \u2013 nicknamed Buggerlugs \u2013 is thought to have been blown south by adverse weather. He might even be an undiscovered species. He was found on the balcony of the Cronulla RSL, and later dug in his claws when two attempts were made by well-meaning wildlife carers to release him onto the chilly waters off Sydney. Ornithologist Lindsay Smith from the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association in Wollongong said Buggerlugs was a long way from home. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have ID so couldn\u2019t get a drink,\u201d he said of the appearance at the RSL. When Buggerlugs was identified as a Bulwer\u2019s petrel, the international birding community became excited. \u201cTo release Buggerlugs here off Wollongong would be like releasing it in the desert,\u201d Mr Smith said. Instead, Buggerlugs was fattened up with southern bluefin tuna (at $130 per kilo), wombaroo, insectivore mix and sea water. Money was raised and tickets booked to take Buggerlugs to Darwin on a scheduled commercial flight. He was checked into the luggage compartment like any other pet, and was in the Larrakia Nation Rangers\u2019 boat Mardma within an hour of arriving in Darwin on February 14. Rangers battled an outgoing tide of only two metres and unpredictable wet-season winds to get Buggerlugs back into a hospitable environment as quickly as possible. Larrakia Nation Land and Sea ranger Javadd Andersen said it was anything but hospitable for humans. \u201cIt was very rough and we had a lot of swell coming over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t head out too far because we had a bit of water coming over the front deck and we decided not to push ourselves too far.\u201d Damien Stanioch from NT Parks and Wildlife was also on board. \u201cThe conditions were ideal for the bird \u2013 a good strong headwind and fairly choppy, so he could use the wind to gain lift,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cLindsay gave him the final check to make sure he was still bright-eyed. \u201cWe simply held him in the hand and as soon as that offshore wind hit him in the face he just started flapping. \u201cIt was one of those now-or-never moments. \u201cLindsay opened his hand and he flew off beautifully \u2013 nice and strong into the wind. \u201cHe went off down toward the water and used that air pressure from the water and just beautifully followed the waterline until he disappeared over the water and then reappeared over the swell. \u201cIt was just so good to see.\u201d The team waited for 20 minutes before heading for home once they were confident Buggerlugs was safe. \u201cBecause he was housebound for a week or so, we weren\u2019t sure how his flight patterns would be,\u201d Mr Stanioch said. \u201cWe were all very, very nervous.\u201d Mr Anderson said: \u201cI hope the bird survives and lives a long and healthy life. It flew off pretty strong, so I hope it flies off in the right direction.\u201d The Bulwer\u2019s petrel is typically found in the latitudes between 10 degrees south and 40 degrees north.

By Saturday evening, she was closing on $8 million, prompting Barber to set a new target of $9 million.

Other celebrities to have pledged donations include Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban ($500,000), Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen DeGeneres, Pink and Hugh Jackman. Donations to the NSW Rural Fire Service directly benefit the volunteer firefighters on the frontline. You can contact your local brigade directly to help or donate here.

Why then are we giving you the low-down on what happened? When everyday people were asked to share their most generous act of 2019, it seemed help usually came from those who could do with the help themselves. Imagine this: A young mum pushing a pram that\u2019s carrying her one-year-old son arrives at your doorstep. She just got kicked out of home and only has the clothes on her back. She is also a drug addict. Before you ask yourself: What would I do? Consider this. Your youngest daughter has a genetic disorder and you\u2019re her full-time carer. You also have interim custody of your youngest granddaughter and are going for custody of your second youngest grandson. Instead of slamming her door shut, Kerie (surname withheld) welcomed Jessica (name changed) in. \u201cI was married to an alcoholic and he was also into drugs. He drugged me while I was pregnant with our first child,\u201d Kerie told The New Daily. She kept Jessica company while her son raided their pantry for \u201cwhatever she needed\u201d, filling two shopping bags to the brim. The 52-year-old didn\u2019t hold back when confronting the single mum about her drug habit. \u201cWhat would happen if you lost him (her son) completely?\u2019 she asked, to which Jessica responded, \u201cI\u2019d kill myself\u201d. Kerie pleaded with Jessica. \u201cMake him your reason to get clean. Make him your reason for living.\u201d Kerie cared for Jessica\u2019s baby while she briefly returned home to collect the rest of her belongings. Next. You\u2019re homeless, five months pregnant and only have $50 to spare. An elderly man catches your eye. He too is desperate for money. As Nikki (last name withheld) was explaining her situation, her eyes filled with tears. When asked about her most generous act this year, she recalled\u00a0seeing a homeless man in his 70s who was having a bad day. \u201cYou can just tell by the look on somebody\u2019s face,\u201d she said. Despite not knowing where her next dollar would come from, the 42-year-old Melbourne woman gave the man $20. \u201cThat made his day so it was worth it,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI\u2019d hate to be that old on the street and people just walk past me.\u201d Now, you have your hands full caring for your 72-year-old dementia-suffering husband who has become completely immobile. You later discover an old school friend is having a hard time coping with his extremely limited mobility due to post-polio syndrome and desperately needs a helping hand. Not only can\u2019t Trevor Cullen, 61, leave his home without assistance, but he struggles to have a shower and even get to the toilet on his own. Debe Thomas has been helping Mr Cullen apply to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. She has also started that process for herself, suffering from osteoarthritis and\u00a0fibromyalgia. Despite her chronic conditions, Ms\u00a0Thomas drives Mr Cullen to and from doctors appointments and even visits the local food bank once every fortnight to collect groceries for him. She also connects him to home-cleaning services and is enquiring about disability-friendly homes on his behalf. On top of everything, she keeps his mental health a priority. \u201cI found out that he hasn\u2019t even been hugged in 40 years. So now we make it a habit,\u201d\u00a0Ms\u00a0Thomas said. Next.\u00a0While working on a construction site, you notice an elderly woman who is struggling in the heat. She looks exhausted and could do with a refresher. After a day\u2019s labour in \u201cstinking hot\u201d weather, Melbourne builder Maarty Ploeg, 50, walked to a nearby IGA and bought the woman an ice-cream. \u201cShe was just so happy. Her smile was worth it all,\u201d he said. Finally, you\u2019re a stay-at-home mum and want to get back into the workforce. A brief google search brings up the State Emergency Service (SES). You know they need more volunteers but the idea of taking part in missing person searches or hazardous tree removals and other emergency response jobs seem daunting. This was Lisa May\u2019s fifth year volunteering for Victoria\u2019s SES. She was stumped for choice when asked about her nicest deed, as she\u00a0puts in about 30 hours every week. Ms May recalled speaking to a distressed elderly woman whose cat was trapped in her roof. She got the impression that the cat was \u201cpretty much all she had\u201d so her rescue team \u201cwent above and beyond\u201d to retrieve it. \u201cShe was over the moon with that and she actually ended up writing a letter of thank you to the unit,\u201d Ms May said."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Shock, tears and delight as company hands out $14.5m in staff bonuses", "date": "2019-12-11", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/12/11/real-estate-christmas-bonus/", "transcript": "Nearly 200 workers at a US real estate company are set for a joyous festive season after their boss announced they would share a $A14.5 million Christmas bonus.

The female shark, which was\u00a0tagged with a satellite transmitter at Malin Head on the northernmost point of Ireland, just happened to be photographed three years later. A recent study published by marine biologists at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and Western University in Ontario, Canada says the crossing is from\u00a0Ireland to North America is just the second time such a transAtlantic crossing has been recorded. The only previous evidence of a transAtlantic crossing came in 2008, when another female tagged with a tracking device swam from the Irish Sea to the coast of Cape Cod, Newfoundland. After a few months after being fitted with its tracking device, the equipment went dark. \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual,\u201d Jonathan Houghton,\u00a0one of the study\u2019s lead researchers told CNN. \u201cIf you put electronics in the sea, some things just glitch up after a while.\u201d Then, out of the blue in June 2017, the shark was photographed by an underwater photographer more than 4600 kilometres away, off the east coast of North America. The photograph was circulated throughout Europe before eventually making its way to the research teams. It was then they noticed the shark\u2019s no-longer-functioning tracking device and a small buoyancy aid fitted only to one shark. \u201cOver 1500 individual sharks have been equipped with either visual ID or satellite tags in the Atlantic to date, leading to just a single record of transoceanic movement \u2013 until now,\u201d study co-author Emmett Johnston said. \u201cThis new evidence offers invaluable information to help us better understand the movements of this endangered species within an international context.\u201d As well as being one of the largest sharks in (second only to the whale shark) the basking shark is also one of the oddest in appearance. The basking shark has several evolutionary adaptations for filter-feeding plankton, its main diet, including a greatly enlarged mouth and its highly developed\u00a0gill rakers. It has a conical snout and gill slits that extend around the top and bottom of its head.

But this two-year-old reef is teeming with life\u00a0\u2013 created from seafood shells collected from restaurants that would have otherwise ended up in landfill. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing how critters know there\u2019s something there, and they come to it,\u201d he says. \u201cCrabs, oysters, starfish, octopus, squid, snapper\u00a0\u2013 you name it, they\u2019re all there.\u201d This is one of 10 pilot sites in four Australian states rebuilding the enormous chain of reefs that once stretched along the coast from Noosa to Perth, that were all but wiped out by dredge harvesting last century. \u201cThey tore the reefs to pieces,\u201d Mr Pearce says. \u201cIt broke my heart.\u201d Back in the 60s, when Mr Pearce first joined the Albert Park Yachting and Angling Club, he remembers being able to collect buckets of oysters in the shallows of South Melbourne beach. \u201cIf you felt like a feed of mussels, you\u2019d just go and get them off the pier pole,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery house along here had a mussel rake. We used to have them with a bit of brown vinegar and pepper. \u201cPeople told me not to worry about the dredging, but it\u2019s left us with a marine desert. I just put my hand up at a club meeting one night and said \u2018We should do something about this\u2019.\u201d It was the start of what became a multi-million-dollar project to begin rebuilding Australia\u2019s shellfish reefs, funded by philanthropic giant The Nature Conservancy, with help from state and federal governments. It has restored more than 100 similar reefs in the United States \u2014 and now wants to do the same in Australia on a similar scale.

State and federal governments have provided some support for the projects underway so far, but we want them to invest so we can quickly scale up. \u201cIf we can get that, this can be a game changer for water quality and fish stocks in Australia.\u201d The conservancy is lobbying to get the project funded in the next round of state and federal budgets. It\u2019s pushing hard on its value as a job-creation scheme in the regions and also as a way of preventing coastal erosion. \u201cWe need them to understand that these reefs are part of our national infrastructure. It\u2019s just that they are alive. And we\u2019ve got a way to go to convince them of that.\u201d In just a few years, 8 million native angasi oyster hatchlings have been placed in the waters off Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia, on the recycled mollusc shells collected from restaurants. They\u2019ve turned empty, sandy seabeds into thriving ecosystems\u00a0\u2013 covering an area the size of the MCG in Port Phillip Bay. \u201cThe results so far have been staggering,\u201d Mr Gilmore says. \u201cA single native oyster can filter a bathtub of water every day. That\u2019s billions of litres of clean water every single year of being filtered.\u201d Mr Pearce says every time he goes back, it reminds him of the bay he once knew. \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of pink snapper swimming on that reef that wouldn\u2019t have been there otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can just keep doing this a chunk at a time, eventually we\u2019ll have something fantastic again.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Jacinda Ardern's rapid-fire achievements video goes viral | The New Daily", "date": "2019-11-5", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/11/05/jacinda-ardern-achievements-video-viral/", "transcript": "It\u2019s been two years since Jacinda Ardern became New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister at 37.

Hairy, primitive beasts roamed the bush. Enormous prehistoric creatures inhabited the seas. And the skies? They brimmed with alien spacecraft. How I wanted to believe. I was obsessed with the strange and the unknown. I had scrapbooks filled with clippings about the Loch Ness monster, the Yowie and its Himalayan cousin, the Yeti. I devoured books about ancient civilisations that had been mentored by advanced extra-terrestrial beings. At the age of 12 I was founder and president of the Aerial Phenomena Investigation Bureau \u2013 an Australia-wide society with more than 60 members dedicated to proving the existence of UFOs in our skies. Unfortunately, it was forced to close. Sinister government interference? No, something far more down to earth. The money I earned from my newspaper delivery round couldn\u2019t meet the cost of the monthly newsletter. And then I grew up. I threw away my tin foil hat \u2013 the one that had successfully been blocking the government\u2019s ability to read my thoughts from its secretive tracking base at Pine Gap. Cold, hard reason replaced that mysterious world of my childhood and science and logic became the slayer of all those dragons and demons. But maybe I was on to something\u2026 For the first time in history the US Navy last month acknowledged that three videos of strange objects filmed by its pilots between 2004 and 2015 were of \u201cunidentified\u201d phenomena. The US Navy videos, published by The New York Times, show objects reaching hypersonic speeds along the east coast of the United States. In other reported cases they swerved and made instantaneous stops in mid-air, defying the physical laws that constrain current aircraft. A Pentagon spokeswoman also confirmed the phenomena was being treated as \u201cunidentified\u201d and was just a part \u201cof a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years.\u201d The videos and the unprecedented statements by US military officials have created a predictable wave of controversy around the world, capping off an extraordinary year for conspiracy theorists and a lucrative one for manufacturers of tin foil hats. The world, it seems, wants to believe. The more certain our universe becomes through science and technological innovation, the more we search for the unexplainable. A Facebook post earlier this year that jokingly called on people to storm the secretive US air force base in Nevada known as Area 51 \u2013 long suspected of harbouring the wreckage of crashed UFOs and alien bodies \u2013 drew more than two million responses and forced the US government to increase security around its perimeter. And in the year in which we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo XI moon landing, more people on the planet than ever before believe it was all just a hoax, insisting NASA\u2019s astronauts only travelled as far as a Los Angeles film studio. Plenty of academic studies have produced compelling evidence showing that in uncertain times, when people feel increasingly helpless with little control over their lives, they are willing to suspend common sense and logic and look for answers in the far-fetched. We saw this in the US when the 9/11 attacks sparked widespread claims of government involvement. We saw this when Barak Obama\u2019s elevation to the presidency resulted in claims he was not a US citizen, spawning the right-wing \u201cBirther\u201d movement. We saw this in the allegations of Hillary Clinton masterminding a global child-trafficking ring from a rear booth in a Washington pizza joint. We saw it in the UK when Princess Diana\u2019s death in a car accident triggered speculation of secret service involvement. And we have seen it in Australia with ongoing lunatic conspiracy theories around the Port Arthur massacre and whether there was a second shooter. This is an age when science has explained \u2013 and proven \u2013 how the universe emerged a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. We have mapped the human genome, sent craft hurtling beyond the limits of our solar system and even, earlier this year, captured the first image of a black hole. But the more explanations we are given and the more our universe shrinks and becomes less mysterious, the more people cling to outlandish theories as a way of coping with their rapidly changing and out-of-control lives. Those UFO videos? I have no idea what those objects are. But I\u2019m certain they cannot be alien spacecraft. It makes no sense. Why travel the vast distances of intergalactic space in your souped-up, technologically advanced ship, only to arrive on Earth and play hide and seek with navy aircraft? But most of all, in an era when almost everyone on the planet has a smartphone and an excellent in-built, automatically focusing camera, why do UFOs only ever appear in front of people who don\u2019t know how to properly use one? So for now, let\u2019s retain a healthy dose of scepticism. The world we live in contains more than enough mystery already. Let\u2019s first solve some of those elusive Australian enigmas like why so many drivers insist on picking their noses while waiting for the traffic lights to change, and why other people insist on ending sentences with the word \u201cbut\u201d.

Labelled \u201cexceptional\u201d by the state\u2019s most experienced equine vet, twin fillies delivered by a mare at Spurrs Stud at Wagin in Western Australia\u2019s Wheatbelt are still alive almost two weeks after being born. The chances of twin foals being born alive are considered one in 10,000. But the odds of both animals surviving past their first two weeks are deemed much higher still, with most pregnancies ending in the death of at least one of the infants and often imperilling the mother. Spurrs Stud owner Kevin Spurr said the birth came as a complete surprise after he had opted not to have the mare, Pearl, assessed during her pregnancy. \u201cMy first thought was \u2018don\u2019t tell me another mare has had a foal and run away and left that\u2019,\u201d he said. Katanning Regional Veterinary Hospital owner John Maxwell has been practising as an equine vet for more than 50 years and said he had never seen the successful delivery of twin foals that go on to survive. Dr Maxwell said even in the unlikely event that twin foals were conceived, it was customary to destroy one of the foetuses or abort the pregnancy because of the extreme mortality risks involved. \u201cI\u2019m surprised, very surprised,\u201d Dr Maxwell said. After finding the mare and her twins \u2014 now named Snip and Drop \u2014 in a field, Mr Spurr said it was a race against time to get the tiny foals to a vet. Even then, he said the pair had to be brought home sooner than he would have liked because of the high costs of veterinary care. Adding to the difficulties, mother Pearl is missing an eye \u2014 the legacy of an accident when she was a yearling. It means Mr Spurr and his farmhand Nicole Kumpfmueller have had to provide round-the-clock care to ensure Pearl does not accidentally tread on the foals. Among their tasks has been helping to feed the twins every two hours at night. \u201cWe get out here and they\u2019re already waiting and know the routine,\u201d Ms Kumpfmueller said. \u201cAnd you have to give them antibiotics twice a day. \u201cEvery now and then we give them an extra milk bucket as well to make sure they have enough milk because we currently don\u2019t know how much she can produce for them. \u201cYou can\u2019t really go anywhere at the moment because every two hours someone has to be here to do it. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth it. If you look at them, they\u2019re just too cute not to get up.\u201d The road to adulthood for the foals is a long one as they are not out of the woods yet. Mr Spurr said even if they can make it, the chances of either going on to become a successful racehorse are low. But he said the twins have been bred from good stock \u2014 the stallion that sired them won almost $200,000 during a career on the track \u2014 and they could still develop into good breeders themselves. Regardless, he said the decision to keep the twins was born of hope rather than cold commercial realities. He is backing the miracle of life to triumph against the odds. \u201cReally, when you see something fighting for its life there\u2019s a tendency to want to help,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the back of my mind was the commercial aspect. \u201cBut when I saw them fighting \u2026 I wanted to give them that chance.\u201d \u2013 ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Truck makes 'brilliant recovery' after trailers sway wildly on freeway", "date": "2019-9-25", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/09/25/track-trailer-sway-recovery/", "transcript": "A dashcam recording has captured a B-double driver making a heart-stopping recovery on the\u00a0down track\u00a0of Adelaide\u2019s\u00a0South Eastern Freeway.

Their goal? \u201cLet\u2019s see them aliens,\u201d the post said. Area 51 has been shrouded in secrecy for decades, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of an alien crew from the crash of an unidentified flying object in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government would not even confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes. When the interest in the Facebook event became overwhelming, the US Air Force warned curiosity seekers not to breach the gates at the military base, which it said was still used to test combat aircraft and train personnel. But still the interest grew. Then\u00a0Mr Roberts teamed up with the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn to plan a music festival, dubbed Alienstock, in Rachel to entertain the expected crowds. He\u2019s since disassociated himself from that event, saying he fears it might devolve into a public safety crisis because of the sheer weight of numbers anticipated to attend. \u201cMy entire thought process for creating this was that it was going to be something funny for my meme page that probably a maximum of 52 people would see,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cI was absolutely terrified [when the FBI called]. But they were just concerned for my safety and the safety of others. They were doing their due diligence so I can\u2019t be mad about it.\u201d The official website for\u00a0Rachel, Nevada, echoed his warnings with a strident warning to intending visitors.

People will get hurt. \u201cSTAY AWAY FROM RACHEL NEXT WEEKEND!\u201d Mr Roberts is now promoting a new \u201csafer alternative\u201d planned for a more than two-hour drive from Area 51 in downtown Las Vegas. It even has a brand deal by way of a specially-created Bud Light beer can for the event.

An emergency declaration has been presigned, just in case. There are real concerns among locals about an influx of people to a place that has very limited services.

Speaking to ABC Pacific Mornings on Friday, he acknowledged that his introduction to the sport was a relatively recent phenomenon. \u201cWe\u2019ve had six days of professional kayak coaching, [which] we\u2019ve just finished going into the World Championships,\u201d Taufatofua told the ABC. \u201cAt the start of it I couldn\u2019t even stay on the kayak \u2014 so we had to learn very quickly.\u201d The championships are being held in Szeged, Hungary, and Taufatofua\u2019s K1 200-metre heat had a minor hitch. At the starting blocks, Taufatofua struggled to keep his kayak facing forward in strong winds, and eventually had to make a 360-degree turn while his competitors waited for him to get back into position. \u201cI hit the starting block and the will in the current swung around,\u201d Taufatofua said. \u201cWe\u2019d only learnt to start on a certain side, and I hadn\u2019t learnt the skills to stabilise myself under those conditions \u2014 so I went back around and kept my composure.\u201d Taufatofua failed to qualify as he finished last, clocking in at 58.19 \u2014 24.22 seconds behind heat-winner Strahinja Stefanovic of Serbia. To compete at Tokyo\u2019s Olympic kayak race, he must record the fastest time in his heat at the 2020 Canoe Sprint Oceania Championships in February, otherwise he may receive a place via a special \u2018tripartite\u2019 invitation. This invitation would be decided by the International Olympic Committee, National Olympic Committees, and the International Canoeing Federation based on previous results and whether or not the invitee fits the Olympic principle of universal representation. Taufatofua said the championships were the first time he had ever faced a sprint kayaking starting block. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t actually trained in them \u2014 I guess it was a comedy of errors,\u201d he said. But while it may have appeared to be an unconventional start in the sport, it hasn\u2019t weakened Taufatofua\u2019s resolve to make Olympic history. \u201cI want to be the first to compete in three unrelated sports \u2014 the goal is still there and it\u2019s only just started,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about criticism, and I guess that gives me the freedom to try.\u201d When he returns to Tonga, Taufatofua will also be trying to qualify for taekwondo in the Olympics, which may see him compete in two separate Olympic sports in Tokyo if successful. \u201cIt\u2019s always about trying to reach that next level,\u201d he said.

She figured maggots \u2013 which can be fed to livestock \u2013 might solve that problem. Her hope was to run a conventional farm. Instead, she recognised the \u201cbeautiful opportunity\u201d that maggots might solve bigger problems \u2013 those of of food waste and landfill, and the rising cost of feed for farmers. That was in 2014. Since the she has built a novel business based on the idea of \u201cdecentralised waste management.\u201d  Instead of food waste being transported to the local tip, modular units full of black soldier flies \u2013 parked in the basement of office buildings, schools, hospitals and subscribed by individual households \u2013 convert up to five tonnes of food waste a day into one tonne of maggots, and 200 kilograms of manure. No arable land is required for maggot farming, and less than a litre of water produces a kilogram of almost pure protein. The maggots are euthanised with carbon dioxide and sold as feed \u2013 and the manure sold to gardeners. It\u2019s a model that Ms Yarger is determined to see replicated and expanded across Australia. Plenty of businesses have foundered on their big dreams, but not many of them are earning revenue off the back and front end \u2013 or have hit the sweet spot of the zeitgeist so well. According to the Department of Environment and Energy, Australians in 2016-2017 produced 7.3 million tonnes of food waste across the supply and consumption chain. Of this, 2.5 million tonnes was created in our homes, 2.3 million tonnes in primary production and 1.8 million tonnes in the manufacturing sector. Public consciousness of this scandal has been elevated by the ABC\u2019s War of Waste campaign, now in its second series. Eight months ago, Ms Yarger\u2019s business, Goterra, entered a partnership with the CSIRO via the research body\u2019s Kick-Start Program, which matches start-ups and small businesses with research and development activities. In this instance, the CSIRO provides technical support and advice to Ms Yarger in optimising her fly breeding program. Part of the motivation here was to give Ms Yarger \u2013 and Australia \u2013 an edge in a business that is growing globally. This is according to\u00a0Dr Cait Paull who heads CSIRO\u2019s Pest Suppressive Landscapes Team \u2013 which focuses on studying the behaviour of insect pests and their predators, looking for new ways to protect crops from infestation. \u201cWe were pretty much straight-away able to help Olympia just by observing what she did, and being able to somewhat test and tweak it,\u201d Dr Paull told The New Daily. Dr Paull noted that \u201cbeing connected with an emerging Australian industry\u2026 meant the relationship was a two-way collaboration\u201d\u2013 allowing the CSIRO to test lab-based results in an up-scaled real-world situation. \u201cThe knowledge benefits are going two ways,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u00a0can test all sorts of things in the lab and get fantastic results. The next step of applying it to real world problems, or upscaling in a commercial sense, takes a long time. And we don\u2019t have the capacity to do that, or if we do it takes a long time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to take what we\u2019ve found in the lab, bring it down to Goterra and test it on the industrial scale.\u201d Dr Paull was unable to give an actual example because of commercial confidentiality agreements. The use of insects in waste management and farming is becoming a billion dollar business. \u201cThe world outside Australia has made moves in a commercial sense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the work we\u2019ve done provide (Ms Yarger) some advantage to get ahead of the game for Australia.\u201d Dr Paull said Mr Yarger seems to take \u201can almost altruistic\u201d to what her work could mean for Australian research.

Artist Wayne Malkin used the wooden end of the match as a tiny canvas, to create an oil painting of Barry Humphries\u2019 alter ego, Dame Edna Everage. The hand-painted portrait measures 2.3 millimetres by 2.3\u00a0millimetres\u00a0or about the same size as the letter U on a 20-cent piece. \u201cI was online and saw a news feed about an artist in Cyprus, who was claiming the smallest painting in the world,\u201d Mr Malkin said. \u201cHis painting was 6.9 millimetres by 7.1 millimetres. And I thought, as an artist, that\u2019s a really great challenge to try to beat.\u201d Mr Malkin said he settled on the end of a matchstick because viewers could easily compare it to other tiny objects. The Sunshine Coast-based artist said it took two months to paint, far longer than his usual and much larger landscape paintings. \u201cA lot of that time was spent trying different methods,\u201d he said. Mr Malkin experimented with using a single brush hair and pinpoint, before switching to the fibre from a bamboo skewer. \u201cIt was the right sort of stiffness and size that I could actually dot paint onto it, and gradually build up in the traditional way with oil paints to form a portrait.\u201d He said he never considered using artificial means like digital printing to create the image. \u201cThere is a smaller painting around, but it\u2019s done by laser \u2013 there\u2019s no paint on it. \u201cMine is a painting that is painted exactly the same way as any other traditional painting.\u201d The artist, who owns a gallery at Montville on the Sunshine Coast hinterland, said he chose Dame Edna as his subject because she has a distinctive face, even in miniature. \u201cIt\u2019s the hair. It\u2019s the glasses,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople look at this painting through the magnifying glass and say I know who that is. That\u2019s Dame Edna.\u201d Mr Malkin said he had consulted record books, but there were no official records kept on paintings because art was considered too subjective. \u201cI have been in touch with the Guinness Book of Records and they\u2019ve sent a number of emails back to me,\u201d he said. The record keepers described it as \u201ctruly amazing\u201d but could not publish the painting as an official record. \u201cIt\u2019s not objective. Someone could argue that this tiniest dot of paint is a painting for the smallest painting. And someone could also argue that the longest painting, say, is the stripe on the M1,\u201d the artist said. \u201cThey tried to subcategorise it in some way, but came back to me and said \u2018No, it\u2019s just too difficult to do that\u2019.\u201d But Mr Malkin said after a thorough search of the internet he was confident his painting was the smallest in the world. The micro-art is best viewed in the gallery with the magnifying glass provided, but even then Mr Malkin said about half of his gallery visitors could not seem to see the work. \u201cThe reaction has been a mix,\u201d he confessed. \u201cThe 50 per cent say \u2018I can\u2019t see what it is, it\u2019s just too small for me\u2019 and the people that can see it have just gone \u2018That is incredible. I\u2019m blown away by it.\u2019 And that\u2019s really satisfying to have people say that.\u201d Mr Malkin said he used special equipment to see the tiny end of the matchstick as he was painting. \u201cI have a small hand-held lens, which is more powerful than the display one.\u201d The artist said he would be willing to lend the work to other galleries, but it would not be for sale. Without a clear ruling from world record keepers, the title of smallest artwork is disputed. Turkish micro-artist Mesut Kul claimed in 2017 that he had painted on to the world\u2019s smallest canvas \u2014 a hair. He has also used other miniature canvases, including pumpkin seeds and beans. Another Turkish artist Hasan Kale, who has dubbed himself the \u2018Microangelo\u2019, has developed an international following by painting tiny images onto food. He has recently painted onto pumpkin seeds, grains of rice, peanuts, sugar cubes and strawberry seeds. Mr Kale has also dabbled in painting onto matches, with portraits of Albert Einstein, composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and artist Salvador Dali onto the heads of matchsticks earlier this year. When opening his latest micro exhibition in an Ankara shopping centre in June, the micro-artist said he had been working in miniature for more than two decades. \u201cEverything that we omit, do not recognise and throw out as trash sometimes has become my canvas,\u201d he said. \u201cI started with the idea of opening new windows with different perspectives and creating a new language in the world. \u201cIt has been 25 years since that day. I am glad that I have done this when I look back.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Move over mega parrot, there's a bigger penguin in town", "date": "2019-8-14", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/08/14/giant-penguin-new-zealand/", "transcript": "New Zealand\u2019s recently identified giant parrot is going to have to shuffle over a bit because there\u2019s a bigger bird in town.

They were analysed by a team that included Canterbury Museum curators Dr Paul Scofield and Dr Vanesa De Pietri and scientists from the Senckenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. C. waiparensis is the fifth ancient penguin species identified from fossils uncovered at the Waipara site. Dr Gerald Mayr, from the Senckenberg museum, said the site was arguably the world\u2019s most significant for penguin fossils from the Paleocene era. \u201cThe fossils discovered there have made our understanding of penguin evolution a whole lot clearer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to come, too \u2013 more fossils which we think represent new species are still awaiting description.\u201d The study team found that\u00a0C. waiparensis\u2018s closest relative was a fellow Paleocene species, Crossvallia unienwillia.

Its primary use has never been revealed, but that is common to many military bases across the US. Even the mere existence of Area 51, which is part of the wider Edwards Air Force Base, was denied for decades. It was eventually confirmed by the CIA in 2013, through records obtained under freedom of information laws. That report maintained the base was solely an aircraft-testing facility.

Her former home, the Steng Meanchey landfill in Phnom Penh, has long been a symbol of the country\u2019s poverty. Each day, thousands of people pick through the filth in the hope of finding edible food and recyclables to sell. On a good day Ms Ron would earn 50 cents, enough for a few cups of rice to share with her parents and six siblings. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it was smelly.

The local school only offered a place to one child per family, so Ms Ron missed out on a chance to study. She said she followed her older sister to school and learned what she could by looking through the classroom windows. Her life changed after a chance meeting at the dump with Scott Neeson, the founder of the Cambodian Children\u2019s Fund (CCF). \u201cHe asked me whether I wanted to study English, and at that time I had no idea what English was,\u201d Ms Ron said. \u201cI ran home feeling happy because he promised he would take me to school.\u201d Mr Neeson\u2019s charity, featured by the ABC\u2019s Australian Story in 2012, has provided education, housing and medical treatment to thousands of people in Cambodia since its launch in 2004. The poverty rate in Cambodia dropped from 53 per cent in 2004 to 13.5 per cent in 2014, according to UNICEF, but children\u2019s living conditions remain poor. In a 2018 report, the United Nations agency said a third of children under four were stunted and about half aged between five and 14 did not have access to proper toilets. Ms Ron said she vividly remembered her first day of school, aged 11, when for the first time she saw groups of children laughing and playing. She was also a quick learner and a good communicator; by 2016 she was on stage presenting a Tedx Talk in English. Through CCF, Ms Ron was able to secure a scholarship to complete a foundation year of study at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Trinity College. She graduated in June, paving the way for her to start a Bachelor of Arts degree when the new semester begins this month. While Ms Ron said she loved life in Melbourne (apart from the cold), she hoped to eventually return home to start a business and continue working with CCF.

The adult male box turtle is living life in the fast lane after undergoing a Lego transplant to get him moving once more. It\u2019s been a rocky road for the turbo turtle, who only had three legs when he was adopted by his owners. But after escaping from his outdoor enclosure in the US state of Louisiana, it\u2019s believed he was attacked by a raccoon or snake, which severed his remaining back leg. \u201cWhile he had three legs, he was able to move around very well,\u201d his owner Sandra Traylor said. \u201cHowever, once he lost his second leg it became significantly more difficult for him to get to where he was trying to go.\u201d Ms Traylor is the first to admit she wasn\u2019t sure what \u2013 if anything \u2013 veterinarians could do to solve Pedro\u2019s problem.

The wound where his leg had been torn off had healed quite well, she explained, and he was still able to \u201cbox up\u201d inside his shell for protection. \u201cWe discussed other prosthetics with his family if he was going to remain outdoors,\u201d Dr Rockwell said. \u201cHowever, they opted to make him an indoor pet and these wheels provided the best mobility for him in that environment.\u201d Armed with a tube of animal-safe epoxy and a Lego car kit, veterinarians got to work. They attached the wheels via axles that were secured to Pedro\u2019s shell and held together by syringe cases. \u201cThe most challenging part was figuring out a way to make it fit to his size,\u201d Dr Rockwell said. \u201cIt took some brainstorming, but once we came up with a design it was fairly easy to implement and attach.\u201d The newfound Speedy Gonzales took to his new wheels with gusto, according to Dr Rockwell, reversing and turning the prosthetics \u201cwithin minutes\u201d. \u201cThe benefit of Legos is that they are very lightweight, so for Pedro\u2019s size it was a perfect fit,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the very least, I hope it inspires veterinarians who don\u2019t work with these animals often to be creative.\u201d It is a sentiment echoed by Ms Traylor, who has lauded the veterinarians for going above and beyond the call of duty. \u201cWe are so glad he feels better.

But a colourful initiative to keep lambs warm with jumpers this winter has gained worldwide traction and has been saving lives \u2013 as well as bringing joy to farmers. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy and absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Marie Knight, a farmer from Coonabarabran in north-west New South Wales. Mrs Knight first put the call out to the world\u2019s knitters to help create the tiny jumpers one year ago and since then she has distributed more than 56,000 of them to Australian farmers. \u201cThe jumpers certainly help the lambs \u2013 and I planned on that \u2013 but what I never planned for was the extra support that would come pouring in from the people who knit them,\u201d she said. \u201cOften we get cards and letters of support to pass onto farmers and that\u2019s the beautiful thing.\u201d The jumpers have been donated from all around the world and, on any given day, Mrs Knight has been sending from one to 1000 items to farmers in need. \u201cThe furthest afield we have received jumpers was from Belgium and they actually came with beautiful chocolates,\u201d Mrs Knight said. \u201cPackages have also come from the United States, Canada, New Zealand and all over Australia.\u201d When Wollongong resident Noleen Shaw first heard about the worldwide push to knit lamb jumpers, she jumped with delight. \u201cI just love knitting of a night-time and my grandchildren don\u2019t like knitted clothes so I thought I\u2019d knit for the poor little lambs,\u201d Mrs Shaw said. The retiree said she knew few farmers but she recently knitted 12 jumpers \u2013 one jumper in each of the team colours within the National Rugby League competition. \u201cMy favourite jumper to knit was the one I did up in the colours of the Illawarra Dragons,\u201d Mrs Shaw said. She was told the farmer who received her lamb jumpers was delighted, which made her feel great too. \u201cIt makes you feel good knowing that you\u2019re doing something for the farmers,\u201d Mrs Shaw said. \u201cThey\u2019re having a rough trot at the moment.\u201d Mrs Shaw already has her next knitting project planned \u2013 she is going to create jumpers for lambs in all the colours of the AFL competition. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work out all the colours first, but I\u2019m going to do them too,\u201d she said. While they look cute and cosy, the jumpers help save orphaned lambs\u2019 lives. Sheep expert Geoff Duddy said lambs are most vulnerable in their first three days of life. During that time they use a lot of their energy reserves trying to keep warm. \u201cLambs have large surface areas so being able to regulate their body temperature is critically important,\u201d he said. Jumpers are ideal for lambs requiring extra warmth and protection, such as those orphaned, but Mr Duddy said lambs that do not require intervention should not have jumpers fitted. \u201cIf you are entering the paddock and disturbing the ewe to pull a jumper on the lamb that could interfere with their relationship and put the lamb at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther, if lambs get wet while in their jumpers \u2013 assuming they\u2019re unlined \u2013 that could actually cause them a lot of harm.\u201d As temperatures continue to drop and pasture growth freezes, drought-affected farmers across the country are continuing to supplementary feed their flocks \u2013 a practice that Mr Duddy said gives sheep extra energy to weather the cold. He said it would be a long and cold winter for many farmers. Forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology indicated this winter in NSW will be drier than average and the state is likely to see higher surface air pressures than normal, which will mean less cloud at times and a higher risk of frost in susceptible areas. Mrs Knight encouraged avid knitters to continue donating lamb jumpers this winter. \u201cAs farmers we all want to do the very best for our animals,\u201d she said. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "How pigeons and Brian the Alsatian helped with a winning war effort", "date": "2019-6-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/06/06/animals-world-war-heroes/", "transcript": "Pigeons and an Alsatian dog called Brian are among the heroes honoured for their vital roles during the D-Day invasion that helped bring an end to World War II.

Days before D-Day, on June 6, 1944, a pigeon named the Duke of Normandy was dropped into Merville with paratroopers from the 21st Army Group. Their mission was to ensure that four heavy-calibre guns trained directly on Sword Beach were out of action before D-Day, which was to be\u00a0history\u2019s largest combined land, air and sea operation. The only way to relay the success (or otherwise) of the operation was to release Duke of Normandy with the news. \u201cHis journey home took 27 hours and he flew through bullets and bombs,\u201d Ms Dickin said. The Duke\u2019s heroics delivered critical intelligence to Allied Command that saved many lives. Just days after, RAF homing pigeon Gustav, released by Reuters news agency correspondent Montague Taylor, relayed the first news report of the D-Day landings. He travelled 240 kilometres across the English Channel in five hours and 16 minutes with his message. Brian, who completed seven parachute jumps in his army career, was another Dickin Medal recipient. As the D-Day landings began, Brian was parachuted into the town on Ranville, but got stuck in a tree on his way down. Fellow paratrooper Sergeant Ken Bailey cut Brian down, despite being under fire, and the pair fought together over the next few months. After that operation, Brian remained on active duty in occupied Germany but was eventually reunited with his family. His Dickin Medal had the citation: \u201cFor excellent patrol work and qualifying as a paratrooper, Airborne Division, Normandy, June 1944.\u201d The 90th anniversary of the D-Day landings has been marked by veterans and world leaders on both sides of the Channel this week."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Vietnamese supermarkets find a-peeling solution to plastic packaging", "date": "2019-6-4", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/06/04/banana-leaves-used-wrapping-produce/", "transcript": "Supermarkets in Vietnam have come up with a genius way to reduce plastic packaging: To wrap produce in banana leaves instead.

The use of banana leaves instead of plastic for packaging vegetables is a great way to reduce single-use plastic. While it appears that some plastic is used for the label, the use of banana leaves greatly reduces the amount of plastic waste generated. They are simply wrapped in the banana leaf and bound using a length of bamboo. According to Forbes, of the nine billion tonnes of plastic ever produced, only 9 per cent has been recycled. The magazine also note that the\u00a0United Nations Environment Programme\u00a0estimates that by 2050 there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic in landfills, the environment and oceans, of which cigarette butts, plastic drinking bottles, food wrappers and plastic grocery bags are the biggest contributors."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Miniature donkey up to his neck in it rescued from septic tank", "date": "2019-5-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/05/31/donkey-septic-tank/", "transcript": "Firefighters have rescued a miniature donkey that became trapped after falling into a septic tank north of Brisbane.

Mr Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $US1.5 million gift to the school. The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $US40 million.

Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries spokesman Jorgen Ree Wiig has told The Washington Post that the beluga \u201cwas the first thing I saw outside of the window\u201d of his patrolling ship in the morning. Speaking from the city of Hammerfest, he said the whale had moved only about 25 nautical miles in the past week and appeared to enjoy being close to humans. That, he said, was strange behaviour for a beluga. The whale was first reported by fishermen, who saw it swimming around their boat in Arctic Norway last week. It was wearing a tight harness with\u00a0\u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d written on the strap, and a camera attachment. Fisherman Joar Hesten jumped into the frigid water to remove the harness, which was later\u00a0handed to Norway\u2019s special police security agency.  Audun Rikardsen, a professor at the Department of Arctic and Marine Biology at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsoe, said he believed \u201cit is most likely that Russian Navy in Murmansk\u201d was involved. The find has triggered fresh speculation about a sea mammal special operations program that the Russian navy is believed to have pursued for years. According to The Washington Post, the Russian Defence Ministry has denied its existence, but the same ministry did publish a 2016 ad seeking three male and two female bottlenose dolphins and offering to pay $24,000. Russia has major military facilities in and around Murmansk, on the Kola Peninsula, in the country\u2019s far north-west. While the idea of putting sea mammals to work for the military might seem far-fetched, there is actually a precedent. According to\u00a0The Washington Post, the US spearheaded such a\u00a0program in the 1950s. The US Navy has its own dolphin and sea lion recruits, which are used to find sea mines, retrieve objects from the ocean floor and gather intelligence for military divers. Meanwhile, Norwegian officials are wondering what to do with their beluga defector. Mr Wiig said one option was to transport it\u00a0to a sanctuary in Iceland \u2013 about 2000 kilometres away.

Four months ago, the Melbourne University student made a New Year\u2019s resolution to read more about climate change. He said he was concerned by the issue, but at the time did not know enough about it. As he read more and followed the protests of activists around the world, an urgency set in. \u201cFor a while I occupied that ground of feeling very afraid of climate change but only vaguely understanding what it meant,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I learnt more I became concerned by the inaction of our government \u2013 Australia at the moment performs really poorly on a global scale in terms of what we\u2019re doing for climate change. \u201cThis protest for me is about making a very direct plea to governments, and showing up and refusing to be ignored.\u201d The hike will take him through country towns from\u00a0Yea, Violet Town, Benalla and Wangaratta to Albury, Lankeys Creek, Rosewood and Tumut. Mr Loughnane plans to stop at each town to talk about climate change and garner signatures from any locals passionate about the cause. The petition will ask members of the House of Representatives to declare a climate emergency, aggressively lift emissions reductions, pursue renewable energy, ban the proposed Carmichael Coal mine and other fossil fuel projects, and ratify climate policy into legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t think my protest is going to hold leaders to account, but I hope it\u2019s part of a wider wave of protests and of action that pressures leaders to think about really changing things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people would be really shocked to see how far it reaches, and the types of things it\u2019ll affect \u2013 from food and water availability to the range of infectious diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s really crucial that we all start looking at it as the whole picture.\u201d Mr Loughnane considers himself among a growing number of young people across Australia and the world who are drawing attention to the impacts of climate change.

They look like their dad, too \u2013 a more wrinkled form of Merino that went out of favour years ago because it made the animal vulnerable to flies laying eggs on its body. University of Sydney researchers found the ancient sperm \u2013 from four long-dead rams \u2013 was as healthy and viable as samples that had been frozen for only 12 months. In fact, the numbers suggest the old fellas had a bit more kick in their tads than contemporary sires. According to a statement from the university, out of 56 ewes inseminated with the ancient seed, 34 were successfully impregnated.  This compares to recently frozen semen from 19 sires used to inseminate 1048 ewes, of which 618 were successfully impregnated. This gives a pregnancy rate of 61 per cent for the 50-year-old semen against 59 per cent for recently frozen sperm, actually a statistically equivalent rate \u2013 but who can begrudge a blue ribbon to Sir Freddie. If still alive, he\u2019d be old enough to be great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather to his newborns. \u201cThis demonstrates the clear viability of long-term frozen storage of semen. The results show that fertility is maintained despite 50 years of frozen storage in liquid nitrogen,\u201d said Associate Professor Simon de Graaf from the Sydney Institute of Agriculture and School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Sydney. \u201cThe lambs appear to display the body wrinkle that was common in Merinos in the middle of last century.\u201d The wrinkles were bred into sheep back then to maximise skin surface and increase the amount of wool the animal could grow. But it also made them vulnerable to infestation. \u201cThat style of Merino has since largely fallen from favour as the folds led to difficulties in shearing and increased risk of fly strike,\u201d said Dr de Graaf. The findings are yet to be published, but Dr de Graaf believes they will provide a benchmark and resource when looking \u201cat the genetic progress made by the wool industry over past 50 years of selective breeding. In that time, we\u2019ve been trying to make better, more productive sheep,\u201d he said. The rams were of Ledgworth, Merryville and Boonoke genetics, famous names in the wool industry. The Boonoke ram, \u201cSir Freddie\u201d was born in 1959 and sold to Ledgworth owned by the Walker family in 1961 for 345 guineas \u2013 about $660 in today\u2019s currency. He died in the 1970s but lives on as part of what\u2019s been described as a time capsule project. It was started in 1968, by the late Dr Steven Salamon \u2013 a world leader in sperm preservation, and something of a legend for how he survived a Siberian after World War II. Dr Salamon died in 2017. In celebration of the semen\u2019s 50th year and Dr Salamon\u2019s 100th birthday, the semen was thawed and inseminated in ewes as part of the the 2018 Balmoral Sire Evaluation Group, a trial into leading sires suited for fine wool production in western Victoria. Dr Jessica Rickard, a post-doctoral McCaughey Research Fellow in the Sydney Institute of Agriculture, did the original work to determine if the stored semen was viable for artificial insemination. This involved thawing the semen, which is stored as small pellets in large vats of liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees. Dr Rickard and her colleagues then undertook in vitro tests on the sperm quality to determine the motility, velocity, viability and DNA integrity of the 50-year-old sperm. \u201cWe believe this is the oldest viable stored semen of any species in the world and definitely the oldest sperm used to produce offspring,\u201d she said."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Kenyan science teacher wins $1.4m global prize | The New Daily", "date": "2019-3-25", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/03/25/peter-tabichi-global-teacher/", "transcript": "A science teacher from rural Kenya, who gives away most of his salary to help poorer pupils, has won a $1.4 million prize for the world\u2019s best teacher.

Using cash raised in a community cropping program, the locals rallied together and bought the run-down establishment to start afresh. After 12 thirsty months without any cold tap beer, the new building finally opened to the public this week and the celebrations began. The Nyabing Community Hub is open for business and the locals could not be happier. They lost their only competitive sport program and came very close to losing their beloved watering hole. But, thanks to some hard work and perseverance, a new place to socialise has been created. A community cropping program, which raised almost $1 million, provided the means for the Nyabing Progress Association to step in and save the crumbling town pub. \u201cWe lost our sport to lack of numbers and the pub was slowly dying,\u201d association member Justin Germain said. \u201cFarms have got bigger, there are fewer people, and we have a big generation gap. \u201cThe pub had been on the market for a long time and there were no takers, so something had to be done.\u201d Originally the plan was to refurbish the existing building but, once the work began, a whole can of worms opened up. \u201cThe window frames were crooked and there were rotting timbers and everything else,\u201d Mr Germain said. \u201cIt was in a poor state, so we had to build a new hub.\u201d The finished product is far more than just a licensed tavern. It also features a modern function room, office spaces, and short-term accommodation for people passing through the small agricultural town. The Nyabing Community Hub is modern and sleek, tucked between shops along the main street. The building features eye-catching stone work and a sleek timber bar top. Association member Fiona Hobley said the stone and timberwork were included not just for aesthetic purposes but also as a sentimental addition. \u201cIt was lovely to keep the granite rock, which is local to the area, and that has formed a really lovely fireplace, so you have the real earthy feel with the fire and stone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to top it off we have salmon gum timber, which used to be a tree that towered over the main street. \u201cDue to safety, it had to be chopped down. But we get to enjoy its beautiful timber now, right? \u201cWe love the natural elements and we live in the elements, so it\u2019s only fitting that our building have a part of that.\u201d Hundreds of people gathered outside the Nyabing Community Hub on Thursday to witness the official opening of their new collaborative space. After weeks of delays, Ms Hobley was relieved to see the open day finally arrive. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely amazed by the number of people who turned up. We knew there would be a lot, but this has exceeded expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a family place that we\u2019ve created, so it\u2019s great to have the children here. \u201cThey\u2019ve had to watch us go through the build and, to have it actually done, I think they\u2019re delighted to be inside.\u201d While the new community hub opened this week with plenty of celebratory drinks, the people of Nyabing say it offers much more than a place to unwind. \u201cI think you need a drinking outlet. It\u2019s where people come to let their hair down and get off the farms,\u201d Mr Germain said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a pub in town, you don\u2019t have much of a town I don\u2019t think.\u201d \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "What an innings!

The launch systems are aimed at ending US reliance on Russian Soyuz rockets for $US80 million-per-seat rides ($113 million) to the $US100 billion ($141 billion) orbital research laboratory, which flies about 400km above earth. Bridenstine told Reuters the cost per seat on the Boeing or SpaceX systems would be lower than for the shuttle or Soyuz.

This is the first time he has stolen food from anywhere,\u201d she said. Boris passed some of the chicken skewers and appeared to be in good spirits, until a month later when the pooch started to exhibit some strange behaviour. The family noticed Boris was not acting normally and was lethargic. After multiple vet visits and scans, Ms Lonergan noticed the pup had started coughing up blood. \u201cThey gave him a chest X-ray and found that he had fluid around his heart,\u201d she said. Following the X-ray, vets at the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic finally discovered the problem. \u201cThe doctor comes out and says, \u2018We\u2019ve got a situation \u2013 Boris has a kebab skewer in his heart\u2019,\u201d Ms Lonergan said. She said she was told Boris needed emergency surgery, or had to be put down. For Ms Lonergan, it was an easy decision. \u201cHe was only 19 months old when this happened. It was just like \u2018Nah, just have to do it! We will find a way\u2019.\u201d Manty Arnott from the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic told ABC Local Radio Boris was very lucky. \u201cWe assume the skewer turned around and went up through the stomach wall and up through the diaphragm and into the left atrium of the heart,\u201d Dr Arnott said. In a lucky turn of events for young Boris, the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic had a visiting cardiologist in town the day Boris came in. \u201cI think he is incredibly lucky \u2013 it was probably the best day for him to be here,\u201d Dr Arnott said. The vet told Ms Lonergan the skewer was millimetres from Boris\u2019 aorta, and one wrong move could have meant another ending to Boris\u2019 tale. Ms Arnott said while it was not rare for a dog to eat something it shouldn\u2019t, the fact that the skewer stayed in Boris for a month before he exhibited poor health was \u201ca freak event\u201d.

With the official recognition of lightsaber duelling as a competitive sport by the French fencing federation, young sword-fighters can now channel their inner Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Vader. Unfortunately for the really keen, the LED-lit, rigid polycarbonate replicas of the famed Star Wars lightsaber\u00a0won\u2019t slice a Sith lord in half. But they look remarkably like the lightsabers that Yoda and others wield in the blockbuster movies. Some of the more expensive sabers are even equipped with chips that emit a throaty electric rumbles \u2013 so they sound the part too. \u201cCape and sword movies have always had a big impact on our federation and its growth,\u201d French Fencing Federation secretary-general Serge Aubailly said. \u201cLightsaber films have the same impact. Young people want to give it a try.\u201d The physicality of lightsaber combat is part of the reason the federation has thrown its support behind the sport. It is equipping fencing clubs with lightsabers and training would-be lightsaber instructors, while officially recognising the three-minute duels. Like virtuous Jedi knights, the French federation sees itself as combating a Dark Side: The sedentary habits of 21st-century life that are affecting the health of ever-growing numbers of adults and children. \u201cWith young people today, it\u2019s a real public health issue. They don\u2019t do any sport and only exercise with their thumbs,\u201d Mr Aubailly said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming difficult to [persuade them to] do a sport that has no connection with getting out of the sofa and playing with one\u2019s thumbs. That is why we are trying to create a bond between our discipline and modern technologies, so participating in a sport feels natural.\u201d But not all of the converts to lightsaber duels are youngsters. Some are more like 49-year-old police officer Philippe Bondi, who was drawn to the idea of acting out the love for Star Wars he\u2019s had since he saw his first film at the age of just seven. Mr Bondi was a fencer for 20 years before switching to lightsaber duelling. He uses a\u00a0federation-approved lightsaber in luminous green \u201cbecause it\u2019s the Jedi colours, and Yoda is my master\u201d. \u201cI had to be on the good side, given that my job is upholding the law,\u201d he told USA Today. Mr Bondi was among the competitors at a recent national tournament outside Paris. They fought in a darkened hall, lit by spectacular illuminated swooshes of coloured blades, while fans dressed as Star Wars characters added their own colour. \u201cWe wanted it to be safe, we wanted it to be umpired and, most of all, we wanted it to produce something visual that looks like the movies, because that is what people expect,\u201d tournament organiser Michel Ortiz said. Nonetheless, lightsaber duelling counts its paid-up practitioners in France in the hundreds, not thousands \u2013 and it has no hope of a place in the Paris Olympics in 2024. But to hear the thwack of blades and see them cut shapes through the air is to want to give the sport a try. -with AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Fight to save dead shark found at abandoned wildlife park", "date": "2019-2-18", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/02/18/rosie-the-shark-abandoned-tank/", "transcript": "An unlikely campaign is growing to save a taxidermied five-metre great white shark discovered languishing in a tank in an abandoned wildlife park. Rosie, as the shark has been dubbed, has been alone in her tank at Victoria\u2019s former Wildlife Wonderland since 2012. The shark was captured in tuna fishing nets off South Australia in 1998. Her stuffed body was sent to the park at Bass, south-east of Melbourne, temporarily but she was left there to rot when Wildlife Wonderland closed seven years ago.

Mr McPherson\u2019s YouTube footage attracted international attention. It also led to the establishment of the Save Rosie the Shark Facebook page, which has nearly 4000 followers. There have also been some unwelcome visitors for Rosie. \u201cVandals have trespassed into the private property and tried their best to smash Rosie\u2019s tank.

Every winter since 2011, people from around the world head to Canada\u2019s northern Yukon Territory for the annual International Hair Freezing Contest at the Takhini Hot Springs, usually in February or \u201cany day that it is cold enough\u201d, according to its website. How do you win? Create the most creative frozen hairdo possible by soaking in the hot springs and allowing the steam to accumulate on your head while the cold air freezes your hair.

People would soothe their weary bodies in the natural hot pools in the evening, and the pools manager would challenge people to create the best frozen hairstyle. Average winter temperatures in the Yukon reach daytime highs of 13 degrees Celsius and lows of -22\u00a0degrees Celsius at night \u2013 the perfect temperature for hair freezing. The mineral-rich waters are between 36 degrees and 42 degrees, ensuring bathers stay warm despite the temperature outside. But the ice-sculpted styles have taken off in other wintery parts of Canada, including Banff, in south-western Canada. And don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t happen to have lustrous locks on your head.

When your hair is wet, the body can struggle to stay warm, which in turn makes your immune system work harder, leaving the body more susceptible to germs and viruses. Management at the Takhini say freezing hair won\u2019t damage it and dipping it back into the hot water thaws it immediately. But before you consider this the \u201call-clear\u201d to recreate the\u00a0super-freeze style, some hair stylists warn the freezing temperatures can cause hair breakage, especially for those with curly hair. \u201cWhen water reaches a freezing point, it\u00a0solidifies and expands by almost 10 per cent, so when you walk out on a cold day with wet hair, those water molecules that have adhered to the hair\u2019s outer cuticle layer solidify and expand,\u201d hair stylist Becky Marinich told Business Insider. The hair expert behind Aquage Haircare explained the hair shaft can swell and cause the cuticle layer to lift, leaving hair vulnerable to environmental and thermal damage. \u201cWhen hair freezes, it naturally becomes less pliable \u2013 like an icicle, frozen locks can easily snap,\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Westminster Dog Show: King continues reign of terriers", "date": "2019-2-13", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/02/13/westminster-dog-show-king/", "transcript": "When King, a wire fox terrier, won best in show honours at the 143rd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Tuesday night, it was not a crowd-pleasing announcement.

Brian Bayliss, 51, originally thought the formations were man-made. That was until he realised there were no footprints in the pristine snow surrounding the bizarre, doughnut-like circles. He told the\u00a0BBC\u00a0he had\u00a0\u201cnever seen anything like it before\u201d. As\u00a0Mr\u00a0Bayliss got closer to the wheels,\u00a0he said he \u201ccould see the sun through the middle, and they just made no sense\u201d. But thankfully there\u2019s a rational explanation. The weird wheels of snow, while extremely rare, are a naturally forming phenomenon commonly known as \u201csnow rollers\u201d. Also known around the world as \u201csnow bales\u201d, \u201cwind snowballs\u201d or \u201csnow donuts\u201d, it is believed the rollers are formed only when a combination of ideal wind conditions combine with certain terrain to\u00a0 blow bundles of snow along. The wheels of snow gather in size along the way, resulting in a wheel-like shape with distinct track behind it. In the past few years, snow rollers have appeared in the US, Canada, and Scotland. They\u2019re most likely to be found in a place with a slope, which can help the snow roll. It is thought that if the wind is too strong, or too weak, or the snow is too tightly packed, snow rollers will not form. BBC weatherman Ian Fergusson said weather conditions need to be almost perfect for snow rollers to form. \u201cThese are truly beautiful photos of a very rare meteorological phenomenon \u2013 called snow rollers or snow bales. Brian was very lucky to see these,\u201d Mr Fergusson was quoted as saying. \u201cConditions have to be just right for snow rollers to occur: A smooth, un-vegetated hillside, such as in this case near Marlborough, enhances the chance of them being formed. \u201cA layer of thin snow, settled atop existing ice and not sticking to it, combined with specific temperature, moisture level and wind speed, are fundamental to the creation of these natural oddities.\u201d -with agencies"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Marilyn Monroe fans set world record before hitting the beach in Adelaide", "date": "2019-2-3", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/02/03/marilyn-monroe-record-beach-adelaide/", "transcript": "Hundreds of Marilyn Monroe impersonators have claimed a new world record on a sweltering Adelaide day before going for a dip in the ocean to raise tens of thousands of dollars for cancer research.

It\u2019s also lighter than your everyday clinker, is very strong, takes heavy metals out of the environment, is more porous and so promotes heat insulation \u2013 and would make the construction industry more eco-friendly. And it would significantly free up landfill. The catch? It\u2019s a psychological one in the public mind. The new brick, developed by RMIT University scientists, is made using biosolids, the sludgy remains of sewage after it goes through the wastewater treatment process. In other words, what you drop into your toilet has the potential to build walls and make the world a more sustainable place. The US produces about 7.1 million tonnes of biosolids a year, while the EU produces\u00a0more than 9 million tonnes. In Australia, 327,000 tonnes of biosolids are produced annually. While some biosolids are used in agriculture as fertiliser (in dry\u00a0form it looks like soil) most of it ends up in landfill or storage. This has proved unsustainable for Melbourne Water and its treatment plants. Last May the body announced it has trucked its millionth tonne\u00a0 of biosolids from its eastern treatment plant to a landfill rehabilitation project \u2013 but it said it had hopes that the construction industry might one day use biosolids in bricks and offer a permanent solution to the problem. Those hopes have been nurtured for a long time. Melbourne Water trialled biosolid bricks 15 years ago in partnership with a South Australian brick company. The results were encouraging and the construction industry wasn\u2019t turned off by the idea. But the bricks weren\u2019t durable, and for Melbourne Water it was back to the drawing board. Eventually Associate Professor Abbas Mohajerani, from RMIT\u2019s school of engineering, took up the challenge. Dr Mohajerani had previously experimented with making bricks and asphalt from cigarette butts. \u201cThere are six trillion of them littering the world,\u201d he said in an interview that suggested he regards cigarette butts as a personal affront, and hasn\u2019t given up on the idea of making them useful. He\u2019s become similarly passionate about biosolids and how it can be used to conserve resources in the brick industry. \u201cMore than 3 billion cubic metres of clay soil is dug up each year for the global brickmaking industry, to produce about 1.5 trillion bricks,\u201d he told The New Daily. \u201cI tried to visualise what that means\u2026 and worked out it is the equivalent of 1000 soccer fields turned into a hole 440 metres deep.\u201d With funding from RMIT, Melbourne Water and the Australian government Research Training Program, Dr Mohajerani became the lead investigator in producing a biosolid brick that has proved technically viable. He said the research tested the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fired-clay bricks incorporating different proportions of biosolids, from 10 to 25 per cent. The biosolid-enhanced bricks passed compressive strength tests and analysis demonstrated heavy metals were largely trapped within the brick. Also, the biosolids bricks were more porous than standard bricks, giving them lower thermal conductivity \u2013 and would make households more environmentally sustainable. The research also showed brick-firing energy demand was cut by up to 48.6 per cent for bricks incorporating 25 per cent biosolids. \u201cThis is because of the organic content of the biosolids and so could considerably reduce the carbon footprint of brick manufacturing companies,\u201d Dr Mohajerani said. But how soon could these bricks come on the market? Dr Mohajerani said he hoped that government building codes could confidently mandate a conservative 15 per cent biosolids component in house bricks in the near future \u2013 based on the success of the research. But without the political will, \u201cIt would take another 20 years\u201d and the problems dogging water treatment plants would only be compounded. A spokeswoman from Melbourne Water said there would be \u201cfurther work and development around this exciting research\u201d."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Snake coils around teenage boy's arm as he sleeps", "date": "2019-1-17", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/01/17/snake-attacks-teenage-boy-cape-york/", "transcript": "Emma and Neville Jackson woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of their screaming 14-year-old son, only to discover he had been attacked by a three-metre-long snake.

Looking frail, dishevelled with matted hair and wearing shoes too big for her, Jayme spotted a woman, Jeanne Nutter, walking her dog on a nearby snow-covered street on Thursday afternoon. Jayme yelled out: \u201cPlease help me! I don\u2019t know where I am! I\u2019m lost!\u201d Ms\u00a0Nutter recognised Jayme immediately due to the enormous public campaign to find her after she disappeared from her home town of Gordon, some 120 kilometres away, on October 15 after her parents James and Denise were shot dead and the front door was left open. \u201cI just kept telling myself \u2018Don\u2019t let her know I\u2019m scared, just talk calmly, walk calmly\u2019,\u201d she told reporters.

She said she did not know him.\u201d Jayme\u2019s grandfather Robert Naiberg said in a telephone interview on Saturday that no one in the family knew Patterson. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know Jayme. He didn\u2019t know [parents] Denise or Jim,\u201d Naiberg said. \u201c[Jayme] don\u2019t know him from Adam. But he knew what he was doing. We don\u2019t know if he was stalking her or what.

Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald says Jayme is the hero in this case, naming her kidnapper as 21-year-old Jake Thomas Patterson who, less than 15 minutes later, was in custody after police pulled over his car based on Closs\u2019s description. \u201cJayme is the hero in this case.

Almost 1500 volunteers, roughly half the population of Barron (3400), located 145 kilometres north-east of Minneapolis, combed cornfields and wooded areas refusing to give up the search for Jayme. Patterson, a resident of Gordon, was charged on Friday with allegedly kidnapping and murdering James and Denise Closs with a shotgun. \u201cThe suspect had specific intentions to kidnap Jayme and went to great lengths to prepare to take her,\u201d said Sheriff Fitzgerald. \u201cI know all of you are searching for the answer why any of this happened,\u201d Sheriff Fitzgerald said. \u201cBelieve me, so are we.\u201d Jayme\u2019s aunt and godmother, Jennifer Smith, told Good Morning America she just cried \u201clots of happy tears\u201d after hearing the news her niece had been located. She has since shared\u00a0on social media the first photo of herself with Jayme and her dog, Molly, \u2013 a picture of the duo being reunited at the hospital on Saturday morning (AEDT), saying: \u201cWe said we\u2019d never give up, and we didn\u2019t.\u201d About 350 people under the age of 21 are kidnapped by strangers in the United States each year, according to FBI data.

I\u2019m praying for Jayme and all her family that they can have a joyous reunion and as the rest of the country celebrates alongside this happy occasion we all are mindful to give the family their space and privacy on their road to finding a new sense of normal and moving forward. I have no doubt Jayme and her family will forever appreciate the efforts and prayers of the many thousands of people who contributed and kept them in their thoughts and prayers! I hope we may all continue to support and embrace Jayme as she reclaims her life and comes to terms with the reality of her situation. What a brave, strong, and powerful survivor!!!!

Participants had improved lung function and cognition and a reduction in the decline of their motor disability. Motor neurone disease is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease with the death of brain cells which control muscle movements, eventually causing paralysis. Patients usually die of respiratory failure within three years of diagnosis and there are no treatments or therapies available. Researchers plan a larger, second stage trial to confirm the drug\u2019s effectiveness in mid to late 2019. \u201cIt is gratifying to see such promising results made possible by collaborative fundamental research at the interface between chemistry and biology,\u201d University of Melbourne Professor Paul Donnelly said. The drug is also being tested on patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. The research comes after the establishment of the Fight MND organisation in 2014 by co-founder and former Melbourne Football club coach Neale Daniher. Mr Daniher went public with his diagnosis and battle with the disease to raise funds and awareness to help find a cure.

Rachael Willson is raffling off her custom-made coffee caravan named Ruby, sparking interest from around Australia, and even as far afield as Germany. Ms Willson first parked the 1950s replica beside the Ross Creek boat ramp at Yeppoon on Queensland\u2019s Capricorn Coast about five years ago after it was built over nine months by a local carpenter. She has since grown a vibrant community and a diverse circle of friends around the little blue and white van. \u201cI always get a little bit of itchy feet and I\u2019ve had a lot of customers who\u2019ve said to me they\u2019d love to have a little business like Ruby,\u201d she said. \u201cBut financially, for a lot of people, [starting or buying a business] can be a bit of a strain.\u201d Having read about similar raffles around the world, Ms Willson said she loved the idea and wanted to be the first in Queensland to do it. \u201cIt gives everybody the chance to throw their hat in the ring and I\u2019d love to see it go to somebody that wants it more for passion than financial [reasons], because she\u2019s [Ruby\u2018s] got to be loved,\u201d Ms Willson said. At $50 a ticket, the entry includes a water colour portrait print of Ruby Caravan by local artist, Belinda Reid. Ms Willson hopes to sell 1900 tickets, which is the number of available prints, to raise $95,000. \u201cI probably would\u2019ve made more money by a traditional sale, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Ms Willson said. \u201cI like to help the community and watching people getting excited about what they would do if they won her \u2026 it\u2019s a bit of a thrill.\u201d Commercial sales agent and buyer\u2019s broker Bruce Coudrey said Ms Willson\u2019s plan was a \u201cgutsy\u201d way of overcoming the supply-versus-demand challenge that faced many small business owners who wanted to sell up, especially those in regional areas. \u201cTo get your business out there and stand out from the crowd, this is a really clever technique,\u201d Mr Coudrey said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try these sorts of things, otherwise it\u2019s going to be very hard for a buyer to find it because there are so many others [businesses] to look at. \u201cWe reckon that there\u2019s currently 41,000 businesses for sale across Australia right now and there\u2019s not 41,000 buyers looking to buy small businesses.\u201d Mr Coudrey, whose national agency has sold more than 4000 businesses since 1995, said the childcare sector was about the only industry where the number of buyers outstrip sellers. He said another common hurdle the raffle method would also remove was the issue of finance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not an easy business for a bank to lend money on, so even if a buyer wanted to buy it, getting money from a bank wouldn\u2019t be easy, especially since the royal commission, that\u2019s really tightened up lending,\u201d Mr Coudrey said. However, he said he did not expect raffling off businesses to become commonplace. \u201cWhen you sell a normal business, there\u2019s a lot of little things you need to cover like restriction of trade, gift vouchers, especially with leased premises \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of disclosure documents that need to be completed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for a caravan like this, it works perfectly.\u201d Ms Willson said drawing a winner would be bittersweet, as she is still not used to the idea of giving up her days with Ruby, named after her great grandmother. \u201cI very often open up and see someone sleeping in their car, so you do find a lot of people who have amazing stories, hardship stories,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll stay here in Yeppoon so I get to see her, but if not, I\u2019m just going to have to embrace her new adventure.\u201d And it is not just the caravan she will miss. Ms Willson has developed some special friendships with many of her regular customers. One of those is grey nomad and sailing enthusiast, John Amber. Mr Amber drove his campervan into the Ross Creek car park about two years ago and has spent every morning since perched on the park bench, watching the customers come and go. The 66-year-old was the first to buy a ticket in the raffle but said he has no plans of coming out of retirement. \u201cThe moment they call out my name, there\u2019ll be a For Sale sign right beside it,\u201d Mr Amber said. Too tall to stand up straight inside the van, Mr Amber said if Ruby ended up leaving Yeppoon, it was likely he would pull up stumps and continue north on his own caravan adventure. \u201cI\u2019d move on. I\u2019ve got the old bus over there and I better get somewhere before it rusts out,\u201d Mr Amber said. The raffle will be drawn via a computerised lottery system by Ms Willson\u2019s solicitors when all 1900 tickets are sold. \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Stay safe: How to spot a rip at the beach | The New Daily", "date": "2019-1-2", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2019/01/02/how-to-spot-rip-beach/", "transcript": "The beach can seem like the ultimate destination at any time on\u00a0the long, hot days of the Australian summer.

A fifth person was saved by volunteer guards while swimming between the flags. \u201cWe saw an increase in the strength and frequency of rip currents last season, so it\u2019s important that people become familiar with how to identify, avoid and escape rip currents,\u201d\u00a0LSV acting life saving operations manager Kane Treloar said. \u201cThey can occur at all beaches, even in bays.\u201d He urged beachgoers looking for relief from the hot weather to draw a line in the sand when they get to the beach \u2013 and to stop, look and plan before rushing into the water. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that people realise just how dangerous beaches can be, even when the weather is nice,\u201d he said.  Associate Professor Rob Brander, from the University of New South Wales, told the ABC that surf life savers\u2019 red and yellow flags were an extremely effective way to keep people safe, but it was not possible to patrol every stretch of beach on the Australian coastline. \u201cIt is rare for people to drown between the flags, but we simply don\u2019t have enough flags,\u201d\u00a0Professor Brander said. \u201cWe hear the message to swim between the flags so often that we kind of switch off, and there\u2019s a dangerous complacency about swimming at unpatrolled beaches. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand things like rip currents and dangerous breaking waves, and you are not a good swimmer, you are at such incredible risk when you swim at an unpatrolled beach.\u201d Gold Coast chief lifeguard Warren Young said patrolled areas offered the greatest security for swimmers. \u201cWe are really saying \u2018go where the guardians are\u2019 \u2013 where the life guards and professional people are and the life savers,\u201d\u00a0Mr Young told the ABC. \u201cIf you go for a swim on an open beach on this coastline and if you are not a surfer or an experienced surf life saver and you have no floatation and your kids get into trouble, someone\u2019s going to drown.\u201d Information about patrolled beach locations and times is available at\u00a0beachsafe.org.au, and by downloading the Beachsafe app."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "From television to the economy, there's a lot to look forward to in 2019 | The New Daily", "date": "2018-12-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/12/31/reasons-looking-forward-2019/", "transcript": "Another year is over and we say goodbye to a mixed 2018 punctuated by political manoeuvrings and scandals, tragedies and heroic triumphs, and angry tweets and global\u00a0uncertainty.

Winter is well and truly here, and the show\u2019s producers have not only promised answers to all the tantalising/irritating questions posed in the previous seven seasons, they\u2019ll also give us the the bloodthirsty final battle\u00a0we\u2019ve\u00a0been waiting for. As Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) told Entertainment Weekly in November, the\u00a0final battle \u201cmakes the Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park\u201d.  While Canberra bears little resemblance to the Westeros capital of Kings Landing, the political bloodshed and recriminations spawned by the\u00a0 Liberal leadership spill in August was worthy of a Game of Thrones plot. Regardless of political machinations, Australians will have their\u00a0own chance to decide who leads their nation when they go to the polls for a federal election this year. While the date is yet to be announced, an election must be held by May at the latest. And if the polls are to be believed, Bill Shorten could be prime minister\u00a0with\u00a0a landslide victory in less than six months. While 2018 was plagued by talk of an impending housing market collapse, low wage growth and record household debt, much of that has overlooked a fairly important detail: Australia\u2019s economy remains a \u201cstandout\u201d among developed economies. Global consultancy firm Deloitte\u00a0pointed out in October that \u201cAustralia\u2019s economy remains on a steady trajectory\u201d despite the nation\u2019s seemingly unending political turmoil. The Reserve Bank agrees, noting in its November statement on monetary policy that \u201cdomestic economic conditions have been a bit stronger\u201d than predicted in the previous statement in August. There could also be good news for\u00a0pay packets\u00a0in 2019, with the RBA predicting a \u201cmodest pick-up\u201d in wages, supported by the steady falls in unemployment seen through the past year. Deloitte shared this view, as did the OECD in\u00a0its economic forecast summary from November, adding the RBA will need to monitor its policies as wages increase. And if you were worried about the value of your home, the \u201ccrash\u201d that Australia\u2019s property market has been supposedly barrelling toward will probably turn out to be something of a \u201csoft landing\u201d this year, according to property expert Michael Yardney. \u201cI\u2019m calling it a soft landing because there are very few forced sales at present, and only recently (December 2018) APRA have lifted their restrictions on interest-only loans to investors and the RBA Governor has encouraged the banks to lend more,\u201d he said in an article published on December 26. This year, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious plan to revolutionise the global internet is expected to take another leap as\u00a0SpaceX looks into raising a further $US500 million ($710 million) in private equity to make his plan to take the internet to the developing world a reality. Called Starlink, the project will see Space X launch 12,000 satellites to create a network of delivering the world wide web to every corner of the world. Gamers will rejoice as yet another console is rendered redundant by the\u00a0possible release of Sony\u2019s next-generation PlayStation 5 (PS5). Shawn Layden, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, recently confirmed to German website,\u00a0Golem.de,\u00a0to expect the PS5 in 2019. Speculation as to what it will offer has raged ever since. With a women\u2019s World Cup looming, 2019 might be the year Australia stakes its claim to having the world\u2019s best footballer. Sam Kerr was nominated for the inaugural female Ballon d\u2019Or in 2018, but lost out to Norway\u2019s Ada Hegerberg. TND\u2019s\u00a0sports editor Francis Leach says Kerr is every bit as good as\u00a0Hegerberg\u00a0and if she\u00a0plays with the full range of her talent at June\u2019s World Cup in\u00a0France,\u00a0she will become Australia\u2019s most celebrated sports star, and the Matildas its most venerated team.  English cricket fans, meanwhile, are salivating at the prospect of hounding the \u201ccheating Aussies\u201d when they arrive to defend the Ashes in August. While current performances from\u00a0Tim Paine\u2019s Australian team\u00a0has been underwhelming, the potential return of the \u201cCape Town trio\u201d of David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft significantly boosts\u00a0the baggy green batting stocks and makes them a real chance to retain the urn, despite the howls of derision and the insults that will rain down upon them wherever they go. If Australia can win the Ashes in England after all that has gone on, it would be one hell of an achievement. In cycling, Richie Porte has been considered a potential\u00a0Tour de France winner for a number of years but it hasn\u2019t come together for him so far. Leach says it\u2019s now or never from the pocket rocket from Launceston, Tasmania, after\u00a0he abandoned the 2018 Tour after\u00a0breaking\u00a0his collarbone on Stage 9. At 33 years of age, Porte will not get a better chance to join Cadel Evans as an Australian cycling legend by winning the world\u2019s most celebrated race."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "US military defy Trump's government shutdown to man Santa tracker | The New Daily", "date": "2018-12-24", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/12/24/norad-santa-tracker/", "transcript": "The US government may be partially shut down, but that won\u2019t stop hundreds of volunteers dressed in Christmas hats and military uniforms from taking calls from children across the world who want to know when Santa will be coming. The military says the NORAD Tracks Santa won\u2019t be affected by the government shutdown because it is run by volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado and is funded by the Department of Defence budget that was approved earlier this year. Now in its 63rd year, the Santa tracker became a Christmas Eve tradition after a mistaken phone call to the Continental Air Defence Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1955. CONAD, as it was known, had the serious job of monitoring a far-flung radar network for any sign of a nuclear attack on the US. When Colonel Harry Shoup picked up the phone that day, he found himself talking not to a military general, but to a child who wanted to speak to Santa Claus. A Colorado Springs newspaper had run an ad inviting kids to call Santa but mistakenly listed the hotline number. Colonel Shoup figured out what had happened and played along. The tradition has since mushroomed into an elaborate operation that attracts tens of thousands of calls every year. For the 1500 civilian and military volunteers who will answer the phones for kids calling 1-877-HI-NORAD, it infuses the holiday with childlike wonder. \u201cThey\u2019re all really sweet, small voices,\u201d said Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer the phones in two previous years. The North American Aerospace Defence Command \u2013 a joint US-Canadian operation based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that protects the skies over both countries \u2013 has taken over the Santa tracker since the tradition started. The military command centre embraced and expanded the Santa-tracking mission and has been rewarded with a bounty of goodwill and good publicity. In the event of a government shutdown, NORAD will continue with its 63-year tradition of NORAD Tracks Santa on Dec. 24. Military personnel who conduct NORAD Tracks Santa are supported by approximately 1,500 volunteers who make the program possible each and every year. pic.twitter.com/fY0oyjrdDc \u2014 NORAD & USNORTHCOM (@Norad_Northcom) December 21, 2018 Last year, NORAD Tracks Santa drew 126,000 phone calls, 18 million website hits, 1.8 million followers on Facebook and 179,000 more on Twitter. It takes 160 phones to handle the calls that pour in. New volunteers get a playbook that briefs them on the questions kids might ask. Big screens on the walls show a Santa icon making blistering progress around the globe. US and Canadian officers do live TV interviews from the phone rooms. \u201cIt really gets you into the Christmas spirit,\u201d said Hill, a student at Mississippi State University who got involved through Air Force family members stationed in Colorado Springs. One year, she took a call from a boy who began reading a very long Christmas list. \u201cI remember having to cut him off after the 10th present or so,\u201d she said, explaining to him that she had to take calls from other children. Sometimes the volunteers have to handle the unexpected. In 2012, a child from Newtown, Connecticut, asked if Santa could bring extra toys for families who had lost children in the mass shooting that year at Sandy Hook Elementary. -AP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Painting looted during WWII coming home to Ukraine", "date": "2018-12-23", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/12/23/painting-looted-wwii-ukraine/", "transcript": "A painting that was stolen during World War II and later spent decades in a US home will be returned to an art museum in Ukraine.

The previous couple in the home said the painting was already there when they purchased the house from a Swiss man in 1962. When Tracy and his wife moved to a different house in the area, they paid $52,500 to add a sunroom big enough to display the painting. \u201cThis painting was a beautiful painting, and we treasured it,\u201d Gabby Tracy, 84, said on Saturday. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t help but admire the fine painting, what detail was in Ivan\u2019s face.\u201d But as they made plans to move to a condominium in Maine last year, they realised the painting wouldn\u2019t fit. They hired an auctioning company near Washington to sell the work, which was appraised at about $US5000 ($7100). After the auction house added the painting to its catalogue, though, an employee received an urgent email from an art museum in Ukraine. \u201cAttention! Painting \u2018Ivan the Terrible\u2019 was in the collection of the Dnepropetrovsk Art Museum until 1941 and was stolen during the Second World War,\u201d the email said, according to court documents. \u201cPlease stop selling this painting at auction!!!\u201d The museum identified the painting as a 1911 work by Mikhail Panin, titled Secret Departure of Ivan the Terrible Before the Oprichina. It was a permanent exhibit at the Ukrainian museum until 1941 but disappeared during Nazi occupation of the city. FBI officials took custody of the painting and later traced it to the Swiss man who sold the Ridgefield home in 1962. Officials didn\u2019t release his name but said he moved to the US in 1946 after serving in the Swiss Army. He died in 1986. Gabby Tracy said it\u2019s unknown how he obtained the painting. After learning it had been stolen, the Tracy couple agreed the painting should be returned to Ukraine. The story particularly moved Gabby, who was born in Slovakia and survived the Holocaust. Her father, Samuel Weiss, died in a concentration camp. \u201cThere was never a question that it was going back.

The heavily armoured, club-tailed ankylosaurs are thought to have stopped themselves from overheating in the Cretaceous sun by using their long and twisting nasal passages. These acted as radiators, transferring heat from the body to the inhaled air and cooling blood on its way to the brain. Ruger Porter, one of the study\u2019s co-authors, said: \u201cWhen we reconstructed the blood vessels, based on bony grooves and canals, we found a rich blood supply running right next to these convoluted nasal passages. \u201cHot blood from the body core would travel through these blood vessels and transfer their heat to the incoming air. \u201cSimultaneously, evaporation of moisture in the long nasal passages cooled the venous blood destined for the brain.\u201d Researchers from Ohio University and the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine published their findings in the journal PLOS ONE. They used CT scanning and engineering to simulate how air moved through the nasal passages of two different ankylosaur species, the hippo-sized Panoplosaurus and larger rhino-sized Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurs were good at retaining heat but struggled to shed it, putting them at risk of overheating even on cloudy days. The results \u201cclearly showed\u201d that nose length was key to their air-conditioning ability, with heat-transfer rates dropping more than 50 per cent when a shorter nose model was tested. This natural engineering feat \u201cmay have allowed the evolution of the great sizes of so many dinosaurs\u201d, they believe. The most elaborate noses were found in the larger dinosaur species, suggesting they may have evolved as a response to the \u201cphysiological stresses of large body size\u201d. -AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Story behind Paul Kelly's How to Make Gravy | The New Daily", "date": "2018-12-21", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/12/21/make-gravy-paul-kelly-christmas/", "transcript": "It\u2019s 22 years since Paul Kelly first narrated the story of a prisoner named Joe and his longing to be with family at Christmas time in his hit song How To Make Gravy. In the song Joe writes a letter to his family \u2013 penned on December 21 \u2013 that includes a recipe for how to make gravy for Christmas dinner. Fans of the tune have since coined December 21 as \u201cGravy Day\u201d. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen to the song after you write them,\u201d Kelly told ABC Radio. \u201cIt was a song that doesn\u2019t have a chorus, it\u2019s set in prison, so I never thought it would be a hit song or anything.\u201d In 1996, Kelly was invited to record a song for an annual charity Christmas album organised by fellow musician Lindsay Field. When Kelly discovered his chosen cover song had been performed on a previous year\u2019s compilation, Field encouraged him to write an original. With no shortage of existing Christmas songs, Kelly\u2019s challenge was to come up with something unique and distinctly his own. \u201cI started thinking \u2026 maybe I\u2019ll write it from the point of view of somebody who is missing Christmas, who can\u2019t get to Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they get there? Maybe they\u2019re overseas and they can\u2019t get home. Then I thought, oh, he\u2019s in prison. \u201cThe song wrote itself from there.\u201d Kelly said he had played the song quite a few times in correctional institutions, to mixed responses from the audiences. \u201cIt\u2019s funny playing in prisons because some of the audience like it and some of them couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a normal gig.\u201d More than two decades since\u00a0How to Make Gravy\u00a0was written, Kelly now includes\u00a0it in every live setlist.

But there are, on occasion, a few gaps that could possibly be filled by more nuanced words. How useful would it be to have a single word to describe waking up in the morning still drunk from the night before, for example?

With the festive season upon us, it might be handy to have a collection of succinct and descriptive foreign expressions in case you find a good reason to employ them. Here\u2019s our pick of some of the best: Packesel: From the German for \u201cburro\u201d, the Packesel is the person who ends up carrying everyone else\u2019s bags on a holiday. Gjensynsglede: Norwegian for the joy of meeting someone you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Iktsuarpok: An Inuit word meaning being so excited about seeing someone that you have to constantly go to the door or look out the window to see if they\u2019re coming. Gigil: Tagalog for a favourite move the elderly often pull on the young \u2013 the cheek pinch, arm or thigh squeeze, in reaction to adorable cuteness. Tartle: A Scottish word for that panicky hesitation when you\u2019re about to introduce someone whose name you suddenly can\u2019t remember. Gluggave\u00f0ur: An Icelandic word meaning \u201cwindow weather\u201d\u00a0\u2013 weather that is nice to see, but not to be in. It could apply just as equally to Australia\u2019s sweaty\u00a0Christmas as Iceland\u2019s frigid, white one. Struisvogelpolitiek: Translates from the Dutch as \u201costrich politics\u201d. The ever-so-polite Dutch employ this to pretend they didn\u2019t notice something (like a fart at the dinner table). The Germans and the Finns, on the other hand, suffer Fremdsch\u00e4men (German)or my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 (Finnish) \u2013\u00a0\u201cvicarious embarrassment\u201d.

It refers to the food a man uses to mollify his wife or girlfriend after he has annoyed her\u00a0(\u201cHere, my love, have another cherry liqueur chocolate\u201d). Sitzfleisch:\u00a0German for the ability to persevere through hard or boring tasks (literally \u201csit meat\u201d).\u00a0Such as a long Christmas lunch. Desenrascan\u00e7o:\u00a0A Portuguese word meaning to disentangle oneself from a troublesome situation. Backpfeifengesicht: German for a face ripe for a slap. Kummerspeck: Another German gem, it translates literally\u00a0as \u201cgrief bacon\u201d \u2013\u00a0the extra weight put on from emotional overeating. Tyvsmake: A Norwegian verb meaning to taste small pieces of the food when you think nobody is watching, usually while cooking. Shemomedjamo: A Georgian\u00a0word for the act of continuing to eat when you\u2019re full just because it just tastes so good. (See also \u201cgula\u201d, the Spanish version.) Lagom: From the ever-moderate Swedes, this translates roughly as \u201cjust enough\u201d, \u201ca fair share\u201d, or \u201ca sufficient amount\u201d. Sobremesa: Spanish for that delightful period when the food has finished and bellies are full but the conversation is still flowing. Borrell: Dutch for an informal party or casual drinks. Schnapsidee:\u00a0The word for an ingenious plan hatched by drunk Germans. Erkl\u00e4rungsnot:\u00a0German for the state of having to explain yourself quickly. Jayus: Indonesian for a story or joke so badly told you can\u2019t help but laugh. Like those found in a Christmas cracker.

In October, MAGNT put the call out for someone to professionally care for a colony of live spiders for its display. The job ad went mildly viral. Duties: day-to-day care of all live spiders, maintaining food and educating visitors. More than 50 spiders were flown to Darwin in the luggage compartment of a plane, unbeknown to passengers in the cabin above, while their environments were freighted by road. The invertebrate zookeeper needed to ensure those on display, and their understudies, were in good shape. \u201cNot all of them will be on display in the exhibition,\u201d Richard Wilan, the museum\u2019s senior curator of molluscs, explained in October. The role would also require meticulous attention to the spiders\u2019 health, right down to breeding the insects they would eat. \u201cSo all of the different spiders, and I think we\u2019ve got a total of around 60 spiders coming, will need care and attention\u00a0\u2013 even on Christmas Day,\u201d Dr Wilan said. Ms Henderson landed the job, and over the next few months she\u2019ll pay meticulous attention to the cluster\u2019s wellbeing. What their posture, movement and appearance says about their health she has down to a tee.

Katherine Connor Martin, the company\u2019s head of US dictionaries, said there had been a marked uptick of interest in the word on its website\u00a0in the past year. But the word was chosen less for statistical reasons, she said, than for the sheer variety of contexts in which it has proliferated, from conversations about environmental poisons to laments about today\u2019s poisonous political discourse to the #MeToo movement, with its calling out of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. In fact, Ms Martin said, the committee initially considered choosing \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d until it realised how widespread \u201ctoxic\u201d had become. Oxford\u2019s word of the year is chosen to reflect \u201cthe ethos, mood or preoccupations\u201d of a particular year, but also to highlight that English is always changing.

In 2016, it was \u201cpost-truth.\u201d \u201cToxic\u201d derives from the Greek \u201ctoxikon pharmakon,\u201d meaning \u201cpoison for arrows\u201d. The current entry in the online Oxford English Dictionary dates its earliest known printed occurrence to 1664. Other words on the shortlist highlight different ways words emerge or evolve. While \u201ctoxic\u201d is an old and common word that has expanded in usage, \u201cincel\u201d \u2013 short for \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d \u2013 is an example of jargon used by a limited group that suddenly enters widespread usage.

Weeks earlier, during the nine hours and 25 minutes he took to finish the iconic Ironman world championships in Kona, Hawaii, Leigh lost three toenails during the 42-kilometre run leg. The sandals are his best footwear option while he heals. \u201cThe nails came off about 12\u00a0kilometres into the run,\u201d says Leigh, 35, who finished in 330th place out of about 2500 entrants. \u201cI knew within the first three\u00a0kilometres I could put ice down my top, which meant wet shoes, or I could cook and keep my shoes dry. I made the decision early on to go for the ice option. \u201cI knew I was going to get a few blisters and whatever else.\u201d The French dinner is to celebrate the Melbourne engineer\u2019s achievement at one of the world\u2019s toughest endurance events \u2013 a four kilometre swim, 180 kilometre bike ride and a full marathon \u2013 in the Hawaiian heat. Bistro Thierry was his late wife Sara Chivers\u2019 favourite restaurant, and the dishes ordered by Leigh are a homage to her. When marketing executive Sara was in a Melbourne hospice last year \u2013 she died of brain cancer in January at age 34 \u2013 a French chef was hired to cook her favourite dishes in her sunlit room. \u201cWe still had happy moments,\u201d Leigh said. Sara also still had plenty to say. She wrote a letter to her boys that made global headlines, and one of her last requests was that her husband tackle the Kona event in her memory. On October 13, Leigh \u2013 whose youngest son Alfie, 2, also died of a rare brain tumour in June \u2013 toed the line. Given an honorary spot and named a race ambassador by Ironman in the US, Leigh and his Kona experience are shown in a new NBC documentary, which premiered in New York on Monday evening (US time). \u201cLeigh has every right to be proud of what he has achieved under remarkable pressure and extremely challenging circumstances,\u201d Noel McMahon, Ironman\u2019s Oceania media manager, told\u00a0The New Daily. \u201cHis time, finishing place and overall performance would be the envy of the vast majority of competitors. It was truly remarkable on so many levels.\u201d Leigh turned down an invitation to be at the documentary\u2019s premiere because of the fresh challenge he\u2019s set himself \u2013 to build a new normality with son Hugh, 4. \u201cI\u2019m sort of craving just rebuilding my every day a bit more,\u201d he told The New Daily. \u201cThe Hawaii experience was so amazing and perfect and is captured in the documentary. There\u2019s plenty for me to do at home. I don\u2019t feel the need to push for anything more. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say, just to be.\u201d Sara was a triathlon competitor herself, and \u201cKona was their dream as a family,\u201d her close friend Mia Greves, who helped bring Leigh\u2019s story to the attention of Ironman, told The New Daily. \u201cI\u2019m a little less heartbroken knowing I could do something to honour her and Alfie. In a different life, Sara, Hugh and Alfie would have all been cheering for Leigh as he crossed the finish line. \u201cAt least Hugh can look at this documentary when he\u2019s older knowing how his mum and her friends helped make this all happen.\u201d On a Thursday morning, Leigh is working from home after dropping Hugh at childcare. \u201cI\u2019ve done some tax, there\u2019s washing on the line, some I need to fold and some cleaning to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day-to-day things with Hugh are what I\u2019m concentrating on. \u201cWith the Sara and Alfie journey, I dealt with it trying to look to the next thing I had to do and could do. Now I don\u2019t mind the idea of spending a little bit of time not latching on to the next thing, just letting whatever comes next happen. \u201cThere\u2019s some time at the beach we didn\u2019t get to do. Hugh and I might do that this summer. I think feeling normal is what will make me happy.\u201d Still on a high from Kona, Leigh \u201cfelt glorious\u201d for most of the nearly 10-hour event: \u201cThere\u2019s been a couple of days in my life where I thought everything just went perfectly. One was my wedding day, and the other was that race.\u201d Leigh admitted\u00a0there were \u201cdefinitely\u201d super challenging moments. \u201cI felt so much gratitude. I just kept telling myself how lucky I was to be out there, with Sara and Alfie in mind that they couldn\u2019t be.\u201d While competing is \u201cwhere you can be fully and wholly yourself\u201d, his late wife and son were on his mind during the race. \u201cI think I had some thoughts in the swim where it went really smoothly and I felt I had a protective ring around me, but that seemed ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThen in the ride I had a feeling of satisfaction they were watching from somewhere but the flip side is I also got quite sad I couldn\u2019t share it with them. Especially Sara. I feel she would have got a big kick out of it.\u201d About five\u00a0kilometres into the run, Simon Johnson, a four-time Kona finisher and Chivers\u2019 friend of 15 years through running and triathlon clubs, was passed by Leigh. \u201cHe ran by looking a million bucks,\u201d Johnson told The New Daily. \u201cSometimes when you have people go past you, you know you\u2019ll see them later, it\u2019s such a long day. But I knew I wasn\u2019t going to see Leigh again. \u201cHe was motivated by more than a normal person can get motivated by. He is incredibly strong willed, a truly impressive athlete with a great engine on him.\u201d Near the finish, Leigh put on a gold \u2018Alfie\u2019 superhero cape and Hugh was passed over a barrier for a quick kiss. Then Leigh pumped a fist and looked to the sky. \u201cThat was just sending Alfie and Sara a signal, blowing them a kiss. It felt pretty natural, and just seemed like the right place to look,\u201d he said. \u201cI was probably smiling and laughing and thinking, \u2018I am in a world of pain right now and this is the greatest thing ever\u2019. \u201cIt blows my mind to think of the happiness and sadness you can have in a single moment.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Elon Musk's Tesla-driving Starman just rocketed past mars", "date": "2018-11-6", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/11/06/elon-musk-tesla-starman-mars/", "transcript": "Elon Musk\u2019s space-bound Tesla Roaster\u00a0with its dummy \u201cStarman\u201d at the wheel has just cruised past Mars.

But when Ear Spring geyser in Yellowstone National Park in northern United States erupted, it fired rocks, water and trash metres into the air. \u201cOn September 15, 2018, Ear Spring erupted and ejected lots of decades-old trash,\u201d Yellowstone said on its Facebook page. In a live video on Facebook, park staff detailed the trash they had found from the eruption, which included a cinderblock, cigarette butts, a 1930s baby pacifier, a grizzly bear warning sign, and nearly 100 coins. Some of the items \u2014 which somehow survived inside the boiling-hot spring \u2014 were historic and may end up in Yellowstone\u2019s archives. \u201cStuff like this that can tell us a story, and the history of how people were unfortunately using the spring while they were visiting it, will definitely be added to the collections,\u201d Yellowstone museum curator Colleen Curry said. Despite the detritus-laden time capsule giving park authorities a glimpse of artefacts from decades ago, they were adamant that visitors not throw their refuse into the springs. \u201cWhen the vent becomes completely plugged, as it has in several springs in the park, then the spring can actually plug up to the point where it\u2019s not a hot spring anymore and it\u2019ll go dormant or it\u2019ll die,\u201d park ranger Rebecca Roland said. Yellowstone spokeswoman Linda Veress said the combination of increased tourism and tourists continuing to throw garbage into the geysers has affected springs like Handkerchief Pool. \u201c[Handkerchief Pool] stopped functioning some time in the 1920s or \u201930s. It stopped because people threw coins, broken bottles, rocks, hairpins, and a small horseshoe into it about 100 years ago,\u201d she said. Other springs like the Morning Glory pool have over time transformed from a deep blue colour to yellow and green due to the chemical composition in the spring changing thanks to garbage clogging it up. Ear Spring erupts very rarely, and is a more docile neighbour of the famous Old Faithful geyser. The US Geological Survey says Ear Spring has only erupted four times in the last 60 years, with the last significant burst of activity coming in 1957. \u201cThe next time Ear Spring erupts we hope it\u2019s nothing but natural rocks and water,\u201d Yellowstone National Park wrote on Facebook. \u201cYou can help by never throwing anything into Yellowstone\u2019s thermal features.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "The New Daily 'extremely proud' of record growth | The New Daily", "date": "2018-11-2", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/11/02/new-daily-record-growth/", "transcript": "Only days away from its fifth birthday, Australian-owned digital news website\u00a0The New Daily has continued to clock record growth in 2018.

But it was that nerdiness which led him to make history. On Thursday, in between\u00a0 studying and his favourite video gaming, Connor witnessed the major impact of his actions. That moment came when the new $50 note entered circulation \u2013 one Connor and 360,000 visually impaired Australians like him can read properly. It\u2019s the first $50 to include tactile markings which enable blind people, like Connor, to differentiate it from other notes. And it happened as a result of a major, relentless campaign he ran with the help of his mum when he was 12. \u201cIt started in Christmas 2012, when I received some Christmas money and couldn\u2019t tell how generous, or for that matter how cheap, my folks had been!\u201d\u00a0Connor said\u00a0when he discovered his campaign had been successful. When Connor discovered the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) already printed tactile markings on banknotes for other countries, but not for Australia, he was \u2018flabbergasted\u2019. \u201cI remember saying, \u2018What? Oh no you don\u2019t!\u201d The RBA said they needed convincing of the need for Australian tactile markings. Our notes are different sizes, but Connor argued he needed an easier way to ensure he wouldn\u2019t be \u201cripped off\u201d when given change and not having other notes to compare it with. He and his mum started a\u00a0Change.org\u00a0petition\u00a0targeting the RBA, amassing 57,000 signatures. \u201cThat kind of proved the need,\u201d he says. Using all the signatures on his petition as leverage, they targeted MPs for a meeting, leading to a Canberra trip where Connor and his mum met cabinet ministers. \u201cHe spoke surprisingly eloquently,\u201d Ally says. In addition to pressuring MPs and the RBA with the petition, they put in a complaint to the Human Rights Commission. They declared\u00a0victory\u00a0on their petition in February 2015 \u2013 but the impact continues year after year, as each new banknote is released. The $5 note has one \u2018bump,\u2019 the $10 has two and the new $50 has four. Next year\u2019s new $20 note will have three bumps. Connor\u2019s mum, Ally Lancaster, said Thursday was special. \u201cEach time a new banknote gets released, I just feel very proud of my boy,\u201d she tells\u00a0The New Daily.\u00a0\u201cHe saw something that wasn\u2019t right, wanted to fix it and saw it through.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that,\u201d Connor says. \u201cMy head will get so big, I\u2019ll get stuck in my bedroom!\u201d Humour has kept the family going through darker times. Ally remembers when Connor\u2019s blindness was first diagnosed. \u201cIt was absolutely devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cI cried a lot. They initially thought it was a brain tumour. It was so scary. Someone was going to cut into my baby\u2019s head. \u201cBut then they discovered it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Ally continues. \u201cAnd I kicked myself up the backside saying \u2018he doesn\u2019t have cancer, it\u2019s just his eyes aren\u2019t working\u2019.\u201d Connor says: \u201cThe first blind joke was made four hours after diagnosis \u2026\u00a0 tell it Mum.\u201d \u201cI was very, very upset\u201d Ally remembers. \u201cI was sat in this room with my mum feeling really frightened, thinking, \u2018how am I going to raise him?\u2019 But then I turned to mum and said, \u2018Oh well, it\u2019ll save me on Christmas wrapping!\u2019. \u201cAs I grew into my role of a parent of a vision-impaired child, I realised how capable he is. His limitations are those that others put on him because they don\u2019t know better.\u201d The banknotes campaign wasn\u2019t the first time Connor has righted a wrong. In year 5, he qualified to represent his school at cross country, but they said he couldn\u2019t. \u201cHe came home very upset and said he was only blind, his legs weren\u2019t painted on,\u201d Ally says. \u201cInitially the Education Department stood by the school, but we told his story on social media and to journalists, and now, thanks to Connor, vision-impaired people can represent their schools at cross country with guided runners.\u201d Life today is busy for Connor. He has a girlfriend in WA he met at Braille Music Camp, which he has attended yearly since 2015. He loves medieval themed audio books. Now he\u2019s\u00a0sizing\u00a0up universities with a plan to study coding and app development. \u201cBut I need to find a university that\u2019s good at audio, rather than just visual learning, and that\u2019s proving a challenge.\u201d Like every other challenge, it\u2019s something his mum knows he\u2019ll meet. \u201cWith new technology, I know there\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t do if he doesn\u2019t put his mind to it,\u201d Ally says. Connor agrees. The role reversal in care has already started. \u201cI\u2019m still fixing all your text problems for you, Mum!\u201d he says.

The video has now been viewed more than 250 million times and has been featured in multiple countries and social media pages. But this time the resilient learner has got back behind the wheel for another lesson, this time with Defence Minister Christopher Pyne.  Mr Davidson said Mr Pyne agreed to do the driving video \u2014 posted on YouTube this evening \u2014 in an attempt to \u201cfix his driving skills\u201d. He said that Mr Pyne seemed to enjoy the lesson, despite the obvious stress.

While most geckos have dark eyes, the silver-eyed velvet gecko is distinguished by its shiny eye colour and a pattern on its back and slender tail. Dr Conrad Hoskin from James Cook University said the \u201csignificant discovery\u201d was made in the sandstone gorges at the Gregory Range, a few hours west of Townsville. \u201cThe discovery of any new vertebrate species in Australia in this day and age is really significant because Australia is pretty well surveyed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo finding a new, spectacular gecko is really significant,\u201d he said.

It is pretty and big,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say it is about twice the size of the Asian house geckos you would find in your house which is quite slender, whereas these ones are much chunkier.\u201d Asian house geckos are one of the most successful invasive species in Australia, and biologists have recently\u00a0raised concerns they\u2019re spreading from suburbia into bushland. The new gecko is the first reptile known to be local to the Gregory Range, which Dr Hoskin said is relatively unknown. He said it has probably been sighted before but has been assumed to be one of the others similar species. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people would come into contact with them day to day,\u201d he said. Dr Hoskin said the gecko didn\u2019t face many threats, but more surveys were needed to learn more about it. \u201cThey eat anything they can fit in their mouth. Lots of insects, spiders, and some baby geckos,\u201d he said.

WA Police said a 22-year-old man would be summonsed for the offence of stealing and a 23-year-old woman would be summonsed for receiving. Zoo staff noticed the baby meerkat was missing from its enclosure on Wednesday afternoon, less than 24 hours before an event to introduce the animal to the public. Staff were unsure whether the meerkat had been stolen or taken by a predatory bird. WA Police have confirmed it was stolen and said it was found in Beverley, a small town about 130 kilometres south-east of Perth. \u201cAs a result of inquiries by Kensington Police, a search warrant was executed at a house in Beverley around 6pm [last night],\u201d a police spokesman said. \u201cThe baby meerkat was located at the house and was conveyed back to the zoo by a veterinarian. The zoo said the meerkit was back in expert care and staff were busy preparing to reintroduce it back successfully with its family. Senior vet Simone Vitali said the animal would be returned to its mother soon. \u201cHe was very stressed and tired and hungry, just like any bub that\u2019s been away from mum,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after an evening of getting his favourite foods and getting a bit of warmth and a bit of quiet, he\u2019s really bounced back quite well, so we\u2019re quite happy with his progress so far. \u201cHe\u2019s still not out of the woods, we\u2019ve still got to get him back with the group and hope that they accept him as one of theirs and they haven\u2019t decided to reject him, so we\u2019re still in very early days.\u201d Ms Vitali said the safety of the meerkat enclosure may need to be reviewed following the incident. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got these open facilities, which you need [in order] to give the animals good welfare, you like to have them open and have lots of sunlight, lots of air, lots of height,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you have animals in those sorts of facilities there\u2019s always the risk of theft, there\u2019s always the risk of predatory birds. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to need to review quite carefully now that this has happened to see if we need to make changes.\u201d Speaking on Thursday after the meerkat was taken, the zoo\u2019s curator of operations, John Lemon, said the newborn was under almost-constant watch.

Ironically, the answer to the mystery of the Endeavour\u2019s final resting place could be the same location as Australia\u2019s greatest sailing victory. It was found in Newport, Rhode Island where the John Bertrand-skippered Australia II won the America\u2019s Cup in 1983. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work ahead, but it is an exciting day,\u201d Australian National Maritime Museum director Kevin Sumption told AAP on Saturday (Friday local time). A 25-year-long archaeological study of transport ships deliberately sunk by the British in Newport Harbour during the American War of Independence in 1778 led to a wreck that fits the dimensions of the Endeavour. The results of the study were announced at a press conference held by Dr Kathy Abbass, founder of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project. The Endeavour, through its lifetime, was used for different purposes. After Captain Cook took it on his historic voyage to Australia and the South Pacific from 1768 to 1771 it was re-fitted into a transportation vessel. It was renamed the Lord Sandwich II and in 1775 was used to take German mercenaries to Newport and New York before its final refit into a prison ship. It is believed the British sunk the Lord Sandwich II and 12 other British ships in Newport Harbour as a tactic to block the French, who were allies of rebelling American colonists, from entering in 1778. Divers on Thursday carefully took four samples from the potential Endeavour. Three will be delivered to separate laboratories around the world, with one location possibly Australia, to confirm if it is timber grown in the north of England in the early part of the 18th century. That would match the timber used for the Endeavour. The fourth sample will be stored and archived. Archaeologists believe it is likely the Endeavour because the shipwreck matches the size of the 360 tonne vessel Captain Cook sailed. A final piece in the puzzle will be if evidence is found the wreck was formerly a prison ship. \u201cWhat will ultimately determine which of the ships is Endeavour is if we are lucky enough to do an excavation that finds evidence that it was used as a prison hulk,\u201d Mr Sumption said. \u201cThat will be the definitive evidence really.\u201d Despite the historical significance of the Endeavour to Australia and New Zealand, if it is determined it is Captain Cook\u2019s former ship it will remain in Rhode Island at the bottom of the harbour. \u201cThe legal ownership of the vessel is incontestable,\u201d Mr Sumption said. \u201cIt is Kathy\u2019s and RIMAP\u2019s under Rhode Island salvage law. \u201cWhat we hope to continue to do with Kathy is with her permission, and the Rhode Island authorities, is look for a loan of a small amount of material at some point when there is a positive identification and we can help with preservation. \u201cUltimately that will be something that is over a year or possibly a couple of years away.\u201d -AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Greek lakefront covered in 300-metre-long web | The New Daily", "date": "2018-9-20", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/09/20/spider-web-greece/", "transcript": "Spiders enjoying warmer weather and boom in their favourite food have created an eerie 300-metre-long web along\u00a0the shore of a lagoon in western Greece.

Workers at the Beta Hunt mine near the small town of Kambalda, 630 kilometres east of Perth, have brought more than $15 million worth of gold specimens to the surface in just four days. The gold-encrusted rocks were found about 500 metres below the surface in an area just three metres wide and three metres high. The largest specimen weighs in at 90 kilograms and took three men to lift it onto the back of a ute. The quartz rock is covered in an estimated 2300 ounces of gold, worth about $3.8 million at today\u2019s gold price. Another 60-kilogram specimen is estimated to contain 1600 ounces, or about $2.6 million in gold. Senior geologist Zaf Thanos said in most mines around the world it is only possible to see gold through a magnifying glass. \u201cYou might go your whole life and you\u2019ll never see anything like it. It\u2019s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime discovery,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a geologist\u00a0\u2026 you get excited by a pinhead speck. But to see something on this scale is just phenomenal. \u201cThis sort of bonanza zone is incredibly unique.\u201d The rich cluster of high-grade gold has so far produced more than 9000 ounces. Kambalda miner Henry Dole is credited with the discovery, describing it as hitting the \u201cmother lode\u201d. Mr Dole had drilled holes into the wall of the mine and planted explosives\u00a0that were fired once he was safely on the surface. When he came back to the same area for his next shift, Mr Dole thought it was business as usual. \u201cEverything was covered in dust, and as I watered the dirt down there was just gold everywhere, as far as you could see,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been an airleg miner for 16 years. Never in my life have I ever seen anything like this. \u201cThere was chunks of gold in the face, on the ground, truly unique I reckon. \u201cI nearly fell over looking at it \u2026 we were picking it up for hours.\u201d A handful of gold rocks could be worth several thousand dollars, so security has been beefed up in the days since the find. Armed guards have been transporting the gold to a secure vault. Workers are under constant video surveillance and the area of the mine where the gold was found has been fenced off and padlocked. The irony is that Beta Hunt has been mined for nickel, which is a key ingredient in stainless steel, since the 1970s. Gold has always played second fiddle. There are stories among the workforce dating back to the early days of the mine\u00a0that suggest similar bonanza finds\u00a0might have been made in the past but were not considered significant at the time because of low gold prices. There are also tales that workers in those days would bury bags of gold rocks in the event the commodity came back stronger. The mine\u2019s Canadian owner, RNC Minerals,\u00a0is planning an auction for the large specimens. RNC president Mark Selby said collectors in north America and around the world are known to pay up to a 50 per cent premium on the gold metal value for rare specimens. \u201cGiven the rarity of the rock, and the physical beauty and presentation of the gold that\u2019s there, it\u2019s a very spectacular stone in multiple ways so we\u2019ll see whether 20, 30 or even 50 per cent premiums apply here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to auctioning the key stones off over the coming weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty select group of collectors who this would appeal to. \u201cWhen you look at nuggets, which are a solid piece of gold, the biggest are around 2000 ounces, so this is right up there in terms of the largest specimens we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d An interesting sub-plot to the discovery is the fact Beta Hunt\u2019s future had been in doubt. The Toronto company was battling to keep it open and had put Beta Hunt on the market several months ago. The sale process is in the final stages, but Mr Selby said the \u201cworld-class discovery\u201d\u00a0did not make RNC think twice about the sale. \u201cWhen we started the sale process it wasn\u2019t because we don\u2019t like the asset. We always believed that it had the potential to become a multi-hundred-thousand ounce mine, we just weren\u2019t able to raise capital required to do the exploration drilling,\u201d Mr Selby said. \u201cWe believe that a different set of management should be running the asset with the right amount of capital to take it forward.\u201d The question now is whether there is more bonanza gold waiting to be found at Beta Hunt. In the eyes of Mr Dole, there is no doubt. He hopes it is just the beginning of a revival for the Kambalda community, which has been hit by multiple mine closures in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we were looking down the barrel for a while, but with this, it\u2019s picked everyone\u2019s morale up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the town, the mine life, all of that. \u201cI truly believe there\u2019s something bigger and better down there. \u201cI reckon we\u2019re just on the fringe of it \u2026 and if we get deeper I reckon we\u2019ll find more.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Peter Dutton's maid-to-order immigration policies", "date": "2018-8-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/08/31/ferguson-dutton-dustup-visa-row/", "transcript": "DUTTON GROWS AU PAIR Fatherland Minister Peter Dutton-To-Do-With-Me has denied that granting two visas for his mates\u2019 au pairs is a conflict of interest. \u201cHe\u2019s neither conflicted nor interested,\u201d said a spokes-cop in a maid\u2019s outfit. \u201cPeter couldn\u2019t just do it for one.

This time, it\u2019s her unusual dance style. Mrs May\u2019s moves in the final days of her tour of Africa have led to calls for her to compete on TV dance shows and seen media outlets publish instructions on how to do what has been dubbed the \u2018Maybot\u2019 and the \u2018Cabinet Shuffle.\u2019 British online newspaper Metro called it a \u201cphenomenon that\u2019s sweeping the nation\u201d. The May dance craze gained fresh impetus on Thursday, when Mrs May nearly made it out of the UN campus in Nairobi, Kenya, without being called on to use any dance floor diplomacy. But a group of scouts, feeling the jaunty music that was playing, roped in Mrs May to join them in throwing some shapes. According to reports, the prime minister realised there was no way out and got her groove on. Mrs May \u2013 whose claim she\u2019ll never be asked to appear on a TV dance competition may be premature \u2013 was nothing if not enthusiastic. Combining arm and leg swings with a maniacal expression, she moved to her own internal rhythm. Her attempts culminated \u201cin a cross between a standing-up front crawl and a desperate attempt to hail a cab\u201d, according to the UK Guardian.

Two days earlier, she had gamely performed a medley of moves including a side-to-side sway at a South African school. It was pointed out that to be obliged as PM to execute dance moves once during a foreign trip could be seen as unfortunate. \u201cTo go through it twice could be seen as the hosts having a laugh at your expense,\u201d said the Guardian.

Salome Sechele, a judge on South Africa\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing TV show, said she was \u201con time with the beat, making for great synchronization.\u201d According to Metro, dancing like Mrs May is deceptively hard and a \u201ctough one to master for anyone with any sort of natural rhythm.\u201d It published a step-by-step guide to copying her moves, with steps including \u201cStart walking forward in a slow, mechanical fashion out of time to the music and with arms still positioned like the large dinosaur.\u201d Next, while keeping both feet planted and swinging arms in a jerky motion \u201cas if trying to prove to your parents you are sober\u201d, add \u201ca creepy smile\u201d while gazing into the middle distance.

Truth is, in Australia, our generation is one of the luckiest to be alive. Take travel, for example. Travel has never been cheaper, easier or safer than it is now. My mother took two international trips in her entire life.\u00a0I have taken many more than that. When I first started travelling in 1992 a return fare from Australia to Europe was $1800. It was a bloody good fare too as a hard-working travel agent pulled every string she could. In today\u2019s money that would be $3356.19. I was searching on Kayak the other day for a potential trip to Australia from London in September (to watch the mighty Magpies at the MCG), with the cheapest return economy fare being \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u00a3315 with China Southern, or $559.62. Today\u2019s discount economy fares are 16 per cent of the 1992 fares. What is more, I can get a return business class, fully flat bed on a 787 Dreamliner for just on \u00a31900 or $3376, flying Vietnam Airlines. In other words, today\u2019s business class fare is more or less what the economy used to be. But of course, I am at the privileged end of world wealth. What about the less privileged end? I worked for the Red Cross in the 1990s in places like Rwanda and Yugoslavia. The countries in war then that are in peace now include Rwanda, Mozambique, a big chunk of west Africa and many countries in Asia. Despite what we read about Syria and terrorism, death counts in conflict have been steadily in decline since the end of World War II,\u00a0with Our World in Data showing death rates in conflict falling from over 100 per 100,000 in the mid-1900s to around 10 per 100,000 now. On the wealth front, while inequality exists and wealth disparity is growing in many places of the world, it is not a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Rather it is the rich getting richer\u00a0and the poor getting richer. It is just that the rich are getting richer faster. Global literacy rates are rising. Those living in absolute poverty (less than $2 per day) is falling, and the numbers entering the middle class is measured in the millions each year. Which brings me back to travel. Many people are now complaining that typical tourist attractions are now overcrowded. Cities like Barcelona are cracking down on Airbnb and short-term lettings. Venice is considering limiting the maximum number of tourists allowed each day. Those with a racial eye note that many of the extra tourists look Asian. And there is a reason for this. When I was a kid we wanted to \u2018bring the world out of poverty\u2019. Guess what? We really are succeeding \u2013 despite the charity TV ads desperately asking for money. Yes there are more Asian tourists because more Asian economies like China, Vietnam, India and others are pulling millions of people out of poverty. And airlines like China Southern and Vietnam Airlines don\u2019t give just you and I cheaper fares, they give them to everyone. While our media calls out the negative, we are being blinded to the positive. Sure, the world is not perfect. Poverty and conflict remain, but both are at the lowest level ever. Further, far from capitalism being the enemy, well-regulated capitalism has given humanity the greatest boost in wealth, life expectancy, health and education we have ever seen. Shouldn\u2019t we celebrate the positive, just as much as we bemoan the negative in the world today? For many people, for the majority, life is actually pretty good, and better than it has ever been. Let\u2019s now make it better for the rest, too.

A dream to be fulfilled.\u201d So it was that five months after Sara died of brain cancer in January \u2013 and just six days after Alfie, 2, passed away in June of the same cruel disease that took his mother \u2013 Leigh toed the start line for the Cairns triathlon. His goal? To qualify, with minimal training, for the iconic Ironman world championship in Kailua Kona, Hawaii, and fulfil his promise to Sara. Cairns was his last shot at it for 2018. And after getting through the swim and bike legs, Leigh, 35, pulled out during the marathon. \u201cI resigned myself to having to qualify next year,\u201d he said. But after The New Daily\u00a0brought Leigh\u2019s story to the attention of Dan Berglund, director of communications for Ironman in Tampa, Florida, the organisation made Sara\u2019s wish a reality. On August 14, Ironman named Leigh \u2013 who qualified for Kona in 2014 but had to forgo it when Hugh, now 4, was sick \u2013 and Queensland\u2019s Elle Goodall as competitors and race ambassadors for 2018. Only one such honorary slot is given each year \u2013 Turia Pitt won one in 2016 \u2013 but an exception was made for the two Australians. \u201cHe is so incredibly deserving and I am just so glad we can make this happen,\u201d Mr Berglund told\u00a0The New Daily. For the uninitiated, the 36-year-old Kona event is the Olympics of the Ironman world. Most triathletes aim for it and only around 2000 get a shot every year. There\u2019s a hairy 3.8-kilometre open water swim, a 180-kilometre ride where winds shear off a volcanic cliff face to smash cyclists, and a 42.2-kilometre run in the Hawaiian heat. Leigh and Ms Goodall, who transformed her life by losing 120kg, were chosen \u201cthanks to characteristics that go well beyond competition,\u201d said Noel McMahon, Ironman\u2019s Oceania media manager. \u201cThey inspire others to do something they thought might not be possible and exemplify our mantra, \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m literally blown away and honoured. Life is so strange,\u201d the engineer told\u00a0The New Daily\u00a0after being surprised at work with news of his ambassador role. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how Sara in a way has been able to orchestrate this. I just feel it\u2019s her gift to me. \u201cSaying, \u2018Leigh you need to go after this\u2019 was because she understood me. She understood I would need to have something to look forward to. She understood that would help me through the hard times. \u201cShe was pretty clever.\u201d Leigh, who hopes to finish the gruelling event in under 10 hours, will have Hugh as head cheerleader in Hawaii. \u201cThis will be the most special of memories for Hugh and I. And I look forward to seeing Sara and Alfie out on the course too. They will be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get it done. Even if I have to walk, I\u2019ll finish.\u201d Squashing around 18 months of preparation for Kona into eight weeks, the former competitive rower finished Sydney\u2019s 14.2-kilometre City2 Surf run on August 12 in 50 minutes and seven seconds. He placed 108 out of 67,242 runners. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a terrible run, so I\u2019ll probably focus on my swimming now,\u201d said Leigh, who also plans to do training rides and runs in a jacket to prepare for the Hawaiian heat. Doing triathlons together was Sara and Leigh\u2019s thing. \u201cI think we loved having coffee and breakfast together afterwards,\u201d Leigh said. One year, he finished the Noosa event and ran back to find Sara then did the last two kilometres again by her side.

The whale, known as J35, carried the baby on her head for at least 17 days, in an image of grief that struck an emotional chord worldwide. The Centre for Whale Research in Washington state\u00a0said\u00a0Monday that J35\u00a0had been\u00a0spotted chasing a school of salmon in Haro Strait west of San Juan Island on Saturday. The killer whale\u00a0population in the Pacific North-West has\u00a0been struggling because of a lack of salmon, and J35\u2019s calf died soon after birth on July 24. \u201cThe baby\u2019s carcass was sinking and being repeatedly retrieved by the mother, who was supporting it on her forehead and pushing it in choppy seas,\u201d the CWR said in a statement at the time.

J35, a 20-year-old whale who is also known as Tahlequah, is an important member of the critically endangered southern resident orca population. Her relative youth means she could have years of reproductive ability ahead of her. CWR said the death of J35\u2019s\u00a0calf underlined the dire state of the southern resident community, which faces extinction after failing to raise a viable calf in the past three years. In the past two decades, 75 per cent of newborn calves have died, according to the CWR. It attributes the low reproduction rate to declining numbers of Chinook salmon, the staple diet of the killer whales. -with AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "MPs inundated with requests for Queen's portrait | The New Daily", "date": "2018-8-10", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/08/10/portraits-queen/", "transcript": "The Australian republican movement has had a real shot in the arm in recent days, and from a mostly unlikely quarter \u2013 the monarch herself.

Well, that came true \u2013 and then some. Professor Venkatesh, who graduated from the University of Western Australia aged 16 with honours in pure mathematics, has achieved his subject\u2019s highest honour. He has been awarded the Fields Medal, known as the \u201cNobel Prize for mathematics\u201d \u2013 awarded once every four years to between two and four people under the age of 40. It is an amazing achievement for the 36-year-old, who was described as a \u201cprodigy\u201d and a \u201cgenius\u201d during his teenage years in Perth. But for his mum, who is immensely proud of him, she just wants him to be happy. \u201cThat is all I hope for him, that he is happy and he loves what he does,\u201d said Svetha Venkatesh, who is herself a professor of computer science at Deakin University, and a leader in the field of machine learning. Professor Venkatesh, who teaches at Stanford University in the US, is being honoured for work that combines insights from several different fields of mathematics. His former classmate, and now professor of mathematics at the University of WA, Michael Giudici said explaining his work to the general public was hard. One of Professor Venkatesh\u2019s most famous pieces of work is solving what\u2019s called the \u201csubconvexity problem\u201d. To do that, he developed new techniques and borrowed from other areas of mathematics, Professor Giudici said. He recalled that despite Professor Venkatesh being so much younger than the rest of the group at university, he was incredibly well adjusted. \u201cI know in our fourth year, he was probably one of the main characters in the group \u2013 always discussing things other than mathematics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time as honours students talking about cricket.\u201d His mum said that was something she was keen to foster. \u201cHe was a normal, happy child growing up in a normal family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never did anything particularly special because he was good at maths. It was just one of those things.\u201d When he started university at the age of 13, one of his mentors was Professor Cheryl Praeger, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. \u201cAt our first meeting I was speaking with Akshay\u2019s mother Svetha while Akshay was sitting at a table in my office reading my blackboard, which contained fragments from a supervision of one of my PhD students, just completed,\u201d Professor Praeger recalled. \u201cAt Akshay\u2019s request I explained what the problem was. He coped with quite a lot of detail and I found that he could easily grasp the essence of the research. \u201cIt was clear from the start that Akshay was amazingly talented. He was interested and immediately engaged with all kinds of mathematical questions. \u201cI was sure that he would achieve a great deal mathematically, and I\u2019m thrilled at his stunning success in being awarded a Fields Medal.\u201d Professor Venkatesh is just the second Australian to receive the Fields Medal. Dr Terence Tao won the award in 2006. Comedian and mathematics communicator Adam Spencer said it was a \u201cgreat day for Australian mathematics\u201d and the crown in a string of recent achievements from Australian mathematicians. \u201cAustralian mathematics is on a real roll here,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cFirst mathematician Geordie Williamson from the University of Sydney was admitted to the Royal Society, making him the youngest member. \u201cThen Nalini Joshi, also from the University of Sydney was named vice-president of the International Mathematical Union. In 2016, when Professor Venkatesh was awarded another prestigious prize, he said doing mathematics gave him a feeling of \u201ctranscendence\u201d. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve been part of something really meaningful,\u201d he said at the time. Now a husband and father of two, he said children were a great way to force him to stop obsessing about mathematical problems.

Wallace, whose sire was a donkey and dam was a horse, comes from a humble background. He was found wandering the streets in Ireland, living off scraps and flowers from village gardens (much to the chagrin of residents), and rescued by a British donkey sanctuary. But 11-year-old Wallace\u2019s life changed dramatically after\u00a0he\u00a0met Christie Mclean, from Stroud in Gloucestershire. Ms Mclean competes in entry-level dressage \u2013 and\u00a0had her own problems when all of her horses went lame. This was Wallace\u2019s time to shine \u2013 and he and Ms Mclean paired up to learn the delicate movements of dressage. But when they wanted to enter a British Dressage-affiliated competition last weekend, the pair was denied their chance \u2013 because Wallace is not a horse. It was a huge blow,\u00a0especially as Wallace and Ms Mclean\u00a0had already done well in local competitions. \u201cWhen British Dressage said the rule book only refers to horses and ponies within its affiliated criteria, I was really surprised and disappointed,\u201d Ms Mclean told the BBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a case of equine racism but more a case of the rule book being very out of date.\u201d News of the discrimination spread across Britain, sparking a public outcry and calls of justice for Wallace the mule. \u201cIt\u2019s got 4 legs, a mane, a seat, why not? Discrimination in the highest order,\u201d wrote one supporter on Twitter. \u201cWallace the mule needs justice!!! Mules matter,\u201d wrote another. Under pressure, British Dressage\u00a0buckled, changing the rules to\u00a0allow Wallace \u2013 and \u201call other animals born to a mare\u201d \u2013 to fulfil their destinies. \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Wallace and his fellow mules to compete with British Dressage, as part of our commitment to inclusion and diversity in dressage, making the sport more accessible to all,\u201d British Dressage chief executive Jason Brautigam said.  But more momentous news was to come. Not only did Wallace change the course of history for his kind, he went on to win last weekend\u2019s competition. \u201cHe did everything I asked of him \u2026 he rode beautifully,\u201d Ms Mclean wrote on Wallace\u2019s Facebook page (where he has more than 6000 followers). \u201cI cannot thank everyone enough for the huge amounts of support for Wallace, knowing that he has a chance in life makes it even more heart-warming.\u201d She said history had been made, for mules and for British Dressage, and \u201cwow, was it a good one\u201d. \u201cI [Christie] fully admit that the pressure was firmly there; we\u2019d come this far and, although I trust Wallace 100\u00a0per cent, would I remember to breathe?,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those big ears flop to the side and he\u2019s in work mode \u2013 legend.\u201d Wallace the Great\u2019s future plans are unknown at this stage.

Paleontologist Xing Xu and a team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found a cluster of fossils belonging to the\u00a0Diplodocoids according to a new study published in Nature Communications. The Diplodocoids include famous long-neck species like Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. The fossils, dating from about 174 million years ago, were found\u00a0in the Ningxia region in northwest China. The new find is 15 million years older than the earliest members of this family known until now. Scientists say it changes the historical documentation of how\u00a0sauropod dinosaurs evolved everywhere. The early Diplodocoid has been named \u201cLingwulong shenqi\u201d, meaning \u201camazing dragon of Lingwu\u201d after the town near where it was found. \u201cPreviously we thought that advanced sauropods arrived in the late Jurassic and quickly became dominant on this planet, but this suggests that these dinosaurs evolved earlier and spread slower,\u201d saiMr Xu said. In 2005, four excavations began at dinosaur sites in Ciyaopu, Lingwu and Ningxia Hui where fossil fragments of up to 10 partial skeletons (including portions of two skulls) ranging from juveniles to adult were discovered. The new sauropod was based on the examination of these fossils, as Nature reported: \u201cWe name a new sauropod based on this material, and demonstrate that it is, to our knowledge, the earliest diplodocoid (and therefore also the earliest neosauropod) sauropod, and the first from East Asia\u201d. \u201cThis discovery has major implications for calibrating the timing of neosauropod diversification,\u201d Nature reported, and provides the \u201cfirst insight into a previously hidden aspect of their evolutionary history\u201d. The Diplodocoids were previously thought to have evolved after the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, but the discovery of these fossils has forced a rethink. These long-neck sauropods, who could stretch up to 36 metres from head to tail, were the largest animals to ever walk on land and dominated the planet\u2019s \u201cland ecosystems\u201d for most of the dinosaur age. According to National Geographic, the \u201camazing dragon\u201d is \u201cthe first dinosaur of its kind ever found in Asia\u201d. Scientists concluded an inland sea had cut off eastern Asia and this so-called \u201cmega-moat\u201d prevented the diplodocoids from reaching this region. \u201cThe discovery of our new animal \u2026 means that this isolation hypothesis has been somewhat watered down, or even placed in serious doubt,\u201d according to University College London paleontologist Paul Upchurch. \u201cWe propose that many of the groups that were supposedly absent in China might well have been present, but we simply do not see them there yet because of poor sampling in the fossil record rather than genuine absence,\u201d he told National Geographic."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Bus caught in tide while trying to rescue beached plane", "date": "2018-7-26", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/07/26/bus-plane-fraser-island-tide/", "transcript": "A good Samaritan bus driver\u00a0found himself in a sticky situation after trying to come to the rescue of a bogged plane on Fraser Island.

When the tiny bird \u2014 weighing only as much as a 10 cent piece \u2014 could no longer be found in SA, there were still numbers that existed in parts of Victoria\u2019s north-west, but they were listed as endangered. In one of the three national parks where they remained, Victoria\u2019s Wyperfeld National Park, their numbers were only in the hundreds. Researchers were concerned a severe bushfire season would threaten the remaining population. Numerous organisations in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, together with the support of the South Australian government, devised a breeding program over four years to boost the birds\u2019 numbers. In April this year, 40 birds, known by bird enthusiasts as the \u2018holy grail\u2019, were introduced into parts of Ngarkat Conservation Park. Another 40 birds are due for release in August, with researchers aiming to establish a population of 250 birds over several years. Before extinction, the estimated population of Mallee emu wren in the early 2000s was upwards of 6000 in Ngarkat. BirdLife Australia\u2019s Rebecca Boulton said it was a massive challenge finding a net that could capture the little birds. \u201cThey\u2019re such a tiny bird and no one\u2019s ever held them overnight and transported them such large distances before. We had to learn a lot about their husbandry. \u201cYou can\u2019t use a traditional net\u2026they\u2019re super fine but these birds are so small they just go straight through the net,\u201d Ms Boulton said. The group had to improvise, she explained, and used large throw nets that covered patches of grass to trap the birds. It took one week to catch just 40 birds. The next challenge for the birds was to find breeding territory and a good insect population to feed on. \u201cWe did quite a lot of surveys before the birds were released. The habitat where we\u2019ve left them is similar to the one they came from,\u201d Ms Boulton said. A number of prescribed burn-offs have been conducted in Ngarkat to reduce the risk of wildfires for next summer. Natural Resources SA Murray Darling Basin project officer Luke Ireland said they would be using the next release of birds to refine their technique, before introducing a larger population.

Kerry and Paul are fifth-generation farmers who live and work together near Nimbin, in the northern rivers of New South Wales. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a journey, to the point where I left a wife and three sons to become openly gay in the dairy industry,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cYou carry a lot of guilt thereafter and even before, the 35 years before that when you know that something\u2019s not quite right in your head, but you can\u2019t quite work it out. Or you\u2019re not quite game to go and work through it with anybody. \u201cSo we\u2019ve have our fair share of ups and downs and the agricultural industry is a tough gig.\u201d \u201cOh, it was horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one stage we thought, OK, we\u2019ll just go to Brisbane and start a new life in the city, an anonymous life. But it was a fleeting thought. It wasn\u2019t an option because I had three sons.\u201d At the time the kids were aged nine, six and four. \u201cAnd they by default had to come on the journey with us,\u201d Kerry said. With the support of Kerry\u2019s former wife, life kept rolling on. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever sitting around with my head in my hands going, \u2018Oh God, what are we going to do?'\u201d Paul said. And, Kerry said, \u201cwe weren\u2019t the only gays in the village\u201d. \u201cWe used to have a joke, because we moved to Nimbin with three boys and a hundred goats, living on the side of a mountain, that we were the most normal thing in town,\u201d he said. Greying hair and ageing bodies aside, the couple hope that by baring it all they might become the role models they didn\u2019t have. \u201cIf there\u2019s normal, average, mainstream people out there that happen to be gay, and some kid in the bush sees that person or that couple and thinks, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s me,\u2019 then we\u2019ve done our job,\u201d Paul said. It was his personal struggle with chronic anxiety that made him want to raise awareness about the mental health of Australian farmers. It began on Instagram in 2017 and has expanded to include a calendar and\u00a0underwear line. \u201cIf you scroll through [social media] and see a photo of a tractor, you\u2019re probably going to keep scrolling,\u201d Mr Brooksby said. \u201cBut if you see a photo of a tractor and somebody naked in front of it, you\u2019re going to stop and take note and take note of the caption and read about it. \u201cMental health is a massive thing with me. I\u2019ve gone through it myself, lost an uncle to suicide. \u201cI thought, I can really help out here, so that\u2019s when I teamed up with the Royal Flying Doctor Service and did a calendar.\u201d He said The Naked Farmer was simply about starting a conversation. \u201cI was actually talking to a guy who\u2019s 19, and he said he was having some beers around the fire with a couple of older guys who were about 50,\u201d Mr Brooksby said. \u201cThey were talking about The Naked Farmer, and one of the old guys arced up and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how this is getting people talking about mental health. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019 \u201cThen 15 minutes later they were still talking about it, and they were talking about mental health. \u201cThen this 19-year-old guy said, \u2018Well, we\u2019re talking about it now, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 \u201cAnd they were all like, \u2018Yeah, I s\u2019pose\u2019.\u201d \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Sea turtle rehab centre reopens in Darwin", "date": "2018-7-10", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/07/10/sea-turtle-rehabilitation-centre-reopens-charles-darwin-university/", "transcript": "Although Heff \u2013 the largest turtle at Darwin\u2019s only turtle rehabilitation facility\u00a0\u2013 has been in recovery for three years, he is still not ready to return to the wild.

Michael Guinea, the president of sea turtle research and conservation group AusTurtle, reopened the facility on Tuesday. He explained it was a place for turtles to finish their rehabilitation before being released back into the sea, no matter how long that took. Darwin vet nurse Geraldine Reid said there had been a jump in the number of injured turtles due to plastic consumption, and a new facility like the one in Darwin could not have come at a better time. It can treat around 20 turtles in individual tanks pumped with high-quality water for as long as required. When a turtle is injured it is usually taken to a veterinarian, who can perform any emergency treatment. But because of their slow-healing biology, they need a few months to recover enough to return to the wild.

But the pooch has never herded a single sheep. No offence to livestock, but Rubble has always had a higher calling \u2014 first as a search-and-rescue dog, and now as a conservation detection dog sniffing out some of Australia\u2019s most elusive and endangered native animals. Owner and trainer Luke Edwards says the dogs are perfect for the job. \u201cWe know that border collies are really good at both searching and stamina,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re after for working dogs \u2014 their stamina both mentally and physically. Border collies are well known for that.\u201d Mr Edwards and his partner Tracy Edwards run Canidae Development, an organisation that selects and trains dogs to search for animals. \u201cWe sort of live a bit differently than most people with working dogs,\u201d Mr Edwards said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got five dogs \u2026 and they\u2019re all inside dogs with us. First and foremost they are working dogs but we live as a unit, as a pack. \u201cWe spend a lot of time out in the field together. We spend a lot of time working away from home together \u2026 we\u2019ve got a pretty close relationship.\u201d The dogs have worked looking for koala and tiger quoll scat, as well as dead birds and bats as part of windfarm mortality surveys. But last year, Rubble and Uda received their most difficult assignment yet. The dogs were called upon by Zoos Victoria to help sniff out one of the country\u2019s most critically endangered species \u2014 the Baw Baw frog. The small brown frog lives only on the Mount Baw Baw Plateau in eastern Victoria and, like a number of other amphibian species, it has been hit hard by the introduction of the deadly chytrid fungus. It is estimated that there are fewer than 1200 Baw Baw frogs left in the wild. At the rate they are going, they are likely to be extinct in the wild within a decade. Zoos Victoria amphibian specialist Deon Gilbert says up until now, the only way to find the elusive frog was to listen for their calls \u2014 but that can be very tricky. \u201cThis species is incredibly difficult to detect in the wild,\u201d he said. \u201cThey live predominantly underground \u2026 the males only call for about five or six weeks of the year, so that restricts our opportunities to actually locate the species.\u201d Knowing where the frogs are is critical to Zoos Victoria\u2019s captive breeding program. Dogs are often used to detect the presence of animals that live above ground. They\u2019ve been used in northern Australia to detect cane toads. But Mr Gilbert says using dogs to find a native amphibian species that lives underground is as rare as the Baw Baw frogs themselves. \u201cDogs are very, very rarely used for amphibians. There\u2019s only a couple of examples worldwide that have utilised dogs and it\u2019s certainly a first for Australia,\u201d he said. The first challenge is training the dogs. To start with, the dogs are trained to locate the smell of a frog swab on a \u2018scent board\u2019. When they recognise the smell, the dogs drop and indicate with their nose. They are then rewarded with a treat. After that the dogs are giving limited and strictly controlled training with real frogs from the captive breeding program. Ms Edwards says there is no actual interaction between the dogs and the frogs. \u201cAs soon as they find that smell and do that drop, they look to us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they\u2019re not actually looking to the animal for the reward, they\u2019re looking back to us for the reward.\u201d Finally, it\u2019s time to go up the mountain. And that\u2019s where the challenges really begin. It\u2019s remote wild terrain \u2013 and Mr Edwards says it\u2019s hard on everyone, including the dogs. \u201cThe first time we took the dogs up there we actually had about two inches of snow one night \u2013 the first time that the dogs have worked in the snow.\u201d Simply reaching the frog\u2019s habitat is a major achievement. \u201cGoing out to the sites in Mount Baw Baw is probably one of the hardest areas I\u2019ve had to search,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to get out to the site we\u2019re trekking through alpine forest \u2026 it took us maybe 45 minutes to an hour just to arrive on site.\u201d Then the dogs had to catch a scent of the frogs, which can live in burrows up to a metre underground. But the dish-lickers were not about to be licked. Both dogs found several frogs. \u201cThe dogs were able to locate the exact site where the frogs were calling from much quicker than we were able to do just by using ears,\u201d Mr Gilbert said. Mr Edwards says it was exciting for everyone involved. \u201cI think the biggest surprise, particularly with Rubble there was \u2026 as he stuck his nose into a crevice the frog actually called,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s [like] ooh here\u2019s a frog there and that was one that no one knew that was in that particular location, so it was really cool.\u201d The frog dogs not only have the potential to locate Baw Baw Frog populations, but also to help when it comes time to release captive-bred frogs back into the wild. Mr Gilbert says the frogs take years to mature, and are not likely to start calling for five or six years \u2026 meaning scientists have a long wait to find out if they\u2019ve survived. \u201cWe have a huge dark period or dark window where we don\u2019t know if those strategies we\u2019ve put in place were successful or not,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re hoping to be able to use the dogs to indicate just presence or absence within that time period. \u201cIf we release the frogs year after year we can use the dogs to just say \u2018Yep, they\u2019re there, they\u2019re alive\u2019 or \u2018No they\u2019re not there. Do we change our strategy and look for another option?\u2019 \u201d Research assistant with Zoos Victoria\u2019s wildlife conservation and science unit, Chris Hartnett, says the detection dog pilot is a success. \u201cWe set up a challenge for those dogs to find a species that burrows in mud. It\u2019s brown, it\u2019s small, very cryptic, and the dogs actually detected Baw Baw frogs in the wild, so that was quite a thrilling development.\u201d Zoos Victoria is now considering using detection dogs for other threatened species. \u201cThe accuracy of a dog\u2019s nose is really unsurpassed, so they basically have a sense of smell or can have a sense of smell that\u2019s about 10,000 times stronger than humans so we really want to utilise that talent,\u201d Mr Hartnett said. \u201cParticularly for those cryptic and low-density species, we think detection dogs might have a really important role to play. In fact, that could be their niche as a monitoring technique.\u201d Luckily for Zoos Victoria, there are more dogs coming up through the ranks that might be able to fill the new roles. Detection-dog-in-training Oakley is now one-year-old and will start field work later this year and Ms Edwards has been in charge of his training. \u201cHe\u2019s only a puppy, or what we call a \u2018whuppy\u2019, a whopping big puppy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is just living life at the moment, learning the basics so obedience and recalls and environmental exposure. \u201cWe\u2019re letting him have a puppyhood, letting him have a little bit of a life because he is going to work and work hard in his life, so we don\u2019t want to add too much pressure at the moment.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "A French man has won the lottery twice in 18 months.

You have to be exceptionally lucky to win it twice in less than 18 months. But according to Le Parisien newspaper, that\u2019s exactly what happened to one unnamed man from south-east France. His first win was in November 2016 and his second came just weeks ago in May 2018. Both times he won one million euros (thus the name of the lottery \u201cMy Million\u201d). That\u2019s about $3 million total. The newsagent who sold him the ticket told the BBC he barely reacted the second time round: \u201cI guess he is used to winning.\u201d UTS Professor Louise Ryan from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical & Statistical Frontiers did a back-of-the-envelope calculation for us based on the report in Le Parisien that said the odds of winning the My Million lottery in any given week were one in 19 million. It\u2019s a bit complicated because while we know the man had been playing weekly, we don\u2019t know how long for. But suppose the man had been playing weekly for five years. Professor Ryan says the chance he would win once in that time is just over one in 73,000. The chance that he\u2019d win twice in those five years and only 15 months apart is roughly one in 1,473,489,000,000. By comparison, the chance that he\u2019d win once over 50 years would be just over one in 10,000. And the chance that he\u2019d win twice in 50 years and only 15 months apart would be roughly one in 139,670,929,703. Those are still huge numbers. To put them in perspective, Professor Ryan said the odds for winning the lottery twice could be compared to \u201cgetting a good price for a house in Sydney\u201d. To get the odds of winning\u00a0just once\u00a0down to one in 100, you\u2019d have to play weekly for 3,700 years. So, whatever the case, the man in France was extremely lucky. No, Professor Ryan says it\u2019s just not happening. \u201cIf I was him I\u2019d probably quit while I was ahead,\u201d she said.

It is believed he employed the help of a dragoman who assisted him to find and buy antiquities as souvenirs of his time in Egypt. \u201cHe brought back chestfuls of memories,\u201d Ms Beattie told ABC\u00a0Radio. Most recently the artefacts were kept by Ms Beattie\u2019s mother, Margaret St Vincent. The items came to her through her husband, also named John Basil St Vincent Welch, who inherited the antiquities after the death of his father. However ailing health forced her to move into aged care and her house needed to be sold to help with costs. While cleaning up the house, Ms Beattie was tasked with finding a new home for the case of Egyptian antiquities. \u201cIt was a big, sort of a long box with a glass front that I had looked at as a child,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt had been sitting on a closed-in verandah on top of a cupboard.\u201d \u201cWe thought what are we going to do with it?\u201d Family members suggested the items be donated to the University of Sydney where both of the men had studied.

It is believed some objects date back to the first millennium BC. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly rare in Australia; we do have items from other WWI diggers but nothing on this scale.\u201d One long-shaped object wrapped in linen and covered in resin is thought to be a mummified cat. It will undergo medical imaging scans to confirm if does contain a feline within the wrapping. \u201cYou can\u2019t unwrap these sorts of things because that destroys the artefact in itself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut through these technologies that we use in medical science all the time, we can actually use them in Egyptology as well and understand more about those artefacts.\u201d It is expected that many of the items will be displayed in an exhibition at a new museum facility expected to be completed by 2020. Ms Beattie\u2019s family had previously\u00a0donated 70 military-related items to the Australian War Memorial. Other relics found in the house included 500 photographic glass negative plates, swords, and a\u00a0hand grenade\u00a0originally kept by her father who served during WWII. Medals belonging to two German soldiers will be personally returned to their rightful owners. Ms Beattie\u2019s mother died soon after the Egyptian artefacts were donated, but the gesture has inspired her to uncover more about her family\u2019s history. \u201cSadly [my grandfather] was never really talked about because\u00a0he died, when my father was five or six years old, from influenza,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t really know much about this incredible man and we\u2019re now at this stage discovering he was fascinating and it\u2019s just sort of opened up a great big world to us.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "TV preacher calls on flock to buy him a fourth private jet", "date": "2018-5-31", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/31/preacher-jesse-duplantis-fourth-jet/", "transcript": "A US Christian televangelist has called on his flock to fork out US$54 million ($71 million) after claiming Jesus told him he needs a new private jet.

The 300-metre stretch of road, on Rayfield Avenue in Craigieburn, uses an additive that\u2019s made up of 530,000 plastic bags, more than 12,000 recycled printer cartridges and 168,000 glass bottles. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a great initiative,\u201d said Geoff Porter, the mayor of Hume City Council, which takes in Craigieburn. \u201cIf this does work out as we hope it will \u2026 we will be promoting this all around the city.\u201d Tests also reveal the new road can handle extreme temperatures better and when it comes to costs, is about the same price as traditional road laying.

Mr Spence said that councils were only weeks away from striking a new agreement for a similar price \u2014 about $1 a week or $52 a year per household. \u201cA number of them have already signed and there are some who are putting a lot of pressure on the recyclers to get better pricing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want is a smooth process \u2026 and that the recycling system continues to operate.\u201d \u2013ABC"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Malaysian cub is the world's newest panda", "date": "2018-5-26", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/26/cute-baby-panda-wows-fans/", "transcript": "A baby panda born in a Malaysian zoo five months ago has made her public debut.

The 11th annual\u00a0list compiled by the\u00a0International Institute of Species Exploration\u00a0(IISW) includes\u00a0microbes, plants, animals and exotic sea creatures. The list is traditionally published to\u00a0highlight the diversity of species on earth, especially the endangered ones, and encourage their conservation. But among the rare and endangered creatures highlighted this year is\u00a0Wakaleo schouteni, a predatory marsupial thought to have hunted the\u00a0open forest habitat in northwestern Queensland in the\u00a0late Oligocene period, which ended about 23 million years ago. Scientists from the University of New South Wales recovered fossils in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in Queensland that proved to be a previously unknown fossil marsupial lion, the IISW said. The \u2018lion\u2019 was thought to have weighed around 23 kilograms, was the size of a\u00a0collie dog\u00a0and spent at least part of its time in trees. Its teeth suggested\u00a0it was not completely reliant on meat but was, instead, an omnivore.

Protist (Ancoracysta twista) This single-celled protist was found living on a brain coral in a tropical aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. Atlantic forest tree (Dinizia jueirana-facao) A\u00a040-metre, 56-tonne tree found in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest, home to half of the country\u2019s threatened species. Amphipod (Epimeria Quasimodo) A brightly coloured, 5cm, humped-back\u00a0crustacean (hence the Quasimodo name)\u00a0found in\u00a0icy waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front. Baffling beetle (Nymphister kronaueri) This tiny beetle, measuring just 1.5 millimetres long, lives alongside a species of nomadic army ant. When the ant colony moves every two to three weeks, the beetle joins them,\u00a0attaching itself to\u00a0the ants and living off their labours. Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) The most endangered great ape in the world, these diminutive primates are\u00a0isolated\u00a0from other species of Sumatra.\u00a0The male orangutans stand under 5 feet tall, while the females are under 4 feet, which is similar to other orangutans. Swire\u2019s snailfish (Pseudoliparis swirei) The\u00a0fish resembles a tadpole and lives at the bottom of the Western Pacific\u2019s Mariana Trench. The name can be traced to one of the officers from the HMS Challenger, which discovered the trench in 1875. Heterotrophic flower (Sciaphila sugimotoi) A critically endangered but\u00a0gorgeous flower on Japan\u2019s Ishigaki Island that produces small blossoms in September and October. While most plants capture energy from the sun to grow\u00a0via\u00a0photosynthesis,\u00a0the flower receives nutrition from fungus without harming it. Volcanic bacterium (Thiolava veneris) The eruption of the Tagoro volcano off the coast of the Canary Islands in 2011 killed off several marine ecosystems, but gave birth to a\u00a0proteobacteria in the new toxic environment. Named \u201cVenus\u2019 hair,\u201d the bacteria formed a white mat making up nearly half an acre around Tagoro\u2019s volcanic cone. Marsupial lion (Wakaleo schouteni) The\u00a0marsupial lion lived in the open forest\u00a0about 23 million years ago and spent part of its life in trees. As big as a collie dog, the omnivore was thought to have increased in size as the Queensland climate became drier and cooler.

Scientists on Wednesday described the cranium of a small primitive Cretaceous Period mammal called Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch, about the size of a small hare, that lived 130 million years ago, as boasting traits suggesting it possessed a keen sense of smell and may have been nocturnal. \u201cIt\u2019s a plant-eater, as we can tell from its herbivorous teeth,\u201d University of Chicago paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo said. \u201cFrom the sediments in which it was preserved, likely it lived on the banks or flood plain of a small river.\u201d The 7.5cm skull was well preserved and nearly complete, unlike the usual scrappy fossils of the group to which Cifelliodon belonged, called haramiyidans. The earliest primitive mammals evolved during the Triassic Period, when dinosaurs also first appeared, from creatures that combined reptilian and mammalian characteristics. Haramiyidans appeared close to the dawn of the mammalian lineage, with the earliest-known representative living about 208 million years ago and the last-known member perhaps about 70 million years ago. The skull was unwittingly excavated at a site north of Arches National Park in eastern Utah. The paleontologists from Utah Geological Survey did not know it was entombed in rock brought back to a lab for study until they looked under a foot bone of a two-legged plant-eating dinosaur called Hippodraco. It may be the best-preserved skull of any haramiyidan, offering a new understanding of the group. \u201cCompared to modern mammals, Cifelliodon had a simple, tube-like brain, lacked complex bony structures usually associated with the front part of the brain case and nasal region, and had simple tooth roots, among other primitive features,\u201d University of Southern California paleontologist Adam Huttenlocker said. Before a geological process called plate tectonics rendered them separate land masses, the Americas, Eurasia, Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India all were part of a huge, single continent called Pangaea. The timing for Pangaea\u2019s break-up, initially into two major land masses, has been a matter of scientific debate. The researchers said the discovery of Cifelliodon, which had a close contemporaneous relative in Africa, suggests there were still connections between the northern hemisphere continents and those in the southern hemisphere 15 million years later than previously believed.

Kami Rita reached the summit on Wednesday morning with a team of foreign climbers and a fellow Sherpa guide and was already safely descending to a lower camp by the afternoon, said Gyanendra Shrestha, a government official who is stationed at the base camp. The 48-year-old was among the three men \u2013 all Nepalese Sherpa guides \u2013 who had tied the previous record of 21 successful ascents of the 8850-metre peak. Before leaving for the mountain last month, he told The Associated Press he wanted to scale Everest at least 25 times. Mountaineering has been his family tradition. His father was among the first professional guides after Nepal opened to foreign trekkers and mountaineers in 1950. His brother has scaled Everest 17 times. Most of his male relatives have reached the top at least once. Kami Rita first scaled Everest at age 24, and has made the trip almost every year since then. He has also climbed many of the region\u2019s other high peaks, including K-2, Cho-Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse. In the autumn, he guides clients to smaller peaks in Nepal. The other two summit record-holders are also Sherpas. Apa, a 58-year-old guide who uses only one name, retired in 2011 and moved to Utah. Phurba Tashi, 47, retired from high-altitude climbing in 2013 but still works at Everest\u2019s Base Camp, helping organise expeditions. The route to the Everest summit was opened up by a team of Sherpas earlier this week. More than 340 foreign climbers along with local guides are attempting to climb Everest this month. -AAP"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Wildlife park fined for taking bear for drive-through ice cream", "date": "2018-5-15", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/15/bear-drive-through-ice-cream/", "transcript": "What seemed like an innocent birthday outing for Berkley, a kodiak bear, has landed a Canadian zoo in trouble with government officials. Discovery Wildlife Park officials decided to celebrate Berkley\u2019s first birthday with a trip to a nearby drive-thru Dairy Queen. In a video posted on Facebook she could be seen leaning happily out of the car\u2019s window devouring a soft serve out of the restaurant manager\u2019s hand. But once the video was posted the park began to receive criticism. An investigation by the Environment and Parks Fish and Wildlife enforcement branch then resulted in a fine. Serena Bos, a bear trainer at the wildlife park, said the original message of the outing was intended to be about conservation. The park regularly focuses on bear safety and they decided a video educating people not to feed wild bears would be a good idea. \u201cWe thought if we were to do something in the natural setting of the park then people might get the idea that feeding a wild bear was a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we thought if it was kind of that extreme, something nobody would ever do, it wouldn\u2019t give the wrong message. \u201cUnfortunately \u2026 it was still twisted and taken out of context.\u201d But Ms Bos said the park accepted the fine, because in the end it was their own human error that resulted in the investigation. \u201cThe reason we were fined is because we failed to notify special wildlife that we were taking an animal off the property,\u201d she said. There is no rule against taking a bear off the park\u2019s property, nor any animal for that matter, however there are strict rules that stipulate authorities must be notified. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a bear or a guinea pig or if it\u2019s a mouse \u2013 we have to notify them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes we did have human error and we forgot to send our email notifying our authorities that yes we were taking an animal off the property.\u201d The park has since deleted both the drive-thru video and another video showing Berkley eating an ice cream cake. Ms Bos said the park \u201c100 per cent\u201d accepted the charges and did not believe the regulations were in any way too strict. In fact she said they were thankful that the authorities fined them and held them accountable. \u201cIt shows the public in \u2026 Canada that our regulations are extremely strict and that the animals here are held in the highest respect and have the highest welfare,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact \u2026 not only did they inspect the situation but we asked for a fully-fledged inspection of our facility, which they did come and do as well. \u201cThat was something we requested just because we felt that it\u2019s beneficial for the public to know that we are inspected and that there are authorities making sure we are giving these animals the utmost respect and care that they deserve and require.\u201d Ms Bos was adamant that when planning Berkley\u2019s ice cream outing they considered both the safety of the bear and the general public. \u201cWe would never do anything that would ever jeopardise anybody\u2019s safety,\u201d she said. Berkley is just a cub, and has been raised by staff at the wildlife park. Ms Bos said riding in a vehicle is an everyday activity for Berkley, as she is driven to different sections daily so she can have play time. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t something that she would ever be stressed out from,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as safety goes for the public she was in the truck the entire time, she never left the truck.\u201d Berkley was also on a bear version of a leash \u2014 a chain \u2014 for the whole trip. Wildlife protection organisations have called the outing completely irresponsible, but Ms Bos said they did not plan for it to be \u201ca stunt\u201d. She said for them it was another part of Berkley\u2019s training for \u201cenrichment purposes\u201d. \u201cTraining is considered to be the highest form of enrichment you can give an animal in captivity, it creates brain function no different than you and I going to school or having a job,\u201d she said. \u201cThey truly enjoy doing different things.\u201d A lot of the training animals get given is for their medical benefit \u2013 bears get trained to pee in a cup and for blood draws, so if they have a medical issue vets can easily test them. \u201cThey\u2019re trained to give you their blood samples so we don\u2019t have to sedate them for simple things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it really does increase their quality of life. \u201cEven training them to open their mouth big and wide, we can make sure we\u2019re doing regular tooth checks to make sure there\u2019s no problems, because animals get those just like humans do. \u201cIn fact we had a jaguar that had his canine tooth broken, he required a root canal and we would have never known if he wasn\u2019t trained to open his mouth and do his daily checks. \u201cWe even had to brush the jaguar\u2019s tooth after the root canal, which again had they not been trained that\u2019s not something we would have been able to.\u201d Would they take a bear out for ice cream again? Ms Bos said they would definitely do something similar again, but probably not exactly the same. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t taken the way \u2026 we wanted it to be taken,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal was to educate people and for it to be taken a specific way \u2014 no we wouldn\u2019t do it exactly the same.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Old Melbourne trams go up for sale", "date": "2018-5-15", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/15/old-trams-for-sale/", "transcript": "A piece of Melbourne\u2019s history is up for sale and it can be yours for the bargain price of just $1000.

Thousands of items have been unearthed, including red crayons that are 48,000 years old and decorated beads made from sea shells and ostrich eggs. Australian National University archaeologist Dr Ceri Shipton said the discovery sheds light on a major turning point in human history. He said for someone whose lifestyle would have revolved around hunting and gathering, the technology was comparable to the smartphone, or the car a hundred years ago. \u201cThe invention of the bow and arrow, because it\u2019s such an effective hunting weapon, could have a totally similarly revolutionary effect,\u201d he said. More than 30,000 items have been discovered, many of them in mint condition. Examples of rapid innovation found in the cave include sharp arrow points carved from bone, more sophisticated use of materials for craft work and essential tools. Dr Shipton said the way the artefacts changed over the timeline indicated the people who made and used them were very innovative. \u201cIn the early part of the sequence, we see they are using quite big stone tools for making things like stone-tipped spearheads,\u201d he said. \u201cThen around 67,000 years ago there is an abrupt change in the stone tools and from that point on, [the tools] become very small and made of very sharp stone.\u201d The cave, called Panga ya Saidi, is 15 kilometres from Kenya\u2019s south-east coast, just north of Mombasa. Dr Shipton, who was part of the team working in the cave, said it was unique in providing such an unbroken, continuous record of human occupation. Humans moved into the cave 78,000 years ago and lived there until 500 years ago. Dr Shipton said the technological revolution seen there in the Later Stone Age would have driven rapid change. During that period, it was unusual for people to live in a tropical rainforest, as they were mostly found in grasslands where there were larger animals for hunting. Living in a rainforest forced humans to hunt for smaller animals, such as monkeys and small deer, which required more sophisticated technology, thus driving the push for better tools. This helps explains the rapid improvement in arrow points found in Panga ya Saidi. Dr Shipton said it was the kind of \u201cbehavioural flexibility\u201d that allowed humans to populate the rest of the world. Other sites from the same period have been found in South Africa and the Rift Valley in East Africa, but this is the first site found with such a continuous record. Dr Shipton said many of the items remain in excellent condition, partly because the cave protected them from the elements, but also because the limestone walls helped preserve materials containing calcium carbonate such as bone, marine shells and egg shells. The tools are still sharp and the crayons still show grooves where they have been used. Dr Shipton said the site was \u201cinspiring\u201d to work on, with clouds of butterflies rising from the vegetation as the jungle over time has begun to take over parts of the cave. \u201cYou walk in through this narrow entrance and it opens up into this huge chamber with lots of little passages going off from it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so old that the roof has collapsed, so inside it\u2019s actually open air and there is all sorts of jungle growing from within the cave. \u201cAnd vines growing down from above as well, so when you go in it\u2019s absolutely beautiful. \u201cIt has these huge chambers that are lush and green inside and they\u2019re 40 metres across with walls that are 15 metres high. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a sanctuary for local wildlife, so there\u2019s monkeys going across overhead, there\u2019s owls that live in the cave and monitor lizards and a giant python.\u201d The cave remains sacred to the local people, so none of the vegetation or wildlife has been cleared away. \u201cThere are parts of the cave, alcoves, that are used for rituals today and it\u2019s a real privilege to work there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe locals that we work with are friendly and generous in letting us work there and they\u2019ve also become good archaeologists in their own right.\u201d The project was led by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and the study was\u00a0published in the Nature Communications\u00a0journal."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Indian fraudsters ridiculed after being paraded in 'space suits'", "date": "2018-5-10", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/10/indian-fraud-space-suits/", "transcript": "A\u00a0man and his son have been embarrassingly paraded in \u201cspace suits\u201d by Indian police after\u00a0they were\u00a0arrested for allegedly defrauding a businessman by\u00a0pretending to work for NASA.

Our point man is armed with a metre-long length of pipe and a dart filled with two potent tranquilisers: ketamine and medetomidine. Beside him is Nasum Ucup, a keeper at the shelter, which houses stolen and smuggled wildlife confiscated by government. He guides us along a row of steel bars and stops at the final cage. The muted torchlight barely penetrates into the cage, but even in the low light you can tell that there\u2019s something big inside. No one speaks \u2026 or even whispers. The dart man raises his blowpipe and then the silence of the rescue centre is torn apart by an ear-splitting screech. It\u2019s like a car alarm blasting a metre from your head. It\u2019s a cockatoo: another resident of the centre, alarmed to find half-a-dozen humans creeping through this place in the middle of the night. The whole centre roars into life. The creature in the cage stirs, and stands up. It\u2019s Jono, an adult orangutan, and the reason we\u2019re all here. Jono\u2019s been here, in this tiny cage, for six years, and it\u2019s finally time for him to get out. Jono, unsurprisingly, does not seem calm. Nasum tries to quieten him, patting his hand against the cage and calling, \u201cJono, Jono, Jono\u201d, in a soft voice, trying to let him know that it\u2019s him, Nasum, a familiar voice, giving the dart man time to get a clean shot. Getting Jono out of the cage without being tranquilised is unthinkable \u2014 he\u2019s eight times stronger than any of us and he could tear off an arm or a leg without much trouble at all. Nasum\u2019s still tapping the cage and the cockatoo is still screeching. Before I understand what I\u2019m seeing a black hand shoots out and grabs Nasum\u2019s wrist\u00a0\u2013 and pulls his hand into the cage. Jono bites Nasum, hard, and his hand is still in the cage. The dart man and another keeper dive in and try to pull Nasum\u2019s hand free. After a few seconds Jono releases Nasum, who\u2019s a bit shocked but his finger seems intact. A dart is finally blown in to him, and within a few minutes Jono is knocked out. He\u2019s hauled out of the cage and carried inside for inspection. Femke den Haas from the Jakarta Animal Aid Network says he\u2019s in pretty good condition. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve been able to inspect him thoroughly,\u201d she says, as a team weighs and measures the unconscious Jono. He\u2019s then loaded into a custom-made crate ready for the flight to Pangkalan Bun. This mission has been planned for months. Animal welfare volunteers and Indonesian government officials had been working to get Jono out since last year\u00a0when Jono\u2019s presence at the centre was revealed by the ABC\u2019s Foreign Correspondent program. Femke den Haas says she didn\u2019t know Jono was still in the centre. \u201cThis transit centre is very important\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s where they put wildlife that\u2019s smuggled through the airport,\u201d she tells 7.30. \u201cBut it\u2019s a transit centre. \u201cNo animal should stay here for more than a few months.\u201d Jono was brought to the centre six years ago after he was confiscated from a private owner who\u2019d kept him illegally as a pet. Efforts to find him a permanent home failed. Ms den Haas says events moved quickly after the Foreign Correspondent episode. The Indonesian government agreed to grant permission for Jono to be moved. DNA tests revealed Jono was from the Indonesian province of Kalimantan. An orangutan rehabilitation centre in Kalimantan agreed to take Jono and donations from Australia helped cover the cost of a new, temporary cage at the Orangutan Foundation International centre outside the city of Pangkalan Bun, run by Professor Birute Galdikas. The centre has released more than 500 orangutans back into the wild. Often the centre is working with baby orangutans that are orphaned by fire or land clearing. The young orangutans are raised by humans and taught survival skills in a jungle camp. Getting an orangutan ready for release is a long process. Professor Galdikas said Jono\u2019s rehabilitation would take several years at least. \u201cWe can\u2019t just open the cage door and let him out into the forest,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure he knows how to make a nest. We also make sure that he\u2019s capable of foraging, of finding wild foods in the forest.\u201d Initially he\u2019ll go into a quarantine cage, then into a small reserve. But the first step is getting him to Kalimantan. The most moving parts of the program come when Jono\u2019s finally released into his new, temporary cage. It\u2019s four times bigger than his Jakarta cage, and it\u2019s fitted with ropes and tyres for him to climb. It\u2019s open to the light, and for the first time in at least six years, Jono\u2019s able to swing and hang from the ceiling. It\u2019s a vast improvement. Ms\u00a0den Haas is in tears as Jono enters his new cage and immediately grabs hold of the ropes, swinging about the cage. \u201cFor all these years he\u2019s not been able to swing around,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the cage in the transit centre in Jakarta, there was nothing for him to swing with. He was always lying on a bare concrete floor. \u201cThat was his life. Dark, no sunlight. Now he can finally swing again.\u201d It is the last stop for Jono. After a short time in his new quarantine cage he will be released into the jungle. Nasum Ucup, the keeper bitten by Jono, also made the trip to Kalimantan with Jono. \u201cI took care of Jono since he arrived in 2012 until today,\u201d he says. \u201cI am very sad but he must return to his habitat. \u201cI am happy too, not just sad. \u201cI\u2019m also proud. Maybe he bit me in that last moment so that he could remember me.\u201d Before leaving, Nasum gives Jono a final wave. \u201cBye, Jono. Please remember me,\u201d he says."}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Secretary, 96, amasses millions and donates it to needy students", "date": "2018-5-8", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/08/96-year-old-secretary-donates-fortune-students/", "transcript": "Even by the dizzying standards of New York City philanthropy, a recent $US6.24 million ($8.37 million) donation to the\u00a0Henry Street Settlement\u00a0on the Lower East Side was a whopper \u2013 the largest single gift from an individual to the social service group in its 125-year history. It was not donated by some billionaire benefactor, but by a frugal legal secretary from Brooklyn who toiled for the same law firm for 67 years until she retired at age 96 and died not long afterward in 2016. Her name was Sylvia Bloom and even her closest friends and relatives had no idea she had amassed a fortune over the decades. She did this by shrewdly observing the investments made by the lawyers she served. \u201cShe was a secretary in an era when they ran their boss\u2019s lives, including their personal investments,\u201d recalled her niece Jane Lockshin. \u201cSo when the boss would buy a stock, she would make the purchase for him, and then buy the same stock for herself, but in a smaller amount because she was on a secretary\u2019s salary.\u201d Since Ms Bloom never talked about this, even to those closest to her, the fact that she had carefully cultivated more than $US9 million ($12.07 million) among three brokerage houses and 11 banks, emerged only at the end of her life \u2013 \u201can oh my God moment\u201d, said Ms Lockshin, the executor of Ms Bloom\u2019s estate. \u201cI realised she had millions and she had never mentioned a word,\u201d recalled Ms Lockshin. \u201cI don\u2019t think she thought it was anybody\u2019s business but her own.\u201d Ms Bloom\u2019s will allowed for some money to be left to relatives and friends, but directed that the bulk of the fortune go toward scholarships of Ms Lockshin\u2019s choice for needy students. Ms Lockshin, the longstanding treasurer of the settlement\u2019s board, called the group\u2019s executive director, David Garza, and asked him if he was sitting down. \u201cWe were all agape, just blown away,\u201d recalled Mr Garza, who said the money would endow the settlement\u2019s\u00a0program\u00a0which helps disadvantaged students prepare for and complete college. Ms Bloom joins the ranks of unassuming and magnanimous millionaires next door, who have died with fortunes far larger than their lifestyles ever would have suggested. Like Ms Bloom,\u00a0Leonard Gigowski, a shopkeeper from New Berlin, Wisconsin, who died in 2015, left his secret $US13 million ($17.4 million) fortune to fund scholarships.\u00a0Grace Groner, who lived in a one-bedroom home in Lake Forest, Illinois, and directed that her $US7 million ($9.39 million) estate go to her alma mater when she died in 2010 at 100, shopped at thrift stores and chose to walk, not drive. Donald and Mildred Othmer, who settled in Brooklyn Heights, lived relatively simple lives; he was a professor at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn and she was a former teacher and buyer for her mother\u2019s dress stores. They invested wisely in Berkshire Hathaway, run by a family friend from Omaha, Warren Buffett, and died in their 90s with three-quarters of a billion dollars, most of which they donated. Ms Bloom, who never had children of her own, was born to eastern European immigrants and grew up in Brooklyn during the Great Depression. She attended public schools\u00a0and did her degree at night while working days to make ends meet. In 1947 she joined a fledgling Wall Street law firm as one of its first employees. Over her 67 years with the firm,\u00a0Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, it grew to its current size, with more than 1200 lawyers, as well as hundreds of staff members, of which Ms Bloom was the longest tenured, said Paul Hyams, a human resources executive for the firm who became good friends with Ms Bloom over his 35 years working there. Ms Bloom\u2019s husband, Raymond Margolies, who died in 2002, was a city firefighter who retired and became a city schoolteacher with a pharmacist career on the side, relatives said. Nearly all the money was in Ms Bloom\u2019s name alone, Ms Lockshin said, adding that it was \u201cvery possible\u201d that even Mr Margolies did not know the size of his wife\u2019s fortune.

Never in his wildest dreams did he think it would be an aggressive form of cancer. But after being diagnosed with a tumour in his right leg, Chico needed help. Luckily, for Chiko\u2019s sake, he was referred to the first and only dedicated oncology facility for animals in New South Wales. \u201cMy wife and I were devastated,\u201d Mr Hosgorur said. The multimillion-dollar facility at the Small Animal Specialist Hospital in North Ryde offers surgery, radiation and chemotherapy for animals. It opened in March and claims to be the most advanced in the southern hemisphere, using machines generally used to treat humans to help animals in need. Oncologist Sandra Nguyen said state-of-the-art technology would not only cure cancer in some pets but could also improve their quality of life. \u201cThe radiation delivery is moulded to the tumour, so we can try and reduce the side effects, as well as shorten the treatment times where possible,\u201d Dr Nguyen said. \u201cMost patients we see are completely healthy when first diagnosed, so what they require is treatment, so they can continue living a happy and pain-free life.\u201d Before the centre opened most animals were either sent to a similar facility in Brisbane for treatment or would be forced to have a limb amputated to prevent the cancer spreading. \u201cMost people can\u2019t afford to take their pets interstate for treatment, whereas at least here, they can drop their patient off with us, go to work and pick them up on the way home,\u201d Dr Nguyen said. Depending on the form of cancer, the cost of treatment ranges from $3000 to $13,000, while an individual dose of radiation takes around 20 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s really up to the pet owner whether or not they want to proceed with treatment, but I would highly recommend pet insurance,\u201d Dr Nguyen said. \u201cWe even had one case where an owner set up a crowd-funding page on Instagram.\u201d Zanthia Harvison put her nine-year-old border collie Dusty through a full cycle of radiation after he was diagnosed with a nose tumour. \u201cHe has only just finished four weeks of treatment and it was so worth it \u2014 he isn\u2019t in any pain, the tumour is shrinking, and he\u2019s even back to hunting for sticks in the park,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t put a price on a human\u2019s life \u2014 a pet is like one of the family \u2014 you do whatever you can to make sure they are happy and we are delighted with the results from this centre.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "'Usain Bolt' oyster on track to be a Guinness World Record holder", "date": "2018-5-1", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/05/01/giant-oyster-on-track-to-break-world-record/", "transcript": "Bernie Connell is an oyster farmer from the Clyde River on the NSW Far South Coast hoping to claim a Guinness World Record at this year\u2019s Narooma Oyster Festival.

Incredibly, Jack the Oyster has grown to the size of a human forearm and unofficially weighs just over\u00a0two kilograms. Mr Connell said it was not uncommon for some oysters to grow at faster rates than others in a batch. \u201cEvery batch of oysters you get, there\u2019s always a certain few that grow a lot faster than the other ones, so he [Jack] stood out for the last four years,\u201d Mr Connell said. \u201cAny time I\u2019d come back and work my crop he\u2019d be a lot bigger than the other ones. \u201cAfter a couple of years he was pretty big \u2026 so I put him in his separate little home and he\u2019s just grown from there. \u201cHe\u2019s still growing. Every time I pick him up he\u2019s got a fringe on him \u2013 new shells. So if nothing happens to him he should grow into a pretty big oyster,\u201d he said. Mr Connell said there are several oysters on his lease which could break the record. Mr Connell said growing Jack has not meant much extra work, aside from finding the right spot in the river and a bit of tender loving care. \u201cThey\u2019re just a special type of oyster, like Usain Bolt \u2026 Just a champion oyster,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery couple of months I bring him back to the shed and clean all the barnacles and seaweed off him. \u201cThey [the oysters] all eat the same sort of stuff \u2026 I look after them and they grow. On whether Jack has reached his peak, Mr Connell said he has still got some growing years in him yet. \u201cHe\u2019s only four years old and the one overseas [which currently holds the record], they reckon is about 16, so he\u2019s got a lot of growing to do,\u201d he said. According to Guinness World Records, the current record for the largest oyster was set in Denmark in 2013 by another Pacific oyster found on the shores of the Wadden Sea. The oyster had another five attached to it, but the cluster weighed a total of 1.62kg and measured 35.5cm long. All new world record contenders looking to claim the official title will be weighed, measured and photographed at the Narooma Oyster Festival this weekend. The information will then be sent to the Guinness World Records office for an official appraisal.

Circumhorizon arcs, a phenomenon that sees wispy rainbow-coloured shapes appear in the sky, have been lighting up social media after a runner spotted one over a national park near San Francisco, California. The \u201cfire rainbows\u201d are formed when the ice crystals that make up wispy cirrus clouds catch sunlight or moonlight at a certain angle. Meteorologist and ABC weather presenter Nate Byrne says they can happen anywhere if you have all the right ingredients. \u201cWhen it comes to the when/where question, it\u2019s really a matter of chance,\u201d Ms Byrne said. \u201cLatitude matters and the time of year depending on that latitude matters. \u201cYou\u2019re generally most likely to see it when the sun is high in the sky\u00a0\u2013 so summer is the most likely time of year you\u2019ll see it.\u201d A number of conditions in the atmosphere must culminate for the condition to occur: If the stars align (so to speak) and the arc of light passes through the ice crystals at the right angle, the cirrus clouds will light up in a rainbow of colour parallel to the horizon. \u201cWhen the sun hits the ice crystals, you get pretty colours,\u201d Roger Gass, a meteorologist with the US National Weather Service, told local news site SFGATE. \u201cIt\u2019s an optical illusion.\u201d And the closer you are to the equator the more likely it is. Because the sun needs to be so high in the sky for the \u201cfire rainbow\u201d to form, places more than 58 degrees north or south from the equator are unlikely to see it occur. \u201cIn the Northern Territory you\u2019re pretty well positioned because you do get quite a few thunderstorms and cirrus clouds occur often after those storms,\u201d Ms Byrne said. \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re not seeing more in Australia is because there are fewer eyes looking up to the sky.\u201d"}, {"source": "The New Daily", "title": "Massive swordfish could smash Australian record", "date": "2018-4-30", "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/good-news/2018/04/30/massive-swordfish-could-smash-australian-record/", "transcript": "A whopper 349-kilogram swordfish caught in Victoria on the weekend may have smashed an Australian record.
