    "transcript": "Aussies are being urged to show their support for front-line workers in the coronavirus crisis with a mass round of applause on Thursday night. The Cheer4Frontliners campaign urges Australians to “cheer, clap, yelp, bang pots, make noise” from doorsteps, balconies, windows and backyards from 8pm on Thursday. It is inspired by a similar show of clapping in Britain for its National Health Service and has been organised by a social enterprise called Frontliners. Frontliners has contributed $2 million in products, including care packages, to health and emergency workers leading the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. The organisation said the campaign would also make up for some of the “disgusting abuse” some health care workers and police officers have endured during the COVID-19 pandemic.

    "date": "04-09-2020",
    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2020\/04\/09\/rhubarb-champagne-farmer\/",
    "transcript": "A Tasmanian farmer has earned a firm ticking-off from France after suggesting people could make their excess rhubarb into champagne. Guy Robertson from Penguin, in the state’s north-west, has turned his business over to deliveries after losing all of almost his usual sales at traditional farmers’ markets and festivals, restaurants and in on-farm experiences overnight because of the COVID-19 outbreak. “The first week was the sleepless week,” Mr Robertson said. “Then we realised we could put everything online.” The Mount Gnomon Farm website was born – and Mr Robertson is now busy selling meat, vegetables, and fruit online, as well as products from other local artisan producers. But it was a post on social media that landed him in hot water with the French. He has been including in-season rhubarb in his produce boxes, and suggested anyone who had too much should treat themselves, as he had, by brewing some homemade rhubarb bubbly, which he termed champagne. A couple of days later, he answered the phone to a French official. “In the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action about the farm’s production of rhubarb champagne,” Mr Robertson wrote in a Facebook post. “I never thought that 10 litres of rhubarb cordial for our own consumption would be on the radar in France.”  Yesterday in the middle of deliveries I received a phone call from a gentleman in France with the threat of legal action… Posted by Mount Gnomon Farm on Monday, April 6, 2020 The French official told Mr Robertson that organisations such as the Comité Champagne protect and promote the Champagne brand. “He was a really nice guy, he said: ‘I know it’s a really bad time around the world at the moment, but our legal team takes it very seriously’,” Mr Robertson told ABC Radio. “He said he has been doing it for three years and it’s his job to make sure everyone complies and nobody markets their bubbles as champagne unless you come from the Champagne region in France. “It was a funny moment for me, I just couldn’t believe I had a call from France in the current climate about 10 litres of home brew that we aren’t even marketing.” Apparently, among Mount Gnomon Farm’s thousands of social media fans is a French person, who was concerned by Mr Robertson’s post. The post was reported – and the man in France then followed it up. “They take their job very seriously,” Mr Robertson said. “It made me laugh and laugh. “If I ever go into the production of rhubarb champagne, I’ll have to call it something different.” In other respects, Mount Gnomon farm is proving resilient. Mr Robertson said he was delivering food boxes throughout Tasmania. “The most encouraging thing is the community support,” he said. “We’re trying to focus on what we can do rather than what we can’t do.” For Easter, he has 70 deliveries around the state’s north-west, 50 to Launceston and 60 to Hobart – all driven by himself. And rhubarb will be in all the produce boxes. -with agencies"

    "transcript": "The Easter long weekend is looming – and while it’s hardly a typical holiday break, there will still be plenty wanting to spend their days at home indulging in good food and chocolate. It might be comforting to know, then, that at least one constant has widespread approval to get on with his “essential” job – the Easter Bunny. “I’m told because he’s a solo operator and an essential service, he or she, will be allowed to continue to operate,” Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has said. It’s a view endorsed in at least two Australian states. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said the Easter Bunny fitted into the same category as health care workers, military personnel, transport and freight specialists, and MPs, and would be allowed to get on with his job despite the island state’s strict coronavirus travel bans. “I’ve actually had a number of emails … one from a delightful young fellow whose brother was taken out of school [and had to] self-isolate because he had an underlying health condition,” he told the Nine Network. “He wrote to me, an eight-year-old … wanting to know whether or not the Easter Bunny would come. “It’s my personal view, based on a discussion with Public Health [Services] … that the Easter Bunny can be classed as an essential traveller and therefore will be in the state over Easter and able to deliver Easter eggs.” It’s a similar situation in Western Australia – which has closed its borders to try to halt the spread of the virus. Premier Mark McGowan said he’d also been hit up by concerned kids – and had decided to allow the Easter Bunny free travel throughout the state. Over the ditch in New Zealand, where the nation will head into its third week in a strict lockdown at the Easter weekend, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also given the all-clear for the busy bunny – and another essential co-worker. “We do consider both the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to be essential workers,” she said on Monday. Ms Ardern said 2020 had already been particularly tough for the Easter Bunny. “They’re going to be potentially quite busy at home with their family as well and their own bunnies,” she said. “So I say to the children of New Zealand if the Easter Bunny doesn’t make it to your household, then we have to understand that it’s a bit difficult at the moment.” -with AAP"

    "transcript": "When the Northern Territory’s strict coronavirus travel restrictions slowed passing trade to a trickle, a Top End roadhouse decided it was time to try something new. The Dunmarra Wayside Inn, 315 kilometres south of Katherine, is owned by pilot Gary Frost. Most of the surrounding cattle stations were now in lockdown – so he had little choice but to take to the skies to keep the locals in high spirits. “Nobody can go anywhere, they’re limited to how they get their supplies and refreshments,” Mr Frost said. “We thought we might do something to help them out a little bit. “We make pizzas at Dunmarra roadhouse anyway, so we thought we would get all the pizzas together and see if they were interested, if we can fly them out, so they don’t have to leave the properties.” Hot food and alcohol has already been delivered to stations within a 100 kilometre radius of the roadhouse, with plans to extend the once-a-week service to properties up to 400 kilometres away. With prices remaining the same as in-house orders, the idea has been well received. “We’ve been getting quite a good response actually – everybody is quite excited about it,” Mr Frost said. “Its something unique I suppose, I don’t know of anyone else who has ever done it probably in the world, as far as I could research. “I suppose the cost of it is prohibitive as a commercial venture, but we’re not doing it as a commercial venture. “We’re just doing it as a friendly gesture to try and help people out and create the right atmosphere.” The takeaway products, along with mailbags for the stations, are delivered in a fixed-wing plane, which has plenty of room for the extra cargo. Mr Frost said he was also willing to throw a few extra toilet rolls in the back, if needed. “As long as they don’t come loose in the back of the plane, that’s all right,” he said."

    "transcript": "April Fools Day is cancelled this year. That’s if you believe search engine overlord Google, which is apparently hitting pass on the trickery of April 1, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The revelation came via a leaked email from Google’s chief marketing officer Lorraine Twohill, to all staff saying pranks would be put on hold this year as the platform has more important duties – like keeping the searching masses informed on the most relevant COVID-19 information. Seems legit, but only time will tell. Usually, April 1 is fraught with danger for the general public and the media. News outlet inboxes are flooded with ‘clever’ pitches from PR companies, trying to trick over-tired, unwitting journalists into running their brand name in headlines. Apparently this year, we can just be our gullible selves, no need to be on high alert. In lieu of any trickery, here’s a round-up of some of the best (and most outlandish) April Fools Day pranks we’ve seen in Australia over the years. It’s a shame Google isn’t (allegedly) participating this year – the company is pretty much the undisputed king of pranks.  About a decade ago, Google announced it was getting involved in the AFL, launching a partnership for the gBall: An AFL ball built-in with the best of Google’s tech, to measure location, accuracy and torque of every kick. You could download all this data and more, to keep improving your game. Sounds like every budding Gary Ablett’s dream, right? Google probably tipped the joke over the edge when it claimed the gBall shared its intel with scouting agents. If they were interested and wanted to contact the ball owner, the ball would buzz. National icon Vegemite got us good in 2015, when it announced a Big Vegemite was being erected in Melbourne. Have you heard? Something BIG is coming to Melbourne in the shape of a 60m tall interactive Vegemite jar. Who's keen? pic.twitter.com\/86N7Fsjepo — Vegemite (@Vegemite) March 31, 2015 What made this prank more memorable was that it caught out pop culture news site pedestrian.tv, which not only ran with the pitch, but broke the embargo to get it out first. Thankfully they’re a funny bunch, and took it on the chin. This served as a lesson for media outlets around the country for the next few years. The media of old knew how to prank. Without the sharp minds of the internet ruining everything with one tweet, news outlets could get hours of mileage out of their April 1 exploits. ABC program This Day Tonight  ran a harmless yet humorous trick in 1975, when it made the declaration Australia would be converting to metric time. What’s metric time? According to the program, there would now be 100 seconds per minute, 100 minutes per hour, and 20-hour days. Seconds were now to be referred to as millidays, minutes centidays and hours decidays. Then deputy premier of South Australia Des Corcoran gave the report more weight by praising the new time system on the broadcast. It was topped off by rendered images of the Adelaide town hall displaying a metric time face. Boom-tish. Virgin Money Australia proved you don’t have to go all out to get a launch.  In 2005 it announced it was launching scratch ‘n’ sniff credit cards, which Australians could travel with overseas and rub a little nail on when they wanted to be reminded of home. The cards’ scent was barbecued sausages. Dick Smith cemented himself in Aussie lore in 1978 with his monumental prank. For weeks, he’d been advertising that he was going to tow an iceberg all the way from Antarctica into Sydney Harbour. Why? He’s an entrepreneur. He was going to park it next to the Opera House and chip off small wedges to passersby, selling them for 10 cents a piece. The ‘Dicksicles’ would improve the flavour of whatever beverage they were added to. And lo, April 1 sprung. There was Dick Smith towing his promised iceberg. The public went wild. The press were stirred into a frenzy. And then the heavens opened. The ‘Dickenberg 1’ began to melt and was revealed for what it really was: A layer of shaving cream and firefighting foam over a structure of plastic sheets. Dick Smith said afterwards he was pretty happy with the prank – it only cost him $1450 to pull off."

If you still haven’t found Obi, here’s a clue to what he normally looks like. So why on Earth is Obi among this cluster of fluff? Apparently he’s a big fan of hide-and-seek.

    "transcript": "Distilleries in Australia are converting their operations to produce much-needed hand sanitiser. Both Beenleigh Rum Distillery and Bundaberg Rum Distillery are using existing production lines and staff to make the hard-to-come-by liquid. Queensland Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning Cameron Dick thanked the distilleries for stepping into the breach to supply sanitiser to schools and frontline workers. Australian cricket great Shane Warne halted production of gin at the SevenZeroEight distillery that he co-owns to make medical-grade hand sanitiser for hospitals. “This is a challenging time for Australians and we all need to do what we can to help our healthcare system combat this disease and save lives,” Warne said on his Instagram page. Tasmanian gin distillery, Southern Wild, says it is ready to shift its entire business to a not-for profit producer of hand-sanitiser-for-schools if it gets the go ahead from the state government. Southern Wild owner George Burgess on Friday said the company was well positioned to begin making sanitiser immediately. The Bellarine Brewing Co in Victoria says it is ready and able to start producing hand sanitisers, and is hoping the Australian Taxation Office can fast track the required permit. Brewing Co director Tim Page-Walker told News Corp the move would allow the business to keep afloat, provide work for its local casual staff, and also assist the community so desperate to find hand sanitisers as supermarket shelves are stripped by selfish hoarders. The developments come as US distilleries have also switched to making the alcohol-based disinfectant. Pennsylvania’s Eight Oaks Farm Distillery filled its first 20 bottles on Monday, according to The Associated Press, sending the batch to charitable groups that get hand sanitiser due to the coronavirus pandemic. The family-owned distillery reportedly plans to dramatically boost production as it distributes the bottles to charities, offers them at farmers’ markets where it sells its alcohol, and via its website. “We are in a national emergency,” brewery founder Chad Butters, was quoted as saying by AP. “What’s the right thing to do? The right thing to do is support this community by providing something that is in desperate need. We’ll flood the valley with hand sanitiser and drive that price right down.” Green Mountain Distillers in Vermont is giving away a hand sanitising solution, while North Carolina’s Durham Distillery is donating a solution to hospitality colleagues. Patrons must bring their own containers. “We wanted to do something that would be as positive as possible,” said Harold Faircloth, an owner of Green Mountain Distillers."

    "transcript": "I am two days into solo self-isolation, and I am going out of my tiny little brain. I discovered last year I am an extrovert. My best friend – a psychologist – snorted when I told her I’d only just worked this out. I thrive on having a calendar chock full of social engagements where I can swill wine with my friends, throw my arms around them and speak utter dross for hours on end. I always, always feel connected. The pub is my spiritual home. So solo isolation is not working out well. I’m cooking meals for myself and I’ve discovered it’s hair-tearingly boring. Cooking is only fun when it’s shared: if you cook a good meal and another soul doesn’t get to appreciate it, did it actually happen? I guess that’s the question Instagram has been answering since it began. Even though it hasn’t been long since I started flying solo I’ve been oddly emotional. Obviously the constant stream of doomsday news isn’t helping. The internet – that singular tool for telling ourselves we’re connected – is only serving to add to the turmoil. Waves of sadness and emptiness and disconnection roll and crash throughout the interminably long days. But I pull myself out by reminding myself that this is (hopefully) temporary, and maybe this spell will be good for me. I might finally do some of the chores that have been on my to-do list for the past decade. Like get on that ancestry website and see if I have some wildly fascinating heritage. Or go online and do that thing where you try and find your missing superannuation. The only time I’m really allowing myself out of the house is taking walks around the park. Yesterday I saw a man in his 80s doing a slow shuffling jog and I instantly burst into tears. Standing next to the empty football fields I was overcome by the realisation that this sense of loneliness I’ve felt for all of five minutes is something so many in our ageing community experience on a daily basis. And it’s not just the elderly. There are young widows and bullied teens and people with crippling anxiety and folks working remotely who battle loneliness on a daily basis. Hell, you don’t have to be part of a certain subgroup. There was this guy who lived by himself in the building where I used to live in Sydney. Coming and going, he was always there, determined to grab me for a chat. And, of course, I’d avoid him – duck out a different way, keep my head down, sneak away – because I thought he was odd (and I was usually rushing off to hang with my gang). But now I think about how obviously lonely he was, how little he was asking for, and I feel absolutely gutted. Social isolation and loneliness are a huge problem in Australia. The impact it has on both mental and physical health is well documented. In fact, it’s been identified as a “significant public health and wellbeing” issue. Me @ the Group FaceTime party during quarantine  pic.twitter.com\/g8v2j47qEK — Z THE DOM⚡️ (@zharayasime) March 14, 2020 So a silver lining? Thankfully, in this unusual time, people are stepping up their game to check on one another. Group Skype calls are being organised. My mate organised a virtual disco where people could dance “together” in their loungerooms. People are baking banana muffins to drop on neighbour’s doorsteps (in this oddly resourceful time people are finally using those brown bananas in the back of the freezer … aren’t *they* having a moment?) lots of grim stuff out there but there's never been a better time to be a black banana in a freezer. black bananas in freezers are actually going to get USED in BAKING this month instead of thrown out in a year and it's their TIME to SHINE — Caitlin Welsh (@Caitlin_Welsh) March 17, 2020 All this is a beautiful thing. How heartening that when there’s a crisis, we step up. But what about when social isolation is no longer a hot topic? What about the people for whom loneliness is their everyday reality? My fear is we’ll just go back to business as usual. That period where we nearly gave ourselves an aneurism stifling a sneeze on a packed train and genuinely washed our hands (instead of just turning on the tap so people didn’t think we’re gross) will just become the stuff of nostalgic anecdotes. So I am making this deal with whichever deity is currently drunk at the wheel: on the other side of this whole thing, when physical distancing is a lonely memory, I’ll do regular volunteer work with The Red Cross companionship and social support program. “What’s that?” Glad you asked. Basically they pair you with someone in the community who is lonely and socially isolated. You visit for a cup of tea, go on an outing, chat on the phone, or go for a walk. It’s for older people who have few social connections, people with a disability, or people recovering from mental illness. I mean, look at the photo they use to illustrate the program. The stuffed toys in the cabinet. The joy on the face of the lady with the nice beaded necklace. Stick a fork in me, I’m done. I am not announcing this to make myself look like a top sort. I’m writing it here because it’s the kind of promise I’ll make in my head, and when the pub is open again I’ll dance off gaily into the sunshine and forget the deal I made. Writing it in public makes me accountable. I’ve had but the tiniest taste of loneliness, and the impact leaves me breathless. How lucky that when we come out the other side, most of us will have people to reconnect with. Not everybody is that lucky. And now, more than ever, that breaks my heart."

    "transcript": "US actor, Tom Hanks was harshly criticised by outraged Australians after he posted a photo of toast he’d thickly smothered in Vegemite. The good news is Australians have nothing else to worry about. “I was scrolling past tweets about some beer-based virus in search of something important,” said an extremely ordinary Australian. “When I saw Tom Hanks had smothered Vegemite onto a piece of toast, I panicked. I ran and bought 1000 jars of Vegemite to hide behind my wall of Ultra absorbent three-ply.” A Tom Hanks fan hiding in a milk crate said, “Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna catch.” PM Scott ‘Flushable Wipe’ Morrison has called the millions of Aussies hoarding toilet paper “un-Australian”. Their passports will be revoked. He called for people to selfishly hoard calmly. But Australians are easily scared, especially the ‘plucky larrikins’ and ‘true-blue Aussies’ who have raided supermarket shelves. The PM said, “Hoarding is not who we are as a people,” when clearly it is. He added, “I can’t be more blunt about it,” when clearly he can. The Reserve Bank has cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent. The Commonwealth Bank has matched it exactly with a cut of 0.7 per cent. “I saw what you did there,” said a customer. “No, you didn’t,” said a banker. A banking CEO who will remain priceless said, “We wash our hands of any wrongdoing, then we leave our customers high and dry.” “These are unprecedented times, and they call for unprecedented measures,” said Commonwealth Bank CEO Matt Comyn, between chuckles and snorts. The other banks have not cut their interest rates. This is not unprecedented. Governments of the world are trusting scientists to invent a cure for the coronavirus, but not a cure for climate change. A government spokesman said, “Scientists are evildoers bent on linking climate change to the things that cause climate change. But we’ll listen to them just this once.” A UN spokesman said, “Scientists are very un-UN.” A Sky News denial-denier pulled his head out of another Sky denier. “We need scientists to stop dishonestly claiming they have a plan to save the world, and get to work on a plan to save the world.” DESPITE HIS BEST EFFORTS, TRUMP FAILS TO DOMINATE HEADLINES CHEM-TRAIL THEORIST CLAIMS “CHEM-TRAILS MADE ME STUPID!” NEWSREADER APOLOGISES FOR BEING RATIONAL & CALM CITY OF ADELAIDE CLASSIFIED AS A NON-ESSENTIAL GATHERING ANTI-VAXXERS GO VERY, VERY QUIET"

    "transcript": "Going to the footy is off the agenda, pub crawls are on hold and your social calendar is swirling through the U-bend. But there are plenty of ways to kick loneliness to the curb during these wild times of social distancing. Businesses are using online meeting platforms to keep the country running, so why not use these to pump up your social life? Here ares our top tech hacks to inspire your next virtual group gathering. Re-creating a cinema experience with your friends is a tough one, but here’s where Netflix is stepping in. Netflix Party is a Google Chrome extension you add for free to your laptop or desktop computer. It allows you to choose a movie and watch it in sync with friends remotely. You can add a group chat so there’s plenty of opportunity to swoon over Ryan Reynolds in 6 Underground, laugh and cry with Taylor Swift doco Miss Americana or get old retro belly laughs with Ghostbusters. Cinemas are still open, but many film companies are starting to send new releases straight to streaming services, which means you can host your own ‘premieres’. There’s no better way to shake off global doom and gloom than by shaking your booty! First up, create a collaborative playlist with your friends using music streaming service Spotify. Share the playlist with your mates via a web link and everyone can add their own tunes. It’s a mixtape, baby! Next up, set the time and date and then hook up your dance buddies via Skype. It’s been around since the Spanish flu (OK, maybe not that long) but Skype never lets you down — unless you have relatives who say ‘I can hear you but I can’t see you’ a lot. Make sure everyone has an account, add them to the call and then hit the dial button. One of you can have the collaborative list playing through their laptop and everyone else can pump up the volume. Let’s get literary, people. Gather your read-a-holic friends and support small book retailers by ordering the same book online. Give yourselves time to read it, then gather around your devices for the Great Discussion. Zoom is a super-popular cloud-based meeting platform for corporate meetings, webinars and training — and it’s being appropriated for social gatherings too. You can join in a chat via desktop, laptop or smartphone (or big screen if you can airplay it to your telly) and have online chats with the group as well or private chats with some people on the call. The only limitation is a 40-minute window for free use, so make your meeting quick or schedule one after the other. The free version of the app allows unlimited meetings. What better time to be sampling the great wines on offer from around Australia (and delivered straight to your door) via well-established companies including Vino Mofo, Tipple, Jimmy Bring, Naked Wines and, of course, your local wine store. Gather your purchases, slice up some cheese and launch Facetime! Use the app for Group FaceTime sessions if you have iOS 12.1.4 on the iPhone 6s or later and for iPadOS on the iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, or iPad (5th generation) or later. Simply open the app and add up to 31 contacts, then start your call. However, the FaceTime app is only available for Apple cult members, so if your crew includes an Android user or two, switch to Facebook Messenger, which can now handle up to 50 guests at one time. Simply create a group of winos, er, friends who appreciate a good drop, then hit the video button. Messenger’s filters can add a whole new level of hilarity. If you have wifi it’s free, otherwise the vid chat may eat into your phone’s data. If your company has directed you to work from home, the ol’ 5pm pub gatherings on a Friday are a bit trickier to coordinate. Many corporations use Slack, the darling of communications apps on the market. Slack introduced video chats for its paid plans which means 15 or more people can jump in on a call once work is done and take turns in sharing their screens. The feature allows team members to draw on each other’s screens too — we’re thinking you could get pretty creative with party games!"

Last year, the canals were swarming with tourists and revellers for the famous Carnival, but on February 23, authorities cancelled the festival amid coronavirus concerns. Italy is the world’s worst-hit country after China, with 35,713 cases and a death toll of 2978 due to the global pandemic. Since the Italian government announced a lockdown earlier this month banning all non-essential travel, silence and clean air replaced the loud noise of tourists overcrowding the narrow alleys of the lagoon city and the pollution caused by powerful engines of motorboats used by residents and workers. Venice has been struggling with a high volume of tourism in recent years and recently banned large cruise ships from docking in the canals, in an attempt to preserve the city’s infrastructure. But since the drastic reduction of water traffic and tourism, residents have observed the usually muddy canals run with bright, clearer water with swarms of fishes and the canal bottom clearly visible. “There are no boats, there is no traffic. Definitely, it is cleaner,” Venice resident Serguei Michtchenko said. However, while it may look nicer, the city’s mayor’s office told CNN that the improved water visibility does not mean the water quality improved. “It’s because there is less boat traffic, [which] usually brings sediment to the top of the water’s surface,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CNN air quality in the city has improved due to the lockdown. Several decades have passed since Venetians were used to swimming in the lagoon water, due to the intensified ferryboats and motorboats traffic in the canals and the increasing volume of commercial and tourist ships stopping at the Venice Passenger Terminal. The coronavirus shutdown is the latest problem the unique lagoon city had to deal with after it was hit by its worst flooding in 50 years in November. –ABC"

Salerno Secondo giro.Forza Campania, Forza Italia!Direttamente da Salerno,dai balconi.. l'inno di Mameli..❤️ Posted by Meteo Campania on Thursday, March 12, 2020 It’s not dissimilar to Wuhan, back in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, when the locked-down occupants sung and danced to each other via videos on the internet. Alongside uplifting actions are tales of downright human compassion. Gone are the stories of shoppers brawling over diminishing groceries in supermarkets. Instead they’re being replaced with acts of kindness. People with surplus goods are actively seeking out those who haven’t been so fortunate, seeking to share their stock so others won’t go without. In one Melbourne neighbourhood, residents have begun waking to gifts left on their doorsteps. Alice Mitchell, whose work has ordered her to stay home, has begun trying to keep the strength of community spirit alive. As she and her family were staring down the barrel of potential self-isolation, Ms Mitchell was turning away from the anxiety-inducing media saturation and towards more traditional forms of entertainment. “I noticed I was gravitating toward board games and the like, to keep my mind occupied from the media overexposure,” Ms Mitchell told The New Daily. “I figured most others could benefit from a similar thing. “So I bought a bunch of puzzles which were inexpensive but might mean the difference between sanity or not.” Together with her two sons, they’ve begun leaving puzzles on their neighbours’ doorsteps at night – with a little note about “keeping sane during lockdown”. “When the climate seems to be every man for himself out in public, I just wanted to give a gesture to my immediate neighbourhood so that they know we’ve got their backs if they need it,” Ms Mitchell said. The reaction has been heartwarming. Neighbours have come a-knocking to chat and say thanks, with a renewed sense of optimism. On Wednesday morning, they woke to their own porch surprise: a thank you note, some chocolate and a “cheeky” roll of toilet paper. “Hopefully they’ll think to pass things down the line to help strengthen our communities – because we need each other more than ever now,” she said. “That human-to-human interaction builds each other up.” Have you seen a kind act during the coronavirus outbreak?

Like many public attractions, the US site has shut down to public visitors until at least the end of March. But that doesn’t mean everyone has gone home – the permanent residents (the animals) and their carers (aquarium staffers) are still hanging out around the clock. As the world shifts into a new mindset of working from home – and not going stir crazy in the process – the aquarium is coming up with some novel ways to entertain itself, and the outside world. This week,  Shedd’s penguins made like Ferris Bueller and had a day off from the Arctic, visiting the Amazon, south-east Asia, and even the reception desk.  Penguins in the Amazon?! 🐧🌴 Some of the penguins went on a field trip to meet other animals at Shedd. Wellington seemed most interested in the fishes in Amazon Rising!

    "transcript": "With the deadly coronavirus spreading ever-faster across the world – and closer to home in Australia – we’re surely all aware by now that washing our hands properly is one of the best ways to avoid contracting it. That means with soap and water for 20 seconds – or, according to Britain’s National Health Service, as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice to yourself. Health authorities in Australia and internationally agree that washing hands, often, with soap and water is one of the best ways to avoid spreading – or catching – infections such as COVID-19. But, now that we’re months into the global outbreak, Happy Birthday might be getting a little old for many diligent hand-washers. That’s where Wash Your Lyrics comes in. The work of a creative – and hygienically minded – teenage British developer, it pairs the lyrics to a song of your choice with instructions on how to wash your hands properly. The developer, who says he is 17 and is known only as William, says he came up with the Wash Your Lyrics website in less than 24 hours. In its first day online, he had more than 120,000 user requests and more than two million server requests – with that number growing rapidly through Wednesday (Australian time). “Thanks to everyone who has used the site so far,” William posted. “Also sorry for the downtime, [I] didn’t expect the traffic the site received.” William’s site is simple but effective. Users enter their choice of song name and author and it automatically pulls the lyrics from Genius (the world’s biggest collection of lyrics) and puts them, line-by-line, over an infographic from the NHS. Elsewhere, as hand-washing gains ever more prominence, a how-to guide produced by Vietnam’s Health Minister has also been a viral hit. It uses an upbeat song described by comedian John Oliver as a “genuine club banger” – and the original video has 9.4 million views on YouTube. The English-subtitled version has 1.2 million. It’s called Ghen Cô Vy – a play on words implying the coronavirus is like a jealous troublemaker trying to come between a couple – and it has also inspired a dance challenge on social media app TikTok. The kitschy animation includes demonstrations of hand-washing, warnings about face masks and public gatherings, and a gloved hand flicking away an angry-looking green coronavirus particle. In the Philippines, the Department of Health released a video on TikTok highlighting protective measures against COVID-19, with instructions like “stahhhp, don’t touch your face” and “follow cough etiquette”.

    "transcript": "Cane toads have been a big problem in far-north New South Wales for decades, but the recent bushfires are making matters worse as cleared, charred land makes it easier for the pests to move into new territory. The village of Rappville, south of Casino, was hit by a firestorm in October that destroyed 15 homes, and is in the buffer area of the newly formed cane toad biosecurity zone. Tamar Cohen, of the Border Ranges Richmond Valley Landcare Network, said the community needed to work together to eradicate the feral amphibians that could travel as far as a kilometre in one night. “Burnt land makes it easier for toads to travel as they’re basically lazy,” she said. “When a bushfire comes through and it clears out a lot of the undergrowth and logs, we’re finding that cane toads can move much quicker through those landscapes. “So the concern with Rappville, as with other towns impacted by the bushfires, is that cane toads can now move in much easier than before.” Ms Cohen said the toads picked easy pathways, such as roads and mowed lawns, but found it difficult to move through natural vegetation because they were not good jumpers. Ms Cohen said cane toads had been found on properties near the Richmond Range National Park. This was causing concern because the national park was one of the few remaining forests in the area that had not been destroyed by the fires and was home to threatened species that were vulnerable to cane toads. “We’ve got native frogs and small reptiles that are already struggling to survive, so we don’t want them killed by the poisonous cane toads,” she said. “The first thing property owners see with cane toad invasions is dead red-belly black snakes, dead pythons and dead freshwater turtle species.” A special Rappville team has been established to control the pests and Sydney dog trainer Steve Austin has been using his English springer spaniels, Tommy and Becky, along with cocker spaniel Emma, to help hunt them out. “The dogs have a high degree of hunting ability,” Mr Austin said. “They can find the toads by scent and stand and point with their nose to alert me they are there. “All three dogs are conservation dogs, which means they have been trained in a passive response. “They stop and stare at their catch, but do not hurt it.” Like many Rappville locals, Cathy Cook is upset many native species were lost in the bushfires. She believed any remaining species must be protected. “Everyone is spewing about losing the natives but when the first lot of rain came, the first thing you heard was a bloody cane toad,” Ms Cook said. “There were millions of cane toad eggs in our dam and that was two weeks between the rain – so I was armed with my butterfly net to get them.” Ms Cook was concerned the toads would also move into Bungawalbin and Whiporie. “We’ve built our place for native birds and we have a lot of native flowers and trees,” she said. “We also look after our dams for the native frogs to live in. “I love hearing the native frogs croaking away in summer and then you hear ‘brrrr’ start up amongst it all, and it’s like ‘You weren’t invited, toads, so go away’.”"

    "transcript": "This is what 12 years’ worth of toilet paper looks like. Toowoomba’s Janetzki family have thousands of rolls of Australia’s most sought-after product, after mistakenly ordering 48 boxes of 48 rolls instead of their usual box of 48 rolls from online delivery service Who Gives A Crap. They received 2304 rolls and were charged $3264 instead of $68, something that went unnoticed until the two-pallet order showed up on their doorstep days later. The family estimate it is enough to last them 12 years. The accidental hoarders made the purchase in early February, weeks before fears relating to coronavirus sent the country into a toilet paper-buying frenzy. Now, they’ve got more toilet paper than most supermarkets have on the shelves. “It’ll take a while to live down,” said Haidee Janetzki, who placed the order. “We’ve told our three daughters that if we’ve still got all this toilet paper when they get married this is what they’ll have as their wedding decorations.” The Janetzkis have been ordering one box of 48 rolls every 12 weeks for the past two years. After Christmas, they decided to change product and set up a new subscription. “It asked for the quantity and I wrote 48 thinking I want a box with 48 rolls in it,” Ms Janetzki said. “A couple of days later, I got an email saying the order was on the way, and that was all good. “On a Monday there was a knock at the door at it was the courier. He said, ‘I’ve got two pallets of toilet paper for you.’ “We checked the credit card statement to try to figure out what’d gone wrong and turned out I’d ordered 48 boxes, so it was legitimately my mistake.” Ms Janetzki said she had paid off her credit card the day prior to being charged, and only checks her statement once a fortnight. “So I didn’t notice there was a large amount on the card and it didn’t max it out,” she said. Husband Chris Janetzki said he could not quite believe the size of their order. “At the time I thought, ‘Holy crap,'” he said. Little did they, or anyone, know that weeks later a toilet paper shortage would make national headlines. Both Woolworths and Coles have limited the amount of toilet paper rolls customers can buy. Toilet paper manufacturers have also ramped up production to meet demand. “I couldn’t believe that people have been mass-buying toilet paper like that. I still don’t understand why they’re doing it,” Mr Janetzki said. “I’m a pastor of a church and so a friend said, ‘How prophetic are you to be able to see the future and know there was going to be a toilet paper shortage?’ “We’re going to get a laugh out of it for a while.” Unable to contact the online-only company via phone, the Janetzkis had no choice but to accept the delivery. The Janetzkis eventually sent off an urgent email about their unusual purchase and the company responded with an offer to take back the unwanted boxes. But by that time, the family had come up with a cunning plan. The family is now selling their excess toilet paper to help raise money for their daughter’s school. Ms Janetzki said she jokingly offered up the toilet paper as a fundraising initiative for the school’s trip to Sydney and Canberra later this year. Days later it was a go. “Lots of people we know offered to buy them off us,” she said. “We’re getting lots of jokes though now. Every other order form I’ve put in for other fundraisers people have said, ‘Just check the quantity, make sure she’s ordering just one, pie not one box of pies.'” WGAC has also refunded $400 in postage for the boxes, which the Janetzkis have put towards their daughter’s trip. “It really has worked out for the best for us in the end,” Ms Janetzki said. While they wait for stock to sell out, the family have been having fun with it – building a wall in their garage, and then a throne in their lounge room. A spokeswoman for WGAC confirmed the Janetzkis’ story. “Haidee and Chris were so patient about this situation. I can’t even imagine what it would have been like to have a whole pallet of toilet paper turn up at my front door,” the spokeswoman said. “I can imagine there’d be some folks around Australia this week who wouldn’t mind it right about now.” The spokeswoman said the company was unable to check all orders manually. “When we were a smaller business, we’d run manual checks twice a day on all the orders we received and a mistake like this would usually jump out during that process,” the spokeswoman said. “Then we’d reach out to the customer before sending the order to the warehouse to make sure it was correct before shipping. “But as the business has grown up, we’ve had to automate how we process orders.”"

    "transcript": "After a three-year wait, the community of Wilcannia in far-western New South Wales is celebrating substantial Darling (Baaka) River flows. Locals had lobbied authorities to prioritise culture and the environment over agriculture as the river struggled through drought and claims of over extraction. Now, thanks to flooding rain in northern NSW and Queensland and soaking rain locally, the dry riverbed is full again. The town is the heartland of the Barkindji people whose culture revolves around the river, traditionally known as the Baaka. Barkindji elder Cyril Hunter said a full river would transform the local community. “It’s been a long wait,” he said. “We’ll be camping on the river, people will be taking their kids and going fishing. “It means a lot, it’s like bloody treasure coming down for us.”  Timelapse Baaka arrives in Wilcannia Three years in the waiting and the Darling (Baaka) is flowing through Wilcannia once again! 🌊💙💚🤎🌊 Posted by ABC Broken Hill on Thursday, March 5, 2020 Such was the excitement among local children that teachers brought them to see the water arrive on their lunch break on Friday. Teacher Sarah Donnelly said the positive impact of water in the river on students was undeniable. “You can feel the energy and the positivity around town; you can feel it at the school,” she said. “We’re doing a lot more learning on country at school and we’re so excited that we can be doing more of our lessons, in all of our key learning areas, down by the river more.” Many residents have relied on drinking water donations for almost a year, preferring to avoid drinking often-unpalatable bore water that was switched on after the river dried up. The local council expects current flows could mean the town supply is secure for at least 12 months. Long before millions of fish died in the river downstream at Menindee, the community held regular rallies at the town demanding state and federal governments prioritise water for cultural and environmental purposes. Mr Hunter said while the flows were welcome, the Barkindji people would continue to demand the government change how it prioritises water needs in the Murray-Darling system. “They’re selling us out. This is our bloodline running through here today,” he said.own; you can feel it at the school,” she said. “We’re doing a lot more learning on country at school and we’re so excited that we can be doing more of our lessons, in all of our key learning areas, down by the river more.”"

    "transcript": "Former Diamond Princess passengers Mytran and Kenneth Donnelly headed home to Sydney on Thursday after spending 32 days in isolation. The couple spent 18 days in lockdown on board the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess, and another 14 in a mining camp near Darwin. In total, it had been 45 days since they left NSW. Mrs Donnelly said the hardest part of the quarantine was missing the birth of their first grandson. “We’re home free, finally,” she said. The Diamond Princess captain let the Donnellys access the internet so they could see a video of the newest addition to their family shortly after he was born, and gave them a teddy bear for their grandson. “We’ll just be glad to go home and see the children,” Mr Donnelly said. “Looking forward to getting back to normal. I haven’t driven a car for 45 days.” The couple were also looking forward to taking off their face masks, which they said made Darwin’s humid temperatures feel hotter. Mr and Mrs Donnelly had nothing but praise for the staff on the cruise ship and at the Manigurr-ma residential village in Howard Springs. But they said they felt the federal government could have done more to bring Australians home sooner. Mr and Mrs Donnelly are two of about 150 Australians heading home today after a fortnight in quarantine in Howard Springs. Altogether, 45 people were tested at the camp. Eight of them tested positive for coronavirus. Those who tested positive in the centre were medically transferred to their home states, and one man later died in Perth. Australian Border Force Commander Colin Drysdale said guests were happy to be heading home, and praised the mission as a success. “There were almost 50,000 meals prepared, and nearly 1000 maintenance requests finalised,” he said. “There’s been, on average, 190 staff supporting the efforts on a daily basis here. “This is a day of joy for them as well.” Australian Medical Assistance Teams mission leader Abi Trewin said it was great to be able to see passengers and staff sit together without masks. “We’re very proud to see everyone leave today happy and healthy,” she said."

    "transcript": "A woman screaming at police, a prime minister showing compassion and the Pope visiting Thailand. These are the some of the award-winning images that encapsulated 2019. After analysing hundreds of images taken across the Asia Pacific, judges have announced the top photographs that defined a moment or a movement last year. Cassie Trotter, Getty Images’ head of editorial in the Asia-Pacific, said judges would usually look for two main skills when assessing an entry: ability and creativity. “It’s a really tough competition,” Ms Trotter told The New Daily. “Can the photographer work with long lens? Short lens? How do they work with the light, with the subject? We like to reward a different eye.” The Best News Picture of the Year was awarded to Laurel Chor for her image of a woman screaming at police officers in Hong Kong during the pro-democracy protests. The political and social unrest in Hong Kong was the “biggest sustained story” of 2019, Ms Trotter said. “That image of a woman screaming at police … that image encapsulated it. “It gives you the feeling that the people aren’t happy.” In second place for Best News Picture of the Year was a photograph of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern embracing a Muslim worshipper after a right-wing extremist opened fire and killed more than 50 mosque-goers in Christchurch. Ms Trotter said the image, captured by Wellington-based photographer Hagen Hopkins outside Kilbirnie mosque, was a “stand-out” in the eyes of the judges. “Capturing something like that is an art,” she said. “He didn’t have time to go, ‘Is the background perfect?’ Instead he thought ‘I’m going to get down lower, I’m going to get to the level of the people, trying not to disturb… I need to be here for this, I want this to capture what I’m feeling’.” The powerful image has been painted on a silo in Brunswick in inner-city Melbourne. The third Best News Photograph of the Year was awarded to American journalist Paula Bronstein for her image of Pope Francis visiting young Catholics in Thailand. “This photograph demonstrates access and years of experience,” Ms Trotter said. “Knowing the Pope is coming, you could stand in front, or shoot from the side, but this photographer thought, ‘I could get above and shoot from an angle’. “There’s just something about it, the hands reaching in, and the shape it creates.” Other award-winning photographs include an image of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam, a woman wearing an Australian-themed hat at Oaks Day in Melbourne, and Nick Allbrook of the band Pond performing at the Splendour in the Grass music festival."

    "transcript": "The family of a Murri boy will donate more than $600,000 to local charities after declining a crowdfunding trip to Disneyland. Young Quaden Bayles, 9, who was born with Achondroplasia, the most common form of Dwarfism, was visibly distressed in a Facebook video his mother posted last week after he had been bullied earlier that day. In it, he was in tears and wanted to kill himself: “Give me a knife—I want to kill myself”, he said. His mother Yarraka decided to share the video to show what her son had endured since he was three years old. American comedian Brad Williams, who also is a dwarf, set up a GoFundMe page on February 21, attracting almost $720,000 from 20,000 global donations for a trip to Disneyland. He wrote: “The bullying was so severe … I’m setting up this GoFundMe to let Quaden know that bullying will not be tolerated, and that he is a wonderful human being who deserves joy. I want to fly Quaden and his mother to America, get them a nice hotel, and bring them to Disneyland”. However, Quaden’s Aunty Mundanara Bayles told NITV News that “while it’s a touching example of goodwill, the family will skip the all-expenses paid trip as they want to focus on the bigger issues at play”. “What kid wouldn’t want to go to Disneyland, especially if you have lived Quaden’s life. To escape to anywhere that is fun that doesn’t remind him of his day to day challenges,” she said. “But my sister said ‘you know what, let’s get back to the real issue’. This little fella has been bullied. How many suicides, black or white, in our society have happened due to bullying.” “We want the money to go to community organisations that really need it. They know what the money should be spent on, So as much as we want to go to Disneyland, I think our community would far off benefit from that.” “We need to come together and work out how to make sure young people like Quaden don’t have to deal with what they have been dealing with,” Ms Bayles said. “We’ve had seven kids at the Murri School in Brisbane, where I am on the board, take their lives in the last ten years,” she told NITV News. Mr Williams announced on Friday that about $100,000 will be donated to six local charities with the remainder going towards “a fund for future medical and support expenses for Quaden”. The charities Born This Way Foundation, STOMP Out Bullying, Dolly’s Dream, Dwarfism Awareness Australia, Gallang Place and Balunu Healing Foundation are the likely recipients. The rest of the crowdfunding will go towards direct medical help, education, accommodation costs, food to feed the family, and for donating to any additional charities of their choosing. “I have been in close communication with Quaden’s family and fully respect their needs and the needs of Australian First Nations people who are experiencing bullying and discrimination at extremely high rates. “Because of this, I’ve decided that the donations will be best served going to charities focused on helping individuals affected by bullying and discrimination,” he wrote.  Meanwhile, Yarraka Bayles is pushing for a new law called Quaden’s Law to be introduced into state and national school curriculums. “We discussed a care plan for Quaden if\/when he chooses to return to school, or when we feel the time is right. We are working with the school to introduce an educational tools for schools package around disability awareness, diversity and inclusion,” she told NITV. “It went okay … They were all very supportive in helping to move forward.” Since Quaden’s story, he has gone from despair to “high spirits” as the family continued to just get on with their lives, according to Ms Bayles. “It’s a bit overwhelming but we are doing good considering. It’s pretty full on but we are strong enough to get through especially with all the mobs support and unconditional love,” she told NITV News. “Quaden is ok. He is spinning out a bit, we just have to protect our boy as best we can. We’ve got a good team around us now.” His Aunty said: “He’s just an amazing kid that’s larger than life.” -with agencies"

    "transcript": "A baboon that was on his way to a vasectomy when he and his two female companions escaped a Sydney hospital has had the big snip – and a mention in the Senate. The 15-year-old male baboon and his two female “troops” escaped on Tuesday night after a lock failed on the truck or crate transporting them at a Royal Prince Alfred Hospital research facility in Camperdown. The trio then caused widespread concern among passers-by as they ran a car park on RPA hospital grounds until Taroonga Zoo staff and police could capture and sedate them. It was later revealed the three primates had come from the Sydney Local Health District facility in Wallacia, about 50 kilometres away from the RPA Hospital. They are part of a colony bred by the lab for “important biomedical research” into diabetes, kidney disease and complications arising from pregnancy. The baboons’ plight drew attention in Canberra on Thursday, with the Senate approving a motion supporting a call for the federal government to invest in research methods that did not need animals. “The baboons motion passed,” Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi tweeted. “The Senate has voted to wish the Sydney baboons well and called on the Government to invest in the methods and technology needed to end the use of animals for research purposes.” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard had said earlier the male baboon was being transported to the hospital on Tuesday for a vasectomy. His two female companions had accompanied him for support. On Thursday, Mr Hazzard confirmed the vasectomy had gone ahead. “Baboon ‘Houdini’ update: vasectomy has been completed this morning as planned. Procedure went well. He is now sleeping\/resting. His two female family members are relaxed and happy,” he said in a tweet.  Mr Hazzard has rubbished claims the animals were being used for research into human-baboon hybrid organs to address the transplant crisis. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "Three baboons that escaped a Sydney hospital and “had a bit of a look around the grounds” were being transported from a baboon colony and had been purpose-bred for medical research. Police were called to a car park near Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown about 5.30pm on Tuesday after the baboons made their bid for freedom, a NSW Police spokeswoman said. They broke out when the lock on the truck they were in failed — bemused onlookers filming the primates as they roamed the hospital grounds and car park on Missenden Road and Lucas Street as police and staff from Taronga Zoo tried to catch them. The baboons were contained by police and medical experts before zoo handlers tranquillised them. THEY'RE TAKING OVER!!! #BaboonWatch #baboons2020 (vid Michael Tran) pic.twitter.com\/aVbmJhQjV3 — Dougal Wallace📺 (@DougalWallace) February 25, 2020 NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the 15-year-old male baboon had been taken to the hospital for a vasectomy. Two female baboons were there to “keep him calm”. “The three baboons decided to take a bit of a look around RPA grounds,” he said on Tuesday. “They didn’t know what to do, nor did the people around them.” A witness has captured the moment three baboons escaped from a facility near a Sydney hospital as shocked onlookers watched on. #baboonwatch pic.twitter.com\/3INAIKKRc2 — Sandra Sully (@Sandra_Sully) February 25, 2020 Mr Hazzard insisted the baboons were not being transported for research purposes. “It had been decided the male needed to have a vasectomy to continue to move with his female troop and not keep producing babies,” he said. “If he had been kept fertile, he would have had to be removed from the family he knows.” The Health Minister said the baboons should be awake and well within a few hours. It was later revealed they were from the National Health and Medical Research Council facility in Wallacia, about 50 kilometres away in Western Sydney. According to Humane Research Australia, there were 272 primates used in medical research in the country in 2017. Of those, 165 were in NSW. Research at the lab has been used to tackle priority medical issues identified by the federal government, including diabetes, kidney disease and complications arising from pregnancy. Professor Annemarie Hennessy, a senior adviser at the facility, said the animals lived in an environment that resembled their natural habitat. “They would have been completely terrified outside their comfort zone in a world they don’t understand,” she said of their escape on Tuesday. She said the facility had used baboons in “important biomedical research” in Australia for at least 30 years – justified only when there was “no alternative”. Mr Hazzard said the baboons were part of research programs that covered a whole range of health issues. When the program has finished with them, they are returned to their colony. NSW Police had earlier said there was no immediate danger to the public but people were advised to avoid the area. Footage shared on social media showed three baboons running in the car park as people took surprised double-takes. Animal activist and former GP Kevin Coleman said the primates’ escape was a “major concern” that could raise biosecurity issues. “If an animal the size of a baboon can escape, how many mice have escaped? How many other animals have escaped,” he asked. “We just don’t know and this is the problem. We have to have transparency on these issues.” NSW Animal Justice Party MP Emma Hurst said the baboons were “medical experimentation survivors” who were trying to flee “further painful procedures forced upon their bodies”. “These are the hidden faces behind animal experimentation in this country,” she said. The three primates were returned to the Wallacia facility late on Tuesday, and the male has had his vasectomy postponed. Baboons are known to be violent if threatened, but Mr Hazzard said the animals had “behaved impeccably”. An investigation has been launched into why the truck’s lock broke. The Sydney Save Animals in Laboratories spokesman said he thought experts were doing research into human-baboon hybrid organs to address the transplant crisis. Mr Hazzard dismissed these claims. “It’s rubbish … These baboons were simply there for the old vasectomy,” he said. -with AAP"

As her mother became distressed, three men jumped off the platform and began looking for the girl under the carriages. As other commuters tried to comfort her, the mother was told the toddler had been found near the front of the train. “It’s OK, they’ve got her,” one passenger was heard saying in a video posted online. The young man who found the girl was then filmed handing her over to her mother, reassuring her “she’s fine, she’s fine”. A Sydney Trains employee then thanked the man and shook his hand. The mother said it was the first time her daughter had been on a train and it “might be the last for a while”. “She freaked out and tried to fling herself back off the train,” the mother was heard saying in the video. Joseph Mourtada, 36, filmed the moment the mother and daughter were reunited, and said he was relieved there were no injuries. Mr Mourtada was walking up the stairs to the platform when he saw the commotion and the distressed mother “shaking”. “She was screaming that her girl was under the train,” he said. “I hear all of this noise and people asking the guards to stop. It was already stopped. “Everything happened very quickly.”"

    "transcript": "A rare bird normally found in the central Pacific, which lost its way and ended up on a pub balcony in Sydney, has been released back into its natural habitat. In the first officially recorded appearance of a live Bulwer’s petrel in Australia, the bird – nicknamed Buggerlugs – is thought to have been blown south by adverse weather. He might even be an undiscovered species. He was found on the balcony of the Cronulla RSL, and later dug in his claws when two attempts were made by well-meaning wildlife carers to release him onto the chilly waters off Sydney. Ornithologist Lindsay Smith from the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association in Wollongong said Buggerlugs was a long way from home. “He didn’t have ID so couldn’t get a drink,” he said of the appearance at the RSL. When Buggerlugs was identified as a Bulwer’s petrel, the international birding community became excited. “To release Buggerlugs here off Wollongong would be like releasing it in the desert,” Mr Smith said. Instead, Buggerlugs was fattened up with southern bluefin tuna (at $130 per kilo), wombaroo, insectivore mix and sea water. Money was raised and tickets booked to take Buggerlugs to Darwin on a scheduled commercial flight. He was checked into the luggage compartment like any other pet, and was in the Larrakia Nation Rangers’ boat Mardma within an hour of arriving in Darwin on February 14. Rangers battled an outgoing tide of only two metres and unpredictable wet-season winds to get Buggerlugs back into a hospitable environment as quickly as possible. Larrakia Nation Land and Sea ranger Javadd Andersen said it was anything but hospitable for humans. “It was very rough and we had a lot of swell coming over,” he said. “We couldn’t head out too far because we had a bit of water coming over the front deck and we decided not to push ourselves too far.” Damien Stanioch from NT Parks and Wildlife was also on board. “The conditions were ideal for the bird – a good strong headwind and fairly choppy, so he could use the wind to gain lift,” he told the ABC. “Lindsay gave him the final check to make sure he was still bright-eyed. “We simply held him in the hand and as soon as that offshore wind hit him in the face he just started flapping. “It was one of those now-or-never moments. “Lindsay opened his hand and he flew off beautifully – nice and strong into the wind. “He went off down toward the water and used that air pressure from the water and just beautifully followed the waterline until he disappeared over the water and then reappeared over the swell. “It was just so good to see.” The team waited for 20 minutes before heading for home once they were confident Buggerlugs was safe. “Because he was housebound for a week or so, we weren’t sure how his flight patterns would be,” Mr Stanioch said. “We were all very, very nervous.” Mr Anderson said: “I hope the bird survives and lives a long and healthy life. It flew off pretty strong, so I hope it flies off in the right direction.” The Bulwer’s petrel is typically found in the latitudes between 10 degrees south and 40 degrees north. By comparison, Cronulla RSL is close to 34 degrees south. The Bulwer’s petrel has also been found in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Blood samples have been taken for DNA testing."

The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, was overjoyed on Monday after he learned he had won $2.5 million in Saturday’s Lotto Superdraw. “I had absolutely no idea,” he said. “I’ve dreamt about winning the lottery before and calling my family to tell them and now I can do that.” The timely win comes just weeks after fires tore through the South Coast town in early January. Nearly 200 homes were destroyed in the region, leaving hundreds of devastated locals trapped on beaches up and down the coast. “We didn’t personally lose our home but homes around us were destroyed and we were evacuated to the beach,” the man said. “The town was black and red. It was frightening.” It’s not the first turn of good fortune following this summer’s horrific bushfires. Earlier in 2020, a man who lost his uninsured house to fires in northern NSW snagged a $1 million lottery prize. The Lott spokeswoman Lauren Cooney said that winner was grateful for the opportunity to rebuild his home. “All that was left of the home was a few charred teacups,” he said at the time. “We didn’t know if we would ever be able to rebuild but now we definitely can.”"

She is suffering from exposure, and was taken to Robina Hospital. The 26-year-old university student was reported missing on Wednesday morning by a man she had been walking with near Gorge Falls in the Tallebudgera Valley. He told police he lost sight of her. It is unclear whether she got lost, fell or walked out of bushland to nearby roads. A search party of up to 30 people had been looking for Ms Chen, with paramedics saying she looked like she’d been through “quite a trauma”. She had lost her shoes, but was able to walk to an ambulance on Monday after being given a pair of socks by a police officer. Several creeks in the area were flooded when Ms Chen vanished. Efforts to find her were also hampered by ongoing rain – with the area drenched by more than 141 millimetres of rain in 24 hours at one point. The floods did claim one life – that of a 75-year-old man who had been kayaking on the swollen Mary River in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. He was found dead on Thursday. There were also numerous rescues during the days of rain that swept across south-east Queensland last week. Among them was a Gold Coast mother who rescued her primary-school aged son when he was swept from a footpath into a rising river on Wednesday afternoon. -with AAP"

The artwork, which echoes Banksy’s signature style, shows a young girl  firing a slingshot of flowers. The flowers are real ivy, a spray-painted vibrant red and appearing to explode across the wall. It was found on the exterior wall of a house in Bristol on Thursday (British time). The famously shy artist was credited with the work almost as soon as it was discovered – although he was somewhat slower to take the credit for it.  A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on Feb 13, 2020 at 4:02pm PST  Property owner Kelly Woodruff said she was “over the moon” with the work. “When we realised it was on one of our properties we were so happy as we have always loved Banksy’s art,” she told the BBC. “I’ve been here all day, chatting to all the people coming to see it.” Ms Woodruff said she had been hoping Banksy would confirm the work was actually his. It was covered in a protective plastic screen even before the artist made his Instagram post. “We need to protect it as soon as possible,” she said. Ms Woodruff is not the only one overjoyed about the sweet artwork. The Bristol Somali Community Association tweeted about the painting soon after it was spotted. “We hope it’s Banksy’s work,” co-founder Saed Ali wrote. “Come and have a look yourself. Whoever painted, it’s worth admiring their creativity.” But now that Banksy has acknowledge the Valentine’s Day artwork, security might become a problem. According to website Artnet, more than 20,000 visitors in three weeks flocked to see a Banksy work in the Welsh town of Port Talbot in 2019 – prompting the owner to invest in fencing and guards. Eventually, overwhelmed with his newfound responsibility, he sold the work to a Banksy collector. -with agencies"

Spiders that are donated to the anti-venon program help to save up to 300 lives a year. Since the program started in 1981, there have been no funnel-related deaths in Australia. The Australian Reptile Park is the only facility in Australia that milks funnel-web spiders. Dwayne (the spider) was handed in from the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle, which is one of the program’s drop-off points. The zoo’s keepers would like to know more about where he came from – in the hopes of finding more like him. “He is unusually large and more spiders like him will only result in more lives being saved due to the huge amount of venom they can produce,” park director Liz Gabriel told News Ltd. Captured spiders can be taken directly to the zoo, or to drop-off zones in Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle. All of those places have safety kits to house the spiders until park staff can retrieve them."

Grumpy puss Perdita, who was dubbed the “world’s worst cat” by a desperate Mitchell County Animal Rescue organisation in North Carolina just over a week ago, is settling in with her new owners in Tennessee. “They adore her and she tolerates them,” the shelter said in a Facebook post on Monday (local time). The animal rescue’s plea for someone – anyone – to take Perdita off its hands went viral in late January. That’s when Joe and Betty from Tennessee stepped in, although the adoption process didn’t got all that smoothly. “She wouldn’t let us take adoption photos in our photo booth, she just growled and ran out of the room,” the shelter wrote. “She was in a hurry to get home, where she will have her own private bedroom.”  Today is a bittersweet day. Perdita has brought so much joy to the staff here at MCAR. We have loved getting to know her… Posted by Mitchell County Animal Rescue, Inc-North Carolina on Saturday, February 1, 2020 Perdita has since been renamed Noel – “just in case the name Perdita is the cause of her anger”. Shelter director Amber Lowery had earlier told the local newspaper that four-year-old Perdita quickly earned a reputation for being less than friendly after she was dropped off on Christmas Eve. “The minute you try to rub her, she slaps you. We thought she was in pain and took her to the vet and he said: ‘No, this cat is just a jerk’,” Ms Lowery said. In is plea for a new home for Perdita\/Noel, the shelter said the black and white moggie’s dislikes included “dogs, children, the Dixie Chicks, Disney movies, Christmas and last but NOT least … HUGS.” She liked lurking, pretending to be sick and “staring into your soul until you feel as if you may never be cheerful again”. However, lucky Noel went home to Tennessee with some loving words from the shelter: “We have loved getting to know her and watching her come out of her slappy shell,” it wrote. “May the catnip be plentiful, the music classical, the bed always fluffy and the journey smooth.”"

The phenomenon had been observed previously in south Florida, he said. “At about [10 degrees Celsius], iguanas can become lethargic,” Mr Michaels said. “It’s when the temperature drops to about [4 degrees] or lower that their blood doesn’t move around as quickly. As a result, they can stiffen up and fall out of the trees they frequent.” During a similar cold snap in January 2018, well-meaning residents who found stiffened iguanas were advised to leave them alone, as they can feel threatened and bite once they warm up. “Don’t assume that they’re dead,” said Kristen Sommers, who oversees the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s non-native fish and wildlife program. Green iguanas are considered an invasive species in Florida. They eat through gardens and dig burrows that undermine infrastructure."

Barber’s online rally has raised more than $33 million from 826,916 donations by Sunday afternoon for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service in three days. The former All Saints star and sketch writer has mobilised many of her 6.4 million Instagram followers that frequently log on to watch her dorky imitations of glamour behaviour. Barber drew pledges from as far as the UK, US, France and Italy. This is my Mother in Law Joy Robin. She’s on the wharf in Eden.

The comedian posted photos on Friday of a fire-red sky bearing down on her mother-in-law’s NSW house. “It’s terrifying. They are scared. They need your help,” she wrote on Facebook. On Saturday, she reported her family was being evacuated: “I feel sick.” She posted photographs of the house on her Facebook page, where the plea for donation is being made. By Friday morning, a million dollars didn’t seem out of the question. Since then her target has grown by the hour. By Saturday evening, she was closing on $8 million, prompting Barber to set a new target of $9 million. The NSW Rural Fire Service and Brigades Donations Fund is used to buy equipment for use by NSW Rural Fire Brigades across the state. Other celebrities to have pledged donations include Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban ($500,000), Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen DeGeneres, Pink and Hugh Jackman. Donations to the NSW Rural Fire Service directly benefit the volunteer firefighters on the frontline. You can contact your local brigade directly to help or donate here. For bank transfers, there is a dedicated bank account (Account Name: NSW Rural Fire Service, BSB: 032-001, Account No: 171051). This account is for the RFS as a whole. The Country Fire Authority in Victoria has two funds. Donations to a specific brigade can be made through CFA Brigades Donations Fund via this bank account: BSB: 063 225 Account: 1022 0603, with the name of the brigade to be included in the Reference section. For the Country Fire Authority Public Fund, for general donations, access this account: BSB: 063 225 Account: 1022 2326 In Queensland, Fire and Rescue suggests donations of money and items be channelled through the website service givit.org.au. Givit is handy because it lists items that are needed, and not just in Queensland but in other states. It’s vital that well-meaning people don’t turn up with goods, as they might hamper emergency work. In South Australia, donations to the Country Fire Service can be made here through the CFS Foundation. To help people who have lost their homes or been displaced, the Red Cross established a New Years Eve disaster relief and recovery fund. Charities such as the Salvation Army and the St Vincent de Paul have a good history of helping people affected by natural disasters. The World Wildlife Fund is raising money to treat and house wildlife injured in the fires, notably koalas."

    "transcript": "Not only did the stories below not make headlines this year but some of the Australians involved would much prefer to keep them a secret. Why then are we giving you the low-down on what happened? When everyday people were asked to share their most generous act of 2019, it seemed help usually came from those who could do with the help themselves. Imagine this: A young mum pushing a pram that’s carrying her one-year-old son arrives at your doorstep. She just got kicked out of home and only has the clothes on her back. She is also a drug addict. Before you ask yourself: What would I do? Consider this. Your youngest daughter has a genetic disorder and you’re her full-time carer. You also have interim custody of your youngest granddaughter and are going for custody of your second youngest grandson. Instead of slamming her door shut, Kerie (surname withheld) welcomed Jessica (name changed) in. “I was married to an alcoholic and he was also into drugs. He drugged me while I was pregnant with our first child,” Kerie told The New Daily. She kept Jessica company while her son raided their pantry for “whatever she needed”, filling two shopping bags to the brim. The 52-year-old didn’t hold back when confronting the single mum about her drug habit. “What would happen if you lost him (her son) completely?’ she asked, to which Jessica responded, “I’d kill myself”. Kerie pleaded with Jessica. “Make him your reason to get clean. Make him your reason for living.” Kerie cared for Jessica’s baby while she briefly returned home to collect the rest of her belongings. Next. You’re homeless, five months pregnant and only have $50 to spare. An elderly man catches your eye. He too is desperate for money. As Nikki (last name withheld) was explaining her situation, her eyes filled with tears. When asked about her most generous act this year, she recalled seeing a homeless man in his 70s who was having a bad day. “You can just tell by the look on somebody’s face,” she said. Despite not knowing where her next dollar would come from, the 42-year-old Melbourne woman gave the man $20. “That made his day so it was worth it,” Nikki said. “I’d hate to be that old on the street and people just walk past me.” Now, you have your hands full caring for your 72-year-old dementia-suffering husband who has become completely immobile. You later discover an old school friend is having a hard time coping with his extremely limited mobility due to post-polio syndrome and desperately needs a helping hand. Not only can’t Trevor Cullen, 61, leave his home without assistance, but he struggles to have a shower and even get to the toilet on his own. Debe Thomas has been helping Mr Cullen apply to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. She has also started that process for herself, suffering from osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. Despite her chronic conditions, Ms Thomas drives Mr Cullen to and from doctors appointments and even visits the local food bank once every fortnight to collect groceries for him. She also connects him to home-cleaning services and is enquiring about disability-friendly homes on his behalf. On top of everything, she keeps his mental health a priority. “I found out that he hasn’t even been hugged in 40 years. So now we make it a habit,” Ms Thomas said. Next. While working on a construction site, you notice an elderly woman who is struggling in the heat. She looks exhausted and could do with a refresher. After a day’s labour in “stinking hot” weather, Melbourne builder Maarty Ploeg, 50, walked to a nearby IGA and bought the woman an ice-cream. “She was just so happy. Her smile was worth it all,” he said. Finally, you’re a stay-at-home mum and want to get back into the workforce. A brief google search brings up the State Emergency Service (SES). You know they need more volunteers but the idea of taking part in missing person searches or hazardous tree removals and other emergency response jobs seem daunting. This was Lisa May’s fifth year volunteering for Victoria’s SES. She was stumped for choice when asked about her nicest deed, as she puts in about 30 hours every week. Ms May recalled speaking to a distressed elderly woman whose cat was trapped in her roof. She got the impression that the cat was “pretty much all she had” so her rescue team “went above and beyond” to retrieve it. “She was over the moon with that and she actually ended up writing a letter of thank you to the unit,” Ms May said."

Baltimore-based St John Properties revealed the enormous bonus at the company’s annual end-of-year celebrations on Tuesday (local time). “Grown men were crying,” company chairman Edward St John told US publication Today. “It was an unbelievable moment. There’s no question.” Mr St John said his 198 employees would share in $US10 million – receiving an average of $50,000 ($A73,000) each. For many of them, the cheques are actually a lot more. Maintenance technician Stanley Ches, who started at the company in 1982, will get more than $200,000. “I was in shock. I’m still in shock,” Mr Ches said. “Everybody was shaking me down and giving me hugs.” Mr St John said the surprise gift was to celebrate St John Properties reaching its goal of developing 1.9 million square metres of office, retail and warehouse space in eight US states. The company is one of the largest commercial real estate companies in its region. “We wanted to reward our employees in a big way that would make a significant impact on their lives,” Mr St John said. “I am thankful for every one of our employees, for their hard work and dedication. I couldn’t think of a better way to show it.” The hefty Christmas gift comes on top of the company’s traditional end-of-year bonuses and other benefits, which including profit-sharing and extra holiday time.

It now has a portfolio of commercial space worth $3.5 billion. The goal of developing 1.9 million square metres of commercial space was set in 2005, when St John Properties had half that. In the 14 years since, it has weathered a recession and grown from operating in five states to eight."

    "transcript": "A second person has been found alive after being lost for two weeks in the Northern Territory outback, with police hopeful they will also find the third person who remains missing. Claire Hockridge, 46, is the only person still missing after a pastoralist found Phu Tran, 40, in the Palmer Valley area south of Alice Springs on Tuesday morning. Mr Tran managed to survive in searing temperatures after finding water. He was taken to hospital in Alice Springs to be treated for exposure. Alice Springs Superintendent Pauline Vicary said Mr Tran was slightly disoriented but otherwise appeared well. “I don’t know if this is unprecedented but if you believe in miracles, I’m saying it’s a miracle,” she told News Corp. Tamra McBeath-Riley, 52, was rescued on Sunday afternoon after drinking from a cattle watering hole. Superintendent Vicary said the search would now target Ms Hockridge’s last-known location. “The helicopters are up again, we are honing on the area and will hopefully locate her today,” Superintendent Vicary said. Mr Tran told the pastoralist he had left Ms Hockridge behind two days ago to look for help until he found the station property or water. He had walked along the fence line for that time, Superintendent Vicary said. He was found about 12 kilometres from where the trio’s ute had become bogged. “He is in a good condition, slightly disorientated, the pastoralist said,” Superintendent Vicary said. “The pastoralist has taken him back to the homestead and given him a feed. “She (Ms Hockridge) was still fine when he left, but we are obviously now focusing the search to identify her where she is, hopefully she’s still in that condition. It is a fortnight since the group told family and friends they were going for a drive out of Alice Springs. Their car ended up bogged in sand in the bed of the Finke River on November 19. The trio, who had travelled with Ms McBeath-Riley’s dog, Raya, stayed together for several days but finally decided to split up in to try to get help. They left a note inside their car to indicate the direction they were heading. Ms Hockridge and Mr Tran also had a GPS and compass with them. Ms McBeath-Riley was released from hospital on Monday after being treated for dehydration, exposure to poor quality water and being exposed to temperatures that nudged 40 degrees in recent days. “We tried many times to try and get out, but just couldn’t get out, so ventured forth to try and find some shelter and some water,” she said. “During the day it’s just really hot so we dug ourselves under the car during the day into the sand.” For one desperate week the trio stayed together, gathering dirty water, boiling it when they could and using a shirt to strain out the sediment. After leaving their car where it became bogged, the three drank from a cattle watering hole and ate biscuits and beef noodles before splitting up. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "A Cairns healthcare worker who scooped an enormous $40 million lottery pool has chosen a low-key way to celebrate his newfound wealth – a shower. The Far North Queensland man held the country’s only division one winning entry in Thursday night’s bumper Powerball draw. As a bonus, his winning PowerHit entry also scored division two 19 times, bolstering his total prize to $40,430,542.90. “I thought I would check my ticket before bed. I was quite calm. I knew I had some of the numbers and thought I might have won division six,” he said late onThursday. “Then I had another look and thought ‘no, you b——-s are wrong!’. I had a look again. Then I went and had a shower.” The anonymous winner credited his beloved cat for alerting him to the confirmation call from lottery organisers Golden Casket. “It feels fantastic. It’s still very hard to accept, but you’ve rung me now so it must be true,” he said. “Actually, when the phone rang, my cat ran over to the phone. She never does that. I was really surprised. That’s why I answered the phone. “It’s hard to believe only one person won it and that one person is me. “It’s amazing. You dream about these things but when it happens you don’t believe it.” The healthcare worker’s winning ticket was a QuickPick from his “favourite newsagent” in Edge Hill. Newsagent Maxine Hare said she was pleased to have sold a top ticket to a regular. “We’ve had the shop for about 16 years and this is the sixth division one we’ve sold,” she said. “We’ve sold a division one winning entry in all the games now, except for Oz Lotto. So that’s what we’re aiming for next.” The numbers from Thursday’s Powerball draw were 1, 12, 3, 2, 25, 13 and 23. The Powerball was number 1. Another healthcare worker, a mum from Sydney, took home a record prize for Powerball in January – winning $107,575,649.08."

    "transcript": "An online fund-raising campaign set up by a NSW koala hospital has raised more than $1 million to rescue and rehabilitate marsupials devastated by bushfires. Port Macquarie Koala Hospital’s Help Thirsty Koalas Devastated by Recent Fires campaign had by Thursday night raised $1,078,000 on GoFundMe, eclipsing the initial stated target of $25,000. According to a message on the campaign’s fund-raising page, the size of the donations had led to the hospital extending the project beyond setting up automatic drinking stations in areas affected by bushfires.  https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100001814059073\/posts\/3301884656548637?sfns=moThis lady is Toni – she is an absolute legend… Posted by Koala Hospital Port Macquarie on Tuesday, November 19, 2019 With the number of new drinking stations increased, and a water-carrying vehicle to replenish the drinking stations, the campaign announced it would use the excess money to establish a wild koala breeding program. “Some of the funds raised through the GoFundMe site will be directed to building a Koala Ark – a facility to allow the surviving koalas to be accommodated in a healthy habitat area,” a message on the campaign’s GoFundMe page read. “Hopefully, these koalas will breed and a new population of koalas will be established for return to the wild.” The campaign says 31 koalas have been brought to the hospital from affected areas since the bushfires began last month. As many as 350 koalas were believed to have died during recent bushfires in the area, and the campaign said 75 per cent of the areas in the region hit by fire were prime koala habitat. The Port Macquarie Koala Hospital normally treats between 200 and 250 koalas each year. Koala hospital volunteer Lyn Booth told the ABC earlier this month that koalas under the hospital’s care would need to stay longer than usual. “We expect to have the koalas in here for up to 12 months because they won’t be able to be released into their habitat because it’s non-existent,” she said. “We’ve got to wait for that bush to regenerate so that they can be put back out there.” Ms Booth said most of the animals in the bushfire zones had suffered dehydration, not only from habitat loss in the fires but from the drought, which had left little water in the leaves the koalas ate.

Bellangry SF Kate has burns to hands, feet, face and full singeing of her body. She arrived very dehydrated and is now in the 5 star service burns ward at the Koala Hospital. Posted by Koala Hospital Port Macquarie on Wednesday, November 13, 2019 The hospital rehydrates koalas and then examines them for burns, which are treated with burn cream before being bandaged. Workers change the dressings every three days. The fund-raising campaign is believed to be one of the most successful Australian GoFundMe campaigns, but its donations total so far is still well short of the country’s highest. The MATW (Muslims Around The World) Africa Project with Ali Banat has raised $1.7 million since December 2015. Earlier this month, the Koala hospital told its Facebook followers to be aware of fraudulent online campaigns claiming to be raising money for the hospital, noting that only one approved campaign was active."

Greta, who refuses to travel by plane due to the high carbon emissions involved, arrived by sailing boat at the summit, where she berated politicians for not having stricter emissions standards. “How dare you?

    "transcript": "A bizarre-looking basking shark has reappeared as a stroke of luck revealed what scientists believe to be an historic, oceanic crossing. The female shark, which was tagged with a satellite transmitter at Malin Head on the northernmost point of Ireland, just happened to be photographed three years later. A recent study published by marine biologists at Queen’s University Belfast and Western University in Ontario, Canada says the crossing is from Ireland to North America is just the second time such a transAtlantic crossing has been recorded. The only previous evidence of a transAtlantic crossing came in 2008, when another female tagged with a tracking device swam from the Irish Sea to the coast of Cape Cod, Newfoundland. After a few months after being fitted with its tracking device, the equipment went dark. “That’s not unusual,” Jonathan Houghton, one of the study’s lead researchers told CNN. “If you put electronics in the sea, some things just glitch up after a while.” Then, out of the blue in June 2017, the shark was photographed by an underwater photographer more than 4600 kilometres away, off the east coast of North America. The photograph was circulated throughout Europe before eventually making its way to the research teams. It was then they noticed the shark’s no-longer-functioning tracking device and a small buoyancy aid fitted only to one shark. “Over 1500 individual sharks have been equipped with either visual ID or satellite tags in the Atlantic to date, leading to just a single record of transoceanic movement – until now,” study co-author Emmett Johnston said. “This new evidence offers invaluable information to help us better understand the movements of this endangered species within an international context.” As well as being one of the largest sharks in (second only to the whale shark) the basking shark is also one of the oddest in appearance. The basking shark has several evolutionary adaptations for filter-feeding plankton, its main diet, including a greatly enlarged mouth and its highly developed gill rakers. It has a conical snout and gill slits that extend around the top and bottom of its head. Perhaps its oddest feature is the structured cartilage inside the shark’s mouth that appears like ribs and serves to support its gaping mouth when feeding."

    "transcript": "At a secret location, nine metres under Port Phillip Bay, divers are combing a newly created oyster reef with a high-powered camera. Up on the dive boat, the pictures on the video screen are a window into Bob Pearce’s teenage years in the 1960s – before overfishing, pollution and disease wiped out 99 percent of Australia’s shellfish reefs within a few decades. “We were left with a marine desert,” he says. But this two-year-old reef is teeming with life – created from seafood shells collected from restaurants that would have otherwise ended up in landfill. “It’s an amazing thing how critters know there’s something there, and they come to it,” he says. “Crabs, oysters, starfish, octopus, squid, snapper – you name it, they’re all there.” This is one of 10 pilot sites in four Australian states rebuilding the enormous chain of reefs that once stretched along the coast from Noosa to Perth, that were all but wiped out by dredge harvesting last century. “They tore the reefs to pieces,” Mr Pearce says. “It broke my heart.” Back in the 60s, when Mr Pearce first joined the Albert Park Yachting and Angling Club, he remembers being able to collect buckets of oysters in the shallows of South Melbourne beach. “If you felt like a feed of mussels, you’d just go and get them off the pier pole,” he says. “Every house along here had a mussel rake. We used to have them with a bit of brown vinegar and pepper. “People told me not to worry about the dredging, but it’s left us with a marine desert. I just put my hand up at a club meeting one night and said ‘We should do something about this’.” It was the start of what became a multi-million-dollar project to begin rebuilding Australia’s shellfish reefs, funded by philanthropic giant The Nature Conservancy, with help from state and federal governments. It has restored more than 100 similar reefs in the United States — and now wants to do the same in Australia on a similar scale. A map showing how shellfish reefs used to stretch along the south and east coasts of Australia. “We’d love to build reefs in 60 places across southern Australia,” says Rich Gilmore, who heads the conservancy’s Australian arm. “That’ll take an investment of about $100 million. State and federal governments have provided some support for the projects underway so far, but we want them to invest so we can quickly scale up. “If we can get that, this can be a game changer for water quality and fish stocks in Australia.” The conservancy is lobbying to get the project funded in the next round of state and federal budgets. It’s pushing hard on its value as a job-creation scheme in the regions and also as a way of preventing coastal erosion. “We need them to understand that these reefs are part of our national infrastructure. It’s just that they are alive. And we’ve got a way to go to convince them of that.” In just a few years, 8 million native angasi oyster hatchlings have been placed in the waters off Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia, on the recycled mollusc shells collected from restaurants. They’ve turned empty, sandy seabeds into thriving ecosystems – covering an area the size of the MCG in Port Phillip Bay. “The results so far have been staggering,” Mr Gilmore says. “A single native oyster can filter a bathtub of water every day. That’s billions of litres of clean water every single year of being filtered.” Mr Pearce says every time he goes back, it reminds him of the bay he once knew. “There’s thousands of pink snapper swimming on that reef that wouldn’t have been there otherwise,” he says. “If we can just keep doing this a chunk at a time, eventually we’ll have something fantastic again.”"

    "transcript": "It’s been two years since Jacinda Ardern became New Zealand’s Prime Minister at 37. It was a huge victory, given she only took over the leadership of the Labour Party seven weeks out from the election, and it made her New Zealand’s youngest leader since the 1800s. To mark the anniversary, Ms Ardern was challenged to cram what she said were some of her key achievements into what was meant to be a two-minute Facebook video … but which ended up going 56 seconds over. Some of the items on the list had already received global attention — banning military-style semi-automatics and leading the call for the removal of terrorist material online, for instance. Ms Ardern also spruiked her crackdown on foreign home buyers and ban on single-use plastic bags, as well as the planting of 140 million trees and the extension of paid parental leave. But other items on the list were much more local, like: All up, she sped through 50 items. But the fact it gets into the nitty gritty of New Zealand politics hasn’t stopped non-Kiwis from watching. The rapid-fire list has been watched over 2 million times, with many pointing to it as an example of what leadership should look like. Absolutely incredible to watch this @jacindaardern video be pinged around the world. In the last 48 hours, it's seemingly gone everywhere from the UK to Pakistan, and has even gone viral in Lebanon – becoming another tool for protestors to push for change pic.twitter.com\/7RyJvywHjJ — Ashleigh Stewart (@Ash_Stewart_) November 3, 2019 However, while many of the comments on Ms Ardern’s own Facebook post were positive (with many suggesting she take her skills to Australia, the UK or Canada), some New Zealanders were more critical. One pointed at Ms Ardern’s as-yet unfulfilled election promise on making medicinal cannabis available (which was one of her “100 days” policies), while another questioned the adequacy of her achievements on nursing staff levels and pay. Earlier this year, Ms Ardern received global praise for her leadership in the aftermath of the Christchurch shooting. “While the US President was busy backing a commentator who equates the hijab with treason, the New Zealand Prime Minister was quietly donning a headscarf to visit stricken Muslim communities,” wrote Annabel Crabb. However, she has been criticised by some in New Zealand over the country’s slowing economy and falling business confidence, while her Government recently had to scrap its “overly ambitious” target of building 100,000 homes in 10 years. Ms Ardern was also criticised over Labour’s mishandling of an internal investigation into the alleged sexual assault of a party volunteer. With an election due in the next year, one recent poll had the opposition National Party with enough support to form a coalition government. “The best guess is that the result could go either way,” political commentator Bryce Edwards of Victoria University told Reuters. – ABC"

The highest total was recorded at a station east of Blackall, which received 50 millimetres of rain. Jess Gardner from the Bureau of Meteorology said there were also decent falls at Fairview, Quilpie and Blackall, which had not recorded any rain for months. “There was widespread falls of a few millimetres and then underneath the storms we’re seeing some of those larger totals as well, which is great for those people who really need them,” she said. “For a lot of the region it has been many, many months since they have seen anything decent.” Longreach grazier Jenny Gordon said she was “chuffed” by the start of the wet season. “It’s not everywhere but just in patches you’ll just see green shoots, so this 18 millimetres is just going to be a bonus for us,” she said. “We’re not in November yet, so fingers crossed this is the start of what’s going to be a more positive season.” Chrissie Bunter at Ilfracrombe said her property measured five millimetres of rain – the first fall since three millimetres on March 29. Ms Gardner said a stationary upper low would bring more rainfall to the region over Wednesday and Thursday. “There is a chance of seeing some severe storms as well – we could even see some stronger winds and hail as well this afternoon,” she said. “Hopefully this is a sign of things to come for the next few months, but it is definitely a very welcome change to the long spell of dry weather that we’ve had.”"

Elston Lami Lami has told how he accidentally stepped on the “12-foot” croc while hunting with his dogs in a shallow creek near Minjilang, on Croker Island, north-east of Darwin. “When he come up, when he flipped me and I looked at his eye, he had that crocodile tears on it. Like … you’re mine, you’re my lunch,” Mr Lami Lami told the ABC from a bed at the Royal Darwin Hospital. “I hit him three times in the nose [and] he let me go. Come back again, try and attack me. “When he snapped at me, I grabbed him, held him at the jaw with two hands and I was getting weak so I thought the only way to get his attention, I had to hit him again.” Mr Lami Lami, 42, said his dogs and yelling from one of his hunting mates distracted the croc and gave him the chance to get away. He escaped with a bite on the leg and another near his shorts – which he said the salty managed to shred. But his ordeal was far from over. Mr Lami Lami then faced a half-hour walk back to his car on his wounded leg. “Whatever pain I was going through, I didn’t want to show it to them boys, because I was the older one there,” he said. He was bandaged up back at the car and took a few paracetamol for his throbbing leg, before being treated at the Minjilang Community Health Centre. He was flown to hospital in Darwin later on Saturday, and was to spend a few days recovering."

    "transcript": "A Sydney dad has scored two multimillion-dollar first division Lotto prizes after a happy accident. The Parramatta man won two of the six division one prizes in Monday night’s draw after accidentally marking two games with the same numbers. The single division one prize was $666,666.67, so the lucky father takes home a total prize of $1,333,333.34. “It wasn’t deliberate that I had two rows of the same numbers. It was just that I had to mark another line on the ticket – so it’s a very happy accident,” he told lottery officials on Tuesday. The double division-one winner, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he was in a state of shock at his good fortune. “You have no idea how this has helped my family,” he said. “It’s already been spent … but all wisely, I can assure you. “It’s so much appreciated.” He bought his winning ticket at a Parramatta newsagency. Owner William Ho said it was the first division one prize he had sold in 15 years. “I was very happy this morning when I saw we had sold not one but two division one wins,” he said. There was also a third first division one winner from Monday night’s draw in NSW. The other winners came from Victoria, South Australia and Queensland."

Joyce said Australia must prevent the extradition of Julian Assange from the UK to the US, and other unhelpful things. Assange has distanced himself from Barnaby by remaining 15,000 kilometres away. Assange claims to be a ‘journalist’, despite his occasional bloggings being rambling rhetoric with way too many semicolons; the grammatical symbol for ‘I can’t end a sentence’; and so forth. Julian said, “I need Barnaby Joyce like a hole in my arguments.” Nerds celebrated the discovery of water on planet K2-18b, suggesting it’s inhabitable by humans or Donald Trump. But some 20-somethingorothers resisted the notion of moving to the planet. A Millennial moving his parents’ widescreen TV into his bedroom said, “I won’t go until my parents buy a house there.” The planet is believed to be located in the “habitable zone” somewhere between the spare room and the toilet.

It’s the end of the world as we vaguely recall it.” Warning labels will be added: smoking this product may cause you to care very little about whether this product harms you. Medical scientists predict that Canberra will become even more disorganised and useless. GetUp! boss Paul Oosting has accused the Morrison government of twisting facts to suit itself, a bit like a grassroots organisation secretly boosting a major political party.

    "transcript": "I grew up in a world filled with monsters. Hairy, primitive beasts roamed the bush. Enormous prehistoric creatures inhabited the seas. And the skies? They brimmed with alien spacecraft. How I wanted to believe. I was obsessed with the strange and the unknown. I had scrapbooks filled with clippings about the Loch Ness monster, the Yowie and its Himalayan cousin, the Yeti. I devoured books about ancient civilisations that had been mentored by advanced extra-terrestrial beings. At the age of 12 I was founder and president of the Aerial Phenomena Investigation Bureau – an Australia-wide society with more than 60 members dedicated to proving the existence of UFOs in our skies. Unfortunately, it was forced to close. Sinister government interference? No, something far more down to earth. The money I earned from my newspaper delivery round couldn’t meet the cost of the monthly newsletter. And then I grew up. I threw away my tin foil hat – the one that had successfully been blocking the government’s ability to read my thoughts from its secretive tracking base at Pine Gap. Cold, hard reason replaced that mysterious world of my childhood and science and logic became the slayer of all those dragons and demons. But maybe I was on to something… For the first time in history the US Navy last month acknowledged that three videos of strange objects filmed by its pilots between 2004 and 2015 were of “unidentified” phenomena. The US Navy videos, published by The New York Times, show objects reaching hypersonic speeds along the east coast of the United States. In other reported cases they swerved and made instantaneous stops in mid-air, defying the physical laws that constrain current aircraft. A Pentagon spokeswoman also confirmed the phenomena was being treated as “unidentified” and was just a part “of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years.” The videos and the unprecedented statements by US military officials have created a predictable wave of controversy around the world, capping off an extraordinary year for conspiracy theorists and a lucrative one for manufacturers of tin foil hats. The world, it seems, wants to believe. The more certain our universe becomes through science and technological innovation, the more we search for the unexplainable. A Facebook post earlier this year that jokingly called on people to storm the secretive US air force base in Nevada known as Area 51 – long suspected of harbouring the wreckage of crashed UFOs and alien bodies – drew more than two million responses and forced the US government to increase security around its perimeter. And in the year in which we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo XI moon landing, more people on the planet than ever before believe it was all just a hoax, insisting NASA’s astronauts only travelled as far as a Los Angeles film studio. Plenty of academic studies have produced compelling evidence showing that in uncertain times, when people feel increasingly helpless with little control over their lives, they are willing to suspend common sense and logic and look for answers in the far-fetched. We saw this in the US when the 9\/11 attacks sparked widespread claims of government involvement. We saw this when Barak Obama’s elevation to the presidency resulted in claims he was not a US citizen, spawning the right-wing “Birther” movement. We saw this in the allegations of Hillary Clinton masterminding a global child-trafficking ring from a rear booth in a Washington pizza joint. We saw it in the UK when Princess Diana’s death in a car accident triggered speculation of secret service involvement. And we have seen it in Australia with ongoing lunatic conspiracy theories around the Port Arthur massacre and whether there was a second shooter. This is an age when science has explained – and proven – how the universe emerged a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. We have mapped the human genome, sent craft hurtling beyond the limits of our solar system and even, earlier this year, captured the first image of a black hole. But the more explanations we are given and the more our universe shrinks and becomes less mysterious, the more people cling to outlandish theories as a way of coping with their rapidly changing and out-of-control lives. Those UFO videos? I have no idea what those objects are. But I’m certain they cannot be alien spacecraft. It makes no sense. Why travel the vast distances of intergalactic space in your souped-up, technologically advanced ship, only to arrive on Earth and play hide and seek with navy aircraft? But most of all, in an era when almost everyone on the planet has a smartphone and an excellent in-built, automatically focusing camera, why do UFOs only ever appear in front of people who don’t know how to properly use one? So for now, let’s retain a healthy dose of scepticism. The world we live in contains more than enough mystery already. Let’s first solve some of those elusive Australian enigmas like why so many drivers insist on picking their noses while waiting for the traffic lights to change, and why other people insist on ending sentences with the word “but”. Figure that out, people, and then it might be time to reach for the tin foil hats. Garry Linnell was director of News and Current Affairs for the Nine network in the mid-2000s.

    "transcript": "A light plane has been left hanging upside down in ski lift cables after crashing in the Italian Alps. Pictures were released by Italian mountain rescuers following the crash in Prato Valentino on Sunday, with alpine rescue teams and firefighters called in to help. Amazingly both the 62-year-old pilot of the aircraft and his 55-year-old passenger escaped the wreckage, although the pilot was taken to hospital with minor injuries. According to CNSAS, Italy’s mountain rescue service, the pilot from Genoa was thrown from the plane after it got tangled and flipped over in the cables. The only passenger was unharmed. Images showed him calmly sitting on the wing as rescuers tried to extricate him from the wreckage. The rescue operation is understood to have taken two hours. Mountain rescue spokesman Walter Milan told British tabloid The Sun the men had a lucky escape. “They were both very lucky, really. If the plane had crashed into the ground, the ending could have been very different,” Mr Milan said. “It was a complicated rescue operation involving many services, but ultimately it was successful, which was the main thing. “It was a miracle. The pilot suffered injuries but not too serious. Both men were of course very shocked also.” The cause of the crash is being investigated."

    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/national\/2019\/09\/26\/foals-twins-one-eyed-mare\/",
    "transcript": "A horse stud owner says he was left stunned after discovering that one of his mares had defied extraordinary odds to give birth to live twin foals. Labelled “exceptional” by the state’s most experienced equine vet, twin fillies delivered by a mare at Spurrs Stud at Wagin in Western Australia’s Wheatbelt are still alive almost two weeks after being born. The chances of twin foals being born alive are considered one in 10,000. But the odds of both animals surviving past their first two weeks are deemed much higher still, with most pregnancies ending in the death of at least one of the infants and often imperilling the mother. Spurrs Stud owner Kevin Spurr said the birth came as a complete surprise after he had opted not to have the mare, Pearl, assessed during her pregnancy. “My first thought was ‘don’t tell me another mare has had a foal and run away and left that’,” he said. Katanning Regional Veterinary Hospital owner John Maxwell has been practising as an equine vet for more than 50 years and said he had never seen the successful delivery of twin foals that go on to survive. Dr Maxwell said even in the unlikely event that twin foals were conceived, it was customary to destroy one of the foetuses or abort the pregnancy because of the extreme mortality risks involved. “I’m surprised, very surprised,” Dr Maxwell said. After finding the mare and her twins — now named Snip and Drop — in a field, Mr Spurr said it was a race against time to get the tiny foals to a vet. Even then, he said the pair had to be brought home sooner than he would have liked because of the high costs of veterinary care. Adding to the difficulties, mother Pearl is missing an eye — the legacy of an accident when she was a yearling. It means Mr Spurr and his farmhand Nicole Kumpfmueller have had to provide round-the-clock care to ensure Pearl does not accidentally tread on the foals. Among their tasks has been helping to feed the twins every two hours at night. “We get out here and they’re already waiting and know the routine,” Ms Kumpfmueller said. “And you have to give them antibiotics twice a day. “Every now and then we give them an extra milk bucket as well to make sure they have enough milk because we currently don’t know how much she can produce for them. “You can’t really go anywhere at the moment because every two hours someone has to be here to do it. “I think it’s worth it. If you look at them, they’re just too cute not to get up.” The road to adulthood for the foals is a long one as they are not out of the woods yet. Mr Spurr said even if they can make it, the chances of either going on to become a successful racehorse are low. But he said the twins have been bred from good stock — the stallion that sired them won almost $200,000 during a career on the track — and they could still develop into good breeders themselves. Regardless, he said the decision to keep the twins was born of hope rather than cold commercial realities. He is backing the miracle of life to triumph against the odds. “Really, when you see something fighting for its life there’s a tendency to want to help,” he said. “In the back of my mind was the commercial aspect. “But when I saw them fighting … I wanted to give them that chance.” – ABC"

    "transcript": "A dashcam recording has captured a B-double driver making a heart-stopping recovery on the down track of Adelaide’s South Eastern Freeway. The incident happened near Crafers about a week ago and was posted by Dash Cam Owners Australia last night. South Australian Road Transport Association executive director Steve Shearer said it was incredible the truck stayed upright. On September 11, another driver crashed his truck into six cars at the base of the freeway when his primary brakes failed. SA Police said the Queensland driver would be summonsed for failing to use a low gear and for dangerous driving. In 2010, 42-year-old John Posnakidis was waiting at a bus stop on the South Eastern Freeway when he was killed by an out-of-control semitrailer that ploughed into him. In 2014, 41-year-old truck driver James Venning died when he slammed into a wall at the intersection of Cross Road and Glen Osmond Road at the beginning of the freeway. Mr Shearer believed the driver in the latest incident would not be fined for using his primary brakes as he was in a low gear with his engine brake engaged. He said there was a “myth out there” — mostly with interstate drivers — that primary brakes were not be used on the South Eastern Freeway. “Drivers are allowed to use their footbrake or their primary brake so long as they’re not relying on it as the sole means of slowing the truck,” Mr Shearer said. Mr Shearer said that was recently made clear by the State Government, and his association “fully accepted” those rules and any penalty for breaking them. He said the truck company involved was “highly credible” and trained drivers on safely negotiating the South Eastern Freeway down track. In a statement, SA Police said it would make enquiries with the transport company to determine the cause of the incident. – ABC"

A sleepless Brisbane man and a gobsmacked Sydney dad have already come forward to claim their shares of the record Powerball division one jackpot. But the identity of the third winner – the holder of a ticket bought in Ipswich – remains a mystery. “If you purchased an entry into last night’s draw from an outlet in Ipswich, you have 50 million reasons why you should check your ticket as soon as possible,” spokeswoman Lauren Cooney said. The mystery ticket-holder and the men from Sydney and Brisbane will each win $50 million after sharing top prize in Thursday’s draw. The Brisbane winner told lottery officials he hadn’t slept a wink after checking his ticket online following the draw. “I am so incredibly overwhelmed,” he said. “I checked my ticket late last night after the draw. “I’ve been wide awake ever since. I couldn’t sleep at all. But I really didn’t want to get my hopes up. “I can’t believe it. Are you sure it’s me?

    "transcript": "UFO enthusiasts are descending on rural Nevada near the secret US military installation known as Area 51, long rumoured to house government secrets about alien life. Early on Friday (Australian time), dozens of visitors began arriving at the only business the tiny desert town of Rachel, Nevada, near the military base – an extraterrestrial-themed motel and restaurant called the Little A’Le’Inn – in response to a viral social-media invitation. Some of Rachel’s 50 residents are worried their community might be overwhelmed by unruly crowds turning out after more than two million people signed up to “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us”. The joke event, posted to Facebook by California college student Matty Roberts, is planned for September 20, Mr Roberts’ “rationale” for his June invitation was simple – if enough people stormed the gates of the secretive base in the Nevada desert, there would not be enough guards to stop everyone from getting in. Their goal? “Let’s see them aliens,” the post said. Area 51 has been shrouded in secrecy for decades, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of an alien crew from the crash of an unidentified flying object in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government would not even confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes. When the interest in the Facebook event became overwhelming, the US Air Force warned curiosity seekers not to breach the gates at the military base, which it said was still used to test combat aircraft and train personnel. But still the interest grew. Then Mr Roberts teamed up with the Little A’Le’Inn to plan a music festival, dubbed Alienstock, in Rachel to entertain the expected crowds. He’s since disassociated himself from that event, saying he fears it might devolve into a public safety crisis because of the sheer weight of numbers anticipated to attend. “My entire thought process for creating this was that it was going to be something funny for my meme page that probably a maximum of 52 people would see,” he told the ABC. “I was absolutely terrified [when the FBI called]. But they were just concerned for my safety and the safety of others. They were doing their due diligence so I can’t be mad about it.” The official website for Rachel, Nevada, echoed his warnings with a strident warning to intending visitors. It bold red font, it states: “We expect riots when those visitors that may show up and paid good money find out that the reality looks nothing like what they were promised. People will get hurt. “STAY AWAY FROM RACHEL NEXT WEEKEND!” Mr Roberts is now promoting a new “safer alternative” planned for a more than two-hour drive from Area 51 in downtown Las Vegas. It even has a brand deal by way of a specially-created Bud Light beer can for the event. There are 11,500 RSVPs, with another 16,000 trying to get in, according to Mr Roberts’ event planner Frank DiMaggio. He expects a capacity crowd. #StormArea51: Preps continue day before Area 51 Basecamp event https:\/\/t.co\/jVZ75LJyZy #8NN — 8 News NOW (@8NewsNow) September 20, 2019 Back in Rachel, the Little A’Le’Inn’s co-owner Connie West said the local event would go on as planned – despite the fears of possible chaos. “It’s happening. There was no stopping it,” she said, adding that some visitors had come from as far away as Australia and New Zealand. “I hope they just enjoy the party we are throwing.” Earlier, Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee told the BBC that an extra 150 officers and 300 paramedics were being brought in to help deal with this weekend’s expected crowds. An emergency declaration has been presigned, just in case. There are real concerns among locals about an influx of people to a place that has very limited services. Chairman of the Nye County Commission Jon Koenig, which is nearby, predicted there will be no mobile phone service, because the area’s cellular towers aren’t built for the volume of calls. “There will probably be no water … or ice available, because everything’s going to sell out,” he said during a Wednesday public meeting, the ABC reports. “There will be no gas left in the gas stations. No food. Nowhere to go potty.” America’s Federal Aviation Administration has also issued a flight ban for the entire area until Monday (local time), meaning everything from news helicopters to drones aren’t allowed to fly. Even police and medical helicopters will need to get special permission to fly, if required. -with agencies"

The Kiwi then posted it to YouTube, where it’s been a smash hit. “That was actually insane,” one viewer wrote. “I wish this video was longer and we could see the reaction giving it back.” Another wrote: “I didn’t know Jesus himself resurrected.”"

    "transcript": "A television broadcast from one of the world’s most prestigious cycling races has inadvertently led to the discovery of a rooftop marijuana plantation. Spanish police announced they had seized 40 marijuana plants from the roof of a building in the town of Igualada, north-west of Barcelona, after footage was broadcast from a helicopter during stage eight of La Vuelta a Espana. Race organisers shared highlights of the stage on their social media accounts, but eagle-eyed observers noticed something extra in the videos. The union representing Spain’s Guardia Civil police then re-shared the video, highlighting the location of the plantation. “We received information via social media that there was a marijuana plantation on the roof of a block of flats in Igualada,” a spokeswoman for the Mossos d’Esquadra, the Catalonian regional police force, told The Guardian. “We began an investigation, which is still underway, and we have seized 40 plants. “For the moment, there have been no arrests.” The Guardian reported that the officers were investigating who owned the plants, as the terrace was not connected to apartments in the building. Spain has decriminalised the personal cultivation and use of marijuana, but it is still illegal to grow the drug for commercial purposes. The 21-day La Vuelta is one of cycling’s famous “grand tours”, along with the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France."

    "transcript": "Vienna has held off Melbourne to retain the top spot on the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Global Liveability Index for 2019, further strengthening its reputation as the world’s most pleasant city, while the “gilets jaunes” protests hurt Paris’ score. The Austrian capital, which attracts tourists for its classical music scene and imperial history but also has abundant green spaces and excellent public services, last year ended Melbourne’s seven-year run at the top of the survey of 140 cities, helped by an improved security outlook across Europe. Vienna and Melbourne have been neck and neck in the EIU survey for years, but the Austrian capital also regularly tops a larger ranking of cities by quality of life compiled by consulting firm Mercer. The gap between the two cities – of 0.7 point out of 100, with Vienna scoring 99.1 – was unchanged in the 2019 ranking, published on Wednesday, as were the cities in the top 10. However, Sydney is closing in on its old rival. “Sydney has risen from fifth to third, thanks to an improvement in its culture and environment score, reflecting an increased focus on combating and mitigating the impacts of climate change, as outlined by the city’s Sustainable Sydney 2030 strategy,” the EIU said. It poured cold water on Sydney’s prospects of overtaking Melbourne, however. “With both cities already scoring very highly across all categories, there is only limited potential for Sydney to displace either Melbourne or Vienna at the top of the rankings. No other city in the top 10 saw a change to its score.” Japan’s Osaka was fourth, followed by three Canadian cities – Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto. Toronto tied with Tokyo for seventh. Copenhagen and Adelaide rounded out the top 10. Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp said second place was something to celebrate, and she was particularly proud of one category. “We actually rank higher than Vienna in culture,” she told radio station 3AW. The EIU’s index ranks cities by five headline criteria. Stability and culture and environment are the two most important, weighted equally at 25 per cent of the total. Healthcare and infrastructure are also matched at 20 per cent, with education coming in last with a 10 per cent weighting. “Paris in France is the highest-ranked city to have seen a deterioration in its stability score, owing to the ongoing anti-government gilets jaunes protests that began in late 2018,” the EIU said of the French anti-government movement. Paris slid six places to 25th, from 19th last year. The culture and environment scores were reduced for many cities in poorer countries that are among the most exposed to the effects of climate change, including New Delhi and Cairo for their poor air quality. Damascus in war-torn Syria remained the worst-ranked city, below Lagos in Nigeria and the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, which swapped places. -AAP"

    "transcript": "A Sydney father is planning an “outrageous holiday” after becoming Australia’s second-biggest individual lottery winner with a $96 million jackpot prize. The office worker learned of his life-changing win in the middle of his work day. You’re s–ting me!” he said after a moment of stunned silence. “I’m shaking. I’m just waiting for someone to tell me I’m being punked.” The Chatswood man, who wanted to remain anonymous, scored his enormous win in Tuesday’s Lucky Lotteries Mega Jackpot draw. His winning ticket, which was bought online, takes home the entire jackpot prize of $96,040,000. It has been nearly three years since the jackpot was last won. In January 2017, a young Sydney woman won $7.48 million. The Australian record for the biggest individual lottery win was set in January 2019 when another woman from Sydney scored an eye-watering $107.5 million in Powerball. Tuesday’s overwhelmed winner – who is a regular buyer of lottery tickets – said he was floored by his good fortune. “Stunned. That’s the only word I can think of to describe how I am feeling right now,” he said. “I just really don’t know what to say. “I know a number of people who are going to be extremely happy when I tell them I have won. “I can’t wait to call my wife and tell her I have won. I don’t think she’ll believe me. I’m a bit of a prankster so she’ll probably think I’m pulling a fast one.” As to his plans for his windfall, the man’s first thoughts were for his family. “This is going to change my life immeasurably,” he said. “I’m going to look after my kids and make sure they are set up for the future. “Then I am going to find the most outrageous holiday I can think of to take myself on. “I’ve always wanted to travel so maybe I’ll work my way around the world. “It’s unlikely that I am going to finish the day out at work. I’m pretty sure I’ll quit. My endless lunch-break starts now.” The Lucky Lotteries Mega Jackpot prize now reverts to $1 million for the next draw."

    "transcript": "The small Pacific nation of Tonga is not traditionally considered a sporting powerhouse, but it may just make global sporting history at the 2020 Tokyo games. Tongan Olympian Pita Taufatofua — who first shot to fame as the country’s shirtless oil-clad flagbearer at the 2016 Rio Olympics — has launched a bid to become a sprint kayaker at next year’s games. The 35-year-old has previously competed in taekwondo and cross-country skiing. Ok so we have a problem….#MentalNoteNeverPracticeANewSportInfrontOfFamily pic.twitter.com\/xZxVjmDB1j — Pita Taufatofua (@pitaTofua) August 12, 2019 If he qualifies, that would make him the first athlete in the modern Olympic era to have competed at the Olympics in three separate sports. Speaking to ABC Pacific Mornings on Friday, he acknowledged that his introduction to the sport was a relatively recent phenomenon. “We’ve had six days of professional kayak coaching, [which] we’ve just finished going into the World Championships,” Taufatofua told the ABC. “At the start of it I couldn’t even stay on the kayak — so we had to learn very quickly.” The championships are being held in Szeged, Hungary, and Taufatofua’s K1 200-metre heat had a minor hitch. At the starting blocks, Taufatofua struggled to keep his kayak facing forward in strong winds, and eventually had to make a 360-degree turn while his competitors waited for him to get back into position. “I hit the starting block and the will in the current swung around,” Taufatofua said. “We’d only learnt to start on a certain side, and I hadn’t learnt the skills to stabilise myself under those conditions — so I went back around and kept my composure.” Taufatofua failed to qualify as he finished last, clocking in at 58.19 — 24.22 seconds behind heat-winner Strahinja Stefanovic of Serbia. To compete at Tokyo’s Olympic kayak race, he must record the fastest time in his heat at the 2020 Canoe Sprint Oceania Championships in February, otherwise he may receive a place via a special ‘tripartite’ invitation. This invitation would be decided by the International Olympic Committee, National Olympic Committees, and the International Canoeing Federation based on previous results and whether or not the invitee fits the Olympic principle of universal representation. Taufatofua said the championships were the first time he had ever faced a sprint kayaking starting block. “We hadn’t actually trained in them — I guess it was a comedy of errors,” he said. But while it may have appeared to be an unconventional start in the sport, it hasn’t weakened Taufatofua’s resolve to make Olympic history. “I want to be the first to compete in three unrelated sports — the goal is still there and it’s only just started,” he said. “I’m not worried about criticism, and I guess that gives me the freedom to try.” When he returns to Tonga, Taufatofua will also be trying to qualify for taekwondo in the Olympics, which may see him compete in two separate Olympic sports in Tokyo if successful. “It’s always about trying to reach that next level,” he said.

    "transcript": "A 50-year-old letter in a bottle from a Russian sailor has been found on the shores of western Alaska. Tyler Ivanoff found the handwritten Russian near Shishmaref about 966 kilometres northwest of Anchorage, television station KTUU reported. “I was just gathering firewood,” Mr Ivanoff said. “I just happened to stumble across the bottle, and I noticed it was a green bottle and had a cork top. Not really cork, it was a tight cap, and I could see inside the bottle there was a note,” he said. Mr Ivanoff shared his discovery on Facebook, where Russian speakers translated the message to be a greeting from a Cold War Russian sailor dated June 20, 1969.  I found a message in a bottle today. Any friends that are Russian translators out there? Posted by Tyler Ivanoff on Monday, August 5, 2019 The message included an address and a request for a response from the person who found it. Reporters from Russian network, Russia-1, tracked down the original writer, Captain Anatoli Prokofievich Botsanenko, who was sceptical that it was his note until he saw his signature on the bottom. “It looks like my handwriting. For sure! East industry fishing fleet! E-I-F-F!” Mr Botsanenko said. The message was dropped into the water while he was aboard the Sulak, a ship whose construction he oversaw in 1966 and on which he sailed until 1970. At one point in his career, he was the youngest captain in the Pacific at 33 years old, Mr Botsanenko said. Mr Botsanenko shed tears when the Russian television reporter told him the Sulak was sold for scrap in the 1990s. Mr Ivanoff said he would consider sending his own message in a bottle with his children. “But that’s something I could probably do with my kids in the future. Just send a message in a bottle out there and see where it goes,” he said. -with AAP"

    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2019\/08\/16\/maggots-waste-australia-recycling-farming\/",
    "transcript": "When Olympia Yarger started farming maggots, it’s because she couldn’t afford to feed sheep, cattle or even chickens. She figured maggots – which can be fed to livestock – might solve that problem. Her hope was to run a conventional farm. Instead, she recognised the “beautiful opportunity” that maggots might solve bigger problems – those of of food waste and landfill, and the rising cost of feed for farmers. That was in 2014. Since the she has built a novel business based on the idea of “decentralised waste management.”  Instead of food waste being transported to the local tip, modular units full of black soldier flies – parked in the basement of office buildings, schools, hospitals and subscribed by individual households – convert up to five tonnes of food waste a day into one tonne of maggots, and 200 kilograms of manure. No arable land is required for maggot farming, and less than a litre of water produces a kilogram of almost pure protein. The maggots are euthanised with carbon dioxide and sold as feed – and the manure sold to gardeners. It’s a model that Ms Yarger is determined to see replicated and expanded across Australia. Plenty of businesses have foundered on their big dreams, but not many of them are earning revenue off the back and front end – or have hit the sweet spot of the zeitgeist so well. According to the Department of Environment and Energy, Australians in 2016-2017 produced 7.3 million tonnes of food waste across the supply and consumption chain. Of this, 2.5 million tonnes was created in our homes, 2.3 million tonnes in primary production and 1.8 million tonnes in the manufacturing sector. Public consciousness of this scandal has been elevated by the ABC’s War of Waste campaign, now in its second series. Eight months ago, Ms Yarger’s business, Goterra, entered a partnership with the CSIRO via the research body’s Kick-Start Program, which matches start-ups and small businesses with research and development activities. In this instance, the CSIRO provides technical support and advice to Ms Yarger in optimising her fly breeding program. Part of the motivation here was to give Ms Yarger – and Australia – an edge in a business that is growing globally. This is according to Dr Cait Paull who heads CSIRO’s Pest Suppressive Landscapes Team – which focuses on studying the behaviour of insect pests and their predators, looking for new ways to protect crops from infestation. “We were pretty much straight-away able to help Olympia just by observing what she did, and being able to somewhat test and tweak it,” Dr Paull told The New Daily. Dr Paull noted that “being connected with an emerging Australian industry… meant the relationship was a two-way collaboration”– allowing the CSIRO to test lab-based results in an up-scaled real-world situation. “The knowledge benefits are going two ways,” she said. “We can test all sorts of things in the lab and get fantastic results. The next step of applying it to real world problems, or upscaling in a commercial sense, takes a long time. And we don’t have the capacity to do that, or if we do it takes a long time. “We’ve been able to take what we’ve found in the lab, bring it down to Goterra and test it on the industrial scale.” Dr Paull was unable to give an actual example because of commercial confidentiality agreements. The use of insects in waste management and farming is becoming a billion dollar business. “The world outside Australia has made moves in a commercial sense,” she said. “We’re hoping that the work we’ve done provide (Ms Yarger) some advantage to get ahead of the game for Australia.” Dr Paull said Mr Yarger seems to take “an almost altruistic” to what her work could mean for Australian research. In honour of that work, a CSIRO taxonomist recently named a new species of the soldier fly after Ms Yarger: Hermetia olympiae."

    "date": "08-14-2019",
    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/entertainment\/arts\/2019\/08\/14\/matchstick-portrait-world-record\/",
    "transcript": "A Queensland painter is claiming a record for creating the world’s smallest painting on the end of a matchstick, but he will never make it into the Guinness Book of Records. Artist Wayne Malkin used the wooden end of the match as a tiny canvas, to create an oil painting of Barry Humphries’ alter ego, Dame Edna Everage. The hand-painted portrait measures 2.3 millimetres by 2.3 millimetres or about the same size as the letter U on a 20-cent piece. “I was online and saw a news feed about an artist in Cyprus, who was claiming the smallest painting in the world,” Mr Malkin said. “His painting was 6.9 millimetres by 7.1 millimetres. And I thought, as an artist, that’s a really great challenge to try to beat.” Mr Malkin said he settled on the end of a matchstick because viewers could easily compare it to other tiny objects. The Sunshine Coast-based artist said it took two months to paint, far longer than his usual and much larger landscape paintings. “A lot of that time was spent trying different methods,” he said. Mr Malkin experimented with using a single brush hair and pinpoint, before switching to the fibre from a bamboo skewer. “It was the right sort of stiffness and size that I could actually dot paint onto it, and gradually build up in the traditional way with oil paints to form a portrait.” He said he never considered using artificial means like digital printing to create the image. “There is a smaller painting around, but it’s done by laser – there’s no paint on it. “Mine is a painting that is painted exactly the same way as any other traditional painting.” The artist, who owns a gallery at Montville on the Sunshine Coast hinterland, said he chose Dame Edna as his subject because she has a distinctive face, even in miniature. “It’s the hair. It’s the glasses,” he explained. “People look at this painting through the magnifying glass and say I know who that is. That’s Dame Edna.” Mr Malkin said he had consulted record books, but there were no official records kept on paintings because art was considered too subjective. “I have been in touch with the Guinness Book of Records and they’ve sent a number of emails back to me,” he said. The record keepers described it as “truly amazing” but could not publish the painting as an official record. “It’s not objective. Someone could argue that this tiniest dot of paint is a painting for the smallest painting. And someone could also argue that the longest painting, say, is the stripe on the M1,” the artist said. “They tried to subcategorise it in some way, but came back to me and said ‘No, it’s just too difficult to do that’.” But Mr Malkin said after a thorough search of the internet he was confident his painting was the smallest in the world. The micro-art is best viewed in the gallery with the magnifying glass provided, but even then Mr Malkin said about half of his gallery visitors could not seem to see the work. “The reaction has been a mix,” he confessed. “The 50 per cent say ‘I can’t see what it is, it’s just too small for me’ and the people that can see it have just gone ‘That is incredible. I’m blown away by it.’ And that’s really satisfying to have people say that.” Mr Malkin said he used special equipment to see the tiny end of the matchstick as he was painting. “I have a small hand-held lens, which is more powerful than the display one.” The artist said he would be willing to lend the work to other galleries, but it would not be for sale. Without a clear ruling from world record keepers, the title of smallest artwork is disputed. Turkish micro-artist Mesut Kul claimed in 2017 that he had painted on to the world’s smallest canvas — a hair. He has also used other miniature canvases, including pumpkin seeds and beans. Another Turkish artist Hasan Kale, who has dubbed himself the ‘Microangelo’, has developed an international following by painting tiny images onto food. He has recently painted onto pumpkin seeds, grains of rice, peanuts, sugar cubes and strawberry seeds. Mr Kale has also dabbled in painting onto matches, with portraits of Albert Einstein, composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and artist Salvador Dali onto the heads of matchsticks earlier this year. When opening his latest micro exhibition in an Ankara shopping centre in June, the micro-artist said he had been working in miniature for more than two decades. “Everything that we omit, do not recognise and throw out as trash sometimes has become my canvas,” he said. “I started with the idea of opening new windows with different perspectives and creating a new language in the world. “It has been 25 years since that day. I am glad that I have done this when I look back.”"

    "transcript": "New Zealand’s recently identified giant parrot is going to have to shuffle over a bit because there’s a bigger bird in town. Scientists have revealed the discovery of a new species of giant penguin that stood up to 1.6 metres tall, identified from fossils found in Waipara, North Canterbury. Crossvallia waiparensis is a monster penguin from the Paleocene Epoch (between 66 and 56 million years ago) that extends the list of New Zealand’s gigantic, but extinct, fauna. They include poor old Squawkzilla, properly known as Heracles inexpectatus. The metre-tall world’s biggest parrot was identified just days ago from fossils found in southern Otago and has already lost its biggest-bird crown. ~🚨~revised parrot chonk chart~🚨~ sorry @Spokesbird you've lost your title as absolutest unit pic.twitter.com\/FnDkBuihgp — Ellen Rykers (@ellerykr) August 7, 2019 Heracles is younger than C. waiparensis, having roamed across New Zealand a mere 19 million year ago. C. waiparensis, whose discovery was revealed by Canterbury Museum on Wednesday, is one of the world’s oldest known penguin species and also one of the largest. It would have topped today’s 1.2-metre emperor penguin, and would have weighed up to to 80 kilograms. The big bird’s bones were found at the Waipara Greensand fossil site in North Canterbury in 2018 by amateur palaeontologist Leigh Love found the bones. They were analysed by a team that included Canterbury Museum curators Dr Paul Scofield and Dr Vanesa De Pietri and scientists from the Senckenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. C. waiparensis is the fifth ancient penguin species identified from fossils uncovered at the Waipara site. Dr Gerald Mayr, from the Senckenberg museum, said the site was arguably the world’s most significant for penguin fossils from the Paleocene era. “The fossils discovered there have made our understanding of penguin evolution a whole lot clearer,” he said. “There’s more to come, too – more fossils which we think represent new species are still awaiting description.” The study team found that C. waiparensis‘s closest relative was a fellow Paleocene species, Crossvallia unienwillia. It was identified from a fossilised partial skeleton found in Antarctica in 2000. The fossils of several giant species, including C. waiparensis, will go on display at Canterbury Museum later this year."

Free jars of Marmite were handed out at the first Test at Edgbaston in a not-so-subtle attempt by the English toast-topper to stoke rivalry between supporters of the twin yeasty spreads. But, led by Tim Paine and amid heroics from Steve Smith, the Aussies were undaunted. Now Vegemite has taken out a full-page ad in a British tabloid to throw a few underarms of its own celebrating the tourists’ crushing comeback win. We wish @Marmite all the best but don’t expect Aussies to be bowled over by their antics at the cricket. So, we took action by running a full page ad in the @DailyMirror … Catch ya at Lord’s! #TastesLikeAustralia #Vegemite #Ashes pic.twitter.com\/jMRJkEi63b — Vegemite (@Vegemite) August 8, 2019 According to the ad in the Daily Mirror, it is only natural that those Down Under prefer the taste of the Aussie icon to that of its British ancestor. “Vegemite is a far stronger taste, made of resilience and fortitude with a dash of cunning and guile,” the ad brags. “Vegemite tastes like back-to-back tons on your return test. Vegemite tastes like a come-from-behind victory by 251 runs. You lot won’t like the taste of Vegemite because Vegemite tastes like Australia.” The dig came in response to the high-profile attempt by Marmite to get Aussies to try the British spread. It held the Australian market captive for 20 years before supply disruptions led chemist and food technologist Cyril Callister to create an Antipodean replacement. The free jars of Marmite handed out in Birmingham were even labelled “Marmy Army”, a provocative reference to the self-labelled Barmy Army England fans that faithfully follow their team around the globe. With both Vegemite and Marmite made from yeast extract leftover from beer brewing, the real difference between the two might be as fine as a glance down the leg side. But those raised on one rarely come to prefer the charms of the other. “Of course, the refined English palate will prefer yours,” said Vegemite, which returned to Australian hands in 2017 after being bought by Bega Cheese. With fans of either toast spread or cricket teams unlikely to switch sides, battle will resume on Thursday (British time) with the start of the second Test. “Catch ya at Lord’s,” the ad breezily concludes. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "A former teacher made homeless while trying to survive on Newstart says she has been buoyed by a flood of kindness in the days since her plight was revealed. The New Daily has been inundated with generous offers from people opening their homes to Karryn Smith, after it was revealed the South Australian mother is living out of her car on $20 a day. From around the nation, readers wrote in with messages of support – including Australians who said they had experienced similar hardships and knew it was the compassion from strangers that had helped turn around their lives. Debe, a full-time carer for her husband who suffers from dementia, offered Ms Smith the spare room in her house for six months rent-free. Despite living “way below the poverty line”, in the past 15 years the Sydney couple has accommodated more than 200 people fleeing situations like domestic violence or drug addiction. “It’s the right thing to do,” Debe said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week ruled out any increase to the Newstart payment after mounting pressure to offer welfare recipients an extra $75 a week. Ms Smith said she receives $570.70 a fortnight, but is left with just $21.30 a day after bills are paid. She said she cannot afford housing or even a healthy meal, so has been sleeping in her car. Kim Martin, an ex-miner from Bendigo, said Ms Smith could have the spare room in her house. She said she knows what it’s like to be “living on survival skills”. About three years ago, Ms Martin, 59, was involved in a car crash that left her with a broken neck in five places. A fortnight later she was hit by a car while crossing the road. As she prepared to go into surgery for a second time, Ms Martin’s brother died by suicide. Then a year later her mother passed away. “She’s (Ms Smith) worked hard, like I’ve worked hard all my life. How dare somebody turn their back on her.” Kate, a nurse from Melbourne, said she could accommodate Ms Smith for up to a year rent-free. She said there had been times where she, too, has struggled to pay for food and rent. “Through good fortune and the fact that I do have a family around me who are able to support me, I didn’t end up living on the street or in a car,” Kate said. Hannah from Melbourne was homeless at one stage and said her home is always open if ever Ms Smith needed a rest, a hot meal or even just a car park. “I was writing a submission to a Senate bill related to poverty and I was doing it in the back of my car as I was homeless in 2017,” she said. “It was only through the kindness of other people that I got out of that situation.” Catherine Karena from Sydney helps disadvantaged young people find long-term employment. She offered financial help for Ms Smith. “Her words ‘I just exist’ cut my heart. People like Karryn need community,” Ms Karena said. Ms Smith has a place to ‘house sit’ in Victoria for the next few weeks, and is in touch with some of the donors who contacted The New Daily to discuss future options. “Even though the federal government does not care about people such as myself, I have been overwhelmed by the support I have received from strangers,” Ms Smith said. “It makes me feel not so alone.” Debe, Kate and Hannah did not wish to have their last name used in this story"

    "transcript": "San Francisco’s international airport has become one of the world’s first airports to ban the sale of plastic-bottled water. The airport (SFO), which in July clamped down on the use of single-use plastic straws following an initiative by the city of San Francisco, has now banned convenience shops, restaurants and vending machines from selling water in plastic bottles. From August 20, water can only be sold within the airport in glass, recycled aluminium or certified compostable materials. The airport said on its website that the change was part of a five-year strategic plan by the airport to becoming a zero “waste-to-landfill” facility by 2021. According to SFO, each airport guest creates about 225 grams of rubbish, so to reduce some of that waste it is also eliminating single-use food accessories, such as napkins, coffee cups and chopsticks. It is also banning items “unsubstantiated claims” about their sustainability, according to a report in The Guardian, with packing touted as “environmentally friendly” or “bio-based” having to be approved by the Biodegradable Plastics Institute (BPI). SFO has installed about 100 water-bottle filling stations, and ordered restaurants give customers only single-use accessories, such as condiment packets upon request. The move comes as the South Australian state government pushes to ban single-use plastics. After seeking input on what any future phase-out or replacement of single-use plastic might look like, the government was inundated by organisations coming forward to be part of the state’s first plastic-free precinct. It has received expressions of interest from retailers, trading groups, councils and disability advocates to take part in the plastic-free trial. Environment minister David Speirs said the first step was working with the precincts to reduce single-use plastics and test innovative solutions and alternatives. “We can’t continue on our current path with no plan to address the impact of single-use plastics,” Mr Speirs said. “The community will lead the change in behaviour as part of SA’s first trials into plastic-free living.” -with AAP"

One frightened witness described how Eno, who is said to weigh about 50 kilograms, jumped on the bonnet of their car, before running away. Apart from that, the flightless Australian hasn’t terrorised locals or damaged property – although he has been known to trespass.

It is unclear who Eno belongs, but there have been several sightings of him across Orange County, particularly in the past few days. “We are sending out a plea. Please, if this is your emu, let us know,” said Tenille Fox from Orange County Animal Services. “We need more information about this animal and it might help with the capture.” Harrumph… Billy was just careless. It will take skills.. special skills.. to track ME down! https:\/\/t.co\/Qrm83v0ZMy — OC_Emu (@OCEmu1) July 31, 2019 Animal control also had another message for locals: Don’t try to capture him yourself. They say he’s likely scared of people and other animals, so residents should keep their distance. “What we really need is for this emu to wander into an area that provides some sort of containment – such as natural barriers, a pasture, or some sort of fenced area,” Ms Fox said. “If the emu is in an area like that, an animal control team can try to block the animal off even more and hopefully corral the animal without causing further stress. We worry about causing more stress in this heat.” There are reportedly quite a few emu farms in the Orange County area, and it’s possible that Eno has escaped from one of them."

    "transcript": "An orthopaedic plate found in the stomach of a crocodile in Queensland could possibly bring closure to the family of a missing person if the object belonged to a human. The orthopaedic plate, with six stainless-steel screws was inside the 4.7-metre MJ, who died a month ago after a fight with another large crocodile at Koorana Crocodile Farm near Rockhampton. The metal object, which is about 10 centimetres long, was found when farm workers cut MJ’s his gut to try to establish why he died. Farm staff had been told the Swiss-made plate is “quite an old model”, manager John Lever said, but an identification code has worn off due to stomach acidity. “It could have been used in a pet or in human surgery, we don’t know,” he said. “It could have been in the crocodile’s stomach for 45, 50 years.”  Imagine our surprise when we opened up the gut on this large croc and found what looks to be an orthopaedic… Posted by Koorana Crocodile Farm on Monday, July 29, 2019 The investigation involves information from social media users and medicos but police are not yet involved, Mr Lever said. The croc had lived at the farm for about six years after being bought from another farm in north Queensland. Mr Lever is unaware of MJ’s prior habitat in the wild but inquiries are being made with the original farm. He said his instinct was the plate belonged to a human. “That’d be our desire – if we can help solve a cold case,” he said. “If we could put some minds at rest, it would be absolutely delightful.” -AAP"

A street in Wales has been wrested the honour of the world’s steepest street from the South Island city of Dunedin, after a successful campaign by residents. The street of Ffordd Pen Llech in the sleepy seaside town of Harlech is now home to the world’s steepest street. The Guinness World Records confirmed this week that the street had a gradient of 37.45 percentage points steeper than the former title holder, Dunedin’s Baldwin Street, which held the record for 10 years. The Welsh campaign was led by businessman and architectural historian Gwyn Headley. He said he felt “jubilation” now that the street has been recognised. He added he felt sorry for New Zealand, but that “steeper is steeper”. The New Zealand Herald reported that locals – stoic as ever – maintained Baldwin Street would remain a tourist attraction, just that some of the marketing around it might have to change. One plucky Kiwi real estate agent said the loss of the title may even have a positive effect on property prices as potential buyers may have been put off by the crowds of tourists that gathered there daily."

    "transcript": "It all started as a bit of a joke. But the US Air Force is taking it very seriously indeed. More than 1.4 million people have RSVPed to a Facebook event, threatening to storm Area 51, the US air force’s top-secret base that some believe is home to aliens. A further 1.1 million people – perhaps those less bold? – claim to be “interested” in the event, while not quite committed to joining in the planned invasion of the secretive Nevada base. “We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Centre tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,” a post reads on the Storm Area 51: They Can’t Stop All Of Us event page. “We can move faster than their bullets. Let’s see them aliens.” Theoretically, the 1.4 million respondents (whose numbers are growing every day) will gather in a remote Nevada town early on Septmber 20. From there, they’ll head for Area 51, using their massive numbers to invade the clandestine base and reveal any alien secrets it holds. But the pitch isn’t entirely serious. Just to make that clear, Facebook user Jackson Barnes wrote on the event page: “Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan”. “I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the Internet. I’m not responsible if people decide to actually storm area 51.” This probably the best Area 51 meme out there pic.twitter.com\/jDJmExlfcC — ATM (@ATM_Tweets) July 17, 2019 Joke or not (and despite the countless memes the event has spawned on social media), the US Air Force doesn’t see the funny side. Spokeswoman Laura McAndrews told The Washington Post that officials were aware of the event. But she wouldn’t reveal any specific plans or security procedures at the base, which is about an hour’s drive north-west of Las Vegas. She did, however, have a warning to those itching to try their luck. “[Area 51] is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces,” Ms McAndrews said. “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.” these Area 51 memes are one of the best things that ever happened to the Internet straight up 😂😂 pic.twitter.com\/gGSqCWMm2P — Mike Majlak (@mikemajlak) July 15, 2019 Area 51 has long been a source of intrigue, and inspiration for conspiracy theorists. Its primary use has never been revealed, but that is common to many military bases across the US. Even the mere existence of Area 51, which is part of the wider Edwards Air Force Base, was denied for decades. It was eventually confirmed by the CIA in 2013, through records obtained under freedom of information laws. That report maintained the base was solely an aircraft-testing facility. However, despite no mention of alien life, it failed to put to rest the conspiracy theories that allege the US government uses Area 51 to hide aliens and their spacecraft. Whatever its purpose, storming the site – as the Facebook event appears to encourage – might prove a bit difficult. It is restricted to the public and has armed guards patrolling the perimeters. And clear signs warning of the risks to anyone who does get over the fence. -with agencies"

    "transcript": "Divers have discovered enormous, human-sized jellyfish off the coast of Britain. Biologist and BBC Earth host Lizzie Daly and wildlife cinematographer Dan Abbott swam with the jellyfish in the sea off Cornwall during Wild Ocean Week, describing the moment as “breath-taking”. “What an unforgettable experience,” Ms Daly wrote on Facebook. “I know barrel jellyfish get really big in size but I have never seen anything like it before.” The barrel jellyfish is the largest species of jellyfish found in British waters. It has an average diameter of about 40 centimetres, though it can grow to 90 centimetres – and weigh as much as 35 kilograms. Fortunately, despite their size, the jellyfish are gentle giants with stings that are too weak to hurt humans. Nick-named “dustbin-lid jellyfish”, they feed on plankton and can be seen on British coasts in summer and autumn. Wild Ocean Week raises money for Britain’s Marine Conservation Society, which campaigns for ocean conservation. During it, Ms Daly and Mr Abbott spent a week filming their experiences over “seven days, 21 videos, six locations and one heck of a journey”. Ms Daly said it was a “real-life adventure”. “We saw everything from swimming with seals on the east, to breaching minke whales, lunge feeding whales, dolphins and then finishing with the giant barrel jellyfish,” she said."

The Patrouille Suisse was due to fly over Langenbruck, south of Basel, to honour the centenary of the death of a Swiss flying pioneer. However, the team flew over the nearby town of Mümliswil, which was hosting – of course – a yodelling festival. A spokesman for the Swiss Defence Ministry apologised for the error. Patrouille Swiss is a the Swiss equivalent of Britain’s Red Arrows or the Unites States’ Blue Angels, and had been scheduled to perform for the 100th anniversary of the death of Oskar Bider, who was the first person to fly over the Alps in both directions in 1913 aged just 22. Bider was born in Langenbruck. When the squadron leader saw a tent pitched for the yodelling festival in Mümliswil, about six kilometres away, he sent the jets there by mistake. A spokesman for the Swiss military told the German language Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper that the F-5E Tiger II aircraft were not equipped with GPS technology. The squadron leader said he was “most embarrassed” by the incident, and that this was the “first and last time” that such a mistake would occur. The Swiss air force has offered to pay the $6500 insurance contribution paid for by the parish of Langenbruck for the display. The yodelling festival patrons are, however, reported to have thoroughly enjoyed the impromptu show. -with agencies"

Snowball, a sulphur-crested cockatoo, had found fame online for his spontaneous grooving to hits such Cyndi Lauper’s Girls Just Want to Have Fun and Queen’s Another One Bites the Dust. He also shows off creative and distinct moves, including head bangs and foot-lifts – and now he’s made scientific history. “What’s most interesting to us is the sheer diversity of his movements to music,” said the study’s senior author Aniruddh Patel, a psychologist at Tufts University and Harvard University.  The study, published in Current Biology on Monday, said “spontaneous movement to music occurs in every human culture and is a foundation of dance”. Such moves also occur “in parrots, perhaps because they [like humans, and unlike monkeys] are vocal learners whose brains contain strong auditory-motor connections”, which gives sophisticated processing abilities, the researchers said. Snowball has lived at the Bird Lovers Only rescue centre in Indiana since 2007. His former owner reportedly left him with a Backstreet Boys CD, and a tip that he loved to dance. Centre director Irena Schulz told The Atlantic that when she played the Backstreet Boys’ Everybody, Snowball “immediately broke out into his head-banging, bad-boy dance”. Ms Schulz took a video, uploaded it to YouTube and – within a month – Snowball was a celebrity. More recent videos show he’s also a fan of Lauper and Queen, showing off diverse and spontaneous movements that use various parts of his body, despite receiving no formal dance training. In the videos, Snowball is seen bobbing, swinging and circling his head around in several ways, sometimes in co-ordination with foot lifts or other movements. The analyses of the videos revealed that Snowball had a diverse repertoire of 14 dance movements and two composite movements. According to the study, this behaviour “could be a sign of creativity”. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "Sophy Ron spent eight years of her childhood surrounded by garbage and toxic fumes while living in a notorious Cambodian rubbish dump nicknamed “Smoky Mountain”. Less than a decade after escaping, the 21-year-old is about to begin studying at the University of Melbourne and dreams of running her own business. Her former home, the Steng Meanchey landfill in Phnom Penh, has long been a symbol of the country’s poverty. Each day, thousands of people pick through the filth in the hope of finding edible food and recyclables to sell. On a good day Ms Ron would earn 50 cents, enough for a few cups of rice to share with her parents and six siblings. “I didn’t realise it was smelly. I didn’t realise it was dirty,” she said. “I slept there, I ate there, I did everything there, so it became my home.” Ms Ron said overwhelming debts left her family with no choice but to live at the dump site. The local school only offered a place to one child per family, so Ms Ron missed out on a chance to study. She said she followed her older sister to school and learned what she could by looking through the classroom windows. Her life changed after a chance meeting at the dump with Scott Neeson, the founder of the Cambodian Children’s Fund (CCF). “He asked me whether I wanted to study English, and at that time I had no idea what English was,” Ms Ron said. “I ran home feeling happy because he promised he would take me to school.” Mr Neeson’s charity, featured by the ABC’s Australian Story in 2012, has provided education, housing and medical treatment to thousands of people in Cambodia since its launch in 2004. The poverty rate in Cambodia dropped from 53 per cent in 2004 to 13.5 per cent in 2014, according to UNICEF, but children’s living conditions remain poor. In a 2018 report, the United Nations agency said a third of children under four were stunted and about half aged between five and 14 did not have access to proper toilets. Ms Ron said she vividly remembered her first day of school, aged 11, when for the first time she saw groups of children laughing and playing. She was also a quick learner and a good communicator; by 2016 she was on stage presenting a Tedx Talk in English. Through CCF, Ms Ron was able to secure a scholarship to complete a foundation year of study at the University of Melbourne’s Trinity College. She graduated in June, paving the way for her to start a Bachelor of Arts degree when the new semester begins this month. While Ms Ron said she loved life in Melbourne (apart from the cold), she hoped to eventually return home to start a business and continue working with CCF. Her uplifting story of transformation has been featured in Cambodia’s local media in recent weeks, and Ms Ron said she hoped it encouraged others to donate to charity. “I can’t really describe the feeling. I hope it changes my life in the future,” she said. “I have this message throughout my life journey: A not-giving-up message. It doesn’t matter in what circumstances.”"

    "transcript": "Losing your limbs would be a death knell for most turtles, but Pedro is learning to roll with the punches (quite literally). The adult male box turtle is living life in the fast lane after undergoing a Lego transplant to get him moving once more. It’s been a rocky road for the turbo turtle, who only had three legs when he was adopted by his owners. But after escaping from his outdoor enclosure in the US state of Louisiana, it’s believed he was attacked by a raccoon or snake, which severed his remaining back leg. “While he had three legs, he was able to move around very well,” his owner Sandra Traylor said. “However, once he lost his second leg it became significantly more difficult for him to get to where he was trying to go.” Ms Traylor is the first to admit she wasn’t sure what – if anything – veterinarians could do to solve Pedro’s problem. Suffice to say, a Lego car set probably wasn’t at the top of the list. “The idea was a collective effort,” said Dr Kelly Rockwell, a zoological medicine intern at the Louisiana State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. “There have been previous reports of exotic veterinarians putting wheels or other prosthetics on turtles [and] tortoises with missing limbs. “This was a perfect situation as Pedro had both of his back legs missing.” According to Dr Rockwell, aside from Pedro’s weakened mobility, he was in otherwise good shape. The wound where his leg had been torn off had healed quite well, she explained, and he was still able to “box up” inside his shell for protection. “We discussed other prosthetics with his family if he was going to remain outdoors,” Dr Rockwell said. “However, they opted to make him an indoor pet and these wheels provided the best mobility for him in that environment.” Armed with a tube of animal-safe epoxy and a Lego car kit, veterinarians got to work. They attached the wheels via axles that were secured to Pedro’s shell and held together by syringe cases. “The most challenging part was figuring out a way to make it fit to his size,” Dr Rockwell said. “It took some brainstorming, but once we came up with a design it was fairly easy to implement and attach.” The newfound Speedy Gonzales took to his new wheels with gusto, according to Dr Rockwell, reversing and turning the prosthetics “within minutes”. “The benefit of Legos is that they are very lightweight, so for Pedro’s size it was a perfect fit,” she said. “At the very least, I hope it inspires veterinarians who don’t work with these animals often to be creative.” It is a sentiment echoed by Ms Traylor, who has lauded the veterinarians for going above and beyond the call of duty. “We are so glad he feels better. The wheels have been a blessing to Pedro, who has in turn been a blessing to us,” she said."

    "transcript": "Britain’s potentially “most haunted house” – a mediaeval prison for witches – is for sale. The property listing, marketed by Home Domus 360, said owner Vanessa Mitchel was seeking offers in excess of 240,000 pounds ($440,000) for the two-bedroom cottage. Real estate website Right Move described the cottage as the “most haunted house in Essex and possibly England”. “The Cage was a mediaeval prison where 13 witches were kept in 1582 while awaiting trial. They became known as the Witches of St Osyth, and among them was the notorious Ursula Kemp,” Home Domus 360 writes in its advertisement. “At the end of the trial, three were found guilty, including Ursula, and were sentenced to death by hanging.” Kemp was a midwife accused of witchcraft after young children became sick or died in her neighbourhood in St Osyth in the 16th century. The house was used to detain men, women and children up until 1908. “Many of the subsequent owners could not handle the paranormal activities and sold on quickly,” Home Domus 360 said. Ms Mitchell has owned the property, dubbed The Cage, since 2004. But Home Domus 360 said she had lived there only briefly “because of the relentless paranormal activity”. According to the Clacton Gazette, she fled the house because she was “physically attacked by spirits” while pregnant, “witnessed mysterious blood spatters appear” and “even alleges she was spanked on the bottom by a demonic entity”. The paper said Ms Mitchell has repeatedly tried to sell the dwelling. It added that a walled courtyard outside the cottage leads to “Coffin Alley” – a passageway “where the bodies of the dead were carried en route to the cemetery”. The house has also been the subject of a docudrama and Ms Mitchell co-wrote a book, called Spirits of the Cage, about the “paranormal nightmare” of living there. “The house has now been cleared of the many evil residents encountered over the years: a vision of a satanic-looking goat, growling moving shadows, violent rattles, drops in temperature, and visions of ghostly [figures] quite often trying to push the living down the steep staircase,” according to Right Move. “All of this seems to have gone, it is still haunted but there seems to be a certain newly found harmony within.”"

    "transcript": "As temperatures plummet, farmers and their flocks are feeling the cold, and none more so than tiny lambs left orphaned due to the effects of drought. But a colourful initiative to keep lambs warm with jumpers this winter has gained worldwide traction and has been saving lives – as well as bringing joy to farmers. “It’s crazy and absolutely beautiful,” said Marie Knight, a farmer from Coonabarabran in north-west New South Wales. Mrs Knight first put the call out to the world’s knitters to help create the tiny jumpers one year ago and since then she has distributed more than 56,000 of them to Australian farmers. “The jumpers certainly help the lambs – and I planned on that – but what I never planned for was the extra support that would come pouring in from the people who knit them,” she said. “Often we get cards and letters of support to pass onto farmers and that’s the beautiful thing.” The jumpers have been donated from all around the world and, on any given day, Mrs Knight has been sending from one to 1000 items to farmers in need. “The furthest afield we have received jumpers was from Belgium and they actually came with beautiful chocolates,” Mrs Knight said. “Packages have also come from the United States, Canada, New Zealand and all over Australia.” When Wollongong resident Noleen Shaw first heard about the worldwide push to knit lamb jumpers, she jumped with delight. “I just love knitting of a night-time and my grandchildren don’t like knitted clothes so I thought I’d knit for the poor little lambs,” Mrs Shaw said. The retiree said she knew few farmers but she recently knitted 12 jumpers – one jumper in each of the team colours within the National Rugby League competition. “My favourite jumper to knit was the one I did up in the colours of the Illawarra Dragons,” Mrs Shaw said. She was told the farmer who received her lamb jumpers was delighted, which made her feel great too. “It makes you feel good knowing that you’re doing something for the farmers,” Mrs Shaw said. “They’re having a rough trot at the moment.” Mrs Shaw already has her next knitting project planned – she is going to create jumpers for lambs in all the colours of the AFL competition. “I’ve got to work out all the colours first, but I’m going to do them too,” she said. While they look cute and cosy, the jumpers help save orphaned lambs’ lives. Sheep expert Geoff Duddy said lambs are most vulnerable in their first three days of life. During that time they use a lot of their energy reserves trying to keep warm. “Lambs have large surface areas so being able to regulate their body temperature is critically important,” he said. Jumpers are ideal for lambs requiring extra warmth and protection, such as those orphaned, but Mr Duddy said lambs that do not require intervention should not have jumpers fitted. “If you are entering the paddock and disturbing the ewe to pull a jumper on the lamb that could interfere with their relationship and put the lamb at risk,” he said. “Further, if lambs get wet while in their jumpers – assuming they’re unlined – that could actually cause them a lot of harm.” As temperatures continue to drop and pasture growth freezes, drought-affected farmers across the country are continuing to supplementary feed their flocks – a practice that Mr Duddy said gives sheep extra energy to weather the cold. He said it would be a long and cold winter for many farmers. Forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology indicated this winter in NSW will be drier than average and the state is likely to see higher surface air pressures than normal, which will mean less cloud at times and a higher risk of frost in susceptible areas. Mrs Knight encouraged avid knitters to continue donating lamb jumpers this winter. “As farmers we all want to do the very best for our animals,” she said. –ABC"

    "transcript": "Pigeons and an Alsatian dog called Brian are among the heroes honoured for their vital roles during the D-Day invasion that helped bring an end to World War II. The birds were given up to the war effort by thousands of pigeon fanciers, and used to help spread news of how the fight war going. Other families donated pets to the cause: Brian the Alsatian (also known as Bing) became a canine parachutist after being sent from his home to the Army War Dog Training School because his owners could not feed him on their war rations. The brave war efforts of Brian and his feathered comrades are among those recognised through the Dickin Medal – acknowledged as the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. It was launched in 1943 by Maria Dickin, the founder of British animal charity, The People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals. The medal has been awarded 71 times since 1943 (as well as one honorary medal awarded in 2014). Of the recipients, 34 are dogs, 32 pigeons, four horses – and there’s even one cat with the honour. The celebrated war pigeon, G.I. Joe, receiving the Dickin Medal for gallantry during WWII. His swift delivery of a message to Allied bombing forces saved over 1000 lives of British troops and civilians in the Italian village of Calvi Vecchia. pic.twitter.com\/7b6OzD9QgA — History Lovers Club (@historylvrsclub) February 3, 2019 PDSA Spokeswoman Amy Dickin said pigeons were the first to receive Dickin medals. Troops used the feathered fighters to help deliver intelligence, because radio equipment could be unreliable, particularly during heavy fighting. The birds braved fighting, bombs and bullets from enemy soldiers, as well as hawk attacks, in their relentless drive to get home. They carried coded messages in tiny scrolls attached to rings on their legs. Days before D-Day, on June 6, 1944, a pigeon named the Duke of Normandy was dropped into Merville with paratroopers from the 21st Army Group. Their mission was to ensure that four heavy-calibre guns trained directly on Sword Beach were out of action before D-Day, which was to be history’s largest combined land, air and sea operation. The only way to relay the success (or otherwise) of the operation was to release Duke of Normandy with the news. “His journey home took 27 hours and he flew through bullets and bombs,” Ms Dickin said. The Duke’s heroics delivered critical intelligence to Allied Command that saved many lives. Just days after, RAF homing pigeon Gustav, released by Reuters news agency correspondent Montague Taylor, relayed the first news report of the D-Day landings. He travelled 240 kilometres across the English Channel in five hours and 16 minutes with his message. Brian, who completed seven parachute jumps in his army career, was another Dickin Medal recipient. As the D-Day landings began, Brian was parachuted into the town on Ranville, but got stuck in a tree on his way down. Fellow paratrooper Sergeant Ken Bailey cut Brian down, despite being under fire, and the pair fought together over the next few months. After that operation, Brian remained on active duty in occupied Germany but was eventually reunited with his family. His Dickin Medal had the citation: “For excellent patrol work and qualifying as a paratrooper, Airborne Division, Normandy, June 1944.” The 90th anniversary of the D-Day landings has been marked by veterans and world leaders on both sides of the Channel this week."

    "transcript": "Supermarkets in Vietnam have come up with a genius way to reduce plastic packaging: To wrap produce in banana leaves instead. Big supermarket chains, such as Lotte Mart, Saigon Co.op and Big C, got the idea from a supermarket in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai whose initiative went viral when it was posted to the Facebook page of a Chiang Mai real estate agent. The use of banana leaves instead of plastic for packaging vegetables is a great way to reduce single-use plastic. While it appears that some plastic is used for the label, the use of banana leaves greatly reduces the amount of plastic waste generated. They are simply wrapped in the banana leaf and bound using a length of bamboo. According to Forbes, of the nine billion tonnes of plastic ever produced, only 9 per cent has been recycled.

    "transcript": "Firefighters have rescued a miniature donkey that became trapped after falling into a septic tank north of Brisbane. Crews were alerted to the drama on Beaujolais Court, Morayfield,at 6.30pm on Thursday. “We’ve had some different calls over the years, but this is sort of more unusual than what we get up here,” Caboolture fire station’s Scott Marles said. “When we arrived he was fully submerged in the contents of the septic system, so he was up to about his head. “The first thing we did was sort of pump all the waste material out of the septic tank and then at that time we got a special rescue unit on the way. “The problem was because he was in a very confined space we had to organise some slings to get under him. “While it took a while to do, time wise, it wasn’t that difficult a rescue once we worked out what we were going to do.” Mr Marles said the donkey was in good spirits. “Yeah he was fine, we were a bit surprised actually, the owners had some carrots there and he sort of came up and started eating carrots. “Other than being a bit cold and a bit smelly he still had a full appetite. “He didn’t seem to have any injuries as a result of the fall.” Mr Marles said it’s likely the donkey kicked a cover off the septic tank and fell through. “Luckily he was a miniature donkey, which made the job a little easier I suppose. A full size donkey would have been a bit harder with the lifting. “We left [the job of cleaning the donkey] to the owners.”"

    "transcript": "A billionaire technology investor has stunned the entire graduating class at a US university after announcing at their commencement that he will pay off their student loans, estimated at $US40 million ($A58 million). Students gasped and some wept as Robert F. Smith, this year’s commencement speaker at Morehouse College, made the announcement during a speech to nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr Smith, 56, is the founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies. He is also one of America’s most prominent black philanthropists. “On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we’re gonna put a little fuel in your bus,” the investor and philanthropist told graduates in his morning speech on Sunday. “This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans.” This is the exact moment that Robert F. Smith, a self-made billionaire, announced during his commencement speech that he was paying off the students loans of the entire 2019 graduating class at Morehouse College. It amounts to $40 million dollars#MorehouseGrad2019 pic.twitter.com\/tszVFsMYIm — Muhammad Lila (@MuhammadLila) May 19, 2019 The announcement drew stunned looks from staff and students alike. Then the graduates broke into applause and the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it was the single largest gift the college had received. Mr Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $US1.5 million gift to the school. The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $US40 million. Mr Smith said he expected the recipients to “pay it forward” and said he hoped that “every class has the same opportunity going forward”. “Because we are enough to take care of our own community,” he said. “We are enough to ensure that we have all the opportunities of the American dream. And we will show it to each other through our actions and through our words and through our deeds.” In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $US200,000 in student loans – 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations. In an instant, that number vanished. Mr Mitchom, sitting in the crowd, wept. “I was shocked,” he said. “My heart dropped. We all cried. In the moment it was like a burden had been taken off.” His mother, Tina Mitchom, was also shocked. Eight family members, including Mr Mitchom’s 76-year-old grandmother, took turns over four years co-signing on the loans that got him across the finish line. “It takes a village,” she said. “It now means he can start paying it forward and start closing this gap a lot sooner, giving back to the college and thinking about a succession plan” for his younger siblings. Morehouse College president David Thomas said the gift would have a profound effect on the students’ futures. “Many of my students are interested in going into teaching, for example, but leave with an amount of student debt that makes that untenable,” Mr Thomas said. “In some ways, it was a liberation gift for these young men that just opened up their choices.” CNN also quoted Mr Thomas as saying: “When you have to service debt, the choices about what you can go do in the world are constrained. “[The grant] gives them the liberty to follow their dreams, their passions.” -with AAP"

Top honours went to The Netherlands’ Duncan Laurence with his love ballad Arcade, which he performed at the Tel Aviv grand final. “This is to dreaming big, this is to music first always,” the 25-year-old said as he received the iconic glass microphone trophy from last year’s winner Netta. Italy’s Mahmood was runner up with Russian Sergey Lazarev third. Australia’s Kate Miller-Heidke finished ninth with her entry Zero Gravity. The lyrics of Arcade are based on a friend who lost the love of her life, as well as on Laurence’s own experiences. 🇳🇱 The winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 is Duncan Laurence, representing The Netherlands with his song, Arcade! 👉 https:\/\/t.co\/8ppA7om1Py@dunclaurence#DareToDream #Eurovision #NLD pic.twitter.com\/iVduYXZY0y — Eurovision (@Eurovision) May 18, 2019 The Netherlands has won the contest four times before, most recently in 1975. “This can’t be described in words. I can’t write a song about this. My dream came true,” Laurence said. Asked a question related to his sexuality Laurence, who is bisexual said, “I think the most important thing is that you stick to who you are. Just as a human being … stick to what you love, even if you have a different sexuality. “Accept people and love each other for who you are, and dream big.” Italian entry Mahmood’s Soldi is an Italian-language song with one line in Arabic, which won the Sanremo Music Festival earlier this year. Two hundred million people watched the show, according to a spokeswoman for the contest, which was hosted by supermodel Bar Refaeli, broadcaster Erez Tal and television hosts Assi Azar and Lucy Ayoub. Malta’s Michela Pace was the first of the contestants to take the stage with her dance pop song Chameleon and Spain’s Miki was last with his Spanish-language upbeat La Venda. Israel’s Kobi Marimi, who is known for getting emotional, shed tears of joy after his performance but he finished in 23rd place with only 47 points. Iceland’s Hatari, who have spoken out about the conflicting feelings they have about being at the contest in Israel, waited until the end of the show to wave Palestinian flags. The Eurovision contest is strictly apolitical. US icon Madonna, who performed toward the end of the show, also included Palestinian and Israeli flags on the backs of two of her dancers as they held hands, in an apparent call for peace. Her much-anticipated performance came before representatives of the 41 countries which participated in the contest began announcing the allocation of their points. Madonna told Eurovision Song Contest performers: “You’re all winners, no matter what happens. To get here, where you are, was not easy.” “First you had to have a dream and believe in that dream… earn your way to the place you are now and in my opinion that makes a winner,” she said. The German act S!sters got a disappointing 0 points from the public and 32 from the jury of music professionals, finishing 24th out of the 26 finalists. The United Kingdom’s Michael Rice came last after scoring a combined 16 points. -AAP"

    "transcript": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has rejected an 11-year-old girl’s request for the government to conduct dragon research. The girl, identified by NZ media as Victoria, wrote to the popular PM asking to be granted telekinetic powers so she could become a dragon trainer. She even included a $NZ5 note with her letter, either as a fee for service or a bribe to make her wish come true. Responding to Victoria on prime ministerial letterhead, Ms Ardern wrote: “We were very interested to hear your suggestions about psychics and dragons, but unfortunately we are not currently doing any work in either of these areas. “I am therefore returning your bribe money, and I wish you all the very best in your quest for telekinesis, telepathy and dragons. “P.S. I’ll still keep an eye out for those dragons. Do they wear suits?” she added in her own handwriting at the end of the letter. Victoria’s brother posted the letter to social media site Reddit simply with the title: “Received this in the post, turns out my littlest sister (11yo) tried to bribe Jacinda”. He said Victoria had wanted the government to “make [dragons] telekinetic … and wanted to find out what they know about dragons and if they had found any yet, so she could train them”. He explained that her interest in the field stemmed from the Netflix sci-fi series Stranger Things, which features telepathy and telekinesis. Ms Ardern has a bit of form in the area. In March, shortly after the Christchurch mosque shootings, she responded to a letter from an eight-year-old girl who said it would be “good idea to ban dangerous guns”.

    "transcript": "An alleged Russian spy whale found by Norwegian fishermen this week is refusing to leave their port city, in what appears to be a high-profile defection. Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries spokesman Jorgen Ree Wiig has told The Washington Post that the beluga “was the first thing I saw outside of the window” of his patrolling ship in the morning. Speaking from the city of Hammerfest, he said the whale had moved only about 25 nautical miles in the past week and appeared to enjoy being close to humans. That, he said, was strange behaviour for a beluga. The whale was first reported by fishermen, who saw it swimming around their boat in Arctic Norway last week. It was wearing a tight harness with “Equipment St Petersburg” written on the strap, and a camera attachment. Fisherman Joar Hesten jumped into the frigid water to remove the harness, which was later handed to Norway’s special police security agency.  Audun Rikardsen, a professor at the Department of Arctic and Marine Biology at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsoe, said he believed “it is most likely that Russian Navy in Murmansk” was involved. The find has triggered fresh speculation about a sea mammal special operations program that the Russian navy is believed to have pursued for years. According to The Washington Post, the Russian Defence Ministry has denied its existence, but the same ministry did publish a 2016 ad seeking three male and two female bottlenose dolphins and offering to pay $24,000. Russia has major military facilities in and around Murmansk, on the Kola Peninsula, in the country’s far north-west. While the idea of putting sea mammals to work for the military might seem far-fetched, there is actually a precedent. According to The Washington Post, the US spearheaded such a program in the 1950s. The US Navy has its own dolphin and sea lion recruits, which are used to find sea mines, retrieve objects from the ocean floor and gather intelligence for military divers. Meanwhile, Norwegian officials are wondering what to do with their beluga defector. Mr Wiig said one option was to transport it to a sanctuary in Iceland – about 2000 kilometres away. That proposal, he said, might increase chances of “the survival of the whale”. -with agencies"

    "transcript": "Sweet as, bro! A global survey has rated the “outrageously charming” New Zealand accent as the world’s sexiest. Travel site Big 7 Travel says its readers put Newzild on top of 7000 languages and accent variations polled. “The Newzild dialect is outrageously charming. The sexiest accent in the world? It’s official,” the website said. Australians might hear only “fush and chups”, but to most of the world the way Kiwis speak is little different to the accents on this side of the Tasman Sea. “To a novice ear, the New Zealand accent might sound just like the Australian accent,” the website said. Despite that, Australian came in only fifth on the list. But even that came with glowing praise: “Pronouncing words long and slow – and often skipping the ends of them completely – is a real turn on, apparently,” Big 7 Travel said. Rounding out the top 10 were: South African, Irish, Italian, Scottish, French, Spanish, southern US and Brazilian Portuguese. “Afrikaans is a hugely popular accent with many people across the globe, thanks to their unique tones and Saffa slang,” the website said. Different variations of the British accent also made the top 50, with Queen’s English at 12th, the Scouse (Liverpool) tone 32nd and Geordie (Newcastle) 41st. The US also had another mention, with the Boston accent taking out 28th place. “One of America’s most imitated and parodied accents, Boston comes in at almost midway on the world’s sexiest accents,” the website said.

    "transcript": "A woman in Germany who suffered a traumatic brain injury protecting her son during a car crash has stunned doctors by waking from a 27-year-long coma. Since regaining consciousness, Munira Abdulla, who was aged 32 at the time of the accident, has been able to hold conversations with her family and even recite prayers from the Koran despite spending almost three decades in a vegetative state. Doctors believed Ms Abdulla, originally from the United Arab Emirates, would never open her eyes again after the 1991 accident which saw a school bus plough into the car she was travelling in as a  passenger. But her son Omar Webair, whom she was cradling at the time of the crash, never lost hope, telling UAE-based newspaper The National of his amazement at hearing his mother calling his name following an altercation in a hospital room that “caused her a shock”. Mr Webair had been involved in an argument at his mother’s bedside when she began to make “strange sounds”. “I kept calling the doctors to examine her, but they said everything was normal,” he said. “Then, three days later, I woke up to the sound of someone calling my name. It was her. She was calling my name, I was flying with joy; for years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said.” Ms Abdulla made the miraculous recovery in June 2018 and has since been able to respond to questions, and communicate when she’s in pain, albeit with difficulty. When Mr Webair insisted his mother would soon be able to talk again, German doctors believed he was “running wild” with his imagination. “We are only doing rehabilitation to fix her quality of life,” he recalled doctors saying. But over time, Ms Abdulla has become more responsive. “The reason I shared her story is to tell people not to lose hope on their loved ones; don’t consider them dead when they are in such a state,” Mr Webair said. “All those years the doctors told me she was a hopeless case, and that there was no point of the treatment I was seeking for her, but whenever in doubt I put myself in her place and did whatever I could to improve her condition.” Dr Ahmad Ryll, a neurology specialist who treated Ms Abdulla, said the mother-of-one was fed through a tube and underwent regular physical therapy during the coma, to keep her muscles from deteriorating. “Our primary goal was to grant her fragile consciousness the opportunity to develop and prosper within a healthy body, just like a delicate plant which needs good soil to grow,” Dr Ryll said. -with agencies"

    "transcript": "A university student is walking hundreds of kilometres from Melbourne to Canberra to call for more action from Australian leaders on climate change. Shannon Loughnane left his home in Coburg two days ago with a plan to trek along major highways, country roads and mountainous areas to deliver his message to Canberra. He said he hoped his 700-kilometre trek would form part of a wider wave of protests aimed at pressuring leaders who he believed were not doing enough to address the issue. Four months ago, the Melbourne University student made a New Year’s resolution to read more about climate change. He said he was concerned by the issue, but at the time did not know enough about it. As he read more and followed the protests of activists around the world, an urgency set in. “For a while I occupied that ground of feeling very afraid of climate change but only vaguely understanding what it meant,” he said. “As I learnt more I became concerned by the inaction of our government – Australia at the moment performs really poorly on a global scale in terms of what we’re doing for climate change. “This protest for me is about making a very direct plea to governments, and showing up and refusing to be ignored.” The hike will take him through country towns from Yea, Violet Town, Benalla and Wangaratta to Albury, Lankeys Creek, Rosewood and Tumut. Mr Loughnane plans to stop at each town to talk about climate change and garner signatures from any locals passionate about the cause. The petition will ask members of the House of Representatives to declare a climate emergency, aggressively lift emissions reductions, pursue renewable energy, ban the proposed Carmichael Coal mine and other fossil fuel projects, and ratify climate policy into legislation. “I don’t think my protest is going to hold leaders to account, but I hope it’s part of a wider wave of protests and of action that pressures leaders to think about really changing things,” he said. “I think a lot of people would be really shocked to see how far it reaches, and the types of things it’ll affect – from food and water availability to the range of infectious diseases. “It’s really crucial that we all start looking at it as the whole picture.” Mr Loughnane considers himself among a growing number of young people across Australia and the world who are drawing attention to the impacts of climate change. Last month, tens of thousands of young Australians walked out of their classrooms to stage protests across cities and regional towns. According to early results from the ABC’s Vote Compass survey, the environment has proved a major concern among respondents, with 29 per cent considering it to be the most important issue. The results are a significant shift from 2016, where 9 per cent of voters saw it as the most important issue in the election. Climate change is shaping up to be a key issue for the May federal election. Mr Loughnane said he believed debate and protests would make an impact. “I can’t speak for what’s happening in the minds of leaders, but I do think culturally there’s a lot happening,” he said. “The student strikes for climate are amazing, those young people stepping up and demanding change, [it] is really enlightening, and it’s drawing attention to the fact that these young people are going to be affected the most by climate change. “People are starting to tune into that at a rate that I haven’t seen before.” –ABC"

    "transcript": "A young couple who sparked an air and land search of isolated terrain in Australia’s north say one of their biggest fears was attracting saltwater crocodiles. Shantelle Johnson and her partner Colen Nulgit lit spot fires and scratched “HELP” into the mud after their utility became bogged during a fishing trip to the Keep River National Park in the Northern Territory, close to the border with Western Australia. The couple, from the East Kimberley town of Kununurra, and their puppy, Ace, were rescued by search teams at Barra Hole near Marralum on Monday afternoon after being missing for 26 hours. “We tried digging and we tried putting stuff under the tyres but it didn’t budge,” Ms Johnson said. “We were pretty scared and worried, but we were just hoping someone would come.” The couple spent Sunday night in their bogged car but got little sleep. They had earlier spotted crocodile tracks and were worried about the tide bringing the reptiles close to the bank. “We were stuck on the marshland and we were right next to saltwater,” Mr Nulgit said. “Earlier that day we saw two, three croc tracks – they were about five, six metres long. “We stayed in the car the first night and then we saw the water rising. “We grabbed everything and took it about 20, 30 metres from the car.” Luckily, the couple had told family where they were going and when to expect them back. They had very little food but had a carton of water bottles packed. By the time the search team spotted the smoke from their fire and the sign in the mud, the pair was getting worried. “There were thoughts like that going through our heads but we had to think positive,” Mr Nulgit said. “I guess we were both upset but I had to put on my big boy boots and keep her calm and also try to keep myself calm. “When they [the rescuers] came a bit lower to the ground, we jumped out of the car and started to wave them down. “It was overwhelming, emotional yeah … we were pretty happy that we’d made it. Kununurra police praised the couple for staying with their vehicle and letting family know where they were going. “It could have been a different story if they hadn’t done that,” Acting Sergeant Dean Andrzejaczek said. “It’s always a good idea to tell family where you’re going and what time you are expected back.” Mr Nulgit has pledged to invest in car recovery equipment for the next fishing trip."

    "transcript": "Sperm donors could keep on making babies for decades long after they’ve died… if they follow the example of the late “Sir Freddie”, a merino ram whose sperm was taken out of the freezer after 50 years, and used to father a cluster of lambs. They look like their dad, too – a more wrinkled form of Merino that went out of favour years ago because it made the animal vulnerable to flies laying eggs on its body. University of Sydney researchers found the ancient sperm – from four long-dead rams – was as healthy and viable as samples that had been frozen for only 12 months. In fact, the numbers suggest the old fellas had a bit more kick in their tads than contemporary sires. According to a statement from the university, out of 56 ewes inseminated with the ancient seed, 34 were successfully impregnated.  This compares to recently frozen semen from 19 sires used to inseminate 1048 ewes, of which 618 were successfully impregnated. This gives a pregnancy rate of 61 per cent for the 50-year-old semen against 59 per cent for recently frozen sperm, actually a statistically equivalent rate – but who can begrudge a blue ribbon to Sir Freddie. If still alive, he’d be old enough to be great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather to his newborns. “This demonstrates the clear viability of long-term frozen storage of semen. The results show that fertility is maintained despite 50 years of frozen storage in liquid nitrogen,” said Associate Professor Simon de Graaf from the Sydney Institute of Agriculture and School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Sydney. “The lambs appear to display the body wrinkle that was common in Merinos in the middle of last century.” The wrinkles were bred into sheep back then to maximise skin surface and increase the amount of wool the animal could grow. But it also made them vulnerable to infestation. “That style of Merino has since largely fallen from favour as the folds led to difficulties in shearing and increased risk of fly strike,” said Dr de Graaf. The findings are yet to be published, but Dr de Graaf believes they will provide a benchmark and resource when looking “at the genetic progress made by the wool industry over past 50 years of selective breeding. In that time, we’ve been trying to make better, more productive sheep,” he said. The rams were of Ledgworth, Merryville and Boonoke genetics, famous names in the wool industry. The Boonoke ram, “Sir Freddie” was born in 1959 and sold to Ledgworth owned by the Walker family in 1961 for 345 guineas – about $660 in today’s currency. He died in the 1970s but lives on as part of what’s been described as a time capsule project. It was started in 1968, by the late Dr Steven Salamon – a world leader in sperm preservation, and something of a legend for how he survived a Siberian after World War II. Dr Salamon died in 2017. In celebration of the semen’s 50th year and Dr Salamon’s 100th birthday, the semen was thawed and inseminated in ewes as part of the the 2018 Balmoral Sire Evaluation Group, a trial into leading sires suited for fine wool production in western Victoria. Dr Jessica Rickard, a post-doctoral McCaughey Research Fellow in the Sydney Institute of Agriculture, did the original work to determine if the stored semen was viable for artificial insemination. This involved thawing the semen, which is stored as small pellets in large vats of liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees. Dr Rickard and her colleagues then undertook in vitro tests on the sperm quality to determine the motility, velocity, viability and DNA integrity of the 50-year-old sperm. “We believe this is the oldest viable stored semen of any species in the world and definitely the oldest sperm used to produce offspring,” she said."

Peter Tabichi, a member of the Franciscan religious order, won the Varkey Foundation’s 2019 Global Teacher Prize. The British charity focuses on improving the standards of education for underprivileged children. Brother Peter’s award, presented at a ceremony in Dubai on Saturday, recognises the “exceptional” teacher’s commitment to pupils in a remote part of Kenya’s Rift Valley. Brother Peter, 36, gives away 80 per cent of his monthly income to help support pupils who otherwise not be able to buy uniforms or books. Of his pupils at the remote Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School, 95 per cent are from poor families, almost a third are orphans or have only one parent, and many go without food at home. “Turning lives around in a school with only one computer, poor internet, and a student-teacher ratio of 58:1, is no easy task, not least when to reach the school, students must walk seven kilometres along roads that become impassable in the rainy season,” the Varkey Foundation said. Brother Peter started a talent nurturing club at the school, and expanded its science club. In 2018, his students won top honours at the Kenya Science and Engineering Fair, while the mathematical science team qualified for the 2019 INTEL International Science and Engineering Fair 2019 in Arizona. Students have also won an award from The Royal Society of Chemistry after harnessing local plant life to generate electricity. Tears of joy! Can't stop it. Among the TOP 10 GTP finalists?

    "transcript": "A champion racing pigeon dubbed the “Lewis Hamilton of pigeons” has fetched an astonishing $2 million at auction. The price for the champion bird, named Armando, eclipsed the previous record for a racing pigeon of $600,000. He was sold by Belgian pigeon auction house Pipa, which described Armando as the “best Belgian long-distance pigeon of all time”. “It was unreal, the feeling – it was something out of this world,” Pipa chief executive Nikolaas Gyselbrecht told the BBC of the moment someone offered more than €1 million ($A1.6 million). “In our wildest dreams, we had never hoped for a price like that. We hoped for around €400,000 to €500,000, and we only dreamed of €600,000.” Armando, who turns five this year, is now set for a cushy life in retirement and breeding. Mr Gyselbrecht told the BBC that two buyers from China got into a bidding war for the champion bird in the fortnight-long auction that ended on Monday. Offers shot up €532,000 to €1.25 million in just over an hour. To put it all in perspective, he says, the usual price for a racing pigeon is around €2500 ($A4000). But Armando is no ordinary pigeon. In the last three races of his career, he won the 2018 Ace Pigeon championship, the 2019 Pigeon Olympiad and the Angoulême. Breeder Joel Verschoot, of West Flanders, told The South China Morning Post that Armando was born to be a champion but he had never dreamed of such a huge sum being paid for him. “The two Chinese had told me in advance that they absolutely wanted Armando,” he said. “But I didn’t see this coming. This is a crowning glory of all those years in the pigeon sport. The icing on the cake.” Mr Verschoot also bred the previous auction price record-holder – a bird called Nadine that sold to a Chinese property tycoon in 2017.  Armando – Joël Verschoot Joël Verschoot auction started on www.pipa.be – One of the headliners in the auction is Armando Posted by PIPA on Monday, March 4, 2019 Fred Vancaillie, president of the local pigeon fancying association in Perwez, told Belgian broadcaster RTBF that Armando was “the Lewis Hamilton of pigeons” – adding the bird was one of the best in the sport’s history. Mr Gyselbrecht said racing pigeons can carry on having chicks until they’re about 10, and live up to 20 years. So Armando has plenty of time to enjoy his new life. -with agencies"

    "transcript": "The WA town of Nyabing has been fighting a long battle against population decline and, just a few short years ago, faced the dismal prospect of losing its only pub. Using cash raised in a community cropping program, the locals rallied together and bought the run-down establishment to start afresh. After 12 thirsty months without any cold tap beer, the new building finally opened to the public this week and the celebrations began. The Nyabing Community Hub is open for business and the locals could not be happier. They lost their only competitive sport program and came very close to losing their beloved watering hole. But, thanks to some hard work and perseverance, a new place to socialise has been created. A community cropping program, which raised almost $1 million, provided the means for the Nyabing Progress Association to step in and save the crumbling town pub. “We lost our sport to lack of numbers and the pub was slowly dying,” association member Justin Germain said. “Farms have got bigger, there are fewer people, and we have a big generation gap. “The pub had been on the market for a long time and there were no takers, so something had to be done.” Originally the plan was to refurbish the existing building but, once the work began, a whole can of worms opened up. “The window frames were crooked and there were rotting timbers and everything else,” Mr Germain said. “It was in a poor state, so we had to build a new hub.” The finished product is far more than just a licensed tavern. It also features a modern function room, office spaces, and short-term accommodation for people passing through the small agricultural town. The Nyabing Community Hub is modern and sleek, tucked between shops along the main street. The building features eye-catching stone work and a sleek timber bar top. Association member Fiona Hobley said the stone and timberwork were included not just for aesthetic purposes but also as a sentimental addition. “It was lovely to keep the granite rock, which is local to the area, and that has formed a really lovely fireplace, so you have the real earthy feel with the fire and stone,” she said. “And to top it off we have salmon gum timber, which used to be a tree that towered over the main street. “Due to safety, it had to be chopped down. But we get to enjoy its beautiful timber now, right? “We love the natural elements and we live in the elements, so it’s only fitting that our building have a part of that.” Hundreds of people gathered outside the Nyabing Community Hub on Thursday to witness the official opening of their new collaborative space. After weeks of delays, Ms Hobley was relieved to see the open day finally arrive. “I’m absolutely amazed by the number of people who turned up. We knew there would be a lot, but this has exceeded expectations,” she said. “This is a family place that we’ve created, so it’s great to have the children here. “They’ve had to watch us go through the build and, to have it actually done, I think they’re delighted to be inside.” While the new community hub opened this week with plenty of celebratory drinks, the people of Nyabing say it offers much more than a place to unwind. “I think you need a drinking outlet. It’s where people come to let their hair down and get off the farms,” Mr Germain said. “If you don’t have a pub in town, you don’t have much of a town I don’t think.” –ABC"

The global authority on records officially recognised Kane Tanaka in a ceremony at the nursing home where she lives in Fukuoka, in Japan’s southwest. Her family and the mayor were present to celebrate. Tanaka was born Jan. 2, 1903, the seventh among eight children. She married Hideo Tanaka in 1922, and they had four children and adopted another child. She is usually up by 6 am and enjoys studying mathematics. The previous oldest living person was another Japanese woman, Chiyo Miyako, who died in July at age 117. The oldest person prior to Miyako was also Japanese. Japanese tend to exhibit longevity and dominate the oldest-person list. Although changing dietary habits mean obesity has been rising, it’s still relatively rare in a nation whose culinary tradition focuses on fish, rice, vegetables and other food low in fat. Age is also traditionally respected here, meaning people stay active and feel useful into their 80s and beyond. But Tanaka has a ways to go before she is the oldest person ever, an achievement of a French woman, Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to 122 years, according to Guinness World Records. Guinness said the world’s oldest man is still under investigation after the man who had the honours, Masazo Nonaka, living on the Japanese northernmost island of Hokkaido, died in January at 113. -AAP"

    "transcript": "An unmanned capsule from Elon Musk’s SpaceX has splashed down into the Atlantic Ocean after a short-term stay on the International Space Station, capping the first orbital test mission in NASA’s quest to resume human space flight from US soil later this year. After a six-day mission on the orbital outpost, Crew Dragon autonomously detached at 6.30pm on Friday night (AEDT) and sped back to earth reaching hypersonic speeds before a 2.45am (AEDT) splash-down in the Atlantic on Saturday, about 320km off the Florida coast. A SpaceX rocket launched the 5-metre-tall capsule from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida last Saturday. Minutes before splash-down, Crew Dragon deployed its four parachutes, easing some concerns about functionality that both NASA and SpaceX had before the landing. “Everything happened just perfectly, right on time the way that we expected it to,” Benjamin Reed, SpaceX’s director of crew mission management, said in a live stream from California.

The recovery crews are out. They’re on the scene,” said Steve Stich, the crew program’s deputy manager with NASA. A boat was in the zone where Dragon hit the Atlantic and was set to lift the spacecraft out of the water about one hour after splash-down using a crane.

    "transcript": "A man whose four-wheel-drive was stranded in Oregon snow for five days survived by eating packets of taco sauce and starting the engine periodically to warm up. A snowmobiler found Jeremy Taylor, 36, of Sunriver, on Friday and a search and rescue team member who rode to him on a large snow tractor brought him out of the woods, said Sergeant William Bailey, the spokesman for the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office. “Jeremy stayed warm … by periodically starting his vehicle and used a few taco sauce packets he had as food,” the sheriff’s office said. The office had released a missing person’s report for Mr Taylor last Thursday. It said he was known to visit the forested area because he liked to go off-roading. He had last been seen getting petrol in Sunriver last Sunday. On Friday, Mr Taylor told his rescuers he and his dog, Ally, became stuck in deep snow on a US Forest Service road later that same day. He slept in his 4WD and when he woke on Monday, more snow had fallen. He tried to hike out, but the snow was too deep, so Mr Taylor and Ally returned to his vehicle. “Thank you everyone, I’m safe my Ally dog is safe. I really appreciate all the help.

    "transcript": "Chicken kebabs are off the menu for Boris the dog, after the pup’s owners were slugged with a $13,000 vet bill after it ate a wooden skewer, and had to have emergency heart surgery. Owner Allison Lonergan said her family was enjoying a barbecue in early January when they went to fetch the extra chicken skewers from the kitchen bench, only to find them missing – the likely destination being Boris’ belly. “He never steals food. This is the first time he has stolen food from anywhere,” she said. Boris passed some of the chicken skewers and appeared to be in good spirits, until a month later when the pooch started to exhibit some strange behaviour. The family noticed Boris was not acting normally and was lethargic. After multiple vet visits and scans, Ms Lonergan noticed the pup had started coughing up blood. “They gave him a chest X-ray and found that he had fluid around his heart,” she said. Following the X-ray, vets at the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic finally discovered the problem. “The doctor comes out and says, ‘We’ve got a situation – Boris has a kebab skewer in his heart’,” Ms Lonergan said. She said she was told Boris needed emergency surgery, or had to be put down. For Ms Lonergan, it was an easy decision. “He was only 19 months old when this happened. It was just like ‘Nah, just have to do it! We will find a way’.” Manty Arnott from the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic told ABC Local Radio Boris was very lucky. “We assume the skewer turned around and went up through the stomach wall and up through the diaphragm and into the left atrium of the heart,” Dr Arnott said. In a lucky turn of events for young Boris, the North Hobart Veterinary Clinic had a visiting cardiologist in town the day Boris came in. “I think he is incredibly lucky – it was probably the best day for him to be here,” Dr Arnott said. The vet told Ms Lonergan the skewer was millimetres from Boris’ aorta, and one wrong move could have meant another ending to Boris’ tale. Ms Arnott said while it was not rare for a dog to eat something it shouldn’t, the fact that the skewer stayed in Boris for a month before he exhibited poor health was “a freak event”. The Lonergan family is now facing nearly $13,000 in vet bills, and are being extra careful to ensure Boris does not get anywhere near a skewer again. “There are no kebabs to be in this house ever again.” Ms Lonergan said. –ABC"

    "transcript": "Move over Zorro, Robin Hood and The Three Musketeers, there’s a new generation of duelling fencers in France. With the official recognition of lightsaber duelling as a competitive sport by the French fencing federation, young sword-fighters can now channel their inner Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Vader. Unfortunately for the really keen, the LED-lit, rigid polycarbonate replicas of the famed Star Wars lightsaber won’t slice a Sith lord in half. But they look remarkably like the lightsabers that Yoda and others wield in the blockbuster movies. Some of the more expensive sabers are even equipped with chips that emit a throaty electric rumbles – so they sound the part too. “Cape and sword movies have always had a big impact on our federation and its growth,” French Fencing Federation secretary-general Serge Aubailly said. “Lightsaber films have the same impact. Young people want to give it a try.” The physicality of lightsaber combat is part of the reason the federation has thrown its support behind the sport. It is equipping fencing clubs with lightsabers and training would-be lightsaber instructors, while officially recognising the three-minute duels. Like virtuous Jedi knights, the French federation sees itself as combating a Dark Side: The sedentary habits of 21st-century life that are affecting the health of ever-growing numbers of adults and children. “With young people today, it’s a real public health issue. They don’t do any sport and only exercise with their thumbs,” Mr Aubailly said. “It’s becoming difficult to [persuade them to] do a sport that has no connection with getting out of the sofa and playing with one’s thumbs. That is why we are trying to create a bond between our discipline and modern technologies, so participating in a sport feels natural.” But not all of the converts to lightsaber duels are youngsters. Some are more like 49-year-old police officer Philippe Bondi, who was drawn to the idea of acting out the love for Star Wars he’s had since he saw his first film at the age of just seven. Mr Bondi was a fencer for 20 years before switching to lightsaber duelling. He uses a federation-approved lightsaber in luminous green “because it’s the Jedi colours, and Yoda is my master”. “I had to be on the good side, given that my job is upholding the law,” he told USA Today. Mr Bondi was among the competitors at a recent national tournament outside Paris. They fought in a darkened hall, lit by spectacular illuminated swooshes of coloured blades, while fans dressed as Star Wars characters added their own colour. “We wanted it to be safe, we wanted it to be umpired and, most of all, we wanted it to produce something visual that looks like the movies, because that is what people expect,” tournament organiser Michel Ortiz said. Nonetheless, lightsaber duelling counts its paid-up practitioners in France in the hundreds, not thousands – and it has no hope of a place in the Paris Olympics in 2024. But to hear the thwack of blades and see them cut shapes through the air is to want to give the sport a try. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "An unlikely campaign is growing to save a taxidermied five-metre great white shark discovered languishing in a tank in an abandoned wildlife park. Rosie, as the shark has been dubbed, has been alone in her tank at Victoria’s former Wildlife Wonderland since 2012. The shark was captured in tuna fishing nets off South Australia in 1998. Her stuffed body was sent to the park at Bass, south-east of Melbourne, temporarily but she was left there to rot when Wildlife Wonderland closed seven years ago. Earlier in February, Luke McPherson posted footage to his YouTube channel of Rosie languishing in the tank. “I didn’t come here for the shark but was compelled after the park shut down because I came here growing up,” he told the Seven Network. “The tank was huge and in bad condition, with a rusting metal frame and smashed panels of glass and trash thrown inside. “Once I got the light behind the tank I was like ‘wow, that’s creepy.” Mr McPherson said fumes from Rosie’s tank were so bad he could stay in the same room for only a minute.  Mr McPherson’s YouTube footage attracted international attention. It also led to the establishment of the Save Rosie the Shark Facebook page, which has nearly 4000 followers. There have also been some unwelcome visitors for Rosie. “Vandals have trespassed into the private property and tried their best to smash Rosie’s tank. The glass is over three inches (7.5 centimetres) thick, and neighbours believe these vandals have used sledge hammers to try and break the glass,” a post on the Facebook page says. “Large cracks have now appeared and the dangerous liquid, formaldehyde, is slowly seeping from the tank out into the open. “We need to act fast and save Rosie. She needs to be given the final resting place she rightly deserves.” The page’s organiser has urged people not to enter the abandoned wildlife park. “As much as we all want to save Rosie, I do not condone trespassing onto private property to go take videos and photos of her,” they said. “Police locked the shed her tank is in and already vandals have broken the lock to get in. “Please do not go onto this private property. We want to save her remains but do it the proper, legal way.” Police have also implored people to stay out of the abandoned park. “This location is on private property, so we advise the public not to attend the area,” they wrote on the Bass Coast police area’s Eyewatch Facebook page on Friday. “You run the risk of being charged with trespassing offences.”  PLEASE KEEP AWAY Police are aware of a great white shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde in an abandoned location… Nai-post ni Eyewatch – Bass Coast Police Service Area noong Biyernes, Pebrero 15, 2019 The Save Rosie the Shark page’s organiser wants the taxidermied great white to be rescued by a museum or aquarium – or even another wildlife park."

    "transcript": "Forget gel, hairspray or mousse. The latest look for creating dog-show hairstyles is much cooler than any old-fashioned product. It involves ducking your head into freezing water, combing your frozen strands into extravagant shapes and hey presto: instant mohawk volume. Sure, your eyes might freeze and roll out of your head like marbles – but at least you’ll look cool. Every winter since 2011, people from around the world head to Canada’s northern Yukon Territory for the annual International Hair Freezing Contest at the Takhini Hot Springs, usually in February or “any day that it is cold enough”, according to its website. How do you win? Create the most creative frozen hairdo possible by soaking in the hot springs and allowing the steam to accumulate on your head while the cold air freezes your hair. Selfies are compared and the best ‘do is announced in March for a grand prize of $CA750 ($792) and some free soaks.  Frozen hair, don't care #hairfreezingcontest |Video by @coralieullyett #exploreyukon A post shared by  Travel Yukon (@travelyukon) on Mar 21, 2017 at 10:55am PDT  The frozen hairstyle show began as a bit of fun after a long day on the slopes competing in winter sports competitions. People would soothe their weary bodies in the natural hot pools in the evening, and the pools manager would challenge people to create the best frozen hairstyle. Average winter temperatures in the Yukon reach daytime highs of 13 degrees Celsius and lows of -22 degrees Celsius at night – the perfect temperature for hair freezing. The mineral-rich waters are between 36 degrees and 42 degrees, ensuring bathers stay warm despite the temperature outside. But the ice-sculpted styles have taken off in other wintery parts of Canada, including Banff, in south-western Canada. And don’t worry if you don’t happen to have lustrous locks on your head. The cold-snap look also works well on beards and body hair.  #meanwhileincanada #HairFreezingContest #thosecrazycanucks #stuffedbeaver #stuffedbeaverbondi A post shared by  The Stuffed Beaver (@thestuffedbeaverbondi) on Mar 7, 2015 at 11:33pm PST  Contrary to what your mother told you, wet hair can’t directly cause a virus or cold, but it does affect your body temperature, which can eventually lead to sickness. When your hair is wet, the body can struggle to stay warm, which in turn makes your immune system work harder, leaving the body more susceptible to germs and viruses. Management at the Takhini say freezing hair won’t damage it and dipping it back into the hot water thaws it immediately. But before you consider this the “all-clear” to recreate the super-freeze style, some hair stylists warn the freezing temperatures can cause hair breakage, especially for those with curly hair. “When water reaches a freezing point, it solidifies and expands by almost 10 per cent, so when you walk out on a cold day with wet hair, those water molecules that have adhered to the hair’s outer cuticle layer solidify and expand,” hair stylist Becky Marinich told Business Insider. The hair expert behind Aquage Haircare explained the hair shaft can swell and cause the cuticle layer to lift, leaving hair vulnerable to environmental and thermal damage. “When hair freezes, it naturally becomes less pliable – like an icicle, frozen locks can easily snap,”"

    "transcript": "When King, a wire fox terrier, won best in show honours at the 143rd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Tuesday night, it was not a crowd-pleasing announcement. Boos and grumbles filled Madison Square Garden when the judge handed King the coveted pewter cup. The victory for King, the No.1-ranked terrier last year, was a victory for convention. Of the 112 best in show titles awarded at Westminster, wire fox terriers have now won 15 times, more any other breed. Next closest are Scottish terriers, with eight wins. As a group, terriers have a record at Westminster that even the most storied sports dynasties would covet. The terrier group has been awarded best in show 47 times, making them the New England Patriots of the dog show world. I know nothing about this but if this isn’t a world record time I wanna know what is pic.twitter.com\/bSKp1BasR5 — Jamie Bartlett (@JamieJBartlett) February 10, 2019 “After you win this show, there’s really nothing else to do,” King’s handler, Gabriel Rangel, said when asked what King would do next after the win. “He should be running around in some grass field.” King beat an intriguing group of contenders: Burns, a long-haired dachshund; Bono, a Havanese; Baby Lars, a bouviers des Flandres; Wilma, a boxer; and Bean, a Sussex spaniel. Judging by the vocal reaction, the crowd was hoping for a somewhat less predictable, and more fun, winner – a dog like Bean, perhaps. When he ambled around the show ring, the crowd erupted, chanting, “Bean, Bean, Bean!” “It was unbelievable,” Bean’s handler, Per Ingar Rismyhr, said. “He definitely feeds off of that. He feels the energy. How could you not? He tries to play it cool but he really kind of likes it. Right, Bean?” Bean did not answer. He was playing it cool. While the finish was unsurprising, there was drama before Tuesday’s events even began. A day after winning the nonsporting group and a place as one of the seven finalists, Colton, a schipperke, was ruled ineligible for best in show because of a conflict of interest between the dog’s owners and the Best in Show judge, Peter Green. Colton was allowed to walk on to the green carpet for the final judging before being awkwardly excused from the ring. #wkcdogshow #BestAtHomeContest How Kennedy watches the dog show pic.twitter.com\/ssUF9oRE1m — Kelsey (@wizardkelz) February 13, 2019 As a result, only six dogs competed for best in show, one fewer than usual. “It’s not the first time it’s happened at a best in show, but it’s the first time at this show,” Crista Cook, Colton’s handler, said. “If you have any business relationship with a judge and an owner, you shouldn’t compete.” Cook characterised the connection between Colton’s owners and the judge’s family as a distant one. The winner of the Non-Sporting group is Colton the Schipperke! #WKCDogShow pic.twitter.com\/u4xu8ak4uR — Westminster Dog Show (@WKCDOGS) February 12, 2019 Colton had already made a mark on the show on Monday, becoming the first of his breed to win the non-sporting group. His win was especially significant given the fiercely competitive group, albeit one that is akin to an island of misfit toys. The dogs in the other groups – sporting, hound, working, terrier, toy and herding – have clearly defined historical roles, but the non-sporting group is a collection of the leftovers: Those who don’t assist hunters, sniff out vermin, guard livestock, herd sheep or serve as pint-size companions. “It’s rare to ever win the group,” Ms Cook said. “We’re often overlooked going against the bulldogs, poodles and bichon frise.” That made Colton’s disqualification particularly painful. Who knows when the chance to compete for best in show at Westminster will come again? However, for King and future kings, the odds are good.

    "transcript": "A UK forestry worker was left perplexed when he encountered large, wheel-like snow formations trailing tracks across his farm field in south-west England. Brian Bayliss, 51, originally thought the formations were man-made. That was until he realised there were no footprints in the pristine snow surrounding the bizarre, doughnut-like circles. He told the BBC he had “never seen anything like it before”. As Mr Bayliss got closer to the wheels, he said he “could see the sun through the middle, and they just made no sense”. But thankfully there’s a rational explanation. The weird wheels of snow, while extremely rare, are a naturally forming phenomenon commonly known as “snow rollers”. Also known around the world as “snow bales”, “wind snowballs” or “snow donuts”, it is believed the rollers are formed only when a combination of ideal wind conditions combine with certain terrain to  blow bundles of snow along. The wheels of snow gather in size along the way, resulting in a wheel-like shape with distinct track behind it. In the past few years, snow rollers have appeared in the US, Canada, and Scotland. They’re most likely to be found in a place with a slope, which can help the snow roll. It is thought that if the wind is too strong, or too weak, or the snow is too tightly packed, snow rollers will not form. BBC weatherman Ian Fergusson said weather conditions need to be almost perfect for snow rollers to form. “These are truly beautiful photos of a very rare meteorological phenomenon – called snow rollers or snow bales. Brian was very lucky to see these,” Mr Fergusson was quoted as saying. “Conditions have to be just right for snow rollers to occur: A smooth, un-vegetated hillside, such as in this case near Marlborough, enhances the chance of them being formed. “A layer of thin snow, settled atop existing ice and not sticking to it, combined with specific temperature, moisture level and wind speed, are fundamental to the creation of these natural oddities.” -with agencies"

    "transcript": "Hundreds of Marilyn Monroe impersonators have claimed a new world record on a sweltering Adelaide day before going for a dip in the ocean to raise tens of thousands of dollars for cancer research. Marilyn Jetty Swim organisers said about 270 women, men and children dressed as the Hollywood icon at Brighton beach this morning, enough for Guinness to create the new record of most people dressed as Marilyn Monroes in one location. They were all dolled up in the star’s iconic white frock with wigs and make-up, including her distinctive beauty mark. Organiser Sarah Tinney said there were even more people interested in dressing up, but she had to turn them away because there simply were not enough wigs in Adelaide. “Pretty much we have sold out of every decent wig – and bad wigs – out of SA,” Ms Tinney said. “We have got them from Murray Bridge, from very far and wide. “We are looking for wig sponsors – we need to get wigs and swimsuits in.” Photos were taken of each individual Marilyn as well as a group photo of what was dubbed the “gaggle” of Marilyns, which will be sent to Guinness World Records as evidence of the event. The event is in its sixth year, but this was the first time a record attempt was made. Organisers said about $65,000 had already been raised this year for the Cancer Council SA, and they were on track to top $100,000 in total. Many of the Marilyns have gone through – or are currently living through – cancer treatment themselves. “Most people on the planet unfortunately have been quite directly affected by cancer in some way,” Ms Tinney said. “One of our swimmers couldn’t compete today because she felt unwell and couldn’t enter the water.” The gathering of the Marilyns has been held on the sidelines of the Brighton Jetty Classic ocean swim every year since 2014, but this swim is far from an athletic competition. The participants paddled around the jetty at a slow pace, crossing the finish line as one group while holding hands. “It’s a sisterhood … we actually get ready at my house nearby,” Ms Tinney said. “We have a team of make-up artists that help us get this look.” A new world record!

    "transcript": "Melbourne researchers have developed a house brick that uses up to 50 per cent less energy when being fired. It’s also lighter than your everyday clinker, is very strong, takes heavy metals out of the environment, is more porous and so promotes heat insulation – and would make the construction industry more eco-friendly. And it would significantly free up landfill. The catch? It’s a psychological one in the public mind. The new brick, developed by RMIT University scientists, is made using biosolids, the sludgy remains of sewage after it goes through the wastewater treatment process. In other words, what you drop into your toilet has the potential to build walls and make the world a more sustainable place. The US produces about 7.1 million tonnes of biosolids a year, while the EU produces more than 9 million tonnes. In Australia, 327,000 tonnes of biosolids are produced annually. While some biosolids are used in agriculture as fertiliser (in dry form it looks like soil) most of it ends up in landfill or storage. This has proved unsustainable for Melbourne Water and its treatment plants. Last May the body announced it has trucked its millionth tonne  of biosolids from its eastern treatment plant to a landfill rehabilitation project – but it said it had hopes that the construction industry might one day use biosolids in bricks and offer a permanent solution to the problem. Those hopes have been nurtured for a long time. Melbourne Water trialled biosolid bricks 15 years ago in partnership with a South Australian brick company. The results were encouraging and the construction industry wasn’t turned off by the idea. But the bricks weren’t durable, and for Melbourne Water it was back to the drawing board. Eventually Associate Professor Abbas Mohajerani, from RMIT’s school of engineering, took up the challenge. Dr Mohajerani had previously experimented with making bricks and asphalt from cigarette butts. “There are six trillion of them littering the world,” he said in an interview that suggested he regards cigarette butts as a personal affront, and hasn’t given up on the idea of making them useful. He’s become similarly passionate about biosolids and how it can be used to conserve resources in the brick industry. “More than 3 billion cubic metres of clay soil is dug up each year for the global brickmaking industry, to produce about 1.5 trillion bricks,” he told The New Daily. “I tried to visualise what that means… and worked out it is the equivalent of 1000 soccer fields turned into a hole 440 metres deep.” With funding from RMIT, Melbourne Water and the Australian government Research Training Program, Dr Mohajerani became the lead investigator in producing a biosolid brick that has proved technically viable. He said the research tested the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fired-clay bricks incorporating different proportions of biosolids, from 10 to 25 per cent. The biosolid-enhanced bricks passed compressive strength tests and analysis demonstrated heavy metals were largely trapped within the brick. Also, the biosolids bricks were more porous than standard bricks, giving them lower thermal conductivity – and would make households more environmentally sustainable. The research also showed brick-firing energy demand was cut by up to 48.6 per cent for bricks incorporating 25 per cent biosolids. “This is because of the organic content of the biosolids and so could considerably reduce the carbon footprint of brick manufacturing companies,” Dr Mohajerani said. But how soon could these bricks come on the market? Dr Mohajerani said he hoped that government building codes could confidently mandate a conservative 15 per cent biosolids component in house bricks in the near future – based on the success of the research. But without the political will, “It would take another 20 years” and the problems dogging water treatment plants would only be compounded. A spokeswoman from Melbourne Water said there would be “further work and development around this exciting research”."

    "transcript": "Emma and Neville Jackson woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of their screaming 14-year-old son, only to discover he had been attacked by a three-metre-long snake. Ryan, who lives on a cattle station south of Weipa, was woken to the “aggressive” scrub python coiled around his arm, sinking its teeth into his hand. “We’ve gone running to see what’s going on and Ryan had his arm in the air screaming in pain with a scrub python wrapped around it,” Ms Jackson said. “It was trying to eat his hand. “We wrestled with it but the more we kept trying, the more the head would inch its way up and it would sink its teeth in higher and higher.” The 14-year-old said his parents saved him with some creative thinking. “They used a platypus money box … they used the platypus’s beak to shove it in the snake’s bottom jaw and my dad tried to push the snake’s mouth forward to lift it off my hand,” he said. Ms Jackson said it took about 10 minutes to prise the “hungry” reptile from their son’s arm. “We’ve taught our children not to fear snakes because they’re everywhere, but this one was hungry and aggressive and not keen to let go,” she said. “It was a shock,” Ryan added. Ms Jackson said it was lucky the snake did not go into the room of her four-year-old daughter Trixie-Bell. “Ryan took one for the team in a way because I think the snake would have killed her. The aggression behind that snake, it would have taken her,” she said. Although his parents strongly believed it was a harmless scrub python that took hold of their son, they wanted to get him to hospital to make sure. “Ryan’s hand was instantly swollen, and he was in a lot of pain and there was a fair bit of blood,” Ms Jackson said. “We did the snake bite bandage just in case, because if it was venomous, we’re in the middle of remote Cape York. “We were pretty confident it was a scrub python but we’re not experts, so we drove to Weipa and the Royal Flying Doctors took Ryan to Cairns Hospital.” After an overnight stay, the hospital staff let Ryan go with some antibiotics. “Ryan handled the whole thing brilliantly and he’s doing well,” Ms Jackson said. “Since then my husband’s put some chicken wire on the window and we’ve been doing some cleaning to check the dark corners to make sure there’s no visitors hiding.” The family said the attack was a reminder of the dangers that come with living in Australia and that we all needed to be aware of the threat snakes could pose. “I don’t do anything too different now, but I check my room every night,” Ryan said. “I’m not really scared of snakes I’m just more cautious of them.” –ABC"

    "transcript": "In what must have been a risky and terrifying opportunity to escape her kidnapper after three months of hell in a cabin in rural Wisconsin, 13-year-old Jayme Closs managed to break free, find help and is now recovering at home with relatives. Looking frail, dishevelled with matted hair and wearing shoes too big for her, Jayme spotted a woman, Jeanne Nutter, walking her dog on a nearby snow-covered street on Thursday afternoon. Jayme yelled out: “Please help me! I don’t know where I am! I’m lost!” Ms Nutter recognised Jayme immediately due to the enormous public campaign to find her after she disappeared from her home town of Gordon, some 120 kilometres away, on October 15 after her parents James and Denise were shot dead and the front door was left open. “I just kept telling myself ‘Don’t let her know I’m scared, just talk calmly, walk calmly’,” she told reporters. The Good Samaritan rushed to the front door of local residents Peter and Kristin Kasinskas, who also recognised the missing girl saying, “This is Jayme Closs!”, according to the Star Tribune of Minneapolis. “Call 911!” Jayme told them she had been held captive in a cabin and didn’t know where she was or anything about Gordon. “She said that this person’s name was Jake Patterson, ‘He killed my parents and took me’,” Ms Kasinskas said. “She did not talk about why or how. She said she did not know him.” Jayme’s grandfather Robert Naiberg said in a telephone interview on Saturday that no one in the family knew Patterson. “He didn’t know Jayme. He didn’t know [parents] Denise or Jim,” Naiberg said. “[Jayme] don’t know him from Adam. But he knew what he was doing. We don’t know if he was stalking her or what. Did he see her somewhere?” Jayme is now speaking to investigators, but it is not clear what the conditions were like inside the cabin, what she was fed, whether she was assaulted and how she managed to escape. Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald says Jayme is the hero in this case, naming her kidnapper as 21-year-old Jake Thomas Patterson who, less than 15 minutes later, was in custody after police pulled over his car based on Closs’s description. “Jayme is the hero in this case. She’s the one who helped us break this case,” Sheriff Fitzgerald told a news conference on Saturday (AEDT). “The suspect was out looking for her when law enforcement made contact with him,” he said. He said Patterson worked for just two days at a local turkey factory, where both Jayme’s parents worked, but he was unable to provide details on how he knew about her or whether there was a “social media connection”. FBI officers were currently combing every room of the cabin to collect evidence while Jayme spent just 24 hours in hospital before being discharged. Special agent in charge of the FBI’s Milwaukee Division Justin Tolomeo said: “We needed a break in this case.” “It was Jayme herself who gave us that break.” Watch Barron County Sheriff’s Office press conference in full:   BREAKING NEWS – Live news conference on Jayme Closs case. Posted by WEAU 13 News on Friday, January 11, 2019 Hundreds of law enforcement officers from different agencies worked around the clock to find Jayme, sifting through thousands of tips but finding nothing. Almost 1500 volunteers, roughly half the population of Barron (3400), located 145 kilometres north-east of Minneapolis, combed cornfields and wooded areas refusing to give up the search for Jayme. Patterson, a resident of Gordon, was charged on Friday with allegedly kidnapping and murdering James and Denise Closs with a shotgun. “The suspect had specific intentions to kidnap Jayme and went to great lengths to prepare to take her,” said Sheriff Fitzgerald. “I know all of you are searching for the answer why any of this happened,” Sheriff Fitzgerald said. “Believe me, so are we.” Jayme’s aunt and godmother, Jennifer Smith, told Good Morning America she just cried “lots of happy tears” after hearing the news her niece had been located. She has since shared on social media the first photo of herself with Jayme and her dog, Molly, – a picture of the duo being reunited at the hospital on Saturday morning (AEDT), saying: “We said we’d never give up, and we didn’t.” About 350 people under the age of 21 are kidnapped by strangers in the United States each year, according to FBI data. Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped for nine months in 2002, posted on her Instagram account she was thrilled Jayme had survived her horrific ordeal, describing her as a “brave, strong and powerful survivor”.  What a miracle!!! Jayme Closs has been found!!!! I’m so thrilled to hear the news. What has been such a heart wrenching tragedy finally has some happiness in the story. I’m praying for Jayme and all her family that they can have a joyous reunion and as the rest of the country celebrates alongside this happy occasion we all are mindful to give the family their space and privacy on their road to finding a new sense of normal and moving forward. I have no doubt Jayme and her family will forever appreciate the efforts and prayers of the many thousands of people who contributed and kept them in their thoughts and prayers! I hope we may all continue to support and embrace Jayme as she reclaims her life and comes to terms with the reality of her situation. What a brave, strong, and powerful survivor!!!! No matter what may unfold in her story let’s all try to remember that this young woman has SURVIVED and whatever other details may surface the most important will still remain that she is alive. May god bless you Jayme Closs and may we all continue to search for every missing child. #miracleshappen #novictimblaming #hope #findingnormal #survivor #strong #brave A post shared by  Elizabeth Smart (@elizabeth_smart_official) on Jan 11, 2019 at 4:00am PST  Patterson, 21, will appear on Monday in Barron County Circuit Court, where he will be charged with kidnapping and two counts of first-degree intentional homicide for allegedly gunning down Jayme’s parents in the early morning hours of October 15. -with agencies"

    "transcript": "Australian researchers have developed a groundbreaking drug which holds hope of treating the debilitating and fatal motor neurone disease. The result of 15 years of work has been tested on 32 patients in Melbourne and Sydney and showed it could slow the progression of the disease, rather than just treat the symptoms. “It is a huge breakthrough,” Professor Ashley Bush, chief scientific officer of collaborative medicinal development and director of the Melbourne Dementia Research Centre, said on Friday. “This is the first human evidence for a disease-modifying drug for motor neurone disease,” he said. “We look forward to confirming the positive results in a larger study soon.” After six months, the copper-delivery drug CuATSM showed the progression of the disease in patients slowed by about 70 per cent. Participants had improved lung function and cognition and a reduction in the decline of their motor disability. Motor neurone disease is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease with the death of brain cells which control muscle movements, eventually causing paralysis. Patients usually die of respiratory failure within three years of diagnosis and there are no treatments or therapies available. Researchers plan a larger, second stage trial to confirm the drug’s effectiveness in mid to late 2019. “It is gratifying to see such promising results made possible by collaborative fundamental research at the interface between chemistry and biology,” University of Melbourne Professor Paul Donnelly said. The drug is also being tested on patients with Parkinson’s disease. The research comes after the establishment of the Fight MND organisation in 2014 by co-founder and former Melbourne Football club coach Neale Daniher. Mr Daniher went public with his diagnosis and battle with the disease to raise funds and awareness to help find a cure. The findings, by researchers from the Florey Institute and University of Melbourne, were presented at the International Symposium on ALS\/MND in Glasgow, Scotland. -AAP"

    "transcript": "A central Queensland barista has come up with an innovative way of selling her idyllic seaside business that will see the new owner pick it up for just $50. Rachael Willson is raffling off her custom-made coffee caravan named Ruby, sparking interest from around Australia, and even as far afield as Germany. Ms Willson first parked the 1950s replica beside the Ross Creek boat ramp at Yeppoon on Queensland’s Capricorn Coast about five years ago after it was built over nine months by a local carpenter. She has since grown a vibrant community and a diverse circle of friends around the little blue and white van. “I always get a little bit of itchy feet and I’ve had a lot of customers who’ve said to me they’d love to have a little business like Ruby,” she said. “But financially, for a lot of people, [starting or buying a business] can be a bit of a strain.” Having read about similar raffles around the world, Ms Willson said she loved the idea and wanted to be the first in Queensland to do it. “It gives everybody the chance to throw their hat in the ring and I’d love to see it go to somebody that wants it more for passion than financial [reasons], because she’s [Ruby‘s] got to be loved,” Ms Willson said. At $50 a ticket, the entry includes a water colour portrait print of Ruby Caravan by local artist, Belinda Reid. Ms Willson hopes to sell 1900 tickets, which is the number of available prints, to raise $95,000. “I probably would’ve made more money by a traditional sale, but where’s the fun in that?” Ms Willson said. “I like to help the community and watching people getting excited about what they would do if they won her … it’s a bit of a thrill.” Commercial sales agent and buyer’s broker Bruce Coudrey said Ms Willson’s plan was a “gutsy” way of overcoming the supply-versus-demand challenge that faced many small business owners who wanted to sell up, especially those in regional areas. “To get your business out there and stand out from the crowd, this is a really clever technique,” Mr Coudrey said. “You’ve got to try these sorts of things, otherwise it’s going to be very hard for a buyer to find it because there are so many others [businesses] to look at. “We reckon that there’s currently 41,000 businesses for sale across Australia right now and there’s not 41,000 buyers looking to buy small businesses.” Mr Coudrey, whose national agency has sold more than 4000 businesses since 1995, said the childcare sector was about the only industry where the number of buyers outstrip sellers. He said another common hurdle the raffle method would also remove was the issue of finance. “It’s probably not an easy business for a bank to lend money on, so even if a buyer wanted to buy it, getting money from a bank wouldn’t be easy, especially since the royal commission, that’s really tightened up lending,” Mr Coudrey said. However, he said he did not expect raffling off businesses to become commonplace. “When you sell a normal business, there’s a lot of little things you need to cover like restriction of trade, gift vouchers, especially with leased premises – there’s a lot of disclosure documents that need to be completed,” he said. “But for a caravan like this, it works perfectly.” Ms Willson said drawing a winner would be bittersweet, as she is still not used to the idea of giving up her days with Ruby, named after her great grandmother. “I very often open up and see someone sleeping in their car, so you do find a lot of people who have amazing stories, hardship stories,” she said. “Hopefully she’ll stay here in Yeppoon so I get to see her, but if not, I’m just going to have to embrace her new adventure.” And it is not just the caravan she will miss. Ms Willson has developed some special friendships with many of her regular customers. One of those is grey nomad and sailing enthusiast, John Amber. Mr Amber drove his campervan into the Ross Creek car park about two years ago and has spent every morning since perched on the park bench, watching the customers come and go. The 66-year-old was the first to buy a ticket in the raffle but said he has no plans of coming out of retirement. “The moment they call out my name, there’ll be a For Sale sign right beside it,” Mr Amber said. Too tall to stand up straight inside the van, Mr Amber said if Ruby ended up leaving Yeppoon, it was likely he would pull up stumps and continue north on his own caravan adventure. “I’d move on. I’ve got the old bus over there and I better get somewhere before it rusts out,” Mr Amber said. The raffle will be drawn via a computerised lottery system by Ms Willson’s solicitors when all 1900 tickets are sold. –ABC"

    "transcript": "The beach can seem like the ultimate destination at any time on the long, hot days of the Australian summer. But the desire to cool off with a dip in the ocean can end in tragedy – and already has for far too many people this summer. A horrifying spike in drownings started in December and shows no signs of slowing in the early days of 2019. At least nine people have drowned in Australia since Christmas Eve – including two in Victoria this week and one each in NSW, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia. The loss of so many lives has prompted renewed desperate pleas from emergency services and Surf Life Saving Australia for beachgoers to follow the most basic of rules: Always swim at a patrolled beach, between the flags. SLSA says swimmers must also know how to spot a rip – the No.1 danger on Australian beaches. “Rips can change shape and location quickly and may be difficult to see,” the organisation wrote on its Facebook page on December 29. “Always stop to check for rips before you go into the water.”  Tragically two lives lost on our coast Christmas Day. More warm weather on the way. Please be safe on, in and around our… Posted by Surf Life Saving Australia on Tuesday, December 25, 2018 On Tuesday, Life Saving Victoria said it rescued four people from a rip at Venus Bay in eastern Victoria, just four kilometres from the local surf life saving club. A fifth person was saved by volunteer guards while swimming between the flags. “We saw an increase in the strength and frequency of rip currents last season, so it’s important that people become familiar with how to identify, avoid and escape rip currents,” LSV acting life saving operations manager Kane Treloar said. “They can occur at all beaches, even in bays.” He urged beachgoers looking for relief from the hot weather to draw a line in the sand when they get to the beach – and to stop, look and plan before rushing into the water. “It’s also important that people realise just how dangerous beaches can be, even when the weather is nice,” he said.  Associate Professor Rob Brander, from the University of New South Wales, told the ABC that surf life savers’ red and yellow flags were an extremely effective way to keep people safe, but it was not possible to patrol every stretch of beach on the Australian coastline. “It is rare for people to drown between the flags, but we simply don’t have enough flags,” Professor Brander said. “We hear the message to swim between the flags so often that we kind of switch off, and there’s a dangerous complacency about swimming at unpatrolled beaches. “If you don’t understand things like rip currents and dangerous breaking waves, and you are not a good swimmer, you are at such incredible risk when you swim at an unpatrolled beach.” Gold Coast chief lifeguard Warren Young said patrolled areas offered the greatest security for swimmers. “We are really saying ‘go where the guardians are’ – where the life guards and professional people are and the life savers,” Mr Young told the ABC. “If you go for a swim on an open beach on this coastline and if you are not a surfer or an experienced surf life saver and you have no floatation and your kids get into trouble, someone’s going to drown.” Information about patrolled beach locations and times is available at beachsafe.org.au, and by downloading the Beachsafe app."

    "transcript": "Another year is over and we say goodbye to a mixed 2018 punctuated by political manoeuvrings and scandals, tragedies and heroic triumphs, and angry tweets and global uncertainty. While we don’t have access to a crystal ball, The New Daily has identified more than a few reasons to look forward to 2019. Game of Thrones fans are looking forward to their long wait to end with the final instalment from Westeros expected in April. Winter is well and truly here, and the show’s producers have not only promised answers to all the tantalising\/irritating questions posed in the previous seven seasons, they’ll also give us the the bloodthirsty final battle we’ve been waiting for. As Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) told Entertainment Weekly in November, the final battle “makes the Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park”.  While Canberra bears little resemblance to the Westeros capital of Kings Landing, the political bloodshed and recriminations spawned by the  Liberal leadership spill in August was worthy of a Game of Thrones plot. Regardless of political machinations, Australians will have their own chance to decide who leads their nation when they go to the polls for a federal election this year. While the date is yet to be announced, an election must be held by May at the latest. And if the polls are to be believed, Bill Shorten could be prime minister with a landslide victory in less than six months. While 2018 was plagued by talk of an impending housing market collapse, low wage growth and record household debt, much of that has overlooked a fairly important detail: Australia’s economy remains a “standout” among developed economies. Global consultancy firm Deloitte pointed out in October that “Australia’s economy remains on a steady trajectory” despite the nation’s seemingly unending political turmoil. The Reserve Bank agrees, noting in its November statement on monetary policy that “domestic economic conditions have been a bit stronger” than predicted in the previous statement in August. There could also be good news for pay packets in 2019, with the RBA predicting a “modest pick-up” in wages, supported by the steady falls in unemployment seen through the past year. Deloitte shared this view, as did the OECD in its economic forecast summary from November, adding the RBA will need to monitor its policies as wages increase. And if you were worried about the value of your home, the “crash” that Australia’s property market has been supposedly barrelling toward will probably turn out to be something of a “soft landing” this year, according to property expert Michael Yardney. “I’m calling it a soft landing because there are very few forced sales at present, and only recently (December 2018) APRA have lifted their restrictions on interest-only loans to investors and the RBA Governor has encouraged the banks to lend more,” he said in an article published on December 26. This year, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk’s ambitious plan to revolutionise the global internet is expected to take another leap as SpaceX looks into raising a further $US500 million ($710 million) in private equity to make his plan to take the internet to the developing world a reality. Called Starlink, the project will see Space X launch 12,000 satellites to create a network of delivering the world wide web to every corner of the world. Gamers will rejoice as yet another console is rendered redundant by the possible release of Sony’s next-generation PlayStation 5 (PS5). Shawn Layden, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, recently confirmed to German website, Golem.de, to expect the PS5 in 2019. Speculation as to what it will offer has raged ever since. With a women’s World Cup looming, 2019 might be the year Australia stakes its claim to having the world’s best footballer. Sam Kerr was nominated for the inaugural female Ballon d’Or in 2018, but lost out to Norway’s Ada Hegerberg. TND’s sports editor Francis Leach says Kerr is every bit as good as Hegerberg and if she plays with the full range of her talent at June’s World Cup in France, she will become Australia’s most celebrated sports star, and the Matildas its most venerated team.  English cricket fans, meanwhile, are salivating at the prospect of hounding the “cheating Aussies” when they arrive to defend the Ashes in August. While current performances from Tim Paine’s Australian team has been underwhelming, the potential return of the “Cape Town trio” of David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft significantly boosts the baggy green batting stocks and makes them a real chance to retain the urn, despite the howls of derision and the insults that will rain down upon them wherever they go. If Australia can win the Ashes in England after all that has gone on, it would be one hell of an achievement. In cycling, Richie Porte has been considered a potential Tour de France winner for a number of years but it hasn’t come together for him so far. Leach says it’s now or never from the pocket rocket from Launceston, Tasmania, after he abandoned the 2018 Tour after breaking his collarbone on Stage 9. At 33 years of age, Porte will not get a better chance to join Cadel Evans as an Australian cycling legend by winning the world’s most celebrated race."

    "transcript": "The US government may be partially shut down, but that won’t stop hundreds of volunteers dressed in Christmas hats and military uniforms from taking calls from children across the world who want to know when Santa will be coming. The military says the NORAD Tracks Santa won’t be affected by the government shutdown because it is run by volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado and is funded by the Department of Defence budget that was approved earlier this year. Now in its 63rd year, the Santa tracker became a Christmas Eve tradition after a mistaken phone call to the Continental Air Defence Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1955. CONAD, as it was known, had the serious job of monitoring a far-flung radar network for any sign of a nuclear attack on the US. When Colonel Harry Shoup picked up the phone that day, he found himself talking not to a military general, but to a child who wanted to speak to Santa Claus. A Colorado Springs newspaper had run an ad inviting kids to call Santa but mistakenly listed the hotline number. Colonel Shoup figured out what had happened and played along. The tradition has since mushroomed into an elaborate operation that attracts tens of thousands of calls every year. For the 1500 civilian and military volunteers who will answer the phones for kids calling 1-877-HI-NORAD, it infuses the holiday with childlike wonder. “They’re all really sweet, small voices,” said Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer the phones in two previous years. The North American Aerospace Defence Command – a joint US-Canadian operation based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that protects the skies over both countries – has taken over the Santa tracker since the tradition started. The military command centre embraced and expanded the Santa-tracking mission and has been rewarded with a bounty of goodwill and good publicity. In the event of a government shutdown, NORAD will continue with its 63-year tradition of NORAD Tracks Santa on Dec. 24. Military personnel who conduct NORAD Tracks Santa are supported by approximately 1,500 volunteers who make the program possible each and every year. pic.twitter.com\/fY0oyjrdDc — NORAD & USNORTHCOM (@Norad_Northcom) December 21, 2018 Last year, NORAD Tracks Santa drew 126,000 phone calls, 18 million website hits, 1.8 million followers on Facebook and 179,000 more on Twitter. It takes 160 phones to handle the calls that pour in. New volunteers get a playbook that briefs them on the questions kids might ask. Big screens on the walls show a Santa icon making blistering progress around the globe. US and Canadian officers do live TV interviews from the phone rooms. “It really gets you into the Christmas spirit,” said Hill, a student at Mississippi State University who got involved through Air Force family members stationed in Colorado Springs. One year, she took a call from a boy who began reading a very long Christmas list. “I remember having to cut him off after the 10th present or so,” she said, explaining to him that she had to take calls from other children. Sometimes the volunteers have to handle the unexpected. In 2012, a child from Newtown, Connecticut, asked if Santa could bring extra toys for families who had lost children in the mass shooting that year at Sandy Hook Elementary. -AP"

    "transcript": "A painting that was stolen during World War II and later spent decades in a US home will be returned to an art museum in Ukraine. The FBI seized the painting after a retired couple in Connecticut transported it to Washington to be auctioned last year. The couple, David and Gabby Tracy, had long cherished the painting but figured it was a copy, not the signed original. The 2.2-metre by 2.6-metre painting depicts the 16th century Russian czar Ivan the Terrible looking crestfallen as he flees the Kremlin on horseback. What a fascinating story! So is still yto be uncovered about the Nazi art theft, especially about smaller scale robberies in occupied territory like my birth country of Ukraine. The generosity of the painting’s owner’s in returning it is deeply moving. https:\/\/t.co\/QfaAhASTnB — Nana Gongadze (@NanaGongadze) December 22, 2018 It had been left behind in a Ridgefield home that David Tracy bought in 1987. The previous couple in the home said the painting was already there when they purchased the house from a Swiss man in 1962. When Tracy and his wife moved to a different house in the area, they paid $52,500 to add a sunroom big enough to display the painting. “This painting was a beautiful painting, and we treasured it,” Gabby Tracy, 84, said on Saturday. “You couldn’t help but admire the fine painting, what detail was in Ivan’s face.” But as they made plans to move to a condominium in Maine last year, they realised the painting wouldn’t fit. They hired an auctioning company near Washington to sell the work, which was appraised at about $US5000 ($7100). After the auction house added the painting to its catalogue, though, an employee received an urgent email from an art museum in Ukraine. “Attention! Painting ‘Ivan the Terrible’ was in the collection of the Dnepropetrovsk Art Museum until 1941 and was stolen during the Second World War,” the email said, according to court documents. “Please stop selling this painting at auction!!!” The museum identified the painting as a 1911 work by Mikhail Panin, titled Secret Departure of Ivan the Terrible Before the Oprichina. It was a permanent exhibit at the Ukrainian museum until 1941 but disappeared during Nazi occupation of the city. FBI officials took custody of the painting and later traced it to the Swiss man who sold the Ridgefield home in 1962. Officials didn’t release his name but said he moved to the US in 1946 after serving in the Swiss Army. He died in 1986. Gabby Tracy said it’s unknown how he obtained the painting. After learning it had been stolen, the Tracy couple agreed the painting should be returned to Ukraine. The story particularly moved Gabby, who was born in Slovakia and survived the Holocaust. Her father, Samuel Weiss, died in a concentration camp. “There was never a question that it was going back. It’s just sad that we had to go through this experience,” Gabby said. “It’s ironic that I should have been so worried about keeping this painting safe.”"

    "transcript": "Warning: This article contains offensive language The residents of the British city of Scunthorpe have a problem. It’s one they share with those who live in Wodonga, Pittwater, and any number of otherwise unassuming Australian towns. The Scunthorpe problem, as it’s known, first came to light in 1996 when many of the good – and otherwise innocent – citizens of the British industrial city ran foul of internet filters at AOL. They were refused permission to sign up for accounts because of the handful of letters in the middle of Scunthorpe that spell out an offensive word. According to Wikipedia, it’s an issue that arises because computers can easily identify strings of text within a document, but actually interpreting words in a range of contexts, even across cultures, is too difficult. Also known as the YASS PICKLE, the WODONGA FIX or COCKATOO CONUNDRUM https:\/\/t.co\/ouW6QMOx3m — David Astle (@dontattempt) December 17, 2018 In the end AOL, one of the biggest internet subscription providers at the time, solved its Scunthorpe problem by renaming the town in its servers as Sconthorpe. However, it’s one thing to be black-banned because of the unfortunate name of the town where you live. It’s even worse if it’s your actual name that falls foul of the intractable internet censor. Imagine, for example, being a Cummings, a Dickman or a Kuntz. Imagine being US journalist Natalie Weiner, who ran into trouble in August for simply trying to register with a high school sports outlet. this is without a doubt the best thing that's ever happened to me pic.twitter.com\/rnVkmhB2dy — Natalie Weiner (@natalieweiner) August 28, 2018 Among those to respond to Weiner with sympathy were Jen Dick, Phillip Sporn, James Butts and Steve Cox. “At one of my jobs, IT had to create a rule on email server to stop my emails from being rejected as porn spam,” Clark Aycock told Weiner. According to online tech journal Motherboard, even the most advanced computer algorithms still struggle with context. “This works both ways around,” Michael Veale, a researcher studying responsible machine learning at University College London, told Motherboard. “Cock (a bird) and Dick (the given name) are both harmless in certain contexts, even in children’s settings online, but in other cases parents might not want them used. Equally, those wanting to abuse a system can find ways around it.” All these people and towns have our sympathy here at The New Daily, because Scunthorpe’s unfortunate issue is also one we deal with every day. As our loyal readers will know, we send out daily and monthly email newsletters. Coming up with headlines and subject lines that walk the fine line between engaging and inadvertently offensive can be an absolute minefield. Words that are obviously offensive are definitely out, of course. But what about Sussex, same-sex, freedom, assets or assassinate? Spam filters say ‘no’. So, spare a thought for us the next time there is a political sex scandal or when the Duchess of Sussex steps out at Sandringham on Christmas Day. We’ll be wracking our frazzled brains in desperate attempts to not go the way of the innocent burghers of Scunthorpe."

    "transcript": "Large armoured dinosaurs kept cool by using an air conditioning system built into their noses, scientists have discovered. The heavily armoured, club-tailed ankylosaurs are thought to have stopped themselves from overheating in the Cretaceous sun by using their long and twisting nasal passages. These acted as radiators, transferring heat from the body to the inhaled air and cooling blood on its way to the brain. Ruger Porter, one of the study’s co-authors, said: “When we reconstructed the blood vessels, based on bony grooves and canals, we found a rich blood supply running right next to these convoluted nasal passages. “Hot blood from the body core would travel through these blood vessels and transfer their heat to the incoming air. “Simultaneously, evaporation of moisture in the long nasal passages cooled the venous blood destined for the brain.” Researchers from Ohio University and the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine published their findings in the journal PLOS ONE. They used CT scanning and engineering to simulate how air moved through the nasal passages of two different ankylosaur species, the hippo-sized Panoplosaurus and larger rhino-sized Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurs were good at retaining heat but struggled to shed it, putting them at risk of overheating even on cloudy days. The results “clearly showed” that nose length was key to their air-conditioning ability, with heat-transfer rates dropping more than 50 per cent when a shorter nose model was tested. This natural engineering feat “may have allowed the evolution of the great sizes of so many dinosaurs”, they believe. The most elaborate noses were found in the larger dinosaur species, suggesting they may have evolved as a response to the “physiological stresses of large body size”. -AAP"

    "transcript": "It’s 22 years since Paul Kelly first narrated the story of a prisoner named Joe and his longing to be with family at Christmas time in his hit song How To Make Gravy. In the song Joe writes a letter to his family – penned on December 21 – that includes a recipe for how to make gravy for Christmas dinner. Fans of the tune have since coined December 21 as “Gravy Day”. “You never know what’s going to happen to the song after you write them,” Kelly told ABC Radio. “It was a song that doesn’t have a chorus, it’s set in prison, so I never thought it would be a hit song or anything.” In 1996, Kelly was invited to record a song for an annual charity Christmas album organised by fellow musician Lindsay Field. When Kelly discovered his chosen cover song had been performed on a previous year’s compilation, Field encouraged him to write an original. With no shortage of existing Christmas songs, Kelly’s challenge was to come up with something unique and distinctly his own. “I started thinking … maybe I’ll write it from the point of view of somebody who is missing Christmas, who can’t get to Christmas,” he said. “Why can’t they get there? Maybe they’re overseas and they can’t get home. Then I thought, oh, he’s in prison. “The song wrote itself from there.” Kelly said he had played the song quite a few times in correctional institutions, to mixed responses from the audiences. “It’s funny playing in prisons because some of the audience like it and some of them couldn’t care less,” he said. “It’s not like a normal gig.” More than two decades since How to Make Gravy was written, Kelly now includes it in every live setlist. He said he never tired of playing it for crowds. “It’s one of those songs that’s got so many gears in it, even if you’re tired [and] you’re struggling,” he said. “Once I start playing that song it lifts you up and takes you along with it.” Because of the song’s popularity, Kelly said he was often given the job of making gravy at family dinners, although he sometimes varied the recipe. “Sometimes I got into trouble for that recipe; every now and then a foodie comes up to me and says, ‘you don’t put tomato sauce in gravy’,” he said. And whatever happened to Joe? Did he ever get out of prison on good behaviour? “He seems to be like the character in some of my other songs; he’s a bit like the guy in To Her Door. “I think he got out.”"

    "transcript": "English is an undeniably rich language. But there are, on occasion, a few gaps that could possibly be filled by more nuanced words. How useful would it be to have a single word to describe waking up in the morning still drunk from the night before, for example? In Denmark, (where the legal drinking age is just 16), they do have a word for the condition – “bagstiv”. The hardcore Russians, meanwhile, have the very specific “zapoi” – two or more days of drunkenness usually involving a journey or waking up in an unexpected place. With the festive season upon us, it might be handy to have a collection of succinct and descriptive foreign expressions in case you find a good reason to employ them. Here’s our pick of some of the best: Packesel: From the German for “burro”, the Packesel is the person who ends up carrying everyone else’s bags on a holiday. Gjensynsglede: Norwegian for the joy of meeting someone you haven’t seen in a long time. Iktsuarpok: An Inuit word meaning being so excited about seeing someone that you have to constantly go to the door or look out the window to see if they’re coming. Gigil: Tagalog for a favourite move the elderly often pull on the young – the cheek pinch, arm or thigh squeeze, in reaction to adorable cuteness. Tartle: A Scottish word for that panicky hesitation when you’re about to introduce someone whose name you suddenly can’t remember. Gluggaveður: An Icelandic word meaning “window weather” – weather that is nice to see, but not to be in. It could apply just as equally to Australia’s sweaty Christmas as Iceland’s frigid, white one. Struisvogelpolitiek: Translates from the Dutch as “ostrich politics”. The ever-so-polite Dutch employ this to pretend they didn’t notice something (like a fart at the dinner table). The Germans and the Finns, on the other hand, suffer Fremdschämen (German)or myötähäpeä (Finnish) – “vicarious embarrassment”. Drachenfutter: Translates from German as “dragon fodder”. It refers to the food a man uses to mollify his wife or girlfriend after he has annoyed her (“Here, my love, have another cherry liqueur chocolate”). Sitzfleisch: German for the ability to persevere through hard or boring tasks (literally “sit meat”). Such as a long Christmas lunch. Desenrascanço: A Portuguese word meaning to disentangle oneself from a troublesome situation. Backpfeifengesicht: German for a face ripe for a slap. Kummerspeck: Another German gem, it translates literally as “grief bacon” – the extra weight put on from emotional overeating. Tyvsmake: A Norwegian verb meaning to taste small pieces of the food when you think nobody is watching, usually while cooking. Shemomedjamo: A Georgian word for the act of continuing to eat when you’re full just because it just tastes so good. (See also “gula”, the Spanish version.) Lagom: From the ever-moderate Swedes, this translates roughly as “just enough”, “a fair share”, or “a sufficient amount”. Sobremesa: Spanish for that delightful period when the food has finished and bellies are full but the conversation is still flowing. Borrell: Dutch for an informal party or casual drinks. Schnapsidee: The word for an ingenious plan hatched by drunk Germans. Erklärungsnot: German for the state of having to explain yourself quickly. Jayus: Indonesian for a story or joke so badly told you can’t help but laugh. Like those found in a Christmas cracker. Pihentagyú: Hungarian for quick-witted people who can come up with sophisticated jokes or bon mots. L’esprit de l’escalier: This is French for “stairwell wit” – that pithy retort we think of when the person has just left. It is also known in German as Treppenwitz (stair wit). Desbundar: Portuguese for shedding one’s inhibitions and getting down to having fun. Mbuki mvuki: The Bantu word for “shaking off your clothes to dance more freely”. Finally, when the drinks are gone, the dishes are washed, and the rellies have departed, there’s “fjaka” to be enjoyed – that’s the Croatian word for the sweetness of doing nothing."

    "transcript": "Caitlin Henderson has harboured a long fascination with spiders – she even kept them as pets as a child. Now she’s in Darwin to keep watch on the cluster of spiders that have taken up residence at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) . She’s keen to spin a new reputation for the eight-legged critters which are part of an interactive exhibition. “It’s this kind of vendetta you go on where you’ve got to get the word out there because no-one else is doing that.” Ms Henderson has spent so much time researching spiders – and defending them – that she categorises the people who fear them into two broad types. “There are the ones that are a bit repulsed by them; they’ve been told their whole life that they’re disgusting and dangerous,” she said. “So you start by just showing them something different, something they didn’t expect, and then they get interested and they want to find out more.” The second type – severe arachnophobes – pose more of an uphill battle, she said. “You can’t really get through that with just, ‘here’s a spider, let’s look at it’. In October, MAGNT put the call out for someone to professionally care for a colony of live spiders for its display. The job ad went mildly viral. Duties: day-to-day care of all live spiders, maintaining food and educating visitors. More than 50 spiders were flown to Darwin in the luggage compartment of a plane, unbeknown to passengers in the cabin above, while their environments were freighted by road. The invertebrate zookeeper needed to ensure those on display, and their understudies, were in good shape. “Not all of them will be on display in the exhibition,” Richard Wilan, the museum’s senior curator of molluscs, explained in October. The role would also require meticulous attention to the spiders’ health, right down to breeding the insects they would eat. “So all of the different spiders, and I think we’ve got a total of around 60 spiders coming, will need care and attention – even on Christmas Day,” Dr Wilan said. Ms Henderson landed the job, and over the next few months she’ll pay meticulous attention to the cluster’s wellbeing. What their posture, movement and appearance says about their health she has down to a tee. She will also attempt to reform their image in the eyes of a cautious public and bust a handful of common myths to boot. Daddy-long-legs spiders are the most venomous in the world – myth. White-tailed spider bites cause necrosis – myth. “The idea that white tails cause necrosis or any kind of horrible bacterial infection came about from a misdiagnosis in the ’80s and we’re still trying to repair that damage,” she said. So why are these reputations so enduring? “I don’t know if we’ll ever get past that idea that these are all deadly creatures that must die, but you can definitely see how these myths travel much faster than the very boring truth of them just being regular animals.” Despite arranging for the exhibition to travel to Darwin, even MAGNT’s director Marcus Schutenko harbours a fear of spiders. “It’s good to meet people who just don’t see spiders as something to be fearful of at all and working alongside them,” he said. “I think anybody coming into this exhibition, the way it’s been set up, is I think any arachnophobic tendencies someone has are lessened. “We’re not trying to get people fearful of them – in fact we’re trying to do the opposite.” So far, for him at least, it’s worked. Spiders runs at MAGNT until April 28."

Footage from a high-tech forum in the city of Yaroslavl this week featured “Boris the Robot”, who organisers used to enliven the event, having him dance to a pop song. But a crew for Russian state television Russia 24 apparently thought Boris was real. They used footage of him dancing and speaking as an example of Russian technological prowess. TJournal noted the lack of sensors, human-like movements and other discrepancies, and revealed that Boris was actually a human clad in a costume sold under the name Alyosha by Russian company Show Robots. It also appeared to have made huge leaps in advancement on robots developed elsewhere in the world. 🤣😂 это прям огонь. Я понять одного не могу.

Perhaps most tellingly of all, the robot suit looked perfectly made to allow a man to fit inside it. Real robots tend to have slim limbs, but Boris’s body was well-proportioned, allowing a person’s arms and legs to fit inside. When pictures emerged showing Boris from slightly different angles, the neck of the person inside was clearly visible. According to local reports, the organisers of the event never claimed the android was anything other than a man in a suit. -with AAP"

Madison, an Anatolian shepherd, was there waiting when Ms Gaylord, who fled the flames on November 8, was allowed back onto her burned-out property at Paradise this week. An animal rescuer who responded to Gaylord’s request to check on Madison first spotted the male Anatolian shepherd after fire raced through the idyllic town and destroyed everything in its path. Shayla Sullivan said the dog was apprehensive and kept his distance when she first spotted him. Sullivan left food and water for him regularly until Gaylord got back on Wednesday. Gaylord told news station ABC10 she couldn’t ask for a better animal. “Imagine the loyalty of hanging in in the worst of circumstances and being here waiting,” she said. “Their instinctual job is to watch the flocks and we’re part of them. “It’s a comforting feeling.” -with AAP"

    "transcript": "In the relentless contest of “world’s biggest animals”, a 194cm-tall Aussie bovine has dramatically raised the steaks. Residing on a property at Myalup, Western Australia, the seven-year-old Holstein Friesian steer is more than twice the size of the other cows in his herd. He was first discovered by news outlets in October, but the beast’s udderly ridiculous stature only began to go viral earlier this week when the story caught international attention. Since then, dozens of sources have been looking for inventive ways to fit the discovery into their regular coverage – some attempts more successful than udders. Which team is most likely to sign Knickers to a 10-day? 🐮 pic.twitter.com\/on7t4pnJup — #RingerNBA (@ringernba) November 28, 2018 Every major news outlet around the globe seems to have become enamoured with the steer and have been mooved to report on it, from the Daily Mirror to New York Magazine. No bull, owner Geoff Pearson told Perth Now that Knickers’ impressive stature should save him from becoming mince meat – as he is simply too big for the local abattoir. “It was too heavy. I wouldn’t be able to put it through a processing facility,” he told Perth Now. “So I think it will just live happily ever after.” Naturally, cow fans on social media began milking Knickers for all he was worth.

Unfortunately, no. According to Guinness World Records, the biggest steer alive is actually Bellino, a 202cm Chianina ox residing in Italy. Prior to the discovery of Knickers, the honour of Australia’s tallest steer went to the aptly named Big Moo, who measures 186cm and was once the main attraction of a ‘cow pat lottery’. Or that’s what we’ve herd, anyway."

    "transcript": "Bhutanese twins Nima and Dawa have left a Melbourne hospital as individual “cheeky” girls, weeks after life-changing surgery to separate them. The 15-month-old sisters, who had spent their lives joined at the torso, left Royal Children’s Hospital in a pram on Monday with their mum Bhumchu Zangmo, after successful surgery on November 9. Lead paediatric surgeon Joe Crameri said the girls were recovering well, but there was no date set for their return to Bhutan. “The twins have made an excellent recovery and they are now starting to act independently and move around,” Dr Crameri said. “I was pleased to see they were somewhat smiling [today].” He said the staff had seen the “two remarkable girls” transform since becoming independent. “Girls who started off really attached and bonded to another, but ultimately frustrated with one another,” Dr Crameri said. “Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen them gain confidence, gain independence and gain a lot of strength.” Dr Crameri says being able to stand will be a “work in progress” for the girls as they build up strength and balance. While they are yet to form full words, Dr Crameri said The Wiggles’ signature finger move had become the girls’ favourite while in hospital. “They are cheeky. Dawa has turned on me. I thought she was going to be eternally grateful to me for getting her sister off her but she just seems to get grumpy with me,” he joked. “When they are comfortable in their own space, they are very cheeky. They like to replicate The Wiggles.” The former king of Bhutan wrote a letter to hospital chief executive Joe Stanway, thanking staff for changing the girls’ lives. Jigme Singye Wangchuck wrote: “The successful surgery has made it possible for Nima and Dawa to enjoy a happy and meaningful life in Bhutan”. The girls will head to regional Victoria with their mother to continue recovering at the Children First Foundation’s Kilmore retreat, before returning home to family. “What the two girls need is stimulation of other children being around to challenge them, to give them interest and that will do wonders for the girls,” Dr Crameri said, noting one more wound check and a review was expected. The foundation helped bring the girls and their mother to Australia for the surgery. They arrived in Australia in October, but waited weeks for the surgery while they built up strength. As Ms Zangmo wheeled her daughters out of the hospital, she paused to give thanks in English: “Thank you, everyone.”"

    "transcript": "A 12-year-old Melbourne schoolgirl has dazzled global audiences and judges to take out third place at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018. Jael Wena, from Doreen in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, also won the jury vote at the Minsk Arena in Belarus on Sunday night. “I cannot believe tonight, I am absolutely overwhelmed,” Jael wrote in an impassioned, excited Instagram post after her win. “To get third place overall tonight is absolutely unbelievable, is absolutely insane.” Wearing a silver sparkly dress and air of confidence, the Year Seven Hazel Glen College student belted out her song Champion on the Minsk Arena stage, watched by a TV audience of an estimated 2 million. She was chosen to represent Australia at the 2018 Junior Eurovision after winning the Fast Track Talent Showcase three years running. “When I found out, I was screaming,” she told Fairfax Media earlier. “It feels amazing. I can’t believe I [was] chosen to represent Australia for this big event.” The Junior Eurovision winner was decided by an online audience vote and by the national juries, which are made up of three music industry professionals and two children from the 19 other participating countries. Poland won the competition with 215 points and France came in second with 203. Jael scored 201 points.  After the verdict, Jael said the competition had been a lifetime’s highlight. “Thank you, thank you for the best experience of my life,” she wrote on Instagram. “I am so humbled by, and appreciative of, tonight’s events, every individual involved in the making of tonight, and every single person who has supported Australia over the past 48 hours⁣. “I never thought I could have the backing of so many, from all the corners of Europe and of the world.” She also thanked everyone who had supported her, including her parents (who travelled to Belarus with her), her manager YoYo Music and youth broadcaster ABC ME. “Your love and support has pushed me further than I ever thought I could go, and I am forever grateful for every day you all  help me achieve my dreams.” Jael’s parents were with her backstage when she heard the results. “You nailed it, darling. This is incredible,” her father said.  Here I go ✈️ I’m so excited I can’t contain it!!!! See you soon Belarus 🇧🇾😱😍 A post shared by  Jael Wena (@jaelwenaofficial) on Nov 16, 2018 at 2:17am PST  The year seven student often performs at assemblies at her college, where middle school principal Anthony Oldmeadow was “absolutely blown away” the first time he heard her sing. “Like most people, you relate it pretty quickly to her age and there’s that thought of ‘My goodness, that doesn’t sound like a 12-year-old,” Mr Oldmeadow told The New Daily. “She’s done some performances for us here but it certainly is a different perspective seeing her on stage, over in Belarus. We’re thrilled for her.”  While she’s still not yet a teenager, Jael has a mature work ethic. “I can’t wait to get back to work when I get home, working on songs and sharing my passion with you all even more. I’m more motivated than ever because of this incredible time in my life.” Last year, Australia’s Isabella Clarke also placed third at Junior Eurovision. “We congratulate Jael on an outstanding, inspiring performance and result. She’s shown herself to be a true champion,” said Libbie Doherty, ABC Acting Head of Children’s Content.   Jael’s Junior Eurovision performance will air on ABC ME at 6pm on Monday."

Any time a ridiculous Rubik’s cube feat has been completed, there’s a good chance it was this Chinese teenager who did it. Earlier this month, on Guinness World Records (GWR) Day, he set records in the some incredibly specific categories, including one he created. The 13-year-old set the fastest time to solve three Rubik’s cubes simultaneously with both hands and feet – a record that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has never been attempted before – at 96.39 seconds. He also broke the record for the fastest time to solve a Rubik’s cube while hanging upside down, doing so in 15.84 seconds to better the previous mark by more than a second. By comparison, the record for solving a Rubik’s cube while upright is 4.22 seconds and actually held by Aussie Feliks Zemdegs. The inverted record was more of a physical feat than Jianyu expected, admitting he would need to work on his leg and core strength in the future.  This is far from the first time Jianyu’s cube completions have captured global attention. In 2015 he appeared on German television program Superkids and solved a measly two Rubik’s cube with his hands and feet. But his piece de resistance came last year on Chinese TV, when he solved three of the Hungarian puzzles … while juggling them. –ABC"

    "transcript": "Oxford Dictionaries has chosen “toxic” as its international word of the year, selecting it from a shortlist that included such politically inflected contenders as “gaslighting”, “incel” and “techlash”. Katherine Connor Martin, the company’s head of US dictionaries, said there had been a marked uptick of interest in the word on its website in the past year. But the word was chosen less for statistical reasons, she said, than for the sheer variety of contexts in which it has proliferated, from conversations about environmental poisons to laments about today’s poisonous political discourse to the #MeToo movement, with its calling out of “toxic masculinity”. In fact, Ms Martin said, the committee initially considered choosing “toxic masculinity” until it realised how widespread “toxic” had become. Oxford’s word of the year is chosen to reflect “the ethos, mood or preoccupations” of a particular year, but also to highlight that English is always changing. Last year’s winner was “youthquake”. In 2016, it was “post-truth.” “Toxic” derives from the Greek “toxikon pharmakon,” meaning “poison for arrows”. The current entry in the online Oxford English Dictionary dates its earliest known printed occurrence to 1664. Other words on the shortlist highlight different ways words emerge or evolve. While “toxic” is an old and common word that has expanded in usage, “incel” – short for “involuntarily celibate” – is an example of jargon used by a limited group that suddenly enters widespread usage. In that case, it came to prominence in April, after it was reported that the young man who drove a van into a crowded sidewalk in Toronto, killing 10 people, appeared to be connected to a now-banned Reddit community of resentful self-identified male “incels”. Then there’s “techlash,” defined as “a strong and widespread negative reaction to the growing power and influence of large technology companies, particularly those based in Silicon Valley”. It’s the kind of word that occurs mainly in journalism, but doesn’t really exist in common usage. (It has appeared in only three articles in The New York Times, all since June, and mostly in scare quotes.) -New York Times"

    "transcript": "A large, drop-shaped natural pearl pendant has sold for a record $US32 million ($44 million) at an auction of jewellery that once belonged to French Queen Marie Antoinette. Sotheby’s auction house says the sale marked the highest price ever for a pearl sold at auction. The Queen Marie Antoinette’s Pearl, a diamond-and-pearl pendant, was among the highlight offerings on the block at the Sotheby’s sale of jewellery from the Bourbon-Parma dynasty. Like many of the 10 former Marie Antoinette pieces up for sale on Thursday morning (Australian time), the pendant obliterated the pre-auction prediction of US$1 million to US$2 million. The total price to the new owner is expected to rise with the inclusion of the “buyer’s premium” and other fees. Sotheby’s billed the sale as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to scoop up heirlooms and jewels that have been held in the Bourbon-Parma dynasty for generations. Some of the Marie Antoinette jewellery on the block hadn’t been seen in public for 200 years. The diamond and pearl jewellery that went under the hammer epitomised the aloof, pre-Revolutionary opulence of French royals brought down by the historic uprising. Marie Antoinette, the wife of King Louis XVI, was executed in France’s revolutionary fervour in 1793. Before falling to the guillotine, she had secretly smuggled abroad some of her most treasured possessions to her relatives, amid swelling revolutionary fervour that ultimately marked the beginning of the end of France’s centuries-old monarchy. “The Marie Antoinette pendant is simply irreplaceable,” Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewellers Le Vian, said before the sale. “This is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinette’s jewellery is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution.” The queen’s jewellery also included a set of pearl and diamond earrings, a diamond brooch, and a natural pearl and diamond necklace. A monogrammed, diamond-set ring in the sale bore a lock of Marie Antoinette’s hair. -with AAP"

Ten-year-old Hamish Lane who lives on the Gold Coast came up with the idea to help his younger brother, Kurt. “He is colourblind in red and green and I thought there might be a better way to help him and other people around the world too,” Hamish said. The St Vincent’s Primary School student has designed how he imagines the watch could work. “It has an inbuilt colour detection sensor,” he said. “So inbuilt colour, and when you point the watch at an object, it displays the colour in words on the screen.” Hamish entered his idea into the Little Big Idea competition, which asked students in grades three to eight to come up with an invention. He was announced as the grade three and four winner in front of his classmates, family, teachers at a surprise school assembly on Wednesday morning. “I was really excited. I was shocked. I didn’t know it was coming,” Hamish said. Biomedical engineer and inventor Jordan Nguyen was at the school to announce Hamish as the winner. Dr Nguyen said he was impressed by the simplicity of Hamish’s invention. “It is very easy to come up with a complex solution to something and to make any idea more complicated as you go along,” he said. “What is difficult is making a solution simple and elegant, and that’s exactly what this is.” Dr Nguyen believes Hamish’s watch idea could have a big future. “It is actually very viable, with the cost of sensors today, to make an inexpensive, small watch that can detect colour,” he said. He also said he was impressed with the purpose of Hamish’s idea. “I think it is very inspiring to see people design something for people around them,” he said. Hamish’s father Daniel Lane said he was pleased to see his son inspired by the science competition. “We are very proud of all the hard work that he has put in,” he said. “It has been great to see him inspired and motivated. “It has got him really motivated into science and just thinking about things from a different perspective.” Hamish is yet to find out when he will be visiting NASA. –ABC"

    "transcript": "Leigh Chivers doesn’t even look at the menu at Melbourne’s elegant Bistro Thierry to know what he’s ordering for the table of friends on a November weeknight: Snails, steak frites and crepes Suzette. There’s champagne, there’s soufflé – and there’s Leigh wearing orienteering sports sandals. Weeks earlier, during the nine hours and 25 minutes he took to finish the iconic Ironman world championships in Kona, Hawaii, Leigh lost three toenails during the 42-kilometre run leg. The sandals are his best footwear option while he heals. “The nails came off about 12 kilometres into the run,” says Leigh, 35, who finished in 330th place out of about 2500 entrants. “I knew within the first three kilometres I could put ice down my top, which meant wet shoes, or I could cook and keep my shoes dry. I made the decision early on to go for the ice option. “I knew I was going to get a few blisters and whatever else.” The French dinner is to celebrate the Melbourne engineer’s achievement at one of the world’s toughest endurance events – a four kilometre swim, 180 kilometre bike ride and a full marathon – in the Hawaiian heat. Bistro Thierry was his late wife Sara Chivers’ favourite restaurant, and the dishes ordered by Leigh are a homage to her. When marketing executive Sara was in a Melbourne hospice last year – she died of brain cancer in January at age 34 – a French chef was hired to cook her favourite dishes in her sunlit room. “We still had happy moments,” Leigh said. Sara also still had plenty to say. She wrote a letter to her boys that made global headlines, and one of her last requests was that her husband tackle the Kona event in her memory. On October 13, Leigh – whose youngest son Alfie, 2, also died of a rare brain tumour in June – toed the line. Given an honorary spot and named a race ambassador by Ironman in the US, Leigh and his Kona experience are shown in a new NBC documentary, which premiered in New York on Monday evening (US time). “Leigh has every right to be proud of what he has achieved under remarkable pressure and extremely challenging circumstances,” Noel McMahon, Ironman’s Oceania media manager, told The New Daily. “His time, finishing place and overall performance would be the envy of the vast majority of competitors. It was truly remarkable on so many levels.” Leigh turned down an invitation to be at the documentary’s premiere because of the fresh challenge he’s set himself – to build a new normality with son Hugh, 4. “I’m sort of craving just rebuilding my every day a bit more,” he told The New Daily. “The Hawaii experience was so amazing and perfect and is captured in the documentary. There’s plenty for me to do at home. I don’t feel the need to push for anything more. “There’s nothing more to say, just to be.” Sara was a triathlon competitor herself, and “Kona was their dream as a family,” her close friend Mia Greves, who helped bring Leigh’s story to the attention of Ironman, told The New Daily. “I’m a little less heartbroken knowing I could do something to honour her and Alfie. In a different life, Sara, Hugh and Alfie would have all been cheering for Leigh as he crossed the finish line. “At least Hugh can look at this documentary when he’s older knowing how his mum and her friends helped make this all happen.” On a Thursday morning, Leigh is working from home after dropping Hugh at childcare. “I’ve done some tax, there’s washing on the line, some I need to fold and some cleaning to do,” he said. “The day-to-day things with Hugh are what I’m concentrating on. “With the Sara and Alfie journey, I dealt with it trying to look to the next thing I had to do and could do. Now I don’t mind the idea of spending a little bit of time not latching on to the next thing, just letting whatever comes next happen. “There’s some time at the beach we didn’t get to do. Hugh and I might do that this summer. I think feeling normal is what will make me happy.” Still on a high from Kona, Leigh “felt glorious” for most of the nearly 10-hour event: “There’s been a couple of days in my life where I thought everything just went perfectly. One was my wedding day, and the other was that race.” Leigh admitted there were “definitely” super challenging moments. “I felt so much gratitude. I just kept telling myself how lucky I was to be out there, with Sara and Alfie in mind that they couldn’t be.” While competing is “where you can be fully and wholly yourself”, his late wife and son were on his mind during the race. “I think I had some thoughts in the swim where it went really smoothly and I felt I had a protective ring around me, but that seemed ridiculous,” he said. “Then in the ride I had a feeling of satisfaction they were watching from somewhere but the flip side is I also got quite sad I couldn’t share it with them. Especially Sara. I feel she would have got a big kick out of it.” About five kilometres into the run, Simon Johnson, a four-time Kona finisher and Chivers’ friend of 15 years through running and triathlon clubs, was passed by Leigh. “He ran by looking a million bucks,” Johnson told The New Daily. “Sometimes when you have people go past you, you know you’ll see them later, it’s such a long day. But I knew I wasn’t going to see Leigh again. “He was motivated by more than a normal person can get motivated by. He is incredibly strong willed, a truly impressive athlete with a great engine on him.” Near the finish, Leigh put on a gold ‘Alfie’ superhero cape and Hugh was passed over a barrier for a quick kiss. Then Leigh pumped a fist and looked to the sky. “That was just sending Alfie and Sara a signal, blowing them a kiss. It felt pretty natural, and just seemed like the right place to look,” he said. “I was probably smiling and laughing and thinking, ‘I am in a world of pain right now and this is the greatest thing ever’. “It blows my mind to think of the happiness and sadness you can have in a single moment.”"

Nearly nine months after it blasted off from the Kennedy Space Centre on a Space X Falcon Heavy rocket, the red electric car and driver are on the ultimate road trip. . Mr Musk’s Tesla became the fastest ever car when it was launched on its endless road trip to the strains of David Bowie’s Space Oddity in February. Space X has now confirmed the car and driver have passed Mars on their way to “the restaurant at the end of the universe,” in reference to the book by Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy author Douglas Adams.

Next stop, the restaurant at the end of the universe. pic.twitter.com\/Ty5m8IjJpE — SpaceX (@SpaceX) November 3, 2018 According to the tracking website, whereisroaster.com, the Tesla and its passenger are now more than 289,864,803 km from Earth. It said the car is moving away from Mars toward the Sun at a speed of 33,955 kmh and had travelled far enough to drive all the world’s roads 16.4 times. “The car has exceeded its 36,000-mile (57,936-km) warranty 10,311.5 times while driving around the Sun … It has achieved a fuel economy of 2946.1 miles per gallon (1252.5 km per litre). From Mars, the Tesla will  continue its orbit around the Sun, looping back toward Earth and is expected to near our again in August, 2019. A paper published on Cornell University’s science website, arXiv, earlier this years estimated the car would have its first close encounter with Earth in 2091, possibly passing closer than the moon. The research also predicted there was a 6 per cent chance Starman falling to Earth in the next one million years, although he would likely burn up in our atmosphere."

    "transcript": "When watching a geyser erupt, you expect a thrilling burst of water from the ground and some warm spray in the air — not to see garbage rain down from the sky. But when Ear Spring geyser in Yellowstone National Park in northern United States erupted, it fired rocks, water and trash metres into the air. “On September 15, 2018, Ear Spring erupted and ejected lots of decades-old trash,” Yellowstone said on its Facebook page. In a live video on Facebook, park staff detailed the trash they had found from the eruption, which included a cinderblock, cigarette butts, a 1930s baby pacifier, a grizzly bear warning sign, and nearly 100 coins. Some of the items — which somehow survived inside the boiling-hot spring — were historic and may end up in Yellowstone’s archives. “Stuff like this that can tell us a story, and the history of how people were unfortunately using the spring while they were visiting it, will definitely be added to the collections,” Yellowstone museum curator Colleen Curry said. Despite the detritus-laden time capsule giving park authorities a glimpse of artefacts from decades ago, they were adamant that visitors not throw their refuse into the springs. “When the vent becomes completely plugged, as it has in several springs in the park, then the spring can actually plug up to the point where it’s not a hot spring anymore and it’ll go dormant or it’ll die,” park ranger Rebecca Roland said. Yellowstone spokeswoman Linda Veress said the combination of increased tourism and tourists continuing to throw garbage into the geysers has affected springs like Handkerchief Pool. “[Handkerchief Pool] stopped functioning some time in the 1920s or ’30s. It stopped because people threw coins, broken bottles, rocks, hairpins, and a small horseshoe into it about 100 years ago,” she said. Other springs like the Morning Glory pool have over time transformed from a deep blue colour to yellow and green due to the chemical composition in the spring changing thanks to garbage clogging it up. Ear Spring erupts very rarely, and is a more docile neighbour of the famous Old Faithful geyser. The US Geological Survey says Ear Spring has only erupted four times in the last 60 years, with the last significant burst of activity coming in 1957. “The next time Ear Spring erupts we hope it’s nothing but natural rocks and water,” Yellowstone National Park wrote on Facebook. “You can help by never throwing anything into Yellowstone’s thermal features.”"

One of the few locally-owned entrants into the digital news landscape in the past decade, the website’s past-year results show vastly improved readership and revenue figures. Google Analytics figures consistently put the website’s readership at more than 2.2 million unique readers per month, with 446,000 subscribers receiving the organisation’s daily news bulletin via email. The website has soared into the Top 20 news websites on the The Nielsen Net Ratings, a significant leap up the charts from its humble beginnings well outside the top 50 just a few years ago. Advertising revenue, which part-funds the site, increased by 15 per cent last financial year and is on track to grow by a further 20 per cent in 2018\/19. The New Daily is an investment in Australian journalism by Industry Super funds and is one of the only locally-owned news websites launched in recent years. The site proudly aims to improve the financial literacy of all Australians, while keeping them informed on the issues affecting the nation. The site boasts an impressive stable of high-profile commentators:  Michael Pascoe, Paula Matthewson, Francis Leach, Bruce Guthrie, Samantha Maiden, Quentin Dempster and Kirstie Clements. Publisher Paul Hamra said the TND team and its backers were thrilled with the incredible progress the site had made in such a short space of time. “We’re in the top 20 news sites in the country, we have more than 2 million monthly readers, we’re on track to have 500,000 subscribers in our fifth year and revenue is growing in a very difficult climate,” he said. “We’re extremely proud of what we’ve achieved so far and look forward to growing our audience even further.”"

    "transcript": "It’s a rainy weekday afternoon in Sydney, and Connor McLeod, 17, breaks from HSC study to speak with The New Daily. “I’m a bit of a nerd at the moment” he says. But it was that nerdiness which led him to make history. On Thursday, in between  studying and his favourite video gaming, Connor witnessed the major impact of his actions. That moment came when the new $50 note entered circulation – one Connor and 360,000 visually impaired Australians like him can read properly. It’s the first $50 to include tactile markings which enable blind people, like Connor, to differentiate it from other notes. And it happened as a result of a major, relentless campaign he ran with the help of his mum when he was 12. “It started in Christmas 2012, when I received some Christmas money and couldn’t tell how generous, or for that matter how cheap, my folks had been!” Connor said when he discovered his campaign had been successful. When Connor discovered the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) already printed tactile markings on banknotes for other countries, but not for Australia, he was ‘flabbergasted’. “I remember saying, ‘What? Oh no you don’t!” The RBA said they needed convincing of the need for Australian tactile markings. Our notes are different sizes, but Connor argued he needed an easier way to ensure he wouldn’t be “ripped off” when given change and not having other notes to compare it with. He and his mum started a Change.org petition targeting the RBA, amassing 57,000 signatures. “That kind of proved the need,” he says. Using all the signatures on his petition as leverage, they targeted MPs for a meeting, leading to a Canberra trip where Connor and his mum met cabinet ministers. “He spoke surprisingly eloquently,” Ally says. In addition to pressuring MPs and the RBA with the petition, they put in a complaint to the Human Rights Commission. They declared victory on their petition in February 2015 – but the impact continues year after year, as each new banknote is released. The $5 note has one ‘bump,’ the $10 has two and the new $50 has four. Next year’s new $20 note will have three bumps. Connor’s mum, Ally Lancaster, said Thursday was special. “Each time a new banknote gets released, I just feel very proud of my boy,” she tells The New Daily. “He saw something that wasn’t right, wanted to fix it and saw it through.” “Don’t tell me that,” Connor says. “My head will get so big, I’ll get stuck in my bedroom!” Humour has kept the family going through darker times. Ally remembers when Connor’s blindness was first diagnosed. “It was absolutely devastating,” she says. “I cried a lot. They initially thought it was a brain tumour. It was so scary. Someone was going to cut into my baby’s head. “But then they discovered it wasn’t,” Ally continues. “And I kicked myself up the backside saying ‘he doesn’t have cancer, it’s just his eyes aren’t working’.” Connor says: “The first blind joke was made four hours after diagnosis …  tell it Mum.” “I was very, very upset” Ally remembers. “I was sat in this room with my mum feeling really frightened, thinking, ‘how am I going to raise him?’ But then I turned to mum and said, ‘Oh well, it’ll save me on Christmas wrapping!’. “As I grew into my role of a parent of a vision-impaired child, I realised how capable he is. His limitations are those that others put on him because they don’t know better.” The banknotes campaign wasn’t the first time Connor has righted a wrong. In year 5, he qualified to represent his school at cross country, but they said he couldn’t. “He came home very upset and said he was only blind, his legs weren’t painted on,” Ally says. “Initially the Education Department stood by the school, but we told his story on social media and to journalists, and now, thanks to Connor, vision-impaired people can represent their schools at cross country with guided runners.” Life today is busy for Connor. He has a girlfriend in WA he met at Braille Music Camp, which he has attended yearly since 2015. He loves medieval themed audio books. Now he’s sizing up universities with a plan to study coding and app development. “But I need to find a university that’s good at audio, rather than just visual learning, and that’s proving a challenge.” Like every other challenge, it’s something his mum knows he’ll meet. “With new technology, I know there’s nothing he can’t do if he doesn’t put his mind to it,” Ally says. Connor agrees. The role reversal in care has already started. “I’m still fixing all your text problems for you, Mum!” he says. Twitter: @garynunn1"

    "transcript": "It would have been easy for Kurt Fearnley to just thank the right people and mouth a few polite platitudes after becoming the first athlete with a disability to win The Don Award. But Fearnley doesn’t do easy. This is the man who took time out from a peerless career as a wheelchair racer to crawl the Kokoda Track. He has also found time to be part of a winning Sydney to Hobart crew. His racing CV includes three Paralympic gold medals, seven world titles and 35 major marathon victories. But the 37-year-old has never lost sight of what is really important – and how his sporting prowess gives him a unique platform to advocate for people with disabilities. So it should really come as no surprise that Fearnley’s acceptance speech to the Sport Australia Hall of Fame function on Thursday night was about so much more than sport. Spinetingling… If you see only one thing from us this year, make it Kurt Fearnley's #TheDon Award acceptance speech. 👏😢 Watch the full speech here ▶️ https:\/\/t.co\/PM65GjNAXt#SAHOF #HALLofFAME @AthsAust @CommGamesAUS @AUSParalympics @ParaAthletics @sportaustralia pic.twitter.com\/518cN3zDK4 — Sport Aus HallofFame (@SportAusHoF) October 11, 2018 “I have to point back behind me to the generations of proud men and women with disabilities who allowed me to become the person and athlete that you see fit to receive this award,” he said. “An athlete whose sport has been born out of the back fields of rehabilitation hospitals. “That was created by men and women who had the desire to see not only what was physically possible but was humanly possible. “ I’ve heard the stories of Paralympic forebears who speak about losing friends, who felt too much shame in their experience with disability – and that is within our own community. “There was too much shame and there wasn’t enough hope. “So our sport was born out of that hope. “Hope that somebody can be judged by substance and not image. “That the difference that we each hold can be celebrated and not used to be segregated.” Kurt Fearnley creates history by receiving the prestigious 'The Don' Award. 📰: https:\/\/t.co\/fl2DUvL2Uh pic.twitter.com\/vIYPqawCme — Comm Games AUS (@CommGamesAUS) October 11, 2018 Fearnley was born with sacral agenesis, with doctors believing he would not live for longer than a week. But he defied that prognosis, playing a wide variety of sports from a young age while growing up in the small NSW town of Carcoar before choosing to focus on wheelchair racing. Fearnley wasn’t present for the annual SAHOF function in Melbourne, having chosen to remain in the United States after racing in the Chicago marathon last weekend to spend time with wife Sheridan and young children Harry and Amelia. But his speech still held an audience of Australia’s sporting greats and luminaries from the worlds of politics and big business spellbound with its messages of hope and inclusion. “Through the medium of sport that’s what our movement represents – hope,” he said. “Hope, that if sport can adjust to include those with disabilities, maybe the community can follow. “I fundamentally believe that sport can lead this country and I believe the Paralympic movement is a jewel within the sporting crown.” Fearnley also called for people with disabilities to be given more opportunities in sports administration and governance, as well as on the fields of play. “Let’s lead the way. We won’t regret it,” he said. “There is strength and substance in this community. “Enough to build a country on. “Sir Donald Bradman once said that athletes who receive recognition, they also have a duty to mankind.” The Don is awarded annually to the athlete who most inspired Australia, with Fearnley edging out seven other finalists including Matildas striker Sam Kerr and motor racing stars Daniel Ricciardo and Will Power. Fearnley won gold in the marathon and silver in the 1500m at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games on his international swan song in the green and gold. -AAP"

    "transcript": "For more than two years Kieran Davidson has been trying to improve his driving, and this time he’s called in one of Australia’s top politicians known as “The Fixer” to help. The Adelaide learner driver, now 20, made waves online when a video of his stressful driving lessons with his parents went viral on social media. His YouTube journey began when he decided to gaffer tape his camera to the dashboard of his parents’ white hatchback before they took him on his first drive. The video has now been viewed more than 250 million times and has been featured in multiple countries and social media pages. But this time the resilient learner has got back behind the wheel for another lesson, this time with Defence Minister Christopher Pyne.  Mr Davidson said Mr Pyne agreed to do the driving video — posted on YouTube this evening — in an attempt to “fix his driving skills”. He said that Mr Pyne seemed to enjoy the lesson, despite the obvious stress. The pair drove around his neighbourhood and he believed he had already improved. “I managed to get in contact with Christopher’s people and he agreed to do the video,” he said. “There wasn’t really any scary moments. Mr Pyne was a very great teacher and actually helped me improve.” Throughout the video, Mr Pyne said that he had had experience in teaching others to drive before but the drive with Kieran was on another level. Mr Pyne took a jab at Mr Davidson, reminding him to be extra careful on the roads. “The defence force would come down on you like a tonne of bricks,” Mr Pyne said. “I don’t know about fixing your driving Kieran, a lot of people do say that you’re very bad.” Mr Pyne also referred to his famous “fixer” comment which he made while the minister for education in a Sky News interview with David Speers in 2015. Mr Pyne said David Speers won a Walkley Award for the interview and didn’t share it with him. “Tell David Speers to give me my Walkley back,” he said. Mr Pyne has been known for his presence on social media, with many of his posts gaining traction online, including a photo he posted while travelling on a tram between meetings in Adelaide back in January. Despite numerous lessons, Mr Davidson has still not progressed onto a provisional licence since getting his learner’s permit in 2016. But he did say he learnt a lot from Mr Pyne, who had more success than his parents did in teaching him.  “I think Christopher Pyne is an excellent teacher. He was nervous at first, but had some good laughs and actually made me improve quite a bit,” he said. “I think he was more calm than my parents were but was still pretty scared. “Overall I think Christopher taught me some helpful tips when stalling the car, changing gears, turning around corners and even parking abruptly.” The video was initially filmed last Saturday morning, but Mr Pyne’s office had put its release on hold until it was approved today. –ABC"

    "transcript": "With bulging, puffy eyes, inflamed skin and bald patches, Matilda the echidna has become a medical marvel. The spiky monotreme now holds the title as the world’s only echidna to be allergic to ants – her sole food source. She first arrived at Melbourne’s Healesville Sanctuary as a baby after her burrow was accidentally dug up at a nearby property. So when vets noticed eye and skin changes almost two years later they set to find out what was wrong and the results surprised even the most seasoned campaigners. Sanctuary vet Claire Madden said the allergy was bizarre and the first of its kind recorded in the world. “Ants make up 100 per cent of their diet, with some dirt,” she said. “So understandably we were in a bit of shock at the finding.” Without an option of an alternative diet, veterinary dermatologists at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre developed two vaccines to train Matilda’s immune system to tolerate the creepy crawlies. Without treatment, Matilda was at risk of getting a deadly infection or losing her sight. The three-year-old has responded well to the treatment and has been vaccine-free for six months, but will be closely monitored by vets for the rest of her life. – AAP"

    "transcript": "After five years of tracking it down in remote ranges, researchers have discovered a new “beautiful” looking species of gecko, which is about double the size you would normally find in your house. While most geckos have dark eyes, the silver-eyed velvet gecko is distinguished by its shiny eye colour and a pattern on its back and slender tail. Dr Conrad Hoskin from James Cook University said the “significant discovery” was made in the sandstone gorges at the Gregory Range, a few hours west of Townsville. “The discovery of any new vertebrate species in Australia in this day and age is really significant because Australia is pretty well surveyed,” he said. “So finding a new, spectacular gecko is really significant,” he said. Dr Hoskin described the gecko as “beautiful”. “It’s really beautiful, with pink and yellow bands. It is pretty and big,” he said. “I would say it is about twice the size of the Asian house geckos you would find in your house which is quite slender, whereas these ones are much chunkier.” Asian house geckos are one of the most successful invasive species in Australia, and biologists have recently raised concerns they’re spreading from suburbia into bushland. The new gecko is the first reptile known to be local to the Gregory Range, which Dr Hoskin said is relatively unknown. He said it has probably been sighted before but has been assumed to be one of the others similar species. “I don’t think many people would come into contact with them day to day,” he said. Dr Hoskin said the gecko didn’t face many threats, but more surveys were needed to learn more about it. “They eat anything they can fit in their mouth. Lots of insects, spiders, and some baby geckos,” he said. The geckos are typically found at night foraging on sandstone cliff faces and pavements but have also been found on small, thin trees and emerging from narrow rock crevices at dusk. –ABC"

    "transcript": "Police are set to charge a man and a woman from Western Australia’s Wheatbelt region over the disappearance of a baby meerkat from Perth Zoo. Officers found the meerkit at a house in the town of Beverley on Friday night. It had been reported missing from its enclosure two days earlier. WA Police said a 22-year-old man would be summonsed for the offence of stealing and a 23-year-old woman would be summonsed for receiving. Zoo staff noticed the baby meerkat was missing from its enclosure on Wednesday afternoon, less than 24 hours before an event to introduce the animal to the public. Staff were unsure whether the meerkat had been stolen or taken by a predatory bird. WA Police have confirmed it was stolen and said it was found in Beverley, a small town about 130 kilometres south-east of Perth. “As a result of inquiries by Kensington Police, a search warrant was executed at a house in Beverley around 6pm [last night],” a police spokesman said. “The baby meerkat was located at the house and was conveyed back to the zoo by a veterinarian. The zoo said the meerkit was back in expert care and staff were busy preparing to reintroduce it back successfully with its family. Senior vet Simone Vitali said the animal would be returned to its mother soon. “He was very stressed and tired and hungry, just like any bub that’s been away from mum,” she said. “But after an evening of getting his favourite foods and getting a bit of warmth and a bit of quiet, he’s really bounced back quite well, so we’re quite happy with his progress so far. “He’s still not out of the woods, we’ve still got to get him back with the group and hope that they accept him as one of theirs and they haven’t decided to reject him, so we’re still in very early days.” Ms Vitali said the safety of the meerkat enclosure may need to be reviewed following the incident. “When you’ve got these open facilities, which you need [in order] to give the animals good welfare, you like to have them open and have lots of sunlight, lots of air, lots of height,” she said. “And when you have animals in those sorts of facilities there’s always the risk of theft, there’s always the risk of predatory birds. “That’s something that we’re going to need to review quite carefully now that this has happened to see if we need to make changes.” Speaking on Thursday after the meerkat was taken, the zoo’s curator of operations, John Lemon, said the newborn was under almost-constant watch. But he admitted there was a small window in which it could have been taken. “It’s quite an effort to get into our meerkat enclosure. We have a glass viewing bay that surrounds the viewing area,” he said at the time."

The ads are written like a thriller with a twist: the six men and women pile on in measured tones with accusations that Arizona Congressman and dentist Paul Gosar is a racist with no integrity – and only at the end is it revealed that these earnest critics are his brothers and sisters.  As US political reporter Joe Perticone Futter tweeted: “This has to be the most wow moment of any political ad I’ve ever seen.” The family has said they are speaking out – and endorsing Democrat hopeful David Brill – for the sake of clearing the good name of their family. Paul Gosar stoked the family feud by taking to Twitter and accusing his siblings of being sore losers after Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election, comparing their campaign to the dark days of the Soviet Union. My siblings who chose to film ads against me are all liberal Democrats who hate President Trump.  These disgruntled Hillary suppporters are related by blood to me but like leftists everywhere, they put political ideology before family.  Stalin would be proud. #Az04 #MAGA2018 — Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) September 22, 2018 Sister Jennifer, a medical interpreter, says in the ad: “It’s horrible to have to do this. This isn’t just about Paul. It’s about our family.” Paul Gosar’s brother David, a lawyer, says to camera: “We gotta stand up for our good name. This is not who we are.” David Gosar has also told The New York Times that he believes his brother is not well. Paul Gosar, the eldest of 10 siblings, and running for his fifth rancorous term in the House, is a Donald Trump devotee, who has suggested that the army be called in to build Mr Trump’s border wall. He is an outrageous conspiracy theorist who, in an October 2017 interview with Vice News, suggested that the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville was coordinated by “the left” with support from ageing Democrat billionaire donor George Soros, whom he labelled a Nazi collaborator. “You know, George Soros is one of those people that actually helps back these individuals,” he told Vice. “Who is he? I think he’s from Hungary. I think he was Jewish. And I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis.” This was the beginning of the public rift with his siblings. In an open letter they wrote: “It is extremely upsetting to have to call you out on this, Paul, but you’ve forced our hand with your deceit and anti-semitic dog whistle.” By then, Paul Gosar had appeared at an anti-Muslim rally in London, on behalf of a jailed alt-right activist, and vilified Muslims as “disgusting and depraved” – tapping into British tabloid enthusiasm for suggestions that Muslims are running a sex slave trade. Unsurprisingly, Paul Gosar appears to be a divisive figure, even in his own party. In January, Democrats invited undocumented young immigrants – known as Dreamers – to Capitol Hill for the State of the Union address. Paul Gosar called for Washington police and Attorney-General Jess Sessions to effectively conduct an ID shakedown and arrest any illegal aliens. As The New York Times headlined the story: “A Congressman Suggests ‘Dreamers’ Be Arrested. Capitol Hill Rolls Its Eyes.” Gaston Gosar reportedly says, in one of the ads, that his brother sells out the environment for cash or influence, and is willing to roll back any environmental regulations “if it benefits his interests or puts a dollar in his pocket from one of his constituents or large mining groups”. Sister Jennifer Gosar asks: “Where is his integrity? I don’t know.”"

    "transcript": "Australian and US archaeologists believe they have found Captain James Cook’s HMB Endeavour, but it could take four months to test wood taken from a shipwreck found at the bottom of a harbour on America’s east coast to prove it. Ironically, the answer to the mystery of the Endeavour’s final resting place could be the same location as Australia’s greatest sailing victory. It was found in Newport, Rhode Island where the John Bertrand-skippered Australia II won the America’s Cup in 1983. “There’s still a lot of work ahead, but it is an exciting day,” Australian National Maritime Museum director Kevin Sumption told AAP on Saturday (Friday local time). A 25-year-long archaeological study of transport ships deliberately sunk by the British in Newport Harbour during the American War of Independence in 1778 led to a wreck that fits the dimensions of the Endeavour. The results of the study were announced at a press conference held by Dr Kathy Abbass, founder of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project. The Endeavour, through its lifetime, was used for different purposes. After Captain Cook took it on his historic voyage to Australia and the South Pacific from 1768 to 1771 it was re-fitted into a transportation vessel. It was renamed the Lord Sandwich II and in 1775 was used to take German mercenaries to Newport and New York before its final refit into a prison ship. It is believed the British sunk the Lord Sandwich II and 12 other British ships in Newport Harbour as a tactic to block the French, who were allies of rebelling American colonists, from entering in 1778. Divers on Thursday carefully took four samples from the potential Endeavour. Three will be delivered to separate laboratories around the world, with one location possibly Australia, to confirm if it is timber grown in the north of England in the early part of the 18th century. That would match the timber used for the Endeavour. The fourth sample will be stored and archived. Archaeologists believe it is likely the Endeavour because the shipwreck matches the size of the 360 tonne vessel Captain Cook sailed. A final piece in the puzzle will be if evidence is found the wreck was formerly a prison ship. “What will ultimately determine which of the ships is Endeavour is if we are lucky enough to do an excavation that finds evidence that it was used as a prison hulk,” Mr Sumption said. “That will be the definitive evidence really.” Despite the historical significance of the Endeavour to Australia and New Zealand, if it is determined it is Captain Cook’s former ship it will remain in Rhode Island at the bottom of the harbour. “The legal ownership of the vessel is incontestable,” Mr Sumption said. “It is Kathy’s and RIMAP’s under Rhode Island salvage law. “What we hope to continue to do with Kathy is with her permission, and the Rhode Island authorities, is look for a loan of a small amount of material at some point when there is a positive identification and we can help with preservation. “Ultimately that will be something that is over a year or possibly a couple of years away.” -AAP"

Locals in Aitoliko awoke to the freakish sight a couple of days ago. A vast area of greenery, including palm trees, salt cedars and thorny bushes, along the Missolonghi Lagoon shore was covered in the sticky web of the tetragnatha spider. Aitoliko local Giannis Giannakopoulos, who shared dozens of photos of the lakeside webs on Facebook, described the phenomenon as a “strange and unprecedented spectacle”. He said a “big veil” covered palms and other vegetation all along the lagoon shore – and the spiders were catching plenty of mosquitoes. Experts say it is a seasonal phenomenon, and the spiders often build large nests for mating.

Posted by Giannis Giannakopoulos on Monday, September 17, 2018 An increase in the mosquito population is also thought to have contributed to the rise in the number of spiders. Maria Chatzaki, professor of molecular biology and genetics at Democritus University of Thrace, Greece said high temperatures, humidity and food created the ideal conditions for the spiders to reproduce in large numbers. “It’s as if the spiders are taking advantage of these conditions and are having a kind of a party. They mate, they reproduce and provide a whole new generation,” she told Newsit.gr. “These spiders are not dangerous for humans and will not cause any damage to the area’s flora.” There are hundreds of species of tetragnatha spiders all over the world. They’re apparently also known as “stretch spiders” because of their long bodies. -With agencies"

    "transcript": "Miners in outback Western Australia have unearthed rare gold specimens that geologists are calling a “once-in-a-lifetime discovery”. Workers at the Beta Hunt mine near the small town of Kambalda, 630 kilometres east of Perth, have brought more than $15 million worth of gold specimens to the surface in just four days. The gold-encrusted rocks were found about 500 metres below the surface in an area just three metres wide and three metres high. The largest specimen weighs in at 90 kilograms and took three men to lift it onto the back of a ute. The quartz rock is covered in an estimated 2300 ounces of gold, worth about $3.8 million at today’s gold price. Another 60-kilogram specimen is estimated to contain 1600 ounces, or about $2.6 million in gold. Senior geologist Zaf Thanos said in most mines around the world it is only possible to see gold through a magnifying glass. “You might go your whole life and you’ll never see anything like it. It’s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime discovery,” he said. “As a geologist … you get excited by a pinhead speck. But to see something on this scale is just phenomenal. “This sort of bonanza zone is incredibly unique.” The rich cluster of high-grade gold has so far produced more than 9000 ounces. Kambalda miner Henry Dole is credited with the discovery, describing it as hitting the “mother lode”. Mr Dole had drilled holes into the wall of the mine and planted explosives that were fired once he was safely on the surface. When he came back to the same area for his next shift, Mr Dole thought it was business as usual. “Everything was covered in dust, and as I watered the dirt down there was just gold everywhere, as far as you could see,” he said. “I’ve been an airleg miner for 16 years. Never in my life have I ever seen anything like this. “There was chunks of gold in the face, on the ground, truly unique I reckon. “I nearly fell over looking at it … we were picking it up for hours.” A handful of gold rocks could be worth several thousand dollars, so security has been beefed up in the days since the find. Armed guards have been transporting the gold to a secure vault. Workers are under constant video surveillance and the area of the mine where the gold was found has been fenced off and padlocked. The irony is that Beta Hunt has been mined for nickel, which is a key ingredient in stainless steel, since the 1970s. Gold has always played second fiddle. There are stories among the workforce dating back to the early days of the mine that suggest similar bonanza finds might have been made in the past but were not considered significant at the time because of low gold prices. There are also tales that workers in those days would bury bags of gold rocks in the event the commodity came back stronger. The mine’s Canadian owner, RNC Minerals, is planning an auction for the large specimens. RNC president Mark Selby said collectors in north America and around the world are known to pay up to a 50 per cent premium on the gold metal value for rare specimens. “Given the rarity of the rock, and the physical beauty and presentation of the gold that’s there, it’s a very spectacular stone in multiple ways so we’ll see whether 20, 30 or even 50 per cent premiums apply here,” he said. “We’re really looking forward to auctioning the key stones off over the coming weeks. “There’s a pretty select group of collectors who this would appeal to. “When you look at nuggets, which are a solid piece of gold, the biggest are around 2000 ounces, so this is right up there in terms of the largest specimens we’ve ever seen.” An interesting sub-plot to the discovery is the fact Beta Hunt’s future had been in doubt. The Toronto company was battling to keep it open and had put Beta Hunt on the market several months ago. The sale process is in the final stages, but Mr Selby said the “world-class discovery” did not make RNC think twice about the sale. “When we started the sale process it wasn’t because we don’t like the asset. We always believed that it had the potential to become a multi-hundred-thousand ounce mine, we just weren’t able to raise capital required to do the exploration drilling,” Mr Selby said. “We believe that a different set of management should be running the asset with the right amount of capital to take it forward.” The question now is whether there is more bonanza gold waiting to be found at Beta Hunt. In the eyes of Mr Dole, there is no doubt. He hopes it is just the beginning of a revival for the Kambalda community, which has been hit by multiple mine closures in recent years. “It’s no secret we were looking down the barrel for a while, but with this, it’s picked everyone’s morale up,” he said. “It’s good for the town, the mine life, all of that. “I truly believe there’s something bigger and better down there. “I reckon we’re just on the fringe of it … and if we get deeper I reckon we’ll find more.”"

    "transcript": "Three weeks after Theresa May’s curtsy to Prince William saw her compared to Golum from Lord of the Rings, the British prime minister has again made headlines with her brand of physical expression. This time, it’s her unusual dance style. Mrs May’s moves in the final days of her tour of Africa have led to calls for her to compete on TV dance shows and seen media outlets publish instructions on how to do what has been dubbed the ‘Maybot’ and the ‘Cabinet Shuffle.’ British online newspaper Metro called it a “phenomenon that’s sweeping the nation”. The May dance craze gained fresh impetus on Thursday, when Mrs May nearly made it out of the UN campus in Nairobi, Kenya, without being called on to use any dance floor diplomacy. But a group of scouts, feeling the jaunty music that was playing, roped in Mrs May to join them in throwing some shapes. According to reports, the prime minister realised there was no way out and got her groove on. Mrs May – whose claim she’ll never be asked to appear on a TV dance competition may be premature – was nothing if not enthusiastic. Combining arm and leg swings with a maniacal expression, she moved to her own internal rhythm. Her attempts culminated “in a cross between a standing-up front crawl and a desperate attempt to hail a cab”, according to the UK Guardian. Theresa May filmed dancing again on her African trip pic.twitter.com\/Zq4vXTpV07 — The Independent (@Independent) August 30, 2018 While her bemused hosts looked like they had never seen anything like it before, for Mrs May it was actually a case of history repeating itself. Two days earlier, she had gamely performed a medley of moves including a side-to-side sway at a South African school. It was pointed out that to be obliged as PM to execute dance moves once during a foreign trip could be seen as unfortunate. “To go through it twice could be seen as the hosts having a laugh at your expense,” said the Guardian. Theresa May dances like she’s had her freedom of movement surgically removedpic.twitter.com\/PaiSEtcRE9 — James Felton (@JimMFelton) August 28, 2018 Business Insider South Africa took the May freestyling seriously enough to ask local experts to weigh in. “Even her expression is good,” Jack Mawasha, CEO of Limpompo dance company Jama Studios said. Salome Sechele, a judge on South Africa’s Strictly Come Dancing TV show, said she was “on time with the beat, making for great synchronization.” According to Metro, dancing like Mrs May is deceptively hard and a “tough one to master for anyone with any sort of natural rhythm.” It published a step-by-step guide to copying her moves, with steps including “Start walking forward in a slow, mechanical fashion out of time to the music and with arms still positioned like the large dinosaur.” Next, while keeping both feet planted and swinging arms in a jerky motion “as if trying to prove to your parents you are sober”, add “a creepy smile” while gazing into the middle distance. Finally, repeat steps one and two while “putting your hands on your thighs and laughing maniacally like you’ve stumbled across a cracking cookbook sale.” Social media was just as keen to get on board the May train, with the PM’s moves widely compared to another infamous dancer, Julia Louis Dreyfus’ Seinfeld character Elaine Benes.

The week-long event at North Korea’s Diamond Mountain resort comes as the rival Koreas boost reconciliation efforts amid a diplomatic push to resolve a standoff over North Korea’s drive for a nuclear weapons program that can reliably target the continental US. The temporary reunions are highly emotional because most participants are elderly and eager to see their loved ones once more before they die. Most of their families were driven apart during the 1950-53 Korean War. It ended in a ceasefire, not a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula still in a technical state of war. Buses carrying about 90 elderly South Koreans and their family members crossed into North Korea on Monday at the eastern border town of Goseong. They were due to reunite with their long-lost North Korean relatives on Monday afternoon at the start of a three-day reunion. A separate round of reunions from Friday to Sunday will involve more than 300 other South Koreans, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry. Past reunions have produced powerful images of elderly Koreans crying, embracing and caressing each other. Nearly 20,000 people have participated in 20 rounds of face-to-face reunions since 2000. Another 3700 exchanged video messages with North Korean relatives under a short-lived communication program from 2005 to 2007."

    "transcript": "There is a lot of bad news in the world today, but have we ever stopped to think of the good news? Truth is, in Australia, our generation is one of the luckiest to be alive. Take travel, for example. Travel has never been cheaper, easier or safer than it is now. My mother took two international trips in her entire life. I have taken many more than that. When I first started travelling in 1992 a return fare from Australia to Europe was $1800. It was a bloody good fare too as a hard-working travel agent pulled every string she could. In today’s money that would be $3356.19. I was searching on Kayak the other day for a potential trip to Australia from London in September (to watch the mighty Magpies at the MCG), with the cheapest return economy fare being – wait for it – £315 with China Southern, or $559.62. Today’s discount economy fares are 16 per cent of the 1992 fares. What is more, I can get a return business class, fully flat bed on a 787 Dreamliner for just on £1900 or $3376, flying Vietnam Airlines. In other words, today’s business class fare is more or less what the economy used to be. But of course, I am at the privileged end of world wealth. What about the less privileged end? I worked for the Red Cross in the 1990s in places like Rwanda and Yugoslavia. The countries in war then that are in peace now include Rwanda, Mozambique, a big chunk of west Africa and many countries in Asia. Despite what we read about Syria and terrorism, death counts in conflict have been steadily in decline since the end of World War II, with Our World in Data showing death rates in conflict falling from over 100 per 100,000 in the mid-1900s to around 10 per 100,000 now. On the wealth front, while inequality exists and wealth disparity is growing in many places of the world, it is not a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Rather it is the rich getting richer and the poor getting richer. It is just that the rich are getting richer faster. Global literacy rates are rising. Those living in absolute poverty (less than $2 per day) is falling, and the numbers entering the middle class is measured in the millions each year. Which brings me back to travel. Many people are now complaining that typical tourist attractions are now overcrowded. Cities like Barcelona are cracking down on Airbnb and short-term lettings. Venice is considering limiting the maximum number of tourists allowed each day. Those with a racial eye note that many of the extra tourists look Asian. And there is a reason for this. When I was a kid we wanted to ‘bring the world out of poverty’. Guess what? We really are succeeding – despite the charity TV ads desperately asking for money. Yes there are more Asian tourists because more Asian economies like China, Vietnam, India and others are pulling millions of people out of poverty. And airlines like China Southern and Vietnam Airlines don’t give just you and I cheaper fares, they give them to everyone. While our media calls out the negative, we are being blinded to the positive. Sure, the world is not perfect. Poverty and conflict remain, but both are at the lowest level ever. Further, far from capitalism being the enemy, well-regulated capitalism has given humanity the greatest boost in wealth, life expectancy, health and education we have ever seen. Shouldn’t we celebrate the positive, just as much as we bemoan the negative in the world today? For many people, for the majority, life is actually pretty good, and better than it has ever been. Let’s now make it better for the rest, too.

Owner Mandy Tiaw said was thrilled her customer had come forward to claim his prize. “That’s great to hear the winner has been found,” she said. ”I’ve been telling all my customers we sold the division one winning ticket. I’ve only had this store for less than two months so it’s amazing to have such a big win so soon.” A young Melbourne man in his 20s is already planning what he’s going to do with his $50 million Powerball prize. The lucky Melbourne man told lottery officials on Friday morning that he slept on the knowledge of his mammoth win after checking his entry before going to bed late on Thursday. “I’m trying to remain as calm as possible,” he said. “I’m going to do the right thing. This win is life-changing.” “I’m going to look after my whole family – invest money in property and shares. It will make a massive difference to a lot of people.” There were two division one winning entries nationally in Thursday’s draw – one each from Victoria and New South Wales. Each division one winning entry takes home $50 million. Thursday’s division one win is the latest in a string of wins for the southern Sydney region. So far this year, the region has enjoyed 14 major lottery prizes worth more than $72.86 million."

    "transcript": "A young Melbourne man in his 20s has been revealed as one of the two winners of the top prize in Thursday’s record-equalling $100 million Powerball prize draw. But the hunt for the other $50 million winner – the owner of a ticket bought in southern Sydney – goes on. The lucky Melbourne man told lottery officials on Friday morning that he slept on the knowledge of his mammoth win after checking his entry before going to bed late on Thursday. “I’m trying to remain as calm as possible,” he said. “I’m going to do the right thing. This win is life-changing. “I’m going to look after my whole family – invest money in property and shares. It will make a massive difference to a lot of people.” The tickets were the only ones that had all the winning numbers in the draw, which offered the equal-largest division one lottery prize pool in Australian history. Lottery operator The Lott said identifying the winners had been delayed because the Sydney entry was unregistered, and the Melbourne man had not supplied all of his contact details. “We can guarantee that when they discover the news, their life is set to change when their bank balance balloons by a whopping $50 million,” spokesman Matthew Hart said. Newsagents across the nation had queues out the door for the record-equalling draw on Thursday, despite the odds of winning first prize being one in 134 million. In further signs punters were desperate to find out whether they would win the big prize on Thursday, the Oz Lotteries website crashed. Minutes before the draw was due to air on TV, the site’s error page declared: “It’s not you, it’s us!” It was the second time an Australian lottery had offered a $100 million first division prize, with a 2012 Oz Lotto draw also reaching that mark. Australian Gambling Research Centre manager Rebecca Jenkinson said three factors were at play in luring people to play a lottery. Humans have difficulty processing and understanding the minuscule odds of winning first prize, she said, while collecting a few numbers brings on the near-miss effect. And, then, we dream. “We’ve all got that hope and it’s nice to dream,” Dr Jenkinson said. “We’ve seen people win before, we’ve heard people win before so it’s the ‘why not us?’ at play.” Dr Jenkinson says about half of all Australians adults have taken part in an official lottery in the past year. A third play at least monthly. Thursday night’s winning numbers were 3, 13, 27, 31, 32, 33, 35, and the powerball was 3. -with AAP"

    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2018\/08\/15\/leigh-chivers-hawaii-triathlon\/",
    "transcript": "When Melbourne mother of two Sara Chivers was dying of brain cancer, one of her last requests was that her husband Leigh Chivers tackle the iconic Ironman world championships in Hawaii in her memory. “She was so happy with herself that she’d brought Leigh to tears,” Stephanie Clark told The New Daily of her sister Sara, whose letter of advice to her sons Hugh and Alfie made headlines around the world last September. “She said, ‘I finally cracked him’,” Ms Clark recalled. “Goes to show how much it meant to both Sara and Leigh. A dream to be fulfilled.” So it was that five months after Sara died of brain cancer in January – and just six days after Alfie, 2, passed away in June of the same cruel disease that took his mother – Leigh toed the start line for the Cairns triathlon. His goal? To qualify, with minimal training, for the iconic Ironman world championship in Kailua Kona, Hawaii, and fulfil his promise to Sara. Cairns was his last shot at it for 2018. And after getting through the swim and bike legs, Leigh, 35, pulled out during the marathon. “I resigned myself to having to qualify next year,” he said. But after The New Daily brought Leigh’s story to the attention of Dan Berglund, director of communications for Ironman in Tampa, Florida, the organisation made Sara’s wish a reality. On August 14, Ironman named Leigh – who qualified for Kona in 2014 but had to forgo it when Hugh, now 4, was sick – and Queensland’s Elle Goodall as competitors and race ambassadors for 2018. Only one such honorary slot is given each year – Turia Pitt won one in 2016 – but an exception was made for the two Australians. “He is so incredibly deserving and I am just so glad we can make this happen,” Mr Berglund told The New Daily. For the uninitiated, the 36-year-old Kona event is the Olympics of the Ironman world. Most triathletes aim for it and only around 2000 get a shot every year. There’s a hairy 3.8-kilometre open water swim, a 180-kilometre ride where winds shear off a volcanic cliff face to smash cyclists, and a 42.2-kilometre run in the Hawaiian heat. Leigh and Ms Goodall, who transformed her life by losing 120kg, were chosen “thanks to characteristics that go well beyond competition,” said Noel McMahon, Ironman’s Oceania media manager. “They inspire others to do something they thought might not be possible and exemplify our mantra, “Anything is possible.”  “I’m literally blown away and honoured. Life is so strange,” the engineer told The New Daily after being surprised at work with news of his ambassador role. “It’s funny how Sara in a way has been able to orchestrate this. I just feel it’s her gift to me. “Saying, ‘Leigh you need to go after this’ was because she understood me. She understood I would need to have something to look forward to. She understood that would help me through the hard times. “She was pretty clever.” Leigh, who hopes to finish the gruelling event in under 10 hours, will have Hugh as head cheerleader in Hawaii. “This will be the most special of memories for Hugh and I. And I look forward to seeing Sara and Alfie out on the course too. They will be there,” he said. “I’ll get it done. Even if I have to walk, I’ll finish.” Squashing around 18 months of preparation for Kona into eight weeks, the former competitive rower finished Sydney’s 14.2-kilometre City2 Surf run on August 12 in 50 minutes and seven seconds. He placed 108 out of 67,242 runners. “It wasn’t a terrible run, so I’ll probably focus on my swimming now,” said Leigh, who also plans to do training rides and runs in a jacket to prepare for the Hawaiian heat. Doing triathlons together was Sara and Leigh’s thing. “I think we loved having coffee and breakfast together afterwards,” Leigh said. One year, he finished the Noosa event and ran back to find Sara then did the last two kilometres again by her side. Before their April 2012 wedding Sara signed up for an entire local series of six triathlons: “It was her strategy to do all of them purely to be at her fittest for the wedding. It worked.” “We even had a Noosa triathlon photo for our wedding save-the-date invitation,” Leigh said. “Geeky but we thought it was hilarious – nobody looks good in a lycra onesie.” Having Kona to train for has “definitely” given Leigh motivation after the heartbreaking deaths of his wife and son, whose ashes were scattered by their families at dawn on a Queensland beach last month. “It’s been tricky because I was living day to day for a long, long time and hadn’t really thought about the future at all,” he told The New Daily. “It comes and goes in waves. “Some days you’re fine and some days I see a photo of Sara and Alfie and I get sad but I also get angry, for them as well. Even though there’s nobody to get angry at.” How is Hugh dealing with life without his mum and brother? “So far, so good, but it’s not something you can ever say is all done,” Leigh said. “We were driving to the airport the other day and talking about Sara and Alfie in the car, and he was telling me they’re not in the stars any more. “He said they’re on the top of a mountain.”"

    "transcript": "An endangered killer whale that captured the world’s attention when it refused to abandon the body of its dead calf is finally back to feeding and frolicking with her pod. The whale, known as J35, carried the baby on her head for at least 17 days, in an image of grief that struck an emotional chord worldwide. The Centre for Whale Research in Washington state said Monday that J35 had been spotted chasing a school of salmon in Haro Strait west of San Juan Island on Saturday. The killer whale population in the Pacific North-West has been struggling because of a lack of salmon, and J35’s calf died soon after birth on July 24. “The baby’s carcass was sinking and being repeatedly retrieved by the mother, who was supporting it on her forehead and pushing it in choppy seas,” the CWR said in a statement at the time. The mother finally abandoned the carcass as it decomposed, it said. Mr Balcomb said he was immensely relieved to see J35 returning to typical behaviour. “The ordeal of her carrying a dead calf for at least 17 days and 1000 miles [1600 kilometres] is now over, thank goodness,” he told The Seattle Times. “She is alive and well and at least over that part of her grief … Today was the first day that I for sure saw her. It is no longer there.” Killer whales had previously been known to transport their dead calves for as long as a week, according to the CWR, which monitors the killer whale community. J35, a 20-year-old whale who is also known as Tahlequah, is an important member of the critically endangered southern resident orca population. Her relative youth means she could have years of reproductive ability ahead of her. CWR said the death of J35’s calf underlined the dire state of the southern resident community, which faces extinction after failing to raise a viable calf in the past three years. In the past two decades, 75 per cent of newborn calves have died, according to the CWR. It attributes the low reproduction rate to declining numbers of Chinook salmon, the staple diet of the killer whales. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "The Australian republican movement has had a real shot in the arm in recent days, and from a mostly unlikely quarter – the monarch herself. Across Australia, MPs have been flooded with requests from constituents for pictures of the Queen after a Vice Media report highlighting the little-known “constituents’ request program”. The program lets voters receive free “nationhood material”, including flags, recordings of the national anthem and images of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, just by asking their federal member. Tim Watts, MP for the inner-west Melbourne seat of Gellibrand, said his office had been inundated with 50 requests on Thursday and Friday alone. “Talking with other members of parliament, it does seem to be a bit of an ironic monarchist trend … with a higher concentration in the younger electorates,” he said. “It’s great to see that young Australians are jumping on this in that great Australian tradition of taking the piss.” The pictures available through the program are poster-sized portraits of the Queen in front of gumtrees, in a formal setting or with her husband, Prince Philip. Getting my pictures of the Australian Head of State ready for the dozens of #Melbswest constituents who have now requested them from me as their MP. Making appropriate local adjustments before sending them out…. pic.twitter.com\/UXwlyr7Pfe — Tim Watts MP (@TimWattsMP) August 8, 2018 Mr Watts’ office has been dutifully fulfilling the picture requests – and taking the chance to add a bit extra to the parcels. “I’ve chosen to respond to these tongue-in-cheek requests with a bit of nationhood material of my own from Melbourne’s west,” he said. “Some portraits of [retired Western Bulldogs captain] Bob Murphy and [former prime minister] Julia Gillard, some Australian Republican Movement membership forms and an invite to our Wattle Day barbecue at Williamstown beach.” Mr Watts is far from the only MP to be inundated with requests for the Queen’s portrait. Mayo MP Rebekha Sharkie has said she received 25 inquiries in 12 hours, while Melbourne MP Adam Bandt had his own message for voters: To every concerned constituent who has just flooded my office asking for a picture of the Queen, I trust you’ll be happy when you get this in the mail. pic.twitter.com\/0r1Q3F5NTE — Adam Bandt (@AdamBandt) August 9, 2018 Mr Watts said, however, he was generally supportive of the overall program. Flags for youth groups or young people representing Australia, for instance, were especially worthwhile. “I take national identity and national symbols quite seriously,” he said. “But the Queen doesn’t bring us together. Different symbols bring us together today than they did at Federation.” Mr Watts said the idea of what it meant to be Australian was always evolving. “It’s crucial that we have a debate about who we are as a nation and what unites us,” he said. In the mean time, there are always portraits of our head of state to ponder. If you want one from your MP though, you might need to be quick – Mr Watts said he thought his office, at least, was about to run out of supplies."

    "transcript": "After nearly a week trapped on a New Zealand mountain, an Australian Army lieutenant described as a “snowman” for his alpine-climbing skills, has been found alive with only “slight frostbite”. In a rescue operation described as being “bigger than Ben Hur” by New Zealand’s Rescue Co-operation Centre (RCCNZ), a break in the weather enabled rescue helicopters to land on Friday afternoon at 3.35pm (local time), where he was airlifted to Dunedin Hospital, the Otago Daily Times is reporting. The experienced climber, identified as Australian Army Lieutenant Terry Harch, was spotted on Thursday night in Mount Aspiring National Park in Wanaka in the South Island after days of rescue efforts were frustrated by gales, sub-zero temperatures and snow. Website stuff.co.nz said Lieutenant Harch was located only after a private beacon operator in the US called RCCNZ. RCCNZ senior search and rescue officer Geoff Lunt said search crews got the sight they were waiting for when they saw Lieutenant Harch ”standing and waving” as they landed near the Quarterdeck Pass at 5pm on Thursday. Here’s the rescue team heading out from Wanaka this morning @AspiringHeliNZ pilot James Ford in HAH pic.twitter.com\/tABqdH2lhd — Wanaka Sun (@wanakasun) August 3, 2018 Wanaka Search and Rescue chairman Bill Day said Lieutenant Harch was not carrying a modern beacon but had borrowed an older-model private tracking device from a friend. It sent a signal to a private supplier in Texas. “He rang the Rescue Co-ordination Centre in New Zealand, then they called us with the positions,” he said. Mr Day said rescue efforts had been complicated because different positions were reported on Tuesday and Wednesday, about two kilometres apart. Soldier On is delighted that Terry Harch has been found safe and well in New Zealand. Terry is an extraordinary Australian and his previous efforts to raise much needed funds for Soldier On by climbing Mount Cook will never be forgotten #safeandwell pic.twitter.com\/lC6dyQcVx4 — Soldier On (@SoldierOnAust) August 3, 2018 Lieutenant Harch joined the ADFA in 2007 and quickly became one of a small group of ADF climbers who eventually scaled New Zealand’s highest peak, Aoraki-Mount Cook, in 2014, according to the defence publication Army. Described as a “snowman”, he reached the 3724-metre peak in 13 hours, along with two colleagues. “The purpose of the two climbs was to raise money for Soldier On, a charity that supports ADF members who have suffered physical or mental wounds in the course of their service. They raised $1780.”  A modern beacon would have pinpointed Lieutenant Harch’s position more accurately and immediately, Mr Day said. Four Wanaka Alpine Rescue crew, equipped with clothes, tents and much-needed food, were dropped in to the pass late on Thursday. Mr Day said it was not possible for Lieutenant Harch and the rescue team to walk or ski out of the area because of the avalanche risk. Mr Lunt said Lieutenant Harch had sheltered for two nights at Quarterback Pass. “He has clearly made some good decisions to be able to survive the bad weather, heavy snow and high winds,” he said. Mr Aspiring rescue: He’s alive! Rescue team with Australian climber. More to come — Maritime New Zealand (@MaritimeNZ) August 2, 2018 Lieutenant Harch, described as being “in good spirits”, entered the national park on Friday and is thought to have left his heavier gear behind to make a quick ascent – not unusual practice – before being caught out by the weather. The alarm was raised on Monday and rescue crews watched his beacon moving around the mountain for days as concerns grew. During the nearly seven days he was out alone, he endured winds of up to 60km\/h, freezing conditions and, at times, heavy snow. Rescue mission co-ordinator Michael Roberts told the Wakana Sun the pilots had done an amazing job. “The pilots did an amazing job to fly in and out, despite the low cloud tonight.” “It has just hung around the mountain for days and hampered our search efforts. The helicopter crews, Wanaka Alpine Cliff Rescue team and Police all deserve the highest praise for the work they’ve done over the past two days – and particularly tonight,” Mr Roberts said. More than 30 people are thought to have died in and around the popular national park in the past decade. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "When Akshay Venkatesh was 13 years old and had completed his high school studies, he told the ABC he was aiming to “maybe become a mathematician”. Well, that came true – and then some. Professor Venkatesh, who graduated from the University of Western Australia aged 16 with honours in pure mathematics, has achieved his subject’s highest honour. He has been awarded the Fields Medal, known as the “Nobel Prize for mathematics” – awarded once every four years to between two and four people under the age of 40. It is an amazing achievement for the 36-year-old, who was described as a “prodigy” and a “genius” during his teenage years in Perth. But for his mum, who is immensely proud of him, she just wants him to be happy. “That is all I hope for him, that he is happy and he loves what he does,” said Svetha Venkatesh, who is herself a professor of computer science at Deakin University, and a leader in the field of machine learning. Professor Venkatesh, who teaches at Stanford University in the US, is being honoured for work that combines insights from several different fields of mathematics. His former classmate, and now professor of mathematics at the University of WA, Michael Giudici said explaining his work to the general public was hard. One of Professor Venkatesh’s most famous pieces of work is solving what’s called the “subconvexity problem”. To do that, he developed new techniques and borrowed from other areas of mathematics, Professor Giudici said. He recalled that despite Professor Venkatesh being so much younger than the rest of the group at university, he was incredibly well adjusted. “I know in our fourth year, he was probably one of the main characters in the group – always discussing things other than mathematics,” he said. “We spent a lot of time as honours students talking about cricket.” His mum said that was something she was keen to foster. “He was a normal, happy child growing up in a normal family,” she said. “He never did anything particularly special because he was good at maths. It was just one of those things.” When he started university at the age of 13, one of his mentors was Professor Cheryl Praeger, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. “At our first meeting I was speaking with Akshay’s mother Svetha while Akshay was sitting at a table in my office reading my blackboard, which contained fragments from a supervision of one of my PhD students, just completed,” Professor Praeger recalled. “At Akshay’s request I explained what the problem was. He coped with quite a lot of detail and I found that he could easily grasp the essence of the research. “It was clear from the start that Akshay was amazingly talented. He was interested and immediately engaged with all kinds of mathematical questions. “I was sure that he would achieve a great deal mathematically, and I’m thrilled at his stunning success in being awarded a Fields Medal.” Professor Venkatesh is just the second Australian to receive the Fields Medal. Dr Terence Tao won the award in 2006. Comedian and mathematics communicator Adam Spencer said it was a “great day for Australian mathematics” and the crown in a string of recent achievements from Australian mathematicians. “Australian mathematics is on a real roll here,” Spencer said. “First mathematician Geordie Williamson from the University of Sydney was admitted to the Royal Society, making him the youngest member. “Then Nalini Joshi, also from the University of Sydney was named vice-president of the International Mathematical Union. In 2016, when Professor Venkatesh was awarded another prestigious prize, he said doing mathematics gave him a feeling of “transcendence”. “You feel like you’ve been part of something really meaningful,” he said at the time. Now a husband and father of two, he said children were a great way to force him to stop obsessing about mathematical problems. Those children are the joy of his life, his mother said. “He is a terrific father, a wonderful father. And yes, they are the joy of his life. They are the absolute joys of my life, too,” she added."

    "transcript": "This is a story about an inspirational mule called Wallace the Great, who has shaken the staid British equestrian scene to its very hoofs. Wallace, whose sire was a donkey and dam was a horse, comes from a humble background. He was found wandering the streets in Ireland, living off scraps and flowers from village gardens (much to the chagrin of residents), and rescued by a British donkey sanctuary. But 11-year-old Wallace’s life changed dramatically after he met Christie Mclean, from Stroud in Gloucestershire. Ms Mclean competes in entry-level dressage – and had her own problems when all of her horses went lame. This was Wallace’s time to shine – and he and Ms Mclean paired up to learn the delicate movements of dressage. But when they wanted to enter a British Dressage-affiliated competition last weekend, the pair was denied their chance – because Wallace is not a horse. It was a huge blow, especially as Wallace and Ms Mclean had already done well in local competitions. “When British Dressage said the rule book only refers to horses and ponies within its affiliated criteria, I was really surprised and disappointed,” Ms Mclean told the BBC. “I don’t think it’s a case of equine racism but more a case of the rule book being very out of date.” News of the discrimination spread across Britain, sparking a public outcry and calls of justice for Wallace the mule. “It’s got 4 legs, a mane, a seat, why not? Discrimination in the highest order,” wrote one supporter on Twitter. “Wallace the mule needs justice!!! Mules matter,” wrote another. Under pressure, British Dressage buckled, changing the rules to allow Wallace – and “all other animals born to a mare” – to fulfil their destinies. “We are delighted to welcome Wallace and his fellow mules to compete with British Dressage, as part of our commitment to inclusion and diversity in dressage, making the sport more accessible to all,” British Dressage chief executive Jason Brautigam said.  But more momentous news was to come. Not only did Wallace change the course of history for his kind, he went on to win last weekend’s competition. “He did everything I asked of him … he rode beautifully,” Ms Mclean wrote on Wallace’s Facebook page (where he has more than 6000 followers). “I cannot thank everyone enough for the huge amounts of support for Wallace, knowing that he has a chance in life makes it even more heart-warming.” She said history had been made, for mules and for British Dressage, and “wow, was it a good one”. “I [Christie] fully admit that the pressure was firmly there; we’d come this far and, although I trust Wallace 100 per cent, would I remember to breathe?,” she said. “But those big ears flop to the side and he’s in work mode – legend.” Wallace the Great’s future plans are unknown at this stage. But whatever he does next, he is surely already a star."

    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2018\/07\/27\/amazing-dragon-dinosaur-china\/",
    "transcript": "A previously-unknown dinosaur dubbed the “amazing dragon of Lingwu” has been discovered in northwest China, potentially rewriting the evolutionary history of a group of dinosaurs. Paleontologist Xing Xu and a team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found a cluster of fossils belonging to the Diplodocoids according to a new study published in Nature Communications. The Diplodocoids include famous long-neck species like Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. The fossils, dating from about 174 million years ago, were found in the Ningxia region in northwest China. The new find is 15 million years older than the earliest members of this family known until now. Scientists say it changes the historical documentation of how sauropod dinosaurs evolved everywhere. The early Diplodocoid has been named “Lingwulong shenqi”, meaning “amazing dragon of Lingwu” after the town near where it was found. “Previously we thought that advanced sauropods arrived in the late Jurassic and quickly became dominant on this planet, but this suggests that these dinosaurs evolved earlier and spread slower,” saiMr Xu said. In 2005, four excavations began at dinosaur sites in Ciyaopu, Lingwu and Ningxia Hui where fossil fragments of up to 10 partial skeletons (including portions of two skulls) ranging from juveniles to adult were discovered. The new sauropod was based on the examination of these fossils, as Nature reported: “We name a new sauropod based on this material, and demonstrate that it is, to our knowledge, the earliest diplodocoid (and therefore also the earliest neosauropod) sauropod, and the first from East Asia”. “This discovery has major implications for calibrating the timing of neosauropod diversification,” Nature reported, and provides the “first insight into a previously hidden aspect of their evolutionary history”. The Diplodocoids were previously thought to have evolved after the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, but the discovery of these fossils has forced a rethink. These long-neck sauropods, who could stretch up to 36 metres from head to tail, were the largest animals to ever walk on land and dominated the planet’s “land ecosystems” for most of the dinosaur age. According to National Geographic, the “amazing dragon” is “the first dinosaur of its kind ever found in Asia”. Scientists concluded an inland sea had cut off eastern Asia and this so-called “mega-moat” prevented the diplodocoids from reaching this region. “The discovery of our new animal … means that this isolation hypothesis has been somewhat watered down, or even placed in serious doubt,” according to University College London paleontologist Paul Upchurch. “We propose that many of the groups that were supposedly absent in China might well have been present, but we simply do not see them there yet because of poor sampling in the fossil record rather than genuine absence,” he told National Geographic."

    "transcript": "A good Samaritan bus driver found himself in a sticky situation after trying to come to the rescue of a bogged plane on Fraser Island. The light tourist plane got stuck in the sand just north of Eurong, on the Queensland island’s east coast, as the tide was coming in. Dozens of tourists watched on as the bus tried to tow it out, without any luck. The plane managed to get out, but the bus became stuck. It spent the night in the sand and heavy machinery is being taken to the island this morning to help tow it out. The company towing the bus out this morning said it was bringing a hook truck and excavator over from the mainland. “When we get there we’ll have a bit of a dig around the bus where it sunk into the sand and we’ll pull it out,” Rainbow Beach Recovery Repairs and Services’ Dean Hayes said. He said it could take up to six hours to pull the bus free. “It’s not the first time and unfortunately won’t be the last time either,” he said. Mr Hayes said it was an unpredictable landscape to drive on, and even his tow trucks got bogged from time to time. “The sand conditions change every day, you think its all good and you’ll drive into a piece of beach where it’s very soft and just get bogged,” he said. Mr Hayes said the bus was only about three months old and spent the night sitting in about a metre of water. “The bus still looks brand new. There was very gentle seas last night so it [the waves] didn’t do any damage to the bus,” he said. “But unfortunately the salt water does all the damage.” The bus company, Fraser Explorer Tours, offers day tours across the world heritage listed island."

    "transcript": "After a series of catastrophic wildfires in 2014, the Mallee emu wren became extinct in South Australia, but the birds are making a comeback in the state with the help of environmentalists. When the tiny bird — weighing only as much as a 10 cent piece — could no longer be found in SA, there were still numbers that existed in parts of Victoria’s north-west, but they were listed as endangered. In one of the three national parks where they remained, Victoria’s Wyperfeld National Park, their numbers were only in the hundreds. Researchers were concerned a severe bushfire season would threaten the remaining population. Numerous organisations in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, together with the support of the South Australian government, devised a breeding program over four years to boost the birds’ numbers. In April this year, 40 birds, known by bird enthusiasts as the ‘holy grail’, were introduced into parts of Ngarkat Conservation Park. Another 40 birds are due for release in August, with researchers aiming to establish a population of 250 birds over several years. Before extinction, the estimated population of Mallee emu wren in the early 2000s was upwards of 6000 in Ngarkat. BirdLife Australia’s Rebecca Boulton said it was a massive challenge finding a net that could capture the little birds. “They’re such a tiny bird and no one’s ever held them overnight and transported them such large distances before. We had to learn a lot about their husbandry. “You can’t use a traditional net…they’re super fine but these birds are so small they just go straight through the net,” Ms Boulton said. The group had to improvise, she explained, and used large throw nets that covered patches of grass to trap the birds. It took one week to catch just 40 birds. The next challenge for the birds was to find breeding territory and a good insect population to feed on. “We did quite a lot of surveys before the birds were released. The habitat where we’ve left them is similar to the one they came from,” Ms Boulton said. A number of prescribed burn-offs have been conducted in Ngarkat to reduce the risk of wildfires for next summer. Natural Resources SA Murray Darling Basin project officer Luke Ireland said they would be using the next release of birds to refine their technique, before introducing a larger population. He said the group found an easy way to keep track of the birds by painting their tails with nail polish in unique colour combinations. –ABC"

    "transcript": "When The Naked Farmer came to town looking for people to get their kit off for a good cause, dairy farmer Kerry Wilson was approached to take part. He and his partner Paul Wilson agreed, though Kerry had reservations about not having the right body type. “Gee whiz, I’m 56. Does it matter?” Kerry asked. It didn’t. The cause, which raises awareness about the mental health of Australian farmers, hit a personal chord with the couple. Kerry and Paul are fifth-generation farmers who live and work together near Nimbin, in the northern rivers of New South Wales. “It’s been quite a journey, to the point where I left a wife and three sons to become openly gay in the dairy industry,” Kerry said. “You carry a lot of guilt thereafter and even before, the 35 years before that when you know that something’s not quite right in your head, but you can’t quite work it out. Or you’re not quite game to go and work through it with anybody. “So we’ve have our fair share of ups and downs and the agricultural industry is a tough gig.” “Oh, it was horrible,” he said. “At one stage we thought, OK, we’ll just go to Brisbane and start a new life in the city, an anonymous life. But it was a fleeting thought. It wasn’t an option because I had three sons.” At the time the kids were aged nine, six and four. “And they by default had to come on the journey with us,” Kerry said. With the support of Kerry’s former wife, life kept rolling on. “I don’t remember ever sitting around with my head in my hands going, ‘Oh God, what are we going to do?'” Paul said. And, Kerry said, “we weren’t the only gays in the village”. “We used to have a joke, because we moved to Nimbin with three boys and a hundred goats, living on the side of a mountain, that we were the most normal thing in town,” he said. Greying hair and ageing bodies aside, the couple hope that by baring it all they might become the role models they didn’t have. “If there’s normal, average, mainstream people out there that happen to be gay, and some kid in the bush sees that person or that couple and thinks, ‘Oh yeah, that’s me,’ then we’ve done our job,” Paul said. It was his personal struggle with chronic anxiety that made him want to raise awareness about the mental health of Australian farmers. It began on Instagram in 2017 and has expanded to include a calendar and underwear line. “If you scroll through [social media] and see a photo of a tractor, you’re probably going to keep scrolling,” Mr Brooksby said. “But if you see a photo of a tractor and somebody naked in front of it, you’re going to stop and take note and take note of the caption and read about it. “Mental health is a massive thing with me. I’ve gone through it myself, lost an uncle to suicide. “I thought, I can really help out here, so that’s when I teamed up with the Royal Flying Doctor Service and did a calendar.” He said The Naked Farmer was simply about starting a conversation. “I was actually talking to a guy who’s 19, and he said he was having some beers around the fire with a couple of older guys who were about 50,” Mr Brooksby said. “They were talking about The Naked Farmer, and one of the old guys arced up and said, ‘I don’t know how this is getting people talking about mental health. It doesn’t make sense.’ “Then 15 minutes later they were still talking about it, and they were talking about mental health. “Then this 19-year-old guy said, ‘Well, we’re talking about it now, aren’t we?’ “And they were all like, ‘Yeah, I s’pose’.” –ABC"

    "transcript": "Although Heff – the largest turtle at Darwin’s only turtle rehabilitation facility – has been in recovery for three years, he is still not ready to return to the wild. But he will be given all the time he needs at the freshly revamped and expanded centre at Charles Darwin University. Michael Guinea, the president of sea turtle research and conservation group AusTurtle, reopened the facility on Tuesday. He explained it was a place for turtles to finish their rehabilitation before being released back into the sea, no matter how long that took. Darwin vet nurse Geraldine Reid said there had been a jump in the number of injured turtles due to plastic consumption, and a new facility like the one in Darwin could not have come at a better time. It can treat around 20 turtles in individual tanks pumped with high-quality water for as long as required. When a turtle is injured it is usually taken to a veterinarian, who can perform any emergency treatment. But because of their slow-healing biology, they need a few months to recover enough to return to the wild. That is where the rehabilitation centre comes in. “Time is the biggest factor, so what we are trying to do is provide them with the time, expert care, good water quality, uncrowded facilities so they can be released back to where they came from,” Mr Guinea said. Others have already shown improvements after being in treatment for 24 hours. “There are a number of natural causes of turtles becoming sick. Some of it is diet. You hear of things such as massive floods in Queensland upsetting seagrass beds, which causes them to lose weight,” Mr Guinea said. “Then you also have boat collisions. Then the shell can be repaired and there is a very long grow-out period for those turtles.” The rehabilitation centre is the only service available to injured turtles found from Cairns (Qld) to Exmouth (WA). –ABC"

    "transcript": "A program to reintroduce eastern quolls to mainland Australia after 50 years has achieved success with 15 babies found in the pouches of three adult females. Twenty eastern quolls bred in a wildlife park in Tasmania were released into the Booderee National Park on the NSW South Coast in March. At first there were serious concerns the repopulation program would not succeed as a number of the cute carnivorous marsupials became road kill, or fell prey to hungry foxes. But pouch checks on the remaining females revealed that three were carrying five babies each. Director of Rewilding Australia Rob Brewster was delighted with the find. “To see those little babies was just fantastic,” he said. “We checked the pouch and it was a very exciting moment for the researchers to see what any reintroduction program wants to see after this amount of time.” Mr Brewster said they always knew that some of the quolls moved to the mainland would die and the challenge was to make it work. The program was modified once they identified the risks. “We relocated those quolls to a part of the park away from sealed roads and that has been really effective at reducing mortalities and allowing us to have this recent success,” he said. Eastern quolls can carry up to six young each, so to carry five is considered very successful. The babies were small and pink resembling a bean. In terms of their capacity to survive, Mr Brewster said the animals have to move long distances looking for food – so the high number of young helps to ensure some will make it through to the next breeding season. The parents wear GPS collars with satellite tracking used to keep an eye on their progress. –ABC"

    "transcript": "A crowd-funded campaign to launch a giant “Trump baby” blimp into the skies above central London during US President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to Britain has smashed fund-raising targets. More than $18,427 (£10,301) has been crowd-funded to get the six metre-high orange inflatable figure up in the air –smashing the original target of $9000. The anti-Trump activists behind the campaign are determined to have their sentiments known by the President himself. “Donald Trump is a big, angry baby with a fragile ego and tiny hands,” the crowd-funding page said. Activists called Mr Trump a “racist demagogue who is a danger to women, immigrants and minorities, and a mortal threat to world peace”. “Moral outrage is water off a duck’s back to Trump. But he really seems to hate it when people make fun of him,” they said. “So when Trump visits the UK on Friday the 13th of July this year, we want to make sure he knows that all of Britain is looking down on him and laughing at him.” However, despite the successful fund-raising, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has not given activists permission to fly the blimp as it does not qualify as a protest. But that has not done much to deter them. I am a giant orange baby with tiny hands. I just want to fly above Parliament on July 13th when little Donald visit Britain. But @MayorofLondon says I can’t. Sad! Tell @SadiqKhan to let #TrumpBaby fly! https:\/\/t.co\/qjbolEge6r — Trump Baby (@TrumpBabyUK) June 13, 2018 More than 7000 people have signed a petition, titled Let Baby Trump Fly, calling for the blimp to be allowed to fly over Parliament Square during Mr Trump’s visit. There is even talk of hiring a barge to “guarantee that Trump Baby will fly”. “If we are unable to obtain consent to fly Trump Baby from Parliament Square Gardens, we may need to be creative about finding a suitable alternative location,” the protesters say."

    "transcript": "A 13th century illustration of an Australasian cockatoo debunks the myth Australia was “a dark continent” and reveals trade routes around the country’s north were flourishing as far back as medieval times, a study shows. Researchers found the illustration in a manuscript that was either written by or belonged to Roman Emperor Frederick II. It is the oldest-known European illustration of the bird, found in a book dating from between 1241 and 1248, and pre-dating other European illustrations of cockatoos by 250 years. The manuscript includes 900 drawings of falcons, falconers and other animals kept by the emperor. Four of the images are of a white cockatoo — a gift from the Sultan of Babylon to Frederick II. Heather Dalton from the University of Melbourne, who contributed to the research published in the journal Parergon, said the find challenged “the British view” Australia was “a dark continent”. “The significant thing is that this parrot provides a window to a world of quite busy trade to Australia’s north,” she said. “The discovery of these images … highlight the fact that during the medieval period, merchants plying the waters just to the north of Australia were part of a flourishing trade network that reached west to the Middle East and beyond.” Dr Dalton said while many scholars were aware the Sultan had given a “white parrot” to Frederick II, few were aware there were surviving images of the bird. The research team looked at the details, such as the shape of the crest and the colouring of the cockatoo, and concluded it was likely a female — either a triton, sulphur-crested cockatoo or yellow-crested cockatoo. Cockatoos travel well with people, being gregarious and long-lived, making a perfect gift, Dr Dalton wrote. “In captivity, they can have lifespans of up to 80 years and Australian greater sulphur-crested cockatoos have been known to live up to 120 years,” she said. “The journey along trade routes would have taken years, and their chances of surviving would have been much higher than the majority of animals.” –ABC"

    "transcript": "An 18th-century Chinese vase stored for decades in a shoebox in a French attic has sold for a record 16.2 million euros ($25.1 million) at an auction in Paris. The vase fetched more than 20 times the estimate of 500,000 euros to 700,000 euros ($775,000 to $1.1 million) and set a record price for a single item sold by Sotheby’s in France. The vase, part of a family inheritance, was only recently discovered in an attic, the BBC reported on Wednesday. Sotheby’s Asian arts expert, Olivier Valmier, said the vase’s seller took the valuable artefact on a perilous journey to the auction house, protected only by the shoebox and some newspaper. “This person [the seller] took the train, then the metro and walked on foot through the doors of Sotheby’s and into my office with the vase in a shoebox protected by newspaper,” he said. “When she put the box on my desk and we opened it, we were all stunned by the beauty of the piece. “This is a major work of art. It is as if we had just discovered a Caravaggio.” The 30-centimetre, bulb-shaped vase, painted in delicate shades of green, blue, yellow and purple, was described as an exceptionally well-preserved porcelain vessel made for an emperor of the Qing dynasty. It depicts deer, birds and other animals in the woods, and includes gold embroidery around the neck. The vase bears a mark of the Qianlong Emperor, who ruled China from 1736-1796. Mr Valmier said the vase was in perfect condition and “the only known example in the world bearing such detail”. The seller was not as enthused. “We didn’t like the vase too much, and my grandparents didn’t like it either,” the former owner was quoted as saying A Sotheby’s spokeswoman said: “They knew it had some value but nothing like that, nor that it was from the Qing dynasty.” The auction lasted some 20 minutes, a long time by usual standards for such sales, with multiple bidders battling for the prize.

    "transcript": "Rubble is a seven-year-old border collie — a classic working dog. But the pooch has never herded a single sheep. No offence to livestock, but Rubble has always had a higher calling — first as a search-and-rescue dog, and now as a conservation detection dog sniffing out some of Australia’s most elusive and endangered native animals. Owner and trainer Luke Edwards says the dogs are perfect for the job. “We know that border collies are really good at both searching and stamina,” he said. “That’s what we’re after for working dogs — their stamina both mentally and physically. Border collies are well known for that.” Mr Edwards and his partner Tracy Edwards run Canidae Development, an organisation that selects and trains dogs to search for animals. “We sort of live a bit differently than most people with working dogs,” Mr Edwards said. “We’ve got five dogs … and they’re all inside dogs with us. First and foremost they are working dogs but we live as a unit, as a pack. “We spend a lot of time out in the field together. We spend a lot of time working away from home together … we’ve got a pretty close relationship.” The dogs have worked looking for koala and tiger quoll scat, as well as dead birds and bats as part of windfarm mortality surveys. But last year, Rubble and Uda received their most difficult assignment yet. The dogs were called upon by Zoos Victoria to help sniff out one of the country’s most critically endangered species — the Baw Baw frog. The small brown frog lives only on the Mount Baw Baw Plateau in eastern Victoria and, like a number of other amphibian species, it has been hit hard by the introduction of the deadly chytrid fungus. It is estimated that there are fewer than 1200 Baw Baw frogs left in the wild. At the rate they are going, they are likely to be extinct in the wild within a decade. Zoos Victoria amphibian specialist Deon Gilbert says up until now, the only way to find the elusive frog was to listen for their calls — but that can be very tricky. “This species is incredibly difficult to detect in the wild,” he said. “They live predominantly underground … the males only call for about five or six weeks of the year, so that restricts our opportunities to actually locate the species.” Knowing where the frogs are is critical to Zoos Victoria’s captive breeding program. Dogs are often used to detect the presence of animals that live above ground. They’ve been used in northern Australia to detect cane toads. But Mr Gilbert says using dogs to find a native amphibian species that lives underground is as rare as the Baw Baw frogs themselves. “Dogs are very, very rarely used for amphibians. There’s only a couple of examples worldwide that have utilised dogs and it’s certainly a first for Australia,” he said. The first challenge is training the dogs. To start with, the dogs are trained to locate the smell of a frog swab on a ‘scent board’. When they recognise the smell, the dogs drop and indicate with their nose. They are then rewarded with a treat. After that the dogs are giving limited and strictly controlled training with real frogs from the captive breeding program. Ms Edwards says there is no actual interaction between the dogs and the frogs. “As soon as they find that smell and do that drop, they look to us,” she said. “So they’re not actually looking to the animal for the reward, they’re looking back to us for the reward.” Finally, it’s time to go up the mountain. And that’s where the challenges really begin. It’s remote wild terrain – and Mr Edwards says it’s hard on everyone, including the dogs. “The first time we took the dogs up there we actually had about two inches of snow one night – the first time that the dogs have worked in the snow.” Simply reaching the frog’s habitat is a major achievement. “Going out to the sites in Mount Baw Baw is probably one of the hardest areas I’ve had to search,” he said. “Just to get out to the site we’re trekking through alpine forest … it took us maybe 45 minutes to an hour just to arrive on site.” Then the dogs had to catch a scent of the frogs, which can live in burrows up to a metre underground. But the dish-lickers were not about to be licked. Both dogs found several frogs. “The dogs were able to locate the exact site where the frogs were calling from much quicker than we were able to do just by using ears,” Mr Gilbert said. Mr Edwards says it was exciting for everyone involved. “I think the biggest surprise, particularly with Rubble there was … as he stuck his nose into a crevice the frog actually called,” he said. “And he’s [like] ooh here’s a frog there and that was one that no one knew that was in that particular location, so it was really cool.” The frog dogs not only have the potential to locate Baw Baw Frog populations, but also to help when it comes time to release captive-bred frogs back into the wild. Mr Gilbert says the frogs take years to mature, and are not likely to start calling for five or six years … meaning scientists have a long wait to find out if they’ve survived. “We have a huge dark period or dark window where we don’t know if those strategies we’ve put in place were successful or not,” he said. “So we’re hoping to be able to use the dogs to indicate just presence or absence within that time period. “If we release the frogs year after year we can use the dogs to just say ‘Yep, they’re there, they’re alive’ or ‘No they’re not there. Do we change our strategy and look for another option?’ ” Research assistant with Zoos Victoria’s wildlife conservation and science unit, Chris Hartnett, says the detection dog pilot is a success. “We set up a challenge for those dogs to find a species that burrows in mud. It’s brown, it’s small, very cryptic, and the dogs actually detected Baw Baw frogs in the wild, so that was quite a thrilling development.” Zoos Victoria is now considering using detection dogs for other threatened species. “The accuracy of a dog’s nose is really unsurpassed, so they basically have a sense of smell or can have a sense of smell that’s about 10,000 times stronger than humans so we really want to utilise that talent,” Mr Hartnett said. “Particularly for those cryptic and low-density species, we think detection dogs might have a really important role to play. In fact, that could be their niche as a monitoring technique.” Luckily for Zoos Victoria, there are more dogs coming up through the ranks that might be able to fill the new roles. Detection-dog-in-training Oakley is now one-year-old and will start field work later this year and Ms Edwards has been in charge of his training. “He’s only a puppy, or what we call a ‘whuppy’, a whopping big puppy,” she said. “He is just living life at the moment, learning the basics so obedience and recalls and environmental exposure. “We’re letting him have a puppyhood, letting him have a little bit of a life because he is going to work and work hard in his life, so we don’t want to add too much pressure at the moment.”"

    "transcript": "You have to be pretty lucky to win a lottery even once. You have to be exceptionally lucky to win it twice in less than 18 months. But according to Le Parisien newspaper, that’s exactly what happened to one unnamed man from south-east France. His first win was in November 2016 and his second came just weeks ago in May 2018. Both times he won one million euros (thus the name of the lottery “My Million”). That’s about $3 million total. The newsagent who sold him the ticket told the BBC he barely reacted the second time round: “I guess he is used to winning.” UTS Professor Louise Ryan from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical & Statistical Frontiers did a back-of-the-envelope calculation for us based on the report in Le Parisien that said the odds of winning the My Million lottery in any given week were one in 19 million. It’s a bit complicated because while we know the man had been playing weekly, we don’t know how long for. But suppose the man had been playing weekly for five years. Professor Ryan says the chance he would win once in that time is just over one in 73,000. The chance that he’d win twice in those five years and only 15 months apart is roughly one in 1,473,489,000,000. By comparison, the chance that he’d win once over 50 years would be just over one in 10,000. And the chance that he’d win twice in 50 years and only 15 months apart would be roughly one in 139,670,929,703. Those are still huge numbers. To put them in perspective, Professor Ryan said the odds for winning the lottery twice could be compared to “getting a good price for a house in Sydney”. To get the odds of winning just once down to one in 100, you’d have to play weekly for 3,700 years. So, whatever the case, the man in France was extremely lucky. No, Professor Ryan says it’s just not happening. “If I was him I’d probably quit while I was ahead,” she said. Also before you think about trying to replicate his success in Australia’s Oz Lotto, just remember that the odds of winning the first division in that are even less (under one in 45 million). So it’s not going to happen … probably. –ABC"

    "transcript": "Fields of fluffy, white cotton are being harvested by farmers in Australia’s eastern states and fetching prices of nearly $600 per bale, but it is cotton’s street value that has farmers talking. In urban Sydney suburbs hipsters are paying up to $35 for a single branch of cotton, and $50 per bunch, in order to take home the trendy woolly blooms. The cotton trend has also created a fuss in the Twittersphere with one observer crunching the numbers of a stem of cotton he came across for $22. “Seen in a cafe today – if you look closely the price tag says $22 for the cotton plant!!” Seen in a cafe today – if you look closely the price tag says $22 for the cotton plant!! At 10 plants per metre, that’s $22,000 per hectare or equivalent to a yield of 44b\/ha at $500\/b. Are we marketing cotton all wrong?!? pic.twitter.com\/G7R9fwTmTR — Mark Dawson (@markmdawson1) May 7, 2018 Mark Dawson estimated in his tweet that if there were 10 cotton plants per metre and each plant sold for $22 that would equate to $22,000 per hectare. However in reality growers have been averaging 12 cotton bales per hectare this season, which returns the much smaller figure of $6500 per hectare. Southern New South Wales farmer Gavin Dal Broi has nearly finished picking his cotton crop and cannot believe how much people are paying for cotton branches at florists and markets. “It’s extraordinary,” he said. “It’s mind boggling that people are willing to pay for something that we have thousands of hectares of. “I just shake my head at what they are willing to pay for it, but if there is someone willing to pay it, someone is going to sell it.” One thing is for sure, Mr Dal Broi will not be showcasing cotton in a vase or mason jar in his home. “There is plenty on the floor when I take my clothes off at night after being on the cotton picker all day,” he said. “My wife is actually sick of it, so we don’t need any extra sitting inside the house on show.” Cut flower grower Sal Russo from Greater Sydney is among the many wholesalers sourcing cotton from NSW growers and said cotton attracts a lot of attention as it stands out to buyers amongst traditional blooms. He said some people visiting the market see the cotton branches and reminisce about when they used to pick cotton. “They’ll have their kids with them and explain to them how they used to pick it,” Mr Russo said. School teachers are also flocking to the market to buy bunches of the plant to show their students. “Most kids haven’t seen how cotton grows — it’s a real novelty at the moment, but how log it stays in vogue I don’t know.” Mr Russo said he is very particular about the features of cotton branches. “We actually go out to the paddocks and pick it ourselves — there is an art to picking it. “We’ve tried to get people to pick it for us, but when it arrives it looks like it’s been through a mulcher.” Mr Russo said florists are quite fussy when it comes to the plant. “Growers like a lot of cotton on the bottom of the plant, and we like a lot of cotton at the top of the plant,” he said. “When there are dry conditions the tops of the cotton plants are bare — that’s no good.” Mr Russo said cotton is a favourite with florists as it has a long shelf life. “It doesn’t need water and can last up to five years,” Mr Russo said. “Florists have started to use it in their corporate arrangements and they love it. “If you put traditional flowers in that sort of office temperature they only last two or three days, whereas, cotton lasts irrespective of whether it’s hot or cold. “Florists can rely of cotton not to fail if they put in an arrangement.”"

    "transcript": "A large collection of Egyptian antiquities uncovered during a clean-up of a Sydney home has been donated to a university archaeological museum. Rosemary Beattie recalls the oddity of being shown what was supposably a mummified cat during childhood visits to her grandmother’s house. “We’d come and have a look and I’d think, ‘Alright, OK, fine, that’s the cat’,” Ms Beattie said. “But then I’d go and roll the cannonballs on the back verandah; that was much more my style.” The linen-wrapped item was one of the many antiquities her grandfather, John Basil St Vincent Welch, brought back from his time serving as a medical officer in World War I. It is believed he employed the help of a dragoman who assisted him to find and buy antiquities as souvenirs of his time in Egypt. “He brought back chestfuls of memories,” Ms Beattie told ABC Radio. Most recently the artefacts were kept by Ms Beattie’s mother, Margaret St Vincent. The items came to her through her husband, also named John Basil St Vincent Welch, who inherited the antiquities after the death of his father. However ailing health forced her to move into aged care and her house needed to be sold to help with costs. While cleaning up the house, Ms Beattie was tasked with finding a new home for the case of Egyptian antiquities. “It was a big, sort of a long box with a glass front that I had looked at as a child,” she said. “It had been sitting on a closed-in verandah on top of a cupboard.” “We thought what are we going to do with it?” Family members suggested the items be donated to the University of Sydney where both of the men had studied. Archaeologist Candace Richards was ecstatic to learn about the existence of the collection. “I was obviously very excited, confused and really intrigued by what could actually be in this home,” said Ms Richards, the assistant curator of the university’s Nicholson Museum. “We do know that a lot of soldiers, especially in WWI and WWII, did buy genuine artefacts and we know there are lots of fakes out there.” The museum has since catalogued the 185 artefacts, which range from small amulets, scarab beetles, a coffin fragment, ceramic items and bronze Roman coins. It is believed some objects date back to the first millennium BC. “It’s incredibly rare in Australia; we do have items from other WWI diggers but nothing on this scale.” One long-shaped object wrapped in linen and covered in resin is thought to be a mummified cat. It will undergo medical imaging scans to confirm if does contain a feline within the wrapping. “You can’t unwrap these sorts of things because that destroys the artefact in itself,” she said. “But through these technologies that we use in medical science all the time, we can actually use them in Egyptology as well and understand more about those artefacts.” It is expected that many of the items will be displayed in an exhibition at a new museum facility expected to be completed by 2020. Ms Beattie’s family had previously donated 70 military-related items to the Australian War Memorial. Other relics found in the house included 500 photographic glass negative plates, swords, and a hand grenade originally kept by her father who served during WWII. Medals belonging to two German soldiers will be personally returned to their rightful owners. Ms Beattie’s mother died soon after the Egyptian artefacts were donated, but the gesture has inspired her to uncover more about her family’s history. “Sadly [my grandfather] was never really talked about because he died, when my father was five or six years old, from influenza,” she said. “So we didn’t really know much about this incredible man and we’re now at this stage discovering he was fascinating and it’s just sort of opened up a great big world to us.”"

    "transcript": "A US Christian televangelist has called on his flock to fork out US$54 million ($71 million) after claiming Jesus told him he needs a new private jet. Jesse Duplantis, leader of Louisiana’s Jesse Duplantis Ministries, has put out the word that he needs a Dassault Falcon 7X — which would be his fourth jet — because the planes get him closer to the Lord. In a video published on his website, Mr Duplantis said he had a divine conversation in which Jesus asked for the new aircraft by name. “It was one of the greatest statements the Lord ever told me,” he said. “‘Jesse, do you want to come up where I’m at?’ I want you to believe me for a Falcon 7X.” The plane would give him the ability to “go anywhere in the world” to preach without the need for stopovers, the minister said. “All it’s gonna do is it’s going to touch people, it’s going to reach people, it’s going to change lives one soul at a time,” he said of the new aircraft. “I really believe that if Jesus was physically on the earth today, he wouldn’t be riding a donkey.” In the video, Mr Duplantis also shows his followers a photo of him standing beside his other three jets – a Cessna Citation 500, an IAI Westwind II, and a Dassault Falcon 50. Under the photograph is a quote, which he proudly states: “It’s not about possessions, it’s about priorities.” French-based Dassault’s website says the Falcon 7X combines “fighter jet technology with an elegant, whisper-quiet executive cabin”. The plane can seat up to 19 passengers but most Falcon 7X models are configured for only 12 although they can be customised to fit beds and showers. Mr Duplantis is of the school of ‘prosperity preachers’ who believe donations to religious causes will increase one’s material wealth. Fellow prosperity preacher Creflo Dollar faced a backlash in 2015 when he asked his followers to help him buy a Gulfstream G650, according to CNN. Televangelist Kenneth Copeland this year bought a Gufstream V private jet from Hollywood director Tyler Perry with donations from his followers. In a 2016 segment of Mr Copeland’s Believer’s Voice of Victory TV program, he and Mr Duplantis defended their use of private jets, saying it would impractical to fly on a commercial airline “with a bunch of demons”. Mr Duplantis recalled he was on his plane and had to unbuckle his seat belt and stand up to speak to God. “You couldn’t have done that over an airline,” Mr Copeland observed. “Stand up and say, ‘What did you say, Lord?’” “This is so important and those of you that are just now coming into these things in the first place: Jesse and I and others … the world is in such a shape, we can’t get there without [private jets].” Mr Copeland went on to claim that a private jet was the only practical way for he and other preachers to travel. “We’ve got to have this. The mess that the airlines are in today. I would have to stop — I’m being very conservative. At least, 75-80, more like 90 per cent of what we are doing. Because we can’t get there,” he said. “That’s why we are on that airplane. We can talk to God!”  -with agencies"

    "transcript": "On the face of things, plastic bags really seem to have no other benefit than carrying your shopping. They’re bad for landfill, animals and the environment. But a new project in Melbourne’s north has successfully been able to take the dreaded plastic bag and turn it into something that can be used again and again — a road. The 300-metre stretch of road, on Rayfield Avenue in Craigieburn, uses an additive that’s made up of 530,000 plastic bags, more than 12,000 recycled printer cartridges and 168,000 glass bottles. “We think it’s a great initiative,” said Geoff Porter, the mayor of Hume City Council, which takes in Craigieburn. “If this does work out as we hope it will … we will be promoting this all around the city.” Tests also reveal the new road can handle extreme temperatures better and when it comes to costs, is about the same price as traditional road laying. It’s the first time the additive has been used and the results have stunned the recycling company behind it, Close the Loop. “The great thing about it is not only is it competitive, but it is a more flexible road surface, it’s more durable, it’s longer lasting and it’s a great use of product that would otherwise go to landfill,” said Craig Devlin, the company’s chairman. The bags are being collected from Australia’s supermarket giants by another major recycling group. The road additive was developed by Close the Loop using $40,000 from a $2.5 million state government fund designed to boost research and development into recycling. It’s a step in the right direction, and one that could take the pressure off councils in the midst of the Chinese recycling crisis, according to Rob Spence, from the Municipal Association of Victoria. But Mr Spence is warning the full effects may not be felt for some years. “Across the next five years or so, we’re going to see major restructure in this industry,” he said. “It’s going to require a significant capital injection to make this stuff happen. “The environment’s got to be right. It’s all about what the landfill levies and landfill prices are, it’s an appetite in the private sector for entering this space.” Meanwhile the interim agreement between councils and recycling companies for kerbside collection, which was struck in the wake of the Chinese crisis, expires on July 1, 2018. Mr Spence said that councils were only weeks away from striking a new agreement for a similar price — about $1 a week or $52 a year per household. “A number of them have already signed and there are some who are putting a lot of pressure on the recyclers to get better pricing,” he said. “What we want is a smooth process … and that the recycling system continues to operate.” –ABC"

    "transcript": "A baby panda born in a Malaysian zoo five months ago has made her public debut. The female cub, which has not yet been named, is the second offspring of giant pandas Liang Liang and Xing Xing, both of which are on a 10-year loan to Malaysia since 2014. The first cub, a female called Nuan Nuan, was born in August, 2015, and sent back to China last November as part of a deal with Beijing to return cubs born in captivity at age 2. Members of the media watched and filmed the cub in an air-conditioned enclosure at the national zoo through a glass shield. Zoologists said the healthy cub weighs 9kg and will face the public later on Saturday. Zoo officials have said the giant panda pair broke the world record for a second baby in four years via natural reproduction. Malaysia’s national zoo has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars on a panda complex that includes bamboo trees to mimic their natural habitat, after China loaned the cub’s parents to mark 40 years of diplomatic relations with Malaysia. According to WWF, there are 1,864 giant pandas in the wild, living mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China and subsisting almost entirely on bamboo."

    "transcript": "A marsupial lion the size of a large dog that roamed Australia more than 20 million years ago has been included on a global list of the top 10 newly-discovered species. The 11th annual list compiled by the International Institute of Species Exploration (IISW) includes microbes, plants, animals and exotic sea creatures. The list is traditionally published to highlight the diversity of species on earth, especially the endangered ones, and encourage their conservation. But among the rare and endangered creatures highlighted this year is Wakaleo schouteni, a predatory marsupial thought to have hunted the open forest habitat in northwestern Queensland in the late Oligocene period, which ended about 23 million years ago. Scientists from the University of New South Wales recovered fossils in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in Queensland that proved to be a previously unknown fossil marsupial lion, the IISW said. The ‘lion’ was thought to have weighed around 23 kilograms, was the size of a collie dog and spent at least part of its time in trees. Its teeth suggested it was not completely reliant on meat but was, instead, an omnivore. One of Wakaleo schouteni’s discoverers, Anna Gillespie, last year wrote it was highly likely the animal “pursued its prey – small vertebrates like lizards, frogs, birds and small mammals – through the tree-tops of these forests”. “Previously, species of Wakaleo were known from younger sites that spanned the middle Miocene to the late Miocene era, dating to approximately 17 million to 5 million years ago,” she wrote in The Conversation. The new species was named in honour of acclaimed Australian paleoartist Peter Schouten. The 10 species on the IISW list were selected by the institute’s international committee of taxonomists from some 18,000 new species named in 2017. Protist (Ancoracysta twista) This single-celled protist was found living on a brain coral in a tropical aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. Atlantic forest tree (Dinizia jueirana-facao) A 40-metre, 56-tonne tree found in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, home to half of the country’s threatened species. Amphipod (Epimeria Quasimodo) A brightly coloured, 5cm, humped-back crustacean (hence the Quasimodo name) found in icy waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front. Baffling beetle (Nymphister kronaueri) This tiny beetle, measuring just 1.5 millimetres long, lives alongside a species of nomadic army ant. When the ant colony moves every two to three weeks, the beetle joins them, attaching itself to the ants and living off their labours. Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) The most endangered great ape in the world, these diminutive primates are isolated from other species of Sumatra. The male orangutans stand under 5 feet tall, while the females are under 4 feet, which is similar to other orangutans. Swire’s snailfish (Pseudoliparis swirei) The fish resembles a tadpole and lives at the bottom of the Western Pacific’s Mariana Trench. The name can be traced to one of the officers from the HMS Challenger, which discovered the trench in 1875. Heterotrophic flower (Sciaphila sugimotoi) A critically endangered but gorgeous flower on Japan’s Ishigaki Island that produces small blossoms in September and October. While most plants capture energy from the sun to grow via photosynthesis, the flower receives nutrition from fungus without harming it. Volcanic bacterium (Thiolava veneris) The eruption of the Tagoro volcano off the coast of the Canary Islands in 2011 killed off several marine ecosystems, but gave birth to a proteobacteria in the new toxic environment. Named “Venus’ hair,” the bacteria formed a white mat making up nearly half an acre around Tagoro’s volcanic cone. Marsupial lion (Wakaleo schouteni) The marsupial lion lived in the open forest about 23 million years ago and spent part of its life in trees. As big as a collie dog, the omnivore was thought to have increased in size as the Queensland climate became drier and cooler. Cave beetle (Xuedytes bellus) Found in a cave in Guangxi province, southern China, this beetle adapted to have long spider-like legs, a compact body and no flight wings, eyes or pigmentation. It is just over a centimetre long and has an elongated head."

    "transcript": "A fossilised skull of a creature found in Utah beneath a dinosaur foot bone is shedding light on one of the most primitive mammalian groups and prompting a rethink of the timing of the break-up of the bygone supercontinent Pangaea. Scientists on Wednesday described the cranium of a small primitive Cretaceous Period mammal called Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch, about the size of a small hare, that lived 130 million years ago, as boasting traits suggesting it possessed a keen sense of smell and may have been nocturnal. “It’s a plant-eater, as we can tell from its herbivorous teeth,” University of Chicago paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo said. “From the sediments in which it was preserved, likely it lived on the banks or flood plain of a small river.” The 7.5cm skull was well preserved and nearly complete, unlike the usual scrappy fossils of the group to which Cifelliodon belonged, called haramiyidans. The earliest primitive mammals evolved during the Triassic Period, when dinosaurs also first appeared, from creatures that combined reptilian and mammalian characteristics. Haramiyidans appeared close to the dawn of the mammalian lineage, with the earliest-known representative living about 208 million years ago and the last-known member perhaps about 70 million years ago. The skull was unwittingly excavated at a site north of Arches National Park in eastern Utah. The paleontologists from Utah Geological Survey did not know it was entombed in rock brought back to a lab for study until they looked under a foot bone of a two-legged plant-eating dinosaur called Hippodraco. It may be the best-preserved skull of any haramiyidan, offering a new understanding of the group. “Compared to modern mammals, Cifelliodon had a simple, tube-like brain, lacked complex bony structures usually associated with the front part of the brain case and nasal region, and had simple tooth roots, among other primitive features,” University of Southern California paleontologist Adam Huttenlocker said. Before a geological process called plate tectonics rendered them separate land masses, the Americas, Eurasia, Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India all were part of a huge, single continent called Pangaea. The timing for Pangaea’s break-up, initially into two major land masses, has been a matter of scientific debate. The researchers said the discovery of Cifelliodon, which had a close contemporaneous relative in Africa, suggests there were still connections between the northern hemisphere continents and those in the southern hemisphere 15 million years later than previously believed. The research was published in the journal Nature. -AAP"

Kami Rita reached the summit on Wednesday morning with a team of foreign climbers and a fellow Sherpa guide and was already safely descending to a lower camp by the afternoon, said Gyanendra Shrestha, a government official who is stationed at the base camp. The 48-year-old was among the three men – all Nepalese Sherpa guides – who had tied the previous record of 21 successful ascents of the 8850-metre peak. Before leaving for the mountain last month, he told The Associated Press he wanted to scale Everest at least 25 times. Mountaineering has been his family tradition. His father was among the first professional guides after Nepal opened to foreign trekkers and mountaineers in 1950. His brother has scaled Everest 17 times. Most of his male relatives have reached the top at least once. Kami Rita first scaled Everest at age 24, and has made the trip almost every year since then. He has also climbed many of the region’s other high peaks, including K-2, Cho-Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse. In the autumn, he guides clients to smaller peaks in Nepal. The other two summit record-holders are also Sherpas. Apa, a 58-year-old guide who uses only one name, retired in 2011 and moved to Utah. Phurba Tashi, 47, retired from high-altitude climbing in 2013 but still works at Everest’s Base Camp, helping organise expeditions. The route to the Everest summit was opened up by a team of Sherpas earlier this week. More than 340 foreign climbers along with local guides are attempting to climb Everest this month. -AAP"

    "transcript": "What seemed like an innocent birthday outing for Berkley, a kodiak bear, has landed a Canadian zoo in trouble with government officials. Discovery Wildlife Park officials decided to celebrate Berkley’s first birthday with a trip to a nearby drive-thru Dairy Queen. In a video posted on Facebook she could be seen leaning happily out of the car’s window devouring a soft serve out of the restaurant manager’s hand. But once the video was posted the park began to receive criticism. An investigation by the Environment and Parks Fish and Wildlife enforcement branch then resulted in a fine. Serena Bos, a bear trainer at the wildlife park, said the original message of the outing was intended to be about conservation. The park regularly focuses on bear safety and they decided a video educating people not to feed wild bears would be a good idea. “We thought if we were to do something in the natural setting of the park then people might get the idea that feeding a wild bear was a good idea,” she said. “So we thought if it was kind of that extreme, something nobody would ever do, it wouldn’t give the wrong message. “Unfortunately … it was still twisted and taken out of context.” But Ms Bos said the park accepted the fine, because in the end it was their own human error that resulted in the investigation. “The reason we were fined is because we failed to notify special wildlife that we were taking an animal off the property,” she said. There is no rule against taking a bear off the park’s property, nor any animal for that matter, however there are strict rules that stipulate authorities must be notified. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a bear or a guinea pig or if it’s a mouse – we have to notify them,” she said. “And yes we did have human error and we forgot to send our email notifying our authorities that yes we were taking an animal off the property.” The park has since deleted both the drive-thru video and another video showing Berkley eating an ice cream cake. Ms Bos said the park “100 per cent” accepted the charges and did not believe the regulations were in any way too strict. In fact she said they were thankful that the authorities fined them and held them accountable. “It shows the public in … Canada that our regulations are extremely strict and that the animals here are held in the highest respect and have the highest welfare,” she said. “In fact … not only did they inspect the situation but we asked for a fully-fledged inspection of our facility, which they did come and do as well. “That was something we requested just because we felt that it’s beneficial for the public to know that we are inspected and that there are authorities making sure we are giving these animals the utmost respect and care that they deserve and require.” Ms Bos was adamant that when planning Berkley’s ice cream outing they considered both the safety of the bear and the general public. “We would never do anything that would ever jeopardise anybody’s safety,” she said. Berkley is just a cub, and has been raised by staff at the wildlife park. Ms Bos said riding in a vehicle is an everyday activity for Berkley, as she is driven to different sections daily so she can have play time. “So it wasn’t something that she would ever be stressed out from,” she said. “As far as safety goes for the public she was in the truck the entire time, she never left the truck.” Berkley was also on a bear version of a leash — a chain — for the whole trip. Wildlife protection organisations have called the outing completely irresponsible, but Ms Bos said they did not plan for it to be “a stunt”. She said for them it was another part of Berkley’s training for “enrichment purposes”. “Training is considered to be the highest form of enrichment you can give an animal in captivity, it creates brain function no different than you and I going to school or having a job,” she said. “They truly enjoy doing different things.” A lot of the training animals get given is for their medical benefit – bears get trained to pee in a cup and for blood draws, so if they have a medical issue vets can easily test them. “They’re trained to give you their blood samples so we don’t have to sedate them for simple things like that,” she said. “And it really does increase their quality of life. “Even training them to open their mouth big and wide, we can make sure we’re doing regular tooth checks to make sure there’s no problems, because animals get those just like humans do. “In fact we had a jaguar that had his canine tooth broken, he required a root canal and we would have never known if he wasn’t trained to open his mouth and do his daily checks. “We even had to brush the jaguar’s tooth after the root canal, which again had they not been trained that’s not something we would have been able to.” Would they take a bear out for ice cream again? Ms Bos said they would definitely do something similar again, but probably not exactly the same. “It wasn’t taken the way … we wanted it to be taken,” she said. “The goal was to educate people and for it to be taken a specific way — no we wouldn’t do it exactly the same.”"

But VicTrack spokesman James O’Brien said these Melbourne icons would be free for not-for-profit groups, including schools and local governments. “We’ll be covering the cost of those and the transport and relocation cost,” he said. Potential tram owners will have to explain how they would restore, repurpose and maintain the trams as part of the expression of interest process. “There’s been lots and lots of interest over the years from Victorians wanting to acquire a retired tram,” Mr O’Brien said. “We’ve already had historically hundreds of people contact us and say, ‘When you are thinking about selling these, let us know’. “We’re expecting to get lots and lots of applications.” An independent panel will be set up to assess the applications. They will look for applicants whose plans demonstrate the best community use. “If you can demonstrate to us that your tram will be on display once you own it, that will have a higher weighting during the assessment process,” Mr O’Brien said. “A tram is not just for Christmas, a tram is well and truly for life.” Public Transport Minister Jacinta Allan said the retired trams had transported millions of Victorians during their working lives. “If they’re not going to be used on the network, we want to keep these trams accessible to the community,” she said. “These Victorian icons will now be available to come to life once again and preserved for future generations to enjoy.” There are some great examples of trams being repurposed for various uses including as cafes and classrooms. Not-for-profit group Hands On Learning has repurposed one tram which is being used at Fitzroy High School. The expression of interest process will be open from May 28 to July 6."

    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2018\/05\/10\/ancient-cave-technological-innovation-stone-age\/",
    "transcript": "Archaeologists exploring an enormous cave in Kenya have discovered some of the oldest examples of technological innovation by humans, beginning more than 60,000 years ago. Thousands of items have been unearthed, including red crayons that are 48,000 years old and decorated beads made from sea shells and ostrich eggs. Australian National University archaeologist Dr Ceri Shipton said the discovery sheds light on a major turning point in human history. He said for someone whose lifestyle would have revolved around hunting and gathering, the technology was comparable to the smartphone, or the car a hundred years ago. “The invention of the bow and arrow, because it’s such an effective hunting weapon, could have a totally similarly revolutionary effect,” he said. More than 30,000 items have been discovered, many of them in mint condition. Examples of rapid innovation found in the cave include sharp arrow points carved from bone, more sophisticated use of materials for craft work and essential tools. Dr Shipton said the way the artefacts changed over the timeline indicated the people who made and used them were very innovative. “In the early part of the sequence, we see they are using quite big stone tools for making things like stone-tipped spearheads,” he said. “Then around 67,000 years ago there is an abrupt change in the stone tools and from that point on, [the tools] become very small and made of very sharp stone.” The cave, called Panga ya Saidi, is 15 kilometres from Kenya’s south-east coast, just north of Mombasa. Dr Shipton, who was part of the team working in the cave, said it was unique in providing such an unbroken, continuous record of human occupation. Humans moved into the cave 78,000 years ago and lived there until 500 years ago. Dr Shipton said the technological revolution seen there in the Later Stone Age would have driven rapid change. During that period, it was unusual for people to live in a tropical rainforest, as they were mostly found in grasslands where there were larger animals for hunting. Living in a rainforest forced humans to hunt for smaller animals, such as monkeys and small deer, which required more sophisticated technology, thus driving the push for better tools. This helps explains the rapid improvement in arrow points found in Panga ya Saidi. Dr Shipton said it was the kind of “behavioural flexibility” that allowed humans to populate the rest of the world. Other sites from the same period have been found in South Africa and the Rift Valley in East Africa, but this is the first site found with such a continuous record. Dr Shipton said many of the items remain in excellent condition, partly because the cave protected them from the elements, but also because the limestone walls helped preserve materials containing calcium carbonate such as bone, marine shells and egg shells. The tools are still sharp and the crayons still show grooves where they have been used. Dr Shipton said the site was “inspiring” to work on, with clouds of butterflies rising from the vegetation as the jungle over time has begun to take over parts of the cave. “You walk in through this narrow entrance and it opens up into this huge chamber with lots of little passages going off from it,” he said. “It’s so old that the roof has collapsed, so inside it’s actually open air and there is all sorts of jungle growing from within the cave. “And vines growing down from above as well, so when you go in it’s absolutely beautiful. “It has these huge chambers that are lush and green inside and they’re 40 metres across with walls that are 15 metres high. “It’s kind of a sanctuary for local wildlife, so there’s monkeys going across overhead, there’s owls that live in the cave and monitor lizards and a giant python.” The cave remains sacred to the local people, so none of the vegetation or wildlife has been cleared away. “There are parts of the cave, alcoves, that are used for rituals today and it’s a real privilege to work there,” he said. “The locals that we work with are friendly and generous in letting us work there and they’ve also become good archaeologists in their own right.” The project was led by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and the study was published in the Nature Communications journal."

    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2018\/05\/09\/jono-the-orangutan\/",
    "transcript": "It’s 4am at an animal shelter deep in Jakarta’s suburbs, and a small team moves quickly through the night, following a tiny circle of light shone from a dimmed torch. Our point man is armed with a metre-long length of pipe and a dart filled with two potent tranquilisers: ketamine and medetomidine. Beside him is Nasum Ucup, a keeper at the shelter, which houses stolen and smuggled wildlife confiscated by government. He guides us along a row of steel bars and stops at the final cage. The muted torchlight barely penetrates into the cage, but even in the low light you can tell that there’s something big inside. No one speaks … or even whispers. The dart man raises his blowpipe and then the silence of the rescue centre is torn apart by an ear-splitting screech. It’s like a car alarm blasting a metre from your head. It’s a cockatoo: another resident of the centre, alarmed to find half-a-dozen humans creeping through this place in the middle of the night. The whole centre roars into life. The creature in the cage stirs, and stands up. It’s Jono, an adult orangutan, and the reason we’re all here. Jono’s been here, in this tiny cage, for six years, and it’s finally time for him to get out. Jono, unsurprisingly, does not seem calm. Nasum tries to quieten him, patting his hand against the cage and calling, “Jono, Jono, Jono”, in a soft voice, trying to let him know that it’s him, Nasum, a familiar voice, giving the dart man time to get a clean shot. Getting Jono out of the cage without being tranquilised is unthinkable — he’s eight times stronger than any of us and he could tear off an arm or a leg without much trouble at all. Nasum’s still tapping the cage and the cockatoo is still screeching. Before I understand what I’m seeing a black hand shoots out and grabs Nasum’s wrist – and pulls his hand into the cage. Jono bites Nasum, hard, and his hand is still in the cage. The dart man and another keeper dive in and try to pull Nasum’s hand free. After a few seconds Jono releases Nasum, who’s a bit shocked but his finger seems intact. A dart is finally blown in to him, and within a few minutes Jono is knocked out. He’s hauled out of the cage and carried inside for inspection. Femke den Haas from the Jakarta Animal Aid Network says he’s in pretty good condition. “This is the first time we’ve been able to inspect him thoroughly,” she says, as a team weighs and measures the unconscious Jono. He’s then loaded into a custom-made crate ready for the flight to Pangkalan Bun. This mission has been planned for months. Animal welfare volunteers and Indonesian government officials had been working to get Jono out since last year when Jono’s presence at the centre was revealed by the ABC’s Foreign Correspondent program. Femke den Haas says she didn’t know Jono was still in the centre. “This transit centre is very important – it’s where they put wildlife that’s smuggled through the airport,” she tells 7.30. “But it’s a transit centre. “No animal should stay here for more than a few months.” Jono was brought to the centre six years ago after he was confiscated from a private owner who’d kept him illegally as a pet. Efforts to find him a permanent home failed. Ms den Haas says events moved quickly after the Foreign Correspondent episode. The Indonesian government agreed to grant permission for Jono to be moved. DNA tests revealed Jono was from the Indonesian province of Kalimantan. An orangutan rehabilitation centre in Kalimantan agreed to take Jono and donations from Australia helped cover the cost of a new, temporary cage at the Orangutan Foundation International centre outside the city of Pangkalan Bun, run by Professor Birute Galdikas. The centre has released more than 500 orangutans back into the wild. Often the centre is working with baby orangutans that are orphaned by fire or land clearing. The young orangutans are raised by humans and taught survival skills in a jungle camp. Getting an orangutan ready for release is a long process. Professor Galdikas said Jono’s rehabilitation would take several years at least. “We can’t just open the cage door and let him out into the forest,” she said. “We have to make sure he knows how to make a nest. We also make sure that he’s capable of foraging, of finding wild foods in the forest.” Initially he’ll go into a quarantine cage, then into a small reserve. But the first step is getting him to Kalimantan. The most moving parts of the program come when Jono’s finally released into his new, temporary cage. It’s four times bigger than his Jakarta cage, and it’s fitted with ropes and tyres for him to climb. It’s open to the light, and for the first time in at least six years, Jono’s able to swing and hang from the ceiling. It’s a vast improvement. Ms den Haas is in tears as Jono enters his new cage and immediately grabs hold of the ropes, swinging about the cage. “For all these years he’s not been able to swing around,” she says. “In the cage in the transit centre in Jakarta, there was nothing for him to swing with. He was always lying on a bare concrete floor. “That was his life. Dark, no sunlight. Now he can finally swing again.” It is the last stop for Jono. After a short time in his new quarantine cage he will be released into the jungle. Nasum Ucup, the keeper bitten by Jono, also made the trip to Kalimantan with Jono. “I took care of Jono since he arrived in 2012 until today,” he says. “I am very sad but he must return to his habitat. “I am happy too, not just sad. “I’m also proud. Maybe he bit me in that last moment so that he could remember me.” Before leaving, Nasum gives Jono a final wave. “Bye, Jono. Please remember me,” he says."

    "url": "https:\/\/thenewdaily.com.au\/news\/good-news\/2018\/05\/08\/96-year-old-secretary-donates-fortune-students\/",
    "transcript": "Even by the dizzying standards of New York City philanthropy, a recent $US6.24 million ($8.37 million) donation to the Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East Side was a whopper – the largest single gift from an individual to the social service group in its 125-year history. It was not donated by some billionaire benefactor, but by a frugal legal secretary from Brooklyn who toiled for the same law firm for 67 years until she retired at age 96 and died not long afterward in 2016. Her name was Sylvia Bloom and even her closest friends and relatives had no idea she had amassed a fortune over the decades. She did this by shrewdly observing the investments made by the lawyers she served. “She was a secretary in an era when they ran their boss’s lives, including their personal investments,” recalled her niece Jane Lockshin. “So when the boss would buy a stock, she would make the purchase for him, and then buy the same stock for herself, but in a smaller amount because she was on a secretary’s salary.” Since Ms Bloom never talked about this, even to those closest to her, the fact that she had carefully cultivated more than $US9 million ($12.07 million) among three brokerage houses and 11 banks, emerged only at the end of her life – “an oh my God moment”, said Ms Lockshin, the executor of Ms Bloom’s estate. “I realised she had millions and she had never mentioned a word,” recalled Ms Lockshin. “I don’t think she thought it was anybody’s business but her own.” Ms Bloom’s will allowed for some money to be left to relatives and friends, but directed that the bulk of the fortune go toward scholarships of Ms Lockshin’s choice for needy students. Ms Lockshin, the longstanding treasurer of the settlement’s board, called the group’s executive director, David Garza, and asked him if he was sitting down. “We were all agape, just blown away,” recalled Mr Garza, who said the money would endow the settlement’s program which helps disadvantaged students prepare for and complete college. Ms Bloom joins the ranks of unassuming and magnanimous millionaires next door, who have died with fortunes far larger than their lifestyles ever would have suggested. Like Ms Bloom, Leonard Gigowski, a shopkeeper from New Berlin, Wisconsin, who died in 2015, left his secret $US13 million ($17.4 million) fortune to fund scholarships. Grace Groner, who lived in a one-bedroom home in Lake Forest, Illinois, and directed that her $US7 million ($9.39 million) estate go to her alma mater when she died in 2010 at 100, shopped at thrift stores and chose to walk, not drive. Donald and Mildred Othmer, who settled in Brooklyn Heights, lived relatively simple lives; he was a professor at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn and she was a former teacher and buyer for her mother’s dress stores. They invested wisely in Berkshire Hathaway, run by a family friend from Omaha, Warren Buffett, and died in their 90s with three-quarters of a billion dollars, most of which they donated. Ms Bloom, who never had children of her own, was born to eastern European immigrants and grew up in Brooklyn during the Great Depression. She attended public schools and did her degree at night while working days to make ends meet. In 1947 she joined a fledgling Wall Street law firm as one of its first employees. Over her 67 years with the firm, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, it grew to its current size, with more than 1200 lawyers, as well as hundreds of staff members, of which Ms Bloom was the longest tenured, said Paul Hyams, a human resources executive for the firm who became good friends with Ms Bloom over his 35 years working there. Ms Bloom’s husband, Raymond Margolies, who died in 2002, was a city firefighter who retired and became a city schoolteacher with a pharmacist career on the side, relatives said. Nearly all the money was in Ms Bloom’s name alone, Ms Lockshin said, adding that it was “very possible” that even Mr Margolies did not know the size of his wife’s fortune. The couple lived modestly in a rent-controlled apartment, though “she could have lived on Park Avenue if she wanted to”, Mr Hyams said. Ms Bloom was known for always taking the subway to work, even on the morning of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center, not far from the firm’s offices. That day, Ms Bloom, at 84, fled north and took refuge in a building before walking over the Brooklyn Bridge and taking a city bus – not a cab – home."

    "transcript": "Perth Zoo’s newest arrivals may have narrowly avoided a bleak future of social media stardom. The two slow lorises – a three-and-a-half-year-old male and 10-year-old female – have spent the past month in quarantine, after leaving their home at Singapore Zoo. Not much is known about their early life, but staff at Perth Zoo say they were destined for the illegal pet or tourist trade. “They’ve both had their teeth trimmed to make them less of a threat as a pet,” Perth Zoo senior veterinarian Simone Vitali told the ABC. “The male’s had significant root canal treatment before he came here, and so that’s something that we’ll have to keep an eye on now.” “Other than the teeth, they’re in really good health.” The slow loris, which is native to south-east Asia, is a popular subject in social media videos, where they are often filmed being tickled or handled as pets. While the videos may be cute, Perth Zoo hopes to raise awareness that handling the slow loris can be extremely distressing for the animal, and viewers may be unwittingly encouraging wildlife trafficking by watching them. “Having these particular animals here at Perth Zoo allows us to really get the message out about illegal trafficking of wildlife,” Dr Vitali said. The primates, which cannot be released back into the wild due to the trauma of their confiscation, will now live out their lives at Perth Zoo as ambassador animals. “These are the first slow lorises we’ve had at the zoo for over 10 years,” Dr Vitali said. “It’s very exciting for all of us to have them here because they’re such a beautiful, charismatic little primate.” The slow lorises will be moved into the zoo’s nocturnal house in the coming months."

    "transcript": "When seven-year-old Chico started limping on his morning walk, his owner Ahmet Hosgorur thought it was just an injury. Never in his wildest dreams did he think it would be an aggressive form of cancer. But after being diagnosed with a tumour in his right leg, Chico needed help. Luckily, for Chiko’s sake, he was referred to the first and only dedicated oncology facility for animals in New South Wales. “My wife and I were devastated,” Mr Hosgorur said. The multimillion-dollar facility at the Small Animal Specialist Hospital in North Ryde offers surgery, radiation and chemotherapy for animals. It opened in March and claims to be the most advanced in the southern hemisphere, using machines generally used to treat humans to help animals in need. Oncologist Sandra Nguyen said state-of-the-art technology would not only cure cancer in some pets but could also improve their quality of life. “The radiation delivery is moulded to the tumour, so we can try and reduce the side effects, as well as shorten the treatment times where possible,” Dr Nguyen said. “Most patients we see are completely healthy when first diagnosed, so what they require is treatment, so they can continue living a happy and pain-free life.” Before the centre opened most animals were either sent to a similar facility in Brisbane for treatment or would be forced to have a limb amputated to prevent the cancer spreading. “Most people can’t afford to take their pets interstate for treatment, whereas at least here, they can drop their patient off with us, go to work and pick them up on the way home,” Dr Nguyen said. Depending on the form of cancer, the cost of treatment ranges from $3000 to $13,000, while an individual dose of radiation takes around 20 minutes. “It’s really up to the pet owner whether or not they want to proceed with treatment, but I would highly recommend pet insurance,” Dr Nguyen said. “We even had one case where an owner set up a crowd-funding page on Instagram.” Zanthia Harvison put her nine-year-old border collie Dusty through a full cycle of radiation after he was diagnosed with a nose tumour. “He has only just finished four weeks of treatment and it was so worth it — he isn’t in any pain, the tumour is shrinking, and he’s even back to hunting for sticks in the park,” she said. “You don’t put a price on a human’s life — a pet is like one of the family — you do whatever you can to make sure they are happy and we are delighted with the results from this centre.”"

    "transcript": "Bernie Connell is an oyster farmer from the Clyde River on the NSW Far South Coast hoping to claim a Guinness World Record at this year’s Narooma Oyster Festival. Mr Connell has been growing a Pacific oyster named Jack for the last four years. Incredibly, Jack the Oyster has grown to the size of a human forearm and unofficially weighs just over two kilograms. Mr Connell said it was not uncommon for some oysters to grow at faster rates than others in a batch. “Every batch of oysters you get, there’s always a certain few that grow a lot faster than the other ones, so he [Jack] stood out for the last four years,” Mr Connell said. “Any time I’d come back and work my crop he’d be a lot bigger than the other ones. “After a couple of years he was pretty big … so I put him in his separate little home and he’s just grown from there. “He’s still growing. Every time I pick him up he’s got a fringe on him – new shells. So if nothing happens to him he should grow into a pretty big oyster,” he said. Mr Connell said there are several oysters on his lease which could break the record. Mr Connell said growing Jack has not meant much extra work, aside from finding the right spot in the river and a bit of tender loving care. “They’re just a special type of oyster, like Usain Bolt … Just a champion oyster,” he said. “Every couple of months I bring him back to the shed and clean all the barnacles and seaweed off him. “They [the oysters] all eat the same sort of stuff … I look after them and they grow. On whether Jack has reached his peak, Mr Connell said he has still got some growing years in him yet. “He’s only four years old and the one overseas [which currently holds the record], they reckon is about 16, so he’s got a lot of growing to do,” he said. According to Guinness World Records, the current record for the largest oyster was set in Denmark in 2013 by another Pacific oyster found on the shores of the Wadden Sea. The oyster had another five attached to it, but the cluster weighed a total of 1.62kg and measured 35.5cm long. All new world record contenders looking to claim the official title will be weighed, measured and photographed at the Narooma Oyster Festival this weekend. The information will then be sent to the Guinness World Records office for an official appraisal. And as for Jack the Oyster, it looks like he will avoid the plate. “It’s like one of the family, you couldn’t eat him!” Mr Connell said."

    "transcript": "A colourful splash in the sky known as a “fire rainbow” has been spotted in the United States, raising the question of whether the phenomenon could occur in our own backyard. Circumhorizon arcs, a phenomenon that sees wispy rainbow-coloured shapes appear in the sky, have been lighting up social media after a runner spotted one over a national park near San Francisco, California. The “fire rainbows” are formed when the ice crystals that make up wispy cirrus clouds catch sunlight or moonlight at a certain angle. Meteorologist and ABC weather presenter Nate Byrne says they can happen anywhere if you have all the right ingredients. “When it comes to the when\/where question, it’s really a matter of chance,” Ms Byrne said. “Latitude matters and the time of year depending on that latitude matters. “You’re generally most likely to see it when the sun is high in the sky – so summer is the most likely time of year you’ll see it.” A number of conditions in the atmosphere must culminate for the condition to occur: If the stars align (so to speak) and the arc of light passes through the ice crystals at the right angle, the cirrus clouds will light up in a rainbow of colour parallel to the horizon. “When the sun hits the ice crystals, you get pretty colours,” Roger Gass, a meteorologist with the US National Weather Service, told local news site SFGATE. “It’s an optical illusion.” And the closer you are to the equator the more likely it is. Because the sun needs to be so high in the sky for the “fire rainbow” to form, places more than 58 degrees north or south from the equator are unlikely to see it occur. “In the Northern Territory you’re pretty well positioned because you do get quite a few thunderstorms and cirrus clouds occur often after those storms,” Ms Byrne said. “The only reason we’re not seeing more in Australia is because there are fewer eyes looking up to the sky.”"

    "transcript": "A whopper 349-kilogram swordfish caught in Victoria on the weekend may have smashed an Australian record. Melbourne fisherman Matthew Boyle took five hours to reel in the massive fish, which was caught about 40 kilometres off the East Gippsland coast, near Lakes Entrance in the state’s east. The swordfish was caught on a 37kg line and — pending appraisal by Game Fishing Association Australia — could wipe out the old record by more than 70kg. The current record for a broadbill fish, another name for swordfish, is 276kg, caught off Lakes Entrance about a year ago. Tony Kemna from Far Out Charters at Lakes Entrance weighed the colossal catch when it came into port. Mr Kemna, who is also vice president of the Gippsland Lakes Fishing Club, said while there was an element of luck in catching giant swordfish, it also required specialist equipment and plenty of patience. “They are a very, very hard fish to catch,” he said. “You are sending your bait down 500 metres deep, the baits hit the bottom and then … you have flashing lights on the end of the rods near the bait, and the lights bring the swordfish in.” “Over the last two years catching swordfish has been increasing in popularity, there’s a lot of people going out and buying bigger boast and bigger motors … to chase these elusive swordfish.” Mr Kemna said the details of the catch had been sent to Game Fishing Association Australia for record verification. “Everything needs to measured, sent away and then approved … everything goes to them they check it all out and then they say if you have a record,” Mr Kemna said. He said Mr Boyle was experienced with large catches, and that he planned to send the fish to a taxidermist so it could be mounted. It is not the only potential record catch which has been caught near Lake Entrance last weekend. Amy Adamo caught a 94kg swordfish on a 37kg line on Saturday, which is a potential record for a fisherwoman in Victoria."

    "transcript": "Australia has a notorious reputation as home to some of the world’s deadliest creatures and until recently also harboured the oldest known living spider in the world. The trapdoor matriarch, named Number 16, died at the ripe old age of 43 during a long-term population study in Western Australia’s Central Wheatbelt and far outlived her previous rival, a 28-year-old Mexican tarantula. Curtin University’s Leanda Mason said the arachnid’s significant life had allowed scientists to further investigate the behaviour and population dynamics of trapdoor spiders, scientific name Gaius Villosus. The research project was started by renowned University of WA biologist and spider specialist Professor Barbara York Main in 1974, when Number 16 was discovered in her original survey. “Through Barbara’s detailed research, we were able to determine that the extensive life span of the trapdoor spider is due to their life-history traits, including how they live in uncleared, native bushland, their sedentary nature and low metabolisms,” Ms Mason said. Professor Main’s research has shown that the male trapdoor spider leaves his burrow at maturity, around seven to nine years old, to wander in search of a mate, after which he dies. The female stays put, raising hatchlings inside the protection of her burrow, which she temporarily seals up with a mud plug. She lives on in the same burrow for the duration of her life."

    "transcript": "A woman in Spain has found unexpected fame on social media after many found she bore a striking resemblance to US President Donald Trump. Thousands of responses flooded in last week after a journalist reporting on farming in northwestern Spain posted on Instagram a picture of Dolores Leis dressed in farm clothing with a hoe over her shoulder. Freelance journalist Paula Vazquez shared the image of Ms Leis, who lives on a farm in Cabana de Bergantinos district, thinking nothing of it. The picture has since been shared thousands of times on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, all of which noted her likeness to President Trump. Some even began referring to her as “the cousin that Donald Trump has in Galicia.” “Dolores was going to her farm to pick some cabbages,” Ms Vazquez told Spanish news site Faro de Vigo on Tuesday. “So I talked with her for a while, while a girlfriend was taking pictures of her, I took the opportunity to take another one [photo] with my cellphone.” The 70-year-old has since been asked to comment on pressing US policy and international issues – though she has shown more concern for a moth plague threatening her potato crops. “I say that it must be because of the colour of the hair,” Ms Leis told the La Voz de Galicia newspaper on Tuesday. She added she doesn’t use a mobile phone and has little interest in online chatter. -with AAP"

    "transcript": "An old blue heeler named Max remained by the side of a three-year-old girl and led searchers to her after she spent more than 15 hours lost in rugged bushland on Queensland’s Southern Downs overnight. Aurora was reported missing about 3pm on Friday after she wandered off on her own, but a search of woodlands and hills on the rural property in wet weather that night found no trace of her. On Saturday morning, more than 100 State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers, police and members of the public resumed the search and found the girl safe and well with Max the dog at 8am. For his good work in keeping the little girl safe, Max has now been declared an honorary police dog. Kelly Benston, the partner of Leisa Bennett, who is Aurora’s grandmother, said Ms Bennett and other searchers heard the little girl faintly from the top of a mountain this morning. “She found the dog first. Max led her to Aurora,” Mr Benston said. “Max is 17 years old, deaf and partially blind.” SES area controller Ian Phipps confirmed a family member spotted Aurora and Max about two kilometres from the house, still on the family property at Cherry Gulley, 30 kilometres south of Warwick. “The area around the house is quite mountainous and is very inhospitable terrain to go walking in, so she’d travelled quite a distance with her dog that was quite loyal to her,” he said. “The search was actually quite hard where the volunteers and the police were, amongst the very steep slopes full of lantana and other vegetation.” Ms Bennett said she tracked her down after the three-year-old responded to her shouting. “When I heard her yell ‘Grammy’ I knew it was her,” she said. “I shot up the mountain … and when I got to the top, the dog came to me and led me straight to her. “He never left her sight. She smelled of dog, she slept with the dog.” Ms Bennett said it was an emotional reunion with “a lot of tears”. “I think [Aurora] was a bit overwhelmed by the tears and the howling, but I explained to her how happy those tears were,” she said. “It could have gone any of 100 ways, but she’s here, she’s alive, she’s well and it’s a great outcome for our family.” Mr Phipps said Aurora suffered minor cuts and abrasions but was otherwise well and it was a wonderful outcome for the family and searchers. “With the weather last night it’s quite lucky she is well because it was cold, it was cold and raining,” he said. “She’s a very hardy young lass to survive that without any ill effects and everyone, all the volunteers are extremely happy. “They had travelled from all over the region just to do the search and that’s one of the things they join the SES for is to look after the community and do these activities … and bring happiness to a family. “There was a little bit of dread going into it with a cold night last night, but to get such a positive outcome the volunteers are very happy, and will be tucking into a bacon and egg sandwich very shortly.”"

    "transcript": "They are one of the most photographed and “flamboyant” marine creatures off Melbourne’s shores, but scientists say they still know very little about sea slugs and their role in the ecosystem. Divers and families have been invited to join the annual Sea Slug Census taking place across the country’s east coast, to help scientists gather information about the colourful creatures. For the first time, citizen scientists will take to Port Phillip Bay and Westernport over the weekend in this year’s expansion of the census. Information about the location, appearance and population of the nudibranchs will prove valuable to marine researchers, says Southern Cross University Professor Steve Smith. Mr Smith, director of the University’s National Marine Science Centre, says previous census events had gathered more data on nudibranchs than he ever thought possible. “These nudibranchs are an underwater photographer’s dream as they are generally easy to spot, relatively immobile and highly photogenic – it’s like a treasure hunt,” he said. More than 130 species were found outside their previously-known distribution range in previous census events, which have run since 2013, in places such as Nelson Bay, Sydney, Eden, Narooma and the Gold Coast. The slugs have proved adaptable, with one variety surviving by sucking sap out of algae, passing the cells and putting them outside their body like solar panels – the cells photosynthesise and provide the slug with energy. ReefsWatch Co-ordinator Kade Mills says the research is important because sea slugs have been “under studied”. “There hasn’t been much done on ecology and how they fit into the broader picture,” Mr Mills told AAP on Saturday. “We know so little about them, we don’t know if they are (endangered) or not.” -AAP"
