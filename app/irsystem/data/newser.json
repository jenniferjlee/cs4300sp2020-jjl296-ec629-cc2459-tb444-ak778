Residents of the town of 1,400, about 30 miles west of Des Moines, discovered a surprise in their mailboxes Thursday in the form of $150 in gift cards to local businesses. An anonymous donor spent more than $82,000 to ensure all 549 households received $50 gift cards to West Side Bar and Grille, the Hometown Market grocery store, and Trostel's Broken Branch, a restaurant and coffee shop, reports the Des Moines Register. Mayor Jeff Lillie had received a March 26 call from a man acting on behalf of the donor, who'd offered to share 100 gift cards. That number was soon raised to 250, then to 500. Lillie noted that was almost enough to give one card to each household, at which point the donor upped the ante yet again.

It has been unable to offer takeout as they hadn't hired a full staff yet, and because Trostel's husband is diabetic and at an increased risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19. \"You couldn't believe that people would actually want to help you in such a huge way,\" Trostel says of the $27,000 purchase. \"It just gave us hope.\"  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"Beauty Queen Trades Crown for Stethoscope","subtitle":"Bhasha Mukherjee cut her humanitarian work short to return to UK and her old job as a doctor","date":"Apr 7, 2020  3:48 AM CDT","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/289217\/beauty-queen-trades-crown-for-doctor-gig.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        Bhasha Mukherjee was crowned Miss England last year\u2014but with the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the UK, she has now returned from the overseas charity work she was doing so that she can work as a doctor in her home country.

Per CBS News, she set up the DHH Project, in which members with \"no prior experience in sewing\" are creating handmade masks based on the design of commercial masks made for this purpose. That is, with a portion of the front of the cloth mask cut out and replaced with a piece of plastic, so those who read lips or use American Sign Language can see the wearer's mouth or facial expressions, an important component in communicating via ASL. \"This is how we stay #HealthyatHome,\" she writes in a Facebook post.

It's not clear how long she'll be able to keep up with demand, as she's already had dozens of orders come in from six states in just two days' time. Lawrence's group can also provide a tutorial and sewing pattern so others can make the masks. A GoFundMe she set up to raise money for the masks had pulled in nearly $3,400 as of Friday morning.

With an expected surge of cases expected in the state in mid-April, Gov. Charlie Baker has now put out a call pleading for personal protective equipment, or PPE, for health care workers\u2014from face masks and gowns to disinfecting wipes\u2014and New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft has just partially answered that call. The Wall Street Journal reports on a \"remarkable delivery\" due in to Boston's Logan Airport Thursday, when the NFL team's private plane is set to land after a flight from Shenzhen, China, with 1.2 million N95 masks on board. The masks were made by various manufacturers scattered around China.                                                                            Kraft and his family not only arranged for the plane and took care of other details, but also ponied up $2 million, which will pay for about half the costs of the masks. Even New York will reap some benefit from this gesture: Because Kraft has been inspired by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's efforts in that state, he and Baker are planning to send 300,000 of the masks to New York. Baker offered his gratitude to Kraft online Thursday, per Sports Illustrated. \"Thanks to some serious teamwork, Massachusetts is set to receive over 1 million N95 masks for our front-line workers.

Inspired by Michael Rosen's 1989 book We're Going on a Bear Hunt, residents of the US, England, and New Zealand (and maybe other countries) are putting bears in windows so children can spot them from outside. Parents say it gives families a fun distraction and a sense of community as they walk or drive around the neighborhood. \"For about an hour we didn't think about anything else that was happening in the world,\" a Maine mom tells WMTW. \"It was just about the bears.

The exclusive treats have been selling \"like crazy\" since the store put them on display Monday, according to Nick Semeraro, franchisee of the caf\u00e9.

A guy who waterproofs basements. A fashion designer. These are just a few of the Good Samaritans around the country who are sitting behind their sewing machines to churn out face masks for health care workers amid the coronavirus pandemic. As more and more patients are diagnosed with COVID-19, hospitals are facing serious mask shortages: Some have a supply for now but anticipate they'll run out as the virus peaks, while other facilities say their mask suppliers are already neglecting to fill orders. CNN notes volunteer groups have popped up nationwide, with tutorials and instructions offered online by hospital systems and craft stores. Some health systems are even sending kits out with all needed supplies to those willing to put in the time and start stitching. \"We're the ones you want around in the apocalypse,\" one Atlanta-area volunteer tells the outlet.                                                                            These DIY masks are a stopgap, not a panacea: Research shows that health care workers who wear cloth masks have a higher rate of infection than those who don medical-grade masks like N95 respirators. \"Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection,\" a 2013 study noted. One researcher tells CNN if a health care worker is forced to resort to cloth masks, he or she should alternate between two masks, with daily washes in hot water. The CDC also uses the words \"last resort\" in its suggestion that health care workers use scarves or bandannas if face masks aren't around. The AP notes the mask-making effort in the US mirrors those around the world, including in Belgium and Spain, where nuns and members of the Spanish Air Force are pitching in.

In a video posted on Instagram\u2014portions of which can be seen in a Good Morning America clip\u2014Wilson read an excerpt from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera before pronouncing the couple wed. \"What a day,\" Jennings wrote. \"Amidst the uncertainty and despair we all feel right now, marrying the love of my life in the most NYC moment was perfect.\" The honeymoon was also guided by society's new normal: The couple dragged their mattress into the living room to hunker down for some Netflix and chill.

People notes Trebek made this charitable move in the midst of contemplating a big one of his own: his final episode of Jeopardy!, which he says will come only if he can't work anymore due to the effects of treatment for his stage 4 pancreatic cancer. \"We'll play it by ear and keep chugging along until we either win or lose,\" he told CTV in October.

It was hard to believe. With a time of 2 hours, 27 minutes, Seidel had just finished second in the Olympic trials, earning her a ticket to the Games this summer in Tokyo. She beat some of the best runners around, the New York Times reports. Knowing the quality of her competition, she tried not to put too much pressure on herself before her marathon debut. \"But talking with my coach,\" she said, \"I didn\u2019t want to phone it in just because it was my first one.\" Seidel, 25, describes herself as more of a racer than someone who does well in time trials; she said the tough course and headwinds worked in her favor. She was in the pack until Mile 21, when she made her move with Aliphine Tuliamuk and Sally Kipyego. They were the first three finishers and now make up the 2020 Olympic squad. Tuliamuk finished first at 2:27:23.                                                                            At Mile 7, Seidel veered over to high-five her sister. Seidel's route to Atlanta wasn't especially direct. She's overcome an eating disorder. She works two jobs in Boston. She's been a success in 5,000- and 10,000-meter races and won a national cross country championship in 2011. But no marathons. It was her time in a half-marathon in December that qualified her for Atlanta. Seidel has endured a series of injuries over the years, including a stress fracture in her lower back; she hugged, thanked and hugged again her chiropractor on Saturday. Just six months ago, Seidel said, she wouldn't have thought she'd reach even the Olympics trials. But she did think it possible as a fourth grader in Wisconsin. Asked her biggest wish and dream, per Sports Illustrated, she wrote on the back of a photograph of herself, \"I wish I will make it into the Olympics and win a gold medal.\" Her parents still have it.

A custodian making repairs at the school, which was Hoover High School when the purse was lost but is now North Canton Middle School, found the purse last year, wedged between the set of lockers and the wall, CNN reports.

More specifically, she listened to the beat of her son's heart, which had been implanted into Cohen after her son's death. Such meetings are always remarkable, but A.C. Shilton's story in Bicycling explains that this one had even more unusual twist. Cohen had ridden his bicycle across the country\u2014from San Diego to Jacksonville, Florida\u2014to meet Cohen's parents and pay his respects at the gravestone of James Mazzuchelli. The latter had been a 32-year-old Navy flight surgeon when he was mortally injured in a helicopter training mission at Camp Pendleton.                                                                            Cheer and her husband, David, got to the California hospital before he died, but doctors informed them their son would never wake up. Cheer then made sure his organs were donated. The day Mazzuchelli was injured just happened to be Cohen's 33rd birthday. That day, he blew out the candles of his cake and wished for a new heart, writes Shilton.

It took Hunter Wart, 19, more than a year to raise the funds; he mowed lawns and collected scrap metal, which he then turned in to a scrap yard for cash. \"It was a lot of hard work,\" his mom tells CNN. And on Thursday afternoon, it paid off in a big way: Alarms immediately alerted firefighters a baby was inside the box, which was installed at the Seymour Fire Department in June of last year, and she was retrieved within one minute. \"This baby is healthy, perfect, and doing very well, and appeared to be around one hour old,\" the founder of Safe Haven says, per the Tribune.                                                                            \"We are ecstatic that the system was used,\" the fire chief says. \"It worked perfect, exactly how it was designed to work.\" The infant was taken to a hospital and will be placed in the custody of the state's child service workers upon her release; an adoptive home will be found within 45 days, but mothers who surrender their babies have 30 days to return if they change their minds. The boxes are meant to give distressed mothers a place to safely and anonymously leave their babies. Wart, who came up with the idea as a junior in high school and worked on it as his senior project, is now raising money for a second box. He asked that the baby be called Mia, and said he hopes she will reach out to him when she's older and hears her story.  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"Tearful Sumo Champ Wins Over Japan","subtitle":"Tokushoryu is first bottom-ranked wrestler to win top title in 20 years","date":"Jan 28, 2020  11:49 AM CST","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/286188\/in-sumos-cinderella-story-big-boys-do-cry.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        Sumo fans aren't used to seeing displays of emotion.

Those genes appear to have been passed down to his son, who's making headlines for an innovative program meant to assist people who can't afford surgery. CBS News reports that Aguila, an Air Force veteran, set up his M25 program at his Healing Hands of Nebraska clinic after he saw patient after patient have to turn down surgery because it cost too much. Six months ago, he decided to do something about it, and his idea was a creative one: Let those who qualify do volunteer work in exchange for any necessary procedures.                                                                            \"We can't ignore the people in our own backyard,\" Aguila tells CBS.

Reception so far has been positive. \"There's nothing more depressing than seeing a bill for ... $24,000, and going, 'And how much of this will my insurance cover?'\" patient Jeff Jensen tells CBS, noting that instead he put in 560 hours of volunteering (100 or so people helped) as barter for foot surgery. \"This whole practice is about restoring hope for patients by giving them the opportunity to wrest back control of their health care,\" Aguila says.  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"2 Guys Just Made an 'Earth Sandwich'","subtitle":"They precisely placed slices of bread on the ground in New Zealand and Spain","date":"Jan 21, 2020  11:25 AM CST","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/285885\/2-guys-just-made-an-earth-sandwich.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        Two strangers who live a world apart just made an unusual sandwich together.

The result is an \"earth sandwich\"\u2014two slices of bread placed on opposite sides of the planet with about 7,900 miles of earth between them, per the Guardian. See the resulting images for yourself via Reddit. (Sierra actually placed nine slices on the ground, to make extra-sure he hit his precise coordinate.)

James tells KOIN 6 that Eugenio told her without that cash, he couldn't afford living expenses or Christmas gifts for his two young kids. James advised him to visit his local branch the next day, Christmas Eve, to have the hold lifted\u2014but when he went, the bank manager was on vacation and no one else could lift the hold. He called James back in frustration and happened to mention he was at a gas station about 15 miles away from the call center. \"I wish I had just $20 bucks to get home,\" Eugenio says he told James.

The goal is to find new planets, and sure enough, on his third day, Cukier spotted a tiny darkness on a distant sun.

Upon discovering that one box containing a household item also contained a separate box with stacks of bills, a staffer at the facility alerted team members, who called police, then analyzed CCTV footage to see who had left the money behind.

Police, meanwhile, praised employees' actions as going beyond the \"reasonable enquiries\" that would typically be expected. \"Without their diligent attitude, integrity and assistance, the family would never have known about the money found, and we would not have been able to return it to them, especially in time for Christmas,\" a police statement reads, per Metro.  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"Woman Lost in Woods Saved Thanks to iPhone Flashlight","subtitle":"Woman got lost on a trail, was spotted via night vision helicopter","date":"Dec 31, 2019  1:50 PM CST","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/285034\/woman-lost-in-woods-saved-thanks-to-iphone-flashlight.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        That iPhone flashlight really comes in handy sometimes ... like when you're missing in the Florida wilderness and hoping to be rescued.

After years of fear and uncertainty, bottom trawler fishermen\u2014those who use nets to catch rockfish, bocaccio, sole, Pacific Ocean perch, and other deep-dwelling fish\u2014are making a comeback here, reinventing themselves as a sustainable industry less than two decades after authorities closed huge stretches of the Pacific Ocean because of the species' depletion, the AP reports. The ban devastated fishermen, but on Jan. 1, regulators will reopen an area roughly three times the size of Rhode Island off Oregon and California to groundfish bottom trawling\u2014all with the approval of environmental groups that were once the industry's biggest foes.                                     The rapid turnaround is made even more unique by the collaboration between the fishermen and environmentalists who spent years refining a long-term fishing plan that will continue to resuscitate the groundfish industry while permanently protecting thousands of square miles of reefs and coral beds that benefit the overfished species. Now, the fishermen who see their livelihood returning must solve another piece of the puzzle: drumming up consumer demand for fish that haven't been in grocery stores or on menus for a generation. \"It's really a conservation home run,\" says Shems Jud, regional director for the Environmental Defense Fund's ocean program. \"The recovery is decades ahead of schedule. It's the biggest environmental story that no one knows about.\"  (Read more fishery stories.)\u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"How This Boy Saved Christmas","subtitle":"Meet Bailey Stacey, who went on a heartwarming 'investigation,' thanks to a favorite police officer","date":"Dec 25, 2019  8:42 AM CST","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/284795\/how-this-boy-saved-christmas.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        Oxford, Miss., lost its native son Ed Aschoff in a Christmas Eve tragedy, but Christmas day brings us the heartwarming story of 3-year-old Bailey Stacey, who, as the Oxford Eagle and the Oxford Police Department tell it, saved Christmas. The story dials back to Bailey's neighbor, police officer Rachel Ratcliffe, who says Bailey came over one day, \"introduced himself and asked about police work. I let him climb in (her patrol car), he turned on the lights and he turned on the siren. He was just always asking how I was doing and if I saved anyone that day.\u201d Says Bailey's dad, Ratcliffe \"would always make time for Bailey,\" no matter how tired she was. It was a rough year for the Staceys, and when their house flooded, Ratcliffe opened her home to them. With Christmas rolling around, she decided to set up a Grinch-themed \"investigation\" for Bailey to solve.                                     Ratcliffe set up clues for Bailey to follow to save Oxford\u2014and his own present\u2014from the Grinch. The police department tweeted a video of it all. Officer Renika Franks set up clues at the Oxford and Lafayette County Library, Avent Park, and City Hall, hustling to keep ahead of Bailey and Ratcliffe. \u201cI think I had more fun than Bailey did,\u201d Franks said. Mayor Robyn Tannehill and Police Chief Jeff McCutchen were in on the fun, and Police Cpl. Blake Horton played the Grinch. Bailey caught the Grinch green-handed in the mayor's office, stuffing Christmas presents into his sack. Rather than clapping him in handcuffs, Bailey shook hands with the Grinch, who pointed out his present\u2014a Power Wheels police car.

By the time Schoeman arrived at Barcelona's Vall d'Hebron Hospital, her body temperature was 64 degrees Fahrenheit and she had no vital signs.                                                                            \"If she had been in cardiac arrest for this long at a normal body temperature, she would be dead,\" says doctor Eduard Argudo, per the BBC. \"But we knew that, in the context of hypothermia, Audrey had a chance of surviving.\" The low body temperature had preserved her body and brain, says Argudo. That allowed doctors to remove blood and infuse it with oxygen before putting it back in her body. And as Schoeman's temperature climbed into the 80s, doctors used a defibrillator to get her heart ticking again. The result: Schoeman was released 12 days later with only mobility issues in her hands, per Reuters. For Argudo, it's remarkable, if not a miracle. After all, \"there are practically no cases of people who have had their heart stop for so long and been revived.\" (A toddler survived after his body temperature dipped into the 50s.)\u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"During School Shooting, Teen Unlocks Mosque for Students","subtitle":"17-year-old Duaa Ahmad stayed calm, acted quickly during chaos at Wisconsin high school","date":"Dec 6, 2019  9:00 AM CST","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/284006\/chaos-at-a-school-followed-by-a-students-calm-heroism.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        When students in an AP English class at a Wisconsin high school heard a gunshot Tuesday and the teacher yelled for the students to go, what followed was a complete state of confusion and chaos.

Monica Gutierrez tells CNN that her son, an eighth-grader at the IDEA Tres Lagos school in McAllen, joined the cross-country team this year, and one of his teammates got injured because he couldn't afford real running shoes; he was practicing and competing in everyday sneakers. With the boys' regional meet approaching and no extra money of her own to help out, Gutierrez remembered that Kutcher had recently posted a phone number on Instagram asking fans to text him, and because Gutierrez knew about his past work with children, she figured she'd see if he could help get new running shoes for the whole team: \"I thought, 'Come on, let's give it a shot.'\"                                                                            Gutierrez texted the number, which spit back an auto reply with a link to the Community service used by stars to communicate with fans. After posting her message there, she then got an email telling her to send shoe specs to Kutcher's rep, Matt Kulina. Later that week, she found six new pairs of Asics running shoes on her stoop; another pair of size 13 shoes is on its way. Kulina tells USA Today that Kutcher, who's helping to launch the Community service, receives messages through the app, then decides which ones to get involved with. TechCrunch, the New York Times, and Wired explain more about the service, which is the new incarnation of a mobile app called Shimmur. As for the boys and their new shoes, they won regionals and placed third at the state meet. \"I didn't expect it to happen,\" Gutierrez tells CNN. \"The only thing we want is to say thank you for everything [Kutcher] has done.\"  (Read more Ashton Kutcher stories.)\u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"He Saw the Speeding Car.

The CBC and Montreal Gazette report Erick Marciano, 48, was on his way to a meeting Tuesday shortly after noon when he saw a Honda speed through a red light, cops right on its tail. Then, Marciano tells Daybreak Montreal, he saw the car make a U-turn and barrel straight toward an intersection filled with pedestrians. That's when he started honking his horn and drove his vehicle over the median and in the Honda's path. \"I didn't want him to hurt anybody,\" he says. \"I figured, sacrificing a car was really no big deal.\" CTV News reports the front bumpers of both cars were shattered from the impact; a taxi was also damaged. On how he had the presence of mind to know what to do, Marciano said he travels a lot to Europe and keeps on the lookout for terrorist attacks.                                                                            \"I said, 'This isn't going to happen here.'\" The city's mayor is grateful. \"I salute the courage of Erick Marciano, whose heroic gesture saved the lives of many pedestrians,\" Valerie Plante tweeted. The 19-year-old suspect's mother is also glad Marciano was on the scene, as she says her son has mental health issues. \"I don't think I'm a hero,\" Marciano tells CTV, adding that his wife and kids are proud of what he did but also think he's crazy. \"I did what I had to do.\" As for his SUV being totaled, Marciano notes: \"It's just metal. It really doesn't matter. Anything but life is replaceable.\" The suspect suffered non-life-threatening injuries and appeared in court Wednesday, where he faced charges including dangerous driving, assault with a weapon, driving a stolen vehicle, and failing to stop for police.

Images of the silver-backed chevrotain, commonly called the Vietnamese mouse deer, were captured in the wild by trap cameras, Global Wildlife Conservation says. The group says the rabbit-sized animal is not a deer or a mouse, despite its nickname, but is the world's smallest hoofed mammal. They are shy and solitary, have two tiny fangs, appear to walk on the tips of their hooves, and have a silver sheen, the group says. The chevrotain was first described in 1910 by four people. A fifth sighting was reported in 1990 in central Vietnam, making it one of the rarest animals in the world, GWC said in a statement.                                     \"For so long this species has seemingly only existed as part of our imagination. Discovering that it is, indeed, still out there, is the first step in ensuring we don't lose it again, and we're moving quickly now to figure out how best to protect it,\" says An Nguyen, a conservation scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, a partner of GWC in the project. An and his team set up camera traps after receiving reports from local villagers and forest rangers of the animals, the AP reports. The cameras took some 1,800 photos of the species over a period of five months.  (Read more endangered species stories.)\u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"He Proposed While They Surfed.

Sometimes he goes days without speaking at all, his mom Kerry Bloch says. That's why she was so surprised when, on Wednesday, he asked his first-ever question: \"Would someone like me?\" As Kerry Bloch explains to BuzzFeed, in addition to autism, her son has a severe immunodeficiency disorder that has required him to be isolated from other people in order to avoid being infected with an illness. The question broke Kerry Bloch's heart, but the response has put it back together. She posted the question on Twitter, where it went viral, racking up more than 72,000 likes so far\u2014plus a ton of heartwarming responses, including one from Rosie O'Donnell, per Fox News.

Kerry Bloch says she's been reading every single message to David. \"I would show him the responses, the little GIFs, the pictures people were sending. He didn\u2019t answer much, but he would say \u2018pretty\u2019 and \u2018nice.\u2019 You could see him just smiling. I\u2019ve never seen him smile so much in my life.\" She later posted a photo of David holding up a sign he wrote reading, \"Thank you friends for liking me,\" and said he wants to reply to every single person. Among the responses was one from the Jacksonville Jaguars, a team the Florida family loves; a few weeks ago, David said his first unprompted sentence, and it was \"I love Jaguars.\" The team even apparently sent the family breakfast. \"People are always saying, \u2018Twitter\u2019s evil, Twitter\u2019s horrible,'\" Kerry Bloch says. \"I say, \u2018No, it\u2019s what you make it.'\"  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"A Modern 'Clark Kent' Lives in Normal, Illinois","subtitle":"ProPublica profiles Michael Gillespie, an unassuming ransomware 'superhero'","date":"Oct 29, 2019  8:42 AM CDT","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/282354\/in-wild-west-of-cybercrime-we-have-a-superhero.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        He is, as described in a profile at ProPublica, \"like a real-life version of Clark Kent or Peter Parker.\" But 27-year-old Michael Gillespie doesn't battle villains of the usual sort: He has turned into a \"crime-fighting superhero\"\u2014one recognized by the FBI\u2014in the field of ransomware. That would be the growing category of cybercrime in which hackers hijack information and data from individuals or cities and demand payment before releasing it.

Foster forked over the $1 he usually did, played his card, and found out he'd won $5. He plunked his new winnings down for a $5 scratch-off, then bought a second $5 card just for the heck of it.

The Denver Post reports the 18-year-old graduated Sept. 20 from Marine Corps boot camp, and in a video statement, Bialy says his drive to become a Marine was \"nothing but reinforced after the shooting.\" He continues: \"What I saw that day was complete and total malevolence, bad overcome by good,\" though he adds that \" the world lost an amazing person\" during the shooting.

New research in the journal Nature notes that even though it's already known bacteria is able to move from the gut to the pancreas, it wasn't clear whether fungi could do the same\u2014until now. \"Our new study is the first to confirm that fungi, too, make that trip, and that related fungal population changes promote tumor inception and growth,\" study co-author George Miller says in a release from NYU, which led the research on this \"fungal invasion.\" Scientists examined both humans with pancreatic cancer and fecal samples from mice with and without the disease, and found \"an increase in fungi of about 3,000-fold\" in the cancerous tissue compared with healthy tissue.

When the mice with cancer were treated with a strong antifungal drug, their tumor weights dropped between 20% and 40% over a 30-week period. \"We have to move from thinking about tumor cells alone to thinking of the whole neighborhood that the tumor lives in,\" a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Researcher tells the New York Times.

Boyan Slat, a university dropout who founded the Ocean Cleanup nonprofit, announced Wednesday that the floating boom is skimming up waste ranging in size from a discarded net and a car wheel complete with tire to chips of plastic measuring just 1 millimeter, the AP reports. The results are promising enough to begin designing a second system to send to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area of floating plastic trash twice the size of Texas, Slat says. But he sounded a note of caution, saying \"if the journey to this point taught us anything it is that it's definitely not going to be easy.\"                                     The floating boom with a tapered 10-foot-deep screen is intended to act like a coastline, trapping some of the 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic that scientists estimate are swirling in the patch while allowing marine life to safely swim beneath it. After it was towed out to sea last year, the barrier did not catch any trash in its first weeks of operation because it was moving at the same speed as the plastic. That problem was overcome by using an underwater parachute anchor to slow the boom. Also, late last year, the barrier broke under the constant pummeling by wind and waves, requiring four months of repairs before being relaunched in June. The organization wants to continue developing the plastic traps, scale them up, and deploy more to the Pacific so they can gather thousands of tons of plastic each year.

Then, two years ago, a man grabbed her violin and damaged it to the point she could no longer use it; KABC shows cellphone video from that moment as she wailed over her destroyed instrument. \"When I lost that, I felt like I lost everything,\" Zamourka tells the news outlet, which notes she played an electric violin for a while\u2014until someone pushed her off a bus and she broke her wrist. She ended up on the streets not long after that. LA Councilman Joe Buscaino has been trying to find housing for Zamourka, and a GoFundMe set up to help her has already raised more than $30,000, but Buscaino's rep says Zamourka has been hard to find since she became internet-famous. \"She's been overwhelmed with the attention,\" he tells the Post.  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"Pit Bull Puppy Dies Protecting Kids From Snake","subtitle":"'Pit bulls are the most loyal dog I know of,' says grieving owner","date":"Sep 30, 2019  5:30 PM CDT","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/281081\/pit-bull-puppy-dies-protecting-kids-from-snake.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        Oriley Richardson, 10, was playing in his Florida backyard Sept. 23 when his family's 9-month-old pit bull puppy, Zeus, jumped toward him and started attacking something on the ground.

But when Orion noticed the pup's eyes looked \"bugged out,\" they turned him over and found that he had actually smothered a venomous coral snake, which had bitten him four times before he ultimately bit off and swallowed its head. The Richardsons rushed Zeus to an animal hospital for anti-venom, but he died the next day.

The institute will \"take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding kindness\u2014through evolutionary, biological, psychological, economic, cultural, and sociological perspectives,\" per a release. \"In the midst of current world politics, violence, and strife, the UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute seeks to be an antidote,\" notes a UCLA social sciences dean.

The philanthropic organization was established by Matthew C. Harris, a UCLA alum, and his wife, Jennifer; the name of the foundation arose from the names of their three kids, Beckett, Dakota, and Riley. UCLA's new push for kindness will be achieved via lectures, online programs, and even a meditation app designed to cultivate kindness. \"[Kindness] is, in terms of the perpetuation of our species and the ability to live with each other and nature, critically important,\" Harris tells the Times.  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"CEO Raising Everyone's Salary to at Least $70K","subtitle":"The process will be finished in 2024","date":"Sep 26, 2019  2:13 AM CDT","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/280930\/ceo-opens-new-office-raises-minimum-pay-to-70k.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        When Gravity Payments bought Boise, Idaho, firm ChargeItPro three years ago, the lowest-paid employees made $24,000 a year.

Two of the fertilized eggs developed into viable embryos. \"Five years ago it seemed like the production of a northern white rhino embryo was an almost unachievable goal\u2014and today we have them,\" says Jan Stejskal, director of communication at the Dvur Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in the Czech Republic, where Najin and Fatu were born.

He'd been alerted to the retirement farewell in Tennessee by Sowers' colleagues, who'd tracked him down for the occasion. For his part, Sowers\u2014who said he'd expected nothing more than \"doughnuts and coffee\" at his goodbye get-together, per an FBI release\u2014tells NBC Rembert's appearance was \"probably one of the best surprises I've ever had.\"                                                                            Rembert, who was told when he was around 5 that he'd been abducted, said he never knew many details about his case, as he'd been reluctant to make his parents dredge up such painful memories, and so he'd never asked too many questions about it. The reunion with Sowers proved fruitful in that regard, as the retired FBI agent filled in some of the gaps for Rembert, including the fact that they'd cajoled Rembert's abductor to lead them to the baby. Sowers was pleased to find out what Rembert, whom he'd always wondered about over the years, had done with his life. \"I'm proud of anybody that serves others above themselves,\" he said of Rembert's military service. \"The fact that he is now doing that makes that case even more special.\"  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"Plane Takes Unfortunate Detour in Bahamas","subtitle":"All 3 people aboard are rescued by fishermen after crash","date":"Aug 9, 2019  2:45 PM CDT","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/278958\/plane-takes-unfortunate-detour-in-bahamas.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        A fishing crew plying the waters in the Bahamas made an unexpected discovery\u2014a raft with three plane crash survivors.

So what was the Florida couple to do when they got engaged? Ask wedding guests to bring school supplies for kids in need in lieu of traditional wedding gifts. They came up with an \"Angel Tree\" idea, in which each guest was given a description of the children they'd be buying for, and the guests really went for it: More than 70 backpacks were donated, full of school supplies, uniforms, other articles of clothing, water bottles, and even cleaning supplies. The couple donated them to a nearby school in Tampa with a high poverty rate.                                                                            Kelli tells WFLA it was her now-husband who really sparked the idea: \"I was a fan of the no wedding gifts, but I even said, 'Well maybe we could have them donate toward our honeymoon or something like that.' And he was like, 'No, let\u2019s not even do that.' And that\u2019s when we started brainstorming a little bit more.\" But her career path inspired the specifics, because she knows how hard it is for kids to start school without the things they need. \"It\u2019s so important that when the kids start school, excited to come to school, as silly as it seems, a new backpack can be what gets them excited,\u201d she said. She adds that the donations will help teachers, too, because \"being a teacher, when you have students that don\u2019t have supplies and things like that, you take it into your own heart and feel the need to go and get that for them.\"  \u00a0"},{"source":"Newser","title":"Woman Buys Out Entire Payless Store to Help Those in Need","subtitle":"Carrie Jernigan says it all began with a simple request from her daughter to donate one pair","date":"Jul 27, 2019  8:00 AM CDT","link":"https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/278361\/woman-buys-out-entire-payless-store-to-help-those-in-need.html","transcript":"                                                                                    \u2013                                        It started with a pair of Avengers-branded shoes. One day in May, attorney Carrie Jernigan was shopping at a Payless near her home in Alma, Ark., with her kids, trying to grab as many pairs of deeply discounted footwear as she could after Payless announced it would soon be closing all of its stores, per CNN. But when her 9-year-old daughter asked if they could buy a pair of Avengers sneakers for a classmate in need, Jernigan was struck with an idea: What if she just bought out the entire store and donated all of the shoes? And so she half-jokingly asked the clerk how much she'd want for the 350 or so pairs of shoes still perched on the store's shelves. Per KFSM, the clerk asked for Jernigan's phone number and told her she'd let her know about her request.                                                                            A few hours later, Jernigan got the call that she could buy out the rest of the store\u2014and while she was there to pick up her new footwear, a final shipment came in with more shoes, and Jernigan scooped those up, too. All told, she went home with about 1,500 shoes, worth about $21,000 before the store's slashed prices. Jernigan had so much new merch that she decided to hold a fundraiser in August, where she'll also give away school supplies to families in need. Local businesses and a church are assisting her with that effort. She hopes this will inspire others. \"If they can go help one person, one child, go to school with a new pair of shoes on, it will make that child\u2019s day so much better,\" she tells CNN.

If he had arrived at the scene much later, it would have been a dead human. Quinones, a Portland resident who works for a company that makes route-planning software for cyclists, soon realized that he had found a semiconscious, badly sunburned, and dehydrated man who had collapsed. \"Once I got a better look at him, I could tell he was in deep trouble,\" Quinones tells the AP. There was no cellphone coverage in the high desert region of Lake County, but Quinones was able to summon help by pressing the SOS button on his GPS device. An ambulance turned up an hour later and picked up Gregory Randolph, a 73-year-old man who had collapsed after hiking 14 miles over four days with one of his dogs.                                                                            Police say Randolph had been exploring the area when his Jeep became stuck in a canyon. One of the two dogs he brought with him was rescued when he was, and the other was found near his Jeep two days later after police used an aircraft to locate the vehicle. Police say Randolph was incredibly lucky that Quinones, who was on a weeklong back-country trip, turned up when he did. Lake County has fewer than 8,000 people in an area almost the size of New Jersey and the road Randolph was found on only sees around one vehicle per week. \"The real hero of the story is Mr. Quinones,\" a Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy tells the Oregonian.
