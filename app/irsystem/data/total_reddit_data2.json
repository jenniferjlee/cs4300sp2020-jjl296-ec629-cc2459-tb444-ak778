This compares to 43% generated by fossil fuels \u2013 coal, gas, and other carbon sources such as oil and diesel. The remaining 8.5% was generated by biomass, such as wood pellets.\n\nThis milestone comes as the UK enters the mid-point between 1990 and 2050, the year in which it has committed to achieve at least a 100% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions based on 1990 levels, and to become a net zero carbon economy.\n\nA decade ago, fossil fuels generated more than three-quarters of all electricity, while zero-carbon sources accounted for less than a quarter (22.8%), with wind at 1.3%. Then, coal plants provided almost a third of the UK\u2019s electricity. This has dwindled to 1.9%, and Britain set a new record for going without coal-powered energy altogether in summer 2019: it went for 18 days from May to early June without using coal to generate electricity, the longest such run since 1882.\n\nBy the end of this winter, the UK will be left with only four coal fired power plants. EDF Energy\u2019s Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire closed this year and two other coal plants, RWE\u2019s Aberthaw B and SSE\u2019s Fiddler\u2019s Ferry, are due to close in March 2020.\n\nThe National Grid figures show a dramatic shift in the last two decades. Wind farms, solar panels and hydro power now generate just over a quarter of Britain\u2019s electricity, compared with 2.3% in 1990. Nuclear power accounts for 17%, compared with nearly 20% in 1990. However, the use of gas \u2013 a fossil fuel \u2013 also shot up to generate more than 38% of the country\u2019s electrical power last year, compared with just 0.1% in 1990.\n\nNational Grid\u2019s chief executive John Pettigrew said: \u201cAs we enter a new decade, this truly is a historic moment and an opportunity to reflect on how much has been achieved.\n\n\u201cAt National Grid, we know we have a critical role in the acceleration towards a cleaner future and are committed to playing our part in delivering a safe and secure energy system that works for all.\u201d\n\nOther recent government figures showed that the UK\u2019s growing fleet of offshore wind projects generated more electricity than onshore windfarms for the first time in the third quarter. Since then, wind power reached fresh highs during blustery weather in early December to generate almost 45% of the UK\u2019s electricity on one day.\n\nIn December, National Grid unveiled plans to invest almost \u00a310bn in the UK\u2019s gas and electricity networks over the next five years. Of this, almost \u00a31bn has been earmarked for the transition to a net zero carbon electricity system by 2025, including investments in new equipment and technology.\n\nA further \u00a385m will support changes to the ways people heat their homes, switching away from gas boilers to technologies such as electric heat pumps and hydrogen boilers. National Grid estimates that more than 23 million homes will need to install new low-carbon heating solutions by 2050.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to make clear, for avoidance of doubt, that various references to energy and power meant electricity only.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/P76FZHSSYdtKG3xXxyhKrQAMhzKVX-LjHj-XobzU8M0.jpg"}, {"title": "Buy Shrooms \u2013 nextworldmedicinals.com", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygjk_qDv1wo&amp;feature=youtu.be", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-1-1", "transcript": "We\u2019ll stop supporting this browser soon.

Certainly, audio/voice platforms are not an exception. In fact, they gather a fast-growing segment devoted to enjoying music and videos.

What is even better is that this strategy is successful not only in the music industry but for many other sectors too. See below some types of audio/sound backlinking strategies you can start.\n\nMusic Industry\n\nThe music industry uses this link strategy as one of its primary sources of marketing. In fact, some resources to maximize the potential of links were developed to satisfy this industry. Nowadays, the artist needs to promote their music through streaming platforms and redirect their listeners to the platforms where they can buy their records and other things. Now they rely on quick links that are easy to create, affordable, help to improve other SEO actions and the following:\n\nShort URLs: by shorting URLs, links look more aesthetic and occupy less space in the site\n\nMulti-platform: Artists offer their music through several streaming platforms, and sometimes their availability may vary according to the geographical location of the users.

Many of them include spaces to offer information about the song and the artists. One of the greatest advantages of these platforms is that songs can be classified in genres that attract specific targets of consumers for each of them.\n\nFor instance, you can relate RAP and Pop style music with young generations. On the other hand, classical music could be related to older listeners. In other words, you can find any target in music platforms.\n\nNew Discoveries Through Music Platforms\n\nThe music environment is somehow conducive to explore new things.

Their goal: turn millions of snow-lovers into climate voters.\n\n\"The industry's much bigger, much more rabid, maybe more powerful and wealthy than the gun lobby, and yet we have no power,\" said Aspen Ski Co.'s Auden Schendler, pointing out that 10 million skiers logged about 59 million visits to U.S. resorts last winter.\n\n\"How do you mobilize that?\" he asked. \"Weaponize the outdoor community as a political movement.\"\n\nThat means venturing beyond the corporate sustainability campaigns already underway at resorts and ski companies, such as pressing local utilities to switch from coal to renewables, signing letters to policy makers and sending snow sport celebrities to lobby Congress.\n\nWinter sports companies are now trying to mobilize those millions of skiers, snowboarders and other winter enthusiasts into a passionate political force for action on climate change by encouraging them to contact policy makers, vote for climate-friendly candidates and spread the word about climate change in their circles. The 2020 elections could become a proving ground for this new strategy to mix politics and play.\n\nThe winter sports industry knows it is facing an uncertain future.\n\nOne analysis, from a 2018 report by scientists with Climate Impact Lab, predicts that the number of days with below-freezing temperatures in Truckee, California, could shrink from 41 to 8 on average by the end of the century, and from 196 days to 141 at Stowe, Vermont. Rocky Mountain resorts, like Breckenridge and Taos, can expect their low-temperature days to decline by as much as one-third.\n\nAnother study, published in 2017, found that climate change will shorten the winter recreation season across the U.S., with half as many downhill skiing days in some places by 2050 and up to 80 percent fewer by 2090.\n\n\"We estimate these season-length changes could result in millions to tens of millions of foregone recreational visits annually by 2050, with an annual monetized impact of hundreds of millions of dollars,\" the study said. \"Limiting global greenhouse gas emissions could both delay and substantially reduce adverse impacts to the winter recreation industry.\"\n\nIt's not just snow sports at risk. Mountain communities depend on agriculture, and mountain ecologies support wildlife, along with water storage for farmers, aquaculture, livestock and forestry.\n\nSki Resorts Have Started Cutting Their Own Emissions\n\nStaring down that chilling reality, resorts have been focused so far on reducing their own carbon footprints.\n\nAt the climate-focused Mountain Towns Summit 2030 in Park City, Utah, this past fall, four major resort operators touted accomplishments like supplanting coal-fired power with renewables and adopting composting and recycling to reduce food waste at their lodges. But speaker after speaker conceded that resorts can't solve climate change on their own.\n\nSign up for InsideClimate News Weekly Our stories. Your inbox. Every weekend.\n\n\"Mountain towns are comprised of passionate citizens, vibrant businesses and natural splendor,\" and climate change threatens their economic stability, snowfall and way of life, local officials point out in a pact that was signed by more than 40 summit attendees, including government agencies, cities, counties, nonprofits and businesses.\n\n\"The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and must be addressed at all levels. As leaders in mountain communities, it is our obligation to address this issue in a bold, timely, and meaningful way,\" they wrote.\n\nThe signers pledged to be net-zero carbon emitters by 2030 and described steps they're taking to educate visitors about climate change and turn them into advocates for climate-friendly policies.\n\nLaura Schaffer, sustainability director for Powdr, which operates the Snowbird resort in Utah and Killington Ski resort in Vermont, said visitors can expect to see more educational programs, such as one promoting sustainable behavior at the Killington ski school and the company's campaign to protect the environment so skiers can \"play forever.\"\n\nAt Alterra Mountain Co. resorts, Sustainability Vice President David Perry said it's time to counter the climate change disinformation campaigns used by fossil-fuel companies and their supporters.\n\n\"They've changed a lot of minds to their disinformation campaign over a long period of time, and it's been incredibly effective,\" Perry said. \"So we [ski companies] are on the back foot in a lot of these conversations. Guests are more receptive to communication when they're on vacation, and we are going to be taking advantage of that.\"\n\nGetting Politicians to 'Give a Fl*ke' About Climate Change\n\nAspen decided years ago that the risk of driving away some customers wasn't nearly as threatening as climate change, and it has become the industry leader in climate outreach. On chairlifts, guests might find a quote from Pope Francis about the need to reduce the human harm to the climate. Throughout the Aspen Snowmass resort, staff members have been trained to talk about climate change and the threat it poses to winter recreation\n\nThere's also \"Give A Flake,\" Aspen's marketing campaign to turn winter sports enthusiasts into climate policy advocates with easy-to-share social media messages and postcards that praise politicians who #GiveAFlake about climate change\u2014and needle those who don't. In 2018, \"Give A Flake\" was responsible for a million postcards targeting three swing-state Republican senators who, while they don't reject climate science, \"haven't really done anything\" about it, in Schendler's view.\n\nThe \"Give a Flake\" campaign aims to turn skiers, snowboarders and other winter sports enthusiasts into climate policy advocates. Credit: Matt Powers via Aspen Snowmass\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who leads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and has been one of the few Republicans willing to talk about climate change concerns, hosted climate solutions hearings last spring, just months after being targeted by a \"Give A Flake\" campaign that criticized her record. When \"Give A Flake\" ran an ad in Outside Magazine targeting her the previous fall, she responded and got into a public exchange with Schendler in letters to the magazine over her climate record.\n\nAspen visitors also see the \"Protect Our Winters\" logo on employee uniforms, which refers to an athlete-led climate-action nonprofit that's been breaking trail for the winter sports community's public engagement effort for more than a decade.\n\n'We Can Turn Our Passion Into Purpose'\n\nPOW previously used a more traditional approach to raising awareness about climate change. To spur fans to become more politically active, snow sport stars like POW founder and professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones have testified before Congress and are featured in videos urging outdoor recreationists to get political about climate change.\n\nThis year, POW has a strategic plan to get out the vote, with an eye on more than 34 million Americans who identify themselves as climbers, skiers/snowboarders, trail runners or mountain bikers\u2014roughly 25 percent of the 2016 election voters.\n\n\"With the right tools, these Americans\u2014this passionate outdoor community of ours\u2014can be the difference in addressing the climate crisis,\" POW Executive Director Mario Molina, who previously served as international director for The Climate Reality Project, wrote in the strategic plan. \"Connected by our shared love of the outdoors, we can turn our passion into purpose and then into results.\"\n\nThe group's 2020 game plan is to secure pledges from 40,000 people in Maine, New Hampshire and parts of Nevada, Colorado, Michigan and North Carolina to vote with climate as a top priority. POW is volunteering to help host 100 community events in these priority areas that feature outdoor athletes, and it is planning contests to engage more people on the issue.\n\n\"We need to continue to validate personal experience with scientific facts\u2014that's a powerful combination,\" said Molina, who sees the thrill of snow sports as a powerful impetus for inspiring outdoor recreation enthusiasts to press politicians on climate change.\n\n\"With the right tools, these Americans\u2014this passionate outdoor community of ours\u2014can be the difference in addressing the climate crisis,\" said Protect Our Winters (POW) Executive Director Mario Molina. Credit: Jesse Dawson\n\nMolina wants to shift people's thinking so personal climate action takes on new meaning beyond simply recycling or driving a hybrid. He wants outdoor enthusiasts to see voting as a powerful tool for fighting climate change.\n\n\"If we were to get a million people to call their representatives once a month,\" he said, \"we would see different results coming out of both our state and federal legislatures.\"\n\n\"The ski industry, particularly, has potential to wield incredible political power,\" Molina said, if it is able to motivate guests to become climate advocates, \"let's just say how the NRA recruits people at gun shows.\"\n\nSome in the ski industry cringe at the comparison. They also look at some of the negative attention Patagonia attracted when it opposed President Donald Trump's move to downsize the Bears Ears National Monument. Its open resistance to Trump administration policies was targeted on social media with a #BoycottPatagonia effort.\n\nDespite the pushback from some quarters, Patagonia CEO Rose Mercario has called the response to the company's environmental campaigns \"overwhelmingly positive.\"\n\nSki Industry Has Been Ramping Up Activism\n\nThe ramp-up of political activism around climate change has been underway in the background in the outdoor recreation industry for years. Ski companies are part of the Outdoor Business Climate Partnership, the U.S. Business Climate Action Contribution Platform and We Are Still In, the coalition supporting Paris Accord climate-pollution reduction goals after the Trump administration announced the United States would pull out.\n\nThe Boulder, Colorado-based Outdoor Industry Association began arguing with Utah's Republican leaders over a decade ago about state policies on public lands.

Last January, for example, Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, among other participants, formed a group called the Partnership for the Bay\u2019s Future that said it was going to commit hundreds of millions of dollars to expand affordable housing and strengthen \u201clow-income tenant protections\u201d in the five main counties in and around San Francisco. Microsoft meanwhile made a similar pledge in January of last year, promising $500 million to increase housing options in Seattle where low- and middle-income workers are being priced out of the city and its surrounding suburbs.\n\nAmazon has made similar pledges in the past, with CEO Jeff Bezos pledging $2 billion to combat homelessness and to fund a network of \u201cMontessori-inspired preschools in underserved communities,\u201d as he said in a statement posted on Twitter at the time, in September 2018.\n\nNow, however, Amazon is taking an approach that immediately raises the bar for its rivals in tech: it\u2019s opening up a space in its Seattle headquarters to a homeless shelter, one that\u2019s expected to become the largest family shelter in the state of Washington.\n\nBusiness Insider reported the news earlier today, and it says the space will be able to accommodate 275 people each night and that it will offer individual, private rooms for families who are allowed to bring pets. It will also feature an industrial kitchen that\u2019s expected to produce 600,000 meals per year.\n\nThe space is scheduled to open in the first quarter of the new year and is part of a partnership Amazon has enjoyed for years with a nonprofit called Mary\u2019s Place that has been operating a shelter out of a Travelodge hotel on Amazon\u2019s campus since 2016.\n\nThe new space, which BI says will have enough beds and blankets for 400 families each year, isn\u2019t just owned by Amazon but the company has offered to pay for the nonprofit\u2019s utilities, maintenance, and security for the next 10 years or as long as Mary\u2019s Place needs it.\n\nBI notes that the shelter will make a mere dent in Seattle\u2019s homeless population, which includes 12,500 people in King County, where Seattle is located. But it\u2019s still notable, not least because of the company\u2019s willingness to house the shelter in its own headquarters.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that no other tech company of which we\u2019re aware has taken. The decision also underscores other cities\u2019 equivocation over where their own, growing homeless populations should receive support.\n\nIn just one memorable instance, after San Francisco Mayor London Breed last March floated an idea of turning a parking lot along the city\u2019s Embarcadero into a center that would provide health, housing services, and stays for up to 200 of the city\u2019s 7,000-plus homeless residents, neighboring residents launched a campaign to squash the proposal. It was later passed anyway.\n\nVox noted in report about Microsoft\u2019s $500 million pledge that many of these corporate efforts tend to elicit two types of reactions: either admiration for the companies\u2019 efforts \u2014 or frustration over the publicity these initiatives receive. After all, it\u2019s hard to forget that Amazon paid no federal tax in the U.S. in 2018 on more than $11 billion in profit before taxes. The company also threatened in 2018 to stop construction in Seattle if the city passed a tax on major businesses that would have raised money for affordable housing.\n\nWhether Amazon \u2014 one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a current $915 billion market cap \u2014 is doing its fair share is certainly worthy of exploring in an ongoing way. The same is true of every tech company that\u2019s \u2018eating the world.\u2019\n\nStill, a homeless shelter at the heart of a company like Amazon is worth acknowledging \u2014 and perhaps emulating \u2014 too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one entity that\u2019s going to solve this\u201d issue of urban homelessness, Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary\u2019s Place, tells BI. \u201cIt\u2019s not on corporations. It\u2019s not on congregations. It\u2019s not on government.

Illinois begins the legal sale of marijuana on Jan 1, 2020. Matthew Hatcher | Reuters\n\nIllinois rings in the new year on Wednesday by joining 10 states and the District of Columbia in allowing the legal sale and purchase of marijuana. Illinois became the 11th state in the nation to legalize recreational pot use in June after Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a bill into law, permitting Illinois residents and visitors to buy the drug from licensed dispensaries, beginning on Jan. 1. Marijuana enthusiasts and those curious about the drug are expected to flock to the more than three dozen licensed dispensaries in the state, most located in Chicago or Chicago suburbs. Cresco Labs, a Chicago-based cannabis company, says it has spent weeks training its roughly 530 employees in Illinois on educating new marijuana users in anticipation of a swell of curious shoppers on Wednesday. The company, with dispensaries peppered across Chicago's suburbs, has also prepared a full selection of products, including flowers, prerolled joints, vapes, concentrates and edibles. Depending on the product, prices usually fall between $15 and $80, according to the company's website. \"The level of excitement has far outweighed the launch of an iPhone or new pair of Jordan [shoes],\" Cresco Labs spokesman Jason Erkes told CNBC.\n\nInterior of Sunnyside, a cannabis shop located in Chicago. Cresco Labs\n\nUnder the new state law, adults over the age of 21 may own 30 grams of cannabis flower, 500 milligrams of THC in pot products and 5 grams of cannabis concentrate. People visiting the state are allowed to purchase 15 grams of the drug but cannot transport it across state lines. The drug can only be smoked in private residences and smoke shops, according to the state law. For the big day, Cresco Labs rented out a coffee shop near its dispensary in Lakeview, Erkes said, where the company is expecting the highest traffic. Some of the staff will be there Wednesday to take preorders as well as educate interested customers on products and how to consume the drug, he said. \"We anticipate people who haven't used cannabis in 20 or 30 years and those who never have,\" said Erkes, who added the company is estimating \"thousands\" to line up across four of its stores. The law, which also imposes a tax on marijuana sales, is expected to generate a large amount of revenue for the state. Marijuana purchases will be taxed based on THC content \u2014 a 10% sales tax on pot products with THC levels of 35% or less, a 25% tax on products with THC levels of 35% or more and a 20% tax on all THC-infused products.

That\u2019s one thing I knew had to be different for me this time around in order for this to work; I had to make healthy and sustainable lifestyle changes that I could actually stick to long term.\n\nUltimately, this all led me to calorie counting, which is the simple tool to which I credit my weight loss. For me, counting my calories worked because I never had to completely cut out any certain foods if I didn\u2019t want to. If I really wanted something, I could still have it, I just had to learn how to incorporate it into my daily caloric allowance.\n\nBefore, when I would try and lose weight, I always categorized food as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d\u2014and now my outlook has totally changed. I realize now that there are foods that are more nutritious and make my body feel better when I eat them, and there are foods that are less nutritious but just taste really good.\n\nI\u2019ve found that what works best for me is focusing on fueling my body with foods that are nutritious and make me feel good when I eat them 80 percent of the time, and incorporating those other foods 20 percent of the time. Over-restricting never worked for me before, so I\u2019m thankful I\u2019ve found balance.\n\nHere\u2019s what I typically eat in a day now:\n\nBreakfast: A yogurt bowl with Greek yogurt, berries, chia seeds, powdered peanut butter, sugar-free jam, and cinnamon. I also enjoy an iced coffee with a scoop of protein powder.\n\nA yogurt bowl with Greek yogurt, berries, chia seeds, powdered peanut butter, sugar-free jam, and cinnamon.

My favorites are Enlightened and Yasso.\n\nI started going to the gym the very first night of my weight-loss journey.\n\nMy friend had a gym at her apartment complex and we went there together. I had no idea what I was doing\u2014all I knew was that I was determined to move my body for at least an hour.\n\nWe did all cardio that first night. I walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes. I also tried the elliptical but couldn\u2019t last longer than 30 seconds. I switched to the stationary bike and did that for 15 minutes, too. We finished with some bicep curls.\n\nThat night, I went home and looked up gym routines that incorporated cardio and strength training and I stuck to those routines I found online (e.g., workouts on PopSugar Fitness on Youtube), while making adjustments to push myself as I lost weight.\n\nTBH, physically going to the gym five nights a week became unrealistic for me, which is how I developed a love for home workouts. I could still get three to five workouts in per week, and it was much more convenient.\n\nCurrently I work out three to five times a week at home but I am going back into the gym in the new year. I am going to start focusing more on strength training\u2014and being in a gym with tons of equipment will allow me to accomplish that better than I can through my home workouts. I am seriously so excited to get back in the gym and challenge myself.\n\nI went from never working out to running a 5k this past August. If you had told me that I would run a 5k before the start of this journey, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\n\nFrom May 2018 until now, I've lost 150 pounds. I\u2019m *so* much happier and stronger today than I ever thought was possible.\n\nI am not a nutritionist. I did not study exercise science in school. I am just a woman who had a poor relationship with food her entire life. I used to eat fast food every day, sometimes multiple times a day. I was a secret binge eater. I would sneak food into my room/car/pockets and eat alone so no one would see. I knew I was harming myself but I didn\u2019t understand how and wasn\u2019t ready to change. Until one day, I was.\n\nI started slow, made simple changes, and things started to click. I am the epitome of, \"If I can do it, anyone can do it.\" I changed for me and no one else. I embraced all the changes, both mental and physical, that this journey has brought me, and I\u2019m healthier and happier than ever before.\n\nThere were times I wanted to quit and go back to my old lifestyle. But on my worst days I would remind myself of why I started and how miserable I felt that night on the stairs bringing in groceries.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NSwmwGMTJ61Hn0Io2gRhDHsFDt0fe61Yh8K00x4JJaI.jpg"}, {"title": "Europe: Anti-Christian Attacks Reach All-Time High in 2019", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/15366/europe-anti-christian-attacks#.XgzBISnT9qR.reddit", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-1-1", "transcript": "\"We are witnessing the convergence of laicism \u2014 conceived as secularism, which relegates the faithful only to the private sphere and where every religious denomination is banal or stigmatized \u2014 with the overwhelming emergence of Islam, which attacks the infidels and those who reject the Koran.

(Photo by Veronique de Viguerie/Getty Images)\n\nAnti-Christian hostility is sweeping across Western Europe, where, during 2019, Christian churches and symbols were deliberately attacked day after day.\n\nGatestone Institute reviewed thousands of newspaper reports, police blotters, parliamentary inquiries, social media posts and specialized blogs from Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. The research shows (see appendices below) that roughly 3,000 Christian churches, schools, cemeteries and monuments were vandalized, looted or defaced in Europe during 2019 \u2014 which is on track to becoming a record year for anti-Christian sacrilege on the continent.\n\nViolence against Christian sites is most widespread in France, where churches, schools, cemeteries and monuments are being vandalized, desecrated and burned at an average rate of three per day, according to government statistics. In Germany, attacks against Christian churches are occurring at an average rate of two per day, according to police blotters.\n\nAttacks on Christian churches and symbols are also commonplace in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Spain. The attacks overwhelmingly involve Roman Catholic sites and symbols, although in Germany, Protestant churches are also being targeted.\n\nThe perpetrators of anti-Christian attacks \u2014 which include acts of arson, defecation, desecration, looting, mockery, profanation, Satanism, theft, urination and vandalism \u2014 are rarely caught. When they are, police and media often censor information about their identities and ethnic backgrounds. Many suspects are said to have mental disorders; as a result, many anti-Christian attacks are not categorized as hate crimes.\n\nIn France and Germany, the spike in anti-Christian attacks dovetails with the recent mass immigration from the Muslim world. The lack of official statistics on perpetrators and motives makes it impossible to know precisely how many attacks can be attributed to Muslim anti-Christianism or the jihadist cause.\n\nIn Spain, by contrast, attacks against churches and crosses are overwhelmingly carried out by anarchists, radical feminists and other far-left activists, who appear to be striving for Christianity to be permanently removed from the public square.\n\nThe motives behind the anti-Christian attacks, which are often met with public indifference, seem to fall into four broad categories:\n\nVandalism . Most attacks against Christian sites in Europe consist of acts of vandalism. These often lack explicit anti-Christian intent, but cross over into profanation and desecration when they target objects and symbols sacred to Christians. From a strictly legal perspective, such crimes are difficult to prosecute as hate crimes: according to the laws of most European countries, prosecutors must prove that the vandalism was specifically motivated by an animosity toward Christians or Christianity.\n\nTheft . Many attacks have financial motives. In France, Germany and elsewhere, thieves have stolen church bells, sacred metal objects and even drain pipes, apparently with the aim of selling those items to scrap dealers. In Britain, nearly half of all churches on the National Historical List for England have been ransacked. Many of the crimes are being attributed to highly organized gangs which use drones, online maps and global positioning systems first to identify their targets through aerial footage and then plot their own escape routes. The plunder is dominated by thefts of metal, with entire roofs being removed from historic places of worship, according to the heritage agency, Historic England.\n\nPolitics . Some attacks, especially those against Roman Catholicism, which some radical feminists and radical secularists perceive to be a symbol of patriarchal power and authority, are political in nature. Such attacks include defacing churches and religious symbols with political graffiti, much of it anarchist or feminist in nature. In Geneva, Switzerland, for instance, the iconic International Monument to the Protestant Reformation, also known as the Reformation Wall, was vandalized with multi-colored paint forming a rainbow, a symbol of the LGBT groups.\n\nReligion. Many attacks that appear to be religious or spiritual in nature reflect a deep-seated hostility toward Christianity. Such attacks include smearing feces on representations of Jesus Christ or statues of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Other attacks involve the defilement or theft of Communion wafers, which Roman Catholics believe are transformed into the real presence of Christ when consecrated. Some of these attacks may be the work of Satanists, who use the consecrated host in a ritual called the Black Mass. Such attacks, especially on the essence of Roman Catholic beliefs, appear to be aimed at intimidating or harassing Catholics or preventing them from practicing their faith. These attacks, which do meet the definition of hate crimes, pose a direct threat to the freedom of religion in Europe, but prosecutions are rare.\n\nWriting for the Spanish newspaper ABC, Juan Pedro Qui\u00f1onero, its Paris correspondent for more than 35 years, explained:\n\n\"The desecrations have an evident anti-Christian character. Drunk with fierce hatred, the vandals want to give their actions a clear anti-religious dimension. In recent months, anti-Semitic gangs have desecrated Jewish cemeteries, 'signing' their actions with swastikas. In the case of the desecration of Catholic churches, vandalism is not 'signed.' It speaks for itself: heinous mockeries of the figure of Christ on the cross and the desecration of high altars.\"\n\nEuropean media outlets, which often amplify attacks on Muslims, have tended to downplay malicious acts against Christians. The issue of anti-Christian vandalism was rarely reported by the European media until February 2019, when vandals attacked nine churches within the space of two weeks. The issue made headlines again in April 2019, when a suspicious fire gutted the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Since then, however, the European media are once again shrouding facts in silence.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Monde has disputed the government's use of the term \"anti-Christian acts\" and warned politicians not to \"instrumentalize\" the issue:\n\n\"More than a thousand acts a year, an average of three per day: the number is high, but what does it cover? Can we really speak of 'profanations' \u2014 a strong term \u2014 which implies an attack on the sacredness of a place of worship? \"Ideological motivations are in the minority: it is mainly about thefts and vandalism. The perpetrators often are minors.\"\n\nAnnie Genevard, a French MP for the center-right Republicans party, has called for a parliamentary investigation in order better to understand the nature and motivations of anti-Christian attacks. In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, she said:\n\n\"Recently, two terribly serious acts of vandalism were committed in symbolic places and shocked me greatly. A few days ago, the fire in the Church of Saint Sulpice, a church that houses remarkable works: there is nearly a million euros of damage and works are irretrievably lost! And some time ago, vandals broke into the Basilica of Saint Denis and damaged stained-glass windows and the organ. Saint Denis it is not only a place of Christian worship, it is the necropolis of the kings of France! It is a meeting place between our national history and our Christian roots. That one dares to attack this monument is really shocking not only for Christians but for many citizens, whatever their convictions. When an anti-Christian act is committed, we turn our backs on the history of France, which has an intimate connection with the Christian religion. \"To attack a Christian tomb or a church, whatever the motivation of the author, is a way to attack one part of our collective identity, because Christianity and its monuments have shaped our culture, our history and our landscapes. Seeking to destroy or damage Christian buildings is a way of 'wiping the slate clean' of the past. In an era where the most absolute cultural relativism reigns, it is all the more serious that some of our oldest and most valuable landmarks are endangered. A civilization that would deny and turn away from its past would be a civilization that would be lost. I think this is worrying, and there is a need for a strong political response.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Italian magazine Il Timone, the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus-Toulon, Dominique Rey, said that the attacks against churches in Europe are taking place within the context of a European society marked by secularism, nihilism, hedonism, cultural and moral relativism, consumerism, and the widespread loss of the sense of the sacred. He noted:\n\n\"In the past, even those who said they were non-Christian lived in a cultural context marked by Christianity.... roots that have been abandoned by our culture and by our societies. Once the Christian roots, which were the common denominator, were removed, people turned to communitarianism, which led to a social fragmentation that is leading to a break. To find a common base of values and points of reference, Europe must restore centrality to its Christian roots.... \"There is an evolution of acts of profanation against monuments, but also against the Catholic faith itself. In the past, even if one was not a Christian, the expression of the sacred was respected. We are facing a serious threat to the expression of religious freedom. Secularism must not be a rejection of the religious, but a principle of neutrality that gives everyone the freedom to express his faith. \"We are witnessing the convergence of laicism \u2014 conceived as secularism, which relegates the faithful only to the private sphere and where every religious denomination is banal or stigmatized \u2014 with the overwhelming emergence of Islam, which attacks the infidels and those who reject the Koran. On one hand, we are mocked by the media ... and on the other, there is the strengthening of Islamic fundamentalism. These are two joint realities.\"\n\nThe French political analyst J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, in his book \u2014 French Archipelago: Birth of a Multiple and Divided Nation \u2014 shows how the de-Christianization of France is taking place within the context of mass migration from the Muslim world. He provides extensive statistical data \u2014 for instance, that less than 5% of French people regularly attend Mass on Sundays \u2014 to show that France's detachment from Christianity is so far-reaching that the country now is effectively \"post-Christian.\" He writes:\n\n\"There is a growing de-Christianization, which is leading to the 'terminal phase' of the Catholic religion.... For hundreds of years the Catholic religion profoundly structured the collective conscience of French society. Today this society is the shadow of what it once was. A great civilizational change is underway.\"\n\nAppendix I: Attacks on Christian Churches and Symbols in Europe in 2019\n\nGatestone Institute reviewed thousands of newspaper reports, police blotters, parliamentary inquiries, social media posts and specialized blogs from Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain.

Peterson also made a noteworthy claim worth thinking about. He said Islam is not compatible with democracy and that this issue has been barred from public discussion.\n\nA chief spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, Ava Muhammad, has officially gone on record disparaging Jews by stating that Jews are \"godless... blood-sucking parasites [that] sell us alcohol, drugs, depraved sex, and every other type of low-life thing.\"\n\nA statement like Ava Muhammad's above is a grave reminder to us that Peterson is correct. Islam is not only incompatible with democracy -- it is inimical to America's fundamental values and principles. More important, it is in violation of the United States Constitution. It is time for the United States to face the truth about a moral and political ideology whose stated goal is the abolition of our political system.\n\nWhen we examine the application of Sharia law in the West, most particularly in Europe, where it is gaining ascendancy, people will come to see a few fundamental tenets about Islam. Its foundation and governing principle is that Sharia law regulates the personal and public behavior of all Muslims and non-Muslims under its governance. When we think of Islam mainly as a religion, we cannot disambiguate it from Sharia law, which, when examined, allows us to see that the legal, cultural and political aspects of the religion supersede the purely private religious aspects of it. World Islam has become, above all, a political ideology.\n\nSharia law is a weaponized political tool supervening the public sphere that violates every sacred tenet of American life.\n\nThe institution of slavery remains lawful under Sharia law. Those who repudiate their faith in Islam directly or indirectly are guilty of capital offenses. It therefore conflicts with our constitutional human right of freedom of conscience and religion. The Sharia law of apostasy restricts other human rights, such as freedom of expression and association. Sharia law does not guarantee equal rights for men and women.\n\nThis past April, the nation of Brunei, in a four-page document addressed to the European Parliament, defended its new sharia law implementation by insisting that stoning to death for adultery and extramarital sex, amputation for offenses such as sodomy and theft, and the death penalty for homosexuality be regarded as permissible because these come from Allah.\n\nIn 2011, a Muslim group in Denmark in a \"Call to Islam\" campaigned vigorously in parts of Copenhagen and other Danish cities into \"Sharia Law Zones\" that would function as autonomous \"enclaves\" ruled by Islamic law. The agenda was to make parts of Copenhagen and other Danish cities into \"Sharia Law Zones\" that would function as autonomous \"enclaves\" ruled by Islamic law. Salafism, a sect within Islam, calls for the destruction of Western democracy and demands that it be replaced by a universal Islamic caliphate and worldwide Islamic theocracy ruled by Islamic law. So does the charter of Hamas. The statement referred to man-made laws and rules as obstacles to be destroyed by all Muslims and exhorted Muslims to rid the world of the great evil of democracy. Islamic courts are also operating in many of Germany's big cities. In Britain, a Muslim group called \"Muslims against the Crusades\" has called for the application of Sharia and championed turning twelve cities, including a renamed London called \"Londonistan,\" into independent Islamic states. Ruled by Sharia law, the states within Britain would operate completely outside British jurisprudence.\n\nThe \"parallel justice system\" is compromising secular law not only in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and France, where Islamic law is displacing French law in parts of suburban Paris, but also right here in the United States of America. Let us never forget the 2008 case of a Moroccan man and his 17-year-old wife who immigrated to America. A short while after migrating to the United States, she filed a restraining order, claiming that her husband was repeatedly raping her. The husband did not deny that their relations were non-consensual; he simply told the judge that in his religion, the wife is required to submit to all his desires. The New Jersey judge stated that, given his understanding of Islam, the man had not intended to commit a crime and was therefore innocent. The judge denied the restraining order. The denial was, fortunately, overturned by a higher court. There have been other cases in the United States where judges allowing Islamic law and customs to supersede inalienable constitutional rights have simply been seen as nothing more than being guilty of committing a legal error.\n\nJust as problematic is the extent to which a number of American financial institutions have started taking steps to become Sharia-compliant. This is in order to both attract and manage Muslim wealth.\n\nIn 2017, the Quran was used for the first time to swear in new U.S. congressman Keith Ellison. He was a former spokesperson for the Nation of Islam and became the second highest leader of the Democratic National Committee. Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) followed in January of 2019 by wearing a traditional Palestinian robe and took the oath on Thomas Jefferson's translated version of the Quran.\n\nA number of U.S. public schools are commemorating Muslim holidays and holding Islamic prayers toward Mecca. Rocky Mountain High School in Colorado in 2011 became the first school in the United States to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in Arabic.\n\nRevolutions of the deepest kinds always begin with our children.\n\nIt was, indeed, our late great president, Abraham Lincoln, who declared: \"The philosophy of the classroom today will be the philosophy of the government of tomorrow.\"\n\nThat government is arriving soon, armed with a philosophy few of us as Americans will survive.\n\nJason D.

The website reports that an investigation conducted by some local Assyrian activists revealed that the footwear was produced by a Turkish company called FLO, located in Gaziantep, in southeastern Turkey.\n\nKurdish shops import the shoes and distribute them in their stores, entice their customers to trample the cross, holy symbol of Christianity and sign of hope and peace.\n\nIt is impossible to understand the meaning of such an act in view Europe's view of alleged Kurdish democracy, freedom of religion, tolerance of Muslims towards Christianity in Iraq's Kurdish region. With such acts, Kurdish Muslims show their real attitude towards Christians as native population of the country and their values. \"It is a pity that empty slogans about tolerance and mutual respect, intended for naive Europeans, find fertile soil in Western media and mislead the public,\" says the article.\n\nThe article goes on to explain how a cross on a shoe sole is perceived in Muslim culture, regardless of which nation represents it. Usually, when Muslims enter the room, they take off their shoes - and then when someone accidentally removed the shoe turns over with the sole up, spits on the sole and places the shoe into the normal position. When there is a cross on the sole, the cross is spitted on. Shoes generally are seen as despised garments. One of the most offensive phrases in that culture is: \"You are a shoe.\" This statement often leads to serious conflicts.\n\nThe range of the offensive assortment included in previous years even more products: women's footwear, socks, and slippers \"decorated\" in many places with symbols of the cross.\n\nAfter protests from the Assyrian Christian population against such acts, the local Kurdish authorities demonstratively withdraw these shoes from one store, usually in front of cameras of foreign correspondents, while allowing them to be sold in others. No one thinks to punish both importers and shop owners for insulting religious feelings of the Christians in a region where a few months ago people were mass murdered for loyalty to the sign of the cross. Instead, the authorities encourage extremely primitive, truly barbaric humiliation of the indigenous people of their country and region, especially during the holiday season.\n\nThis attitude towards fellow citizens reveals the true face of the \"good-neighbor\" attitude of Muslim Kurds to Christian Assyrians, dominated by racism and expansionism. It is no wonder, then, that the wave of protests on social media networks is becoming more widespread: most comments cite regularly recurring historical facts, including the prepared or implemented genocides against the Assyrians by the Kurds during the years 1843, 1895, 1914-1916, as well as the treacherous assassination of the Assyrian patriarch Mar Shimon in 1918 and Kurdish support to the jihadists from Islamic State.\n\nNobody checked whose order the Turkish company manufactures these shoes. It is certain, however, that if the persons involved in import and sale are somehow related to anyone in power, especially if they are from the Barzani family, then the matter will be covered up, and this practice will certainly be repeated more than once. It is also worth remembering that after the publication of the caricature of Muhammad in the Danish newspaper, churches and Christians were burning in many Muslim countries, and an embargo was announced on Danish goods.\n\nTranslated from Polish by AINA.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Zookeeper takes animals home to save them from fire", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50962775", "comments": 8, "date": "2020-1-1", "transcript": "Image copyright Twitter/mogowildlife Image caption All 200 animals from Mogo Zoo survived the fires\n\nAmid the devastating fires ravaging Australia, a small zoo has managed to save all its animals through the extraordinary bravery of its staff.\n\nMogo Zoo houses Australia's largest collection of primates, along with zebras, rhinos and giraffes.\n\nYet when it was right in the line of a bushfire, the keepers managed to protect all 200 animals from harm.\n\nWhile most were sheltered at the site, monkeys, pandas and even a tiger were temporary lodgers at one keeper's home.\n\nOn Tuesday, an evacuation order was made for the New South Wales area where the zoo is located, but staff decided to stay to protect their animals.\n\nZoo director Chad Staples said the situation had been \"apocalyptic\" and that it \"felt like Armageddon\".\n\nHe said the zoo only survived because there'd been a precise plan in place: first the zoo keepers moved everything flammable from the area and then turned to the animals themselves.\n\nThe larger ones like the lions, tigers and orang-utans were moved into secured night enclosures to keep them safe and calm, but the smaller ones needed extra shelter.\n\nSo director Staples decided to simply have them taken to his own house.\n\n\"Right now in my house there's animals of all descriptions in all the different rooms, that are there safe and protected... not a single animal lost,\" he told the ABC broadcaster.\n\nSara Ang from the wildlife park told BBC 5 Live radio that \"some of the smaller monkeys had to be moved to the house, the red panda is in the house and there's a tiger in the back area of the house\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Firefighters in New South Wales sheltered in their truck as it was overrun by flames\n\n\"All the animals that needed to be moved indoors have been moved indoors,\" and hence are safe from the fire.\n\nImage copyright Google Maps Image caption The zoo was encircled by fire and smoke, the zoo keepers say\n\nGiraffes and zebras were left in their enclosures as they were large enough for the animals to move away from spot fires.\n\nMr Staples explained that these were the only animals that suffered from stress - not from the fires but due to the rush of keepers and vehicles moving around to fight the flames.\n\nHe told the ABC the zoo staff had prepared \"hundreds of thousands of litres\" of water in advance and then put water into smaller tanks on vehicles to drive around and put out spot fires.\n\nDescribing how his team worked for hours and throughout the night, he said the park would have been lost to the fire had it not been for the staff's heroic efforts to save it.\n\nThe zoo's survival is a positive development after a devastating week along Australia's eastern coast.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Residents have taken shelter on beaches to escape the flames\n\nHowever, the small town of Mogo itself has been severely damaged by the fires, with dozens of homes destroyed.\n\nThe bushfires have killed at least seven people in the Australian state of New South Wales since Monday, according to police.\n\nFires have also destroyed more than 200 homes, leaving thousands of people facing an uncertain future.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2NAeh4y4PWmwdNWt9vcEmomW-T56mbcVRhfPy8Iarlg.jpg"}, {"title": "Jihadi Jack \\'married into a top ISIS family\\' claims filmmaker", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7838223/Jihadi-Jack-married-ISIS-family-claims-filmmaker.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-1-1", "transcript": "British Islamist 'Jihadi Jack' Letts married into a 'top' ISIS family and has been playing down his status within the terror group, it has been claimed.\n\nThe 24-year-old Muslim convert from Oxfordshire, who declared himself an 'enemy of Britain' and fled to the Middle East to join ISIS, has already been stripped of his UK citizenship.\n\nNow a former British soldier who fought ISIS has claimed that Letts married the daughter of an Iraqi tribal leader, who he has a son with, before being captured in northern Syria in 2017.\n\nMuslim convert Jack Letts, from Oxfordshire, was pictured gaunt and lying on the floor in an overcrowded jail in northern Syria.

Plastic straws and cutlery will follow on January 1, 2021.\n\nFrance will begin phasing out plastic products from 2020 in keeping with EU regulations. FRANCE 24 graphics studio\n\nThe ban was issued in a government decree, published on December 27, to bring France in conformity with European Union directives. It defines single-use plastics as those not designed to be reused \u201cfor a use identical to that for which it was intended\u201d.\n\n\n\nShops that carry the banned products will be allowed to continue selling them for six months after January 1, provided they were produced or imported beforehand.\n\n\n\nThe decree includes a temporary exemption for compostable products containing at least 50 percent of organic materials, as well as for cutlery used in health and corrections facilities and on transport such as trains and airplanes.

A first version of the law, which aims to promote the \u201ccircular economy\u201d, was passed by parliament earlier this month. It would set a 2040 target to phase out all single-use plastics, with the goal of recycling 100 percent of plastics by 2025. Specific plastic products would be phased out year by year, and recycling guidelines would be standardised throughout France by no later than the end of 2022.\n\n\n\nAs of 2018, only 25 percent of plastic packaging in France was recycled, while the rest was incinerated or put in landfills.

Heather Mac Donald, a graduate of Yale, Cambridge University and the Stanford University Law School, is an author, essayist and political commentator. She\u2019s not a radical or a firebrand. She\u2019s a brilliant intellectual who presents her ideas in a reasoned, articulate manner. Open-minded Holy Cross students would have much to learn from her, even those who disagree.\n\nJust fifteen minutes into Mac Donald\u2019s presentation, a majority of the audience in a packed auditorium rose and began chanting. They shouted that she and her \u201csexism, racism and homophobia\u201d weren\u2019t welcome on campus. They then drowned out her response and slowly walked out the hall while loudly repeating their attack slogans. Their pre-planned disruption included filling as many seats as they could in the auditorium in order to keep other students from hearing Mac Donald.\n\nMac Donald has been targeted at other schools by disruptive student activists employing similar tactics. She noted that, \u201cAfter the Holy Cross protest, the co-president of the Black Student Union, which organized the walkout with an assist from the student government, told the campus newspaper: \u2018The fact that we pulled this off is actually amazing. I feel so empowered now, and this is just the beginning.'\u201d\n\nPresumably, the beginning of suppressing any and all diversity of thought and dissent from leftist orthodoxy at Holy Cross. And that\u2019s something to celebrate?\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing element of this affair was the response of Michele Murray, PhD., the Dean of Students at Holy Cross. Dean Murray falsely claimed that \u201cThe subtext of (Mac Donald\u2019s) talk was that discrimination no longer exists, or at least that we should not be bothered by it.\u201d Murray\u2019s deceitful use of the term \u201csubtext\u201d enabled her to reprehensibly misrepresent Mac Donald\u2019s message, which was that students at American colleges like Holy Cross should \u201cseize their boundless opportunities for learning with joy and gratitude.\u201d Mac Donald explains that American universities are, today, arguably the least discriminatory venues in our nation, where students regardless of race, ethnicity or gender orientation are accepted and shielded by sympathetic faculty and administrators who provide them with a safe and welcoming sanctuary. Ironically, it\u2019s conservative students who are subject to repression if they offend hypersensitive progressive dogma.\n\nWhile agreeing with Mac Donald, that \u201cAmerican undergraduates are among the most privileged individuals in history by virtue of their unfettered access to knowledge,\u201d Murray then proceeded to justify the behavior of the student radicals who disrupted Mac Donald\u2019s lecture with this preposterous rationalization:\n\n\u201cAt Holy Cross, students learn to use that privilege to make the world a better place. That education requires them to wrestle with a wide range of ideas, which sometimes means engaging speakers with controversial messages, as with Ms. MacDonald. And sometimes, it means making use of their own free speech to combat objectionable ideas.\u201d\n\nThis is sophistry on steroids. Apparently, in Murrayspeak, \u201cengaging\u201d is a euphemism for shouting down someone whose viewpoint you disagree with and denying others the right to hear that viewpoint.

Consequently, age-related dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are becoming common diagnoses in older adults. For example, in the United States alone Alzheimer\u2019s is estimated to affect 5.7 million people. Now, it appears help may soon be on the way in the form of a potential new vaccine that has shown success in mice testing.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Irvine believe that this immunotherapy combination vaccine should be ready for human trials within the next few years. The initial version of the vaccine was created by Flinders University professor Nikolai Petrovsky in South Australia, and it works by removing \u201cbrain plaque\u201d and tau protein aggregates, both of which have been extensively linked to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nSuccess in 2019 with mice models has opened the door towards more extensive research and development in 2020, researchers say.\n\nIf the vaccine can in fact remove accumulated beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques and tau protein aggregates from human subjects brains, just as it was able to in mice that had already shown signs of A\u03b2 and tau pathologies, that should, in theory, stop the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cTaken together, these findings warrant further development of this dual vaccination strategy \u2026 for ultimate testing in human Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d the study reads.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO OUR WEEKLY NEWSLETTER & GET THE LATEST STUDIES FROM STUDYFINDS.ORG BY EMAIL!\n\nAccording to professor Petrovsky, researchers are hopeful they can proceed with human clinical trials in about two years.\n\n\u201cOur approach is looking to cover all bases and get past previous roadblocks in finding a therapy to slow the accumulation of A\u03b2/tau molecules and delay AD progression in a the rising number of people around the world,\u201d professor Petrovsky explains in a media release.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a possible preventative drug for Alzheimer\u2019s has shown promise, but every one of these drugs has ultimately faltered when it came time for human trials.

(WTVD) -- A North Carolina judge formally struck down the law requiring voters to show a photo ID at polls.U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs released her written order Tuesday, granting an injunction against Gov. Roy Cooper, North Carolina State Board of Elections Chair Robert Cordle, North Carolina State Board of Elections Secretary Stella Anderson, and board members Kenneth Raymond, Jefferson Carmon III and David Black. According to the injunction, the defendants cannot implement the new voter-ID requirements and must stop any communications to the public that say a photo ID will be required for all 2020 elections.Election officials also have to work with local media and voter-education groups to inform voters that they will not need photo ID this election.Several North Carolina chapters of the NAACP filed the lawsuit the day after the voting ID requirement became law in December 2018.In her decision, Biggs said an injunction would be in the public interest, adding, \"Electoral integrity is enhanced, not diminished, when all eligible voters are allowed to exercise their right to vote free from interference and burden unnecessarily imposed by others.\"Biggs also recognized the history discrimination in North Carolina.\"No one disputes that North Carolina 'has a long history of race discrimination generally and race-based vote suppression in particular,'\" she wrote, quoting another court case.The order outlines a brief history of voter ID laws in North Carolina and the legal challenges to those laws.The new court order means that voters will not need a photo ID in the March 3 primary elections.To read Biggs' full court order, click here A spokesperson for State Senator Phil Berger released the following statement about Biggs' decision Tuesday evening:Reverend Dr. Anthony Spearman, president of the North Carolina NAACP released the following statement Tuesday evening:", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/pl1suuofir7-NI0k7G0KRNsnibhf6ekZP2msKyt4juc.jpg"}, {"title": "'Won't leave': Women lead protest in India capital's Muslim area", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/leave-women-lead-protest-india-capital-muslim-area-191230062707469.html", "comments": 1, "date": "2020-1-1", "transcript": "New Delhi, India - As Shahin Kausar steps down from the makeshift stage set up in the Muslim enclave of Shaheen Bagh in the Indian capital of New Delhi, it is difficult to hear her speak.\n\nHer words are no longer amplified through a sound system, and the man now holding the microphone is drowning her out with boisterous slogans.\n\nMore:\n\nIt doesn't help that Kausar herself is also on the verge of losing her voice from weeks of shouting.

And they don't plan on going anywhere.\n\n\"We are here to fight for our rights, our concerns,\" says 53-year-old Tarannum Begum at the sit-in. \"Until they take back their [policies], this will go on.\"\n\nAway from the limelight of protests in Central Delhi - dominated largely by English-speaking protesters from higher socioeconomic backgrounds - Shaheen Bagh has become a symbol for more vulnerable communities on the fringes of the city.\n\nUntil they take back their [policies], this will go on. Tarannum Begum, Protester\n\nPolice have cracked down brutally on many protests, particularly in Muslim areas and universities, vandalising homes, using tear gas and batons even on children, and opening fire on peaceful protesters.\n\nAt least 26 people have been killed across India, with most deaths reported from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nThe majority, if not all, of those killed were Muslim. Thousands have been detained, mostly in Uttar Pradesh, whose hardline chief minister had vowed revenge on the protesters.\n\nBut the demonstration at Shaheen Bagh has remained peaceful, even as protesters remain resolute in opposing Modi's Hindu nationalist government.\n\nNRC fears\n\nAt the heart of the unrest is the CAA, which provides a path to citizenship to refugees who arrived in India before 2015 from three neighbouring countries, as long as they are not Muslim.\n\n191223075630465\n\nMuslims fear the CAA is a precursor to a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), as repeatedly indicated by India's powerful Home Minister Amit Shah.\n\nRecently, the NRC process in the northeastern state of Assam excluded 2 million people, many of them Muslims, effectively rendering them stateless. They now fear either detention or deportation.\n\nMeanwhile, several detention centres operate and are in the works across Assam and in other parts of the country to detain undocumented migrants, triggering fears among Muslims of mass incarceration.\n\nA nationwide NRC would force all Indians to prove their citizenship with documentation, something India's mostly impoverished people of all religions lack.\n\nBut women say they are particularly vulnerable.\n\n\"I don't have a husband, and us ladies don't even get property papers,\" says Begum, a widow. \"Everything is in the name of the husband, so how will a woman prove [citizenship] through her papers?\"\n\nWomen such as Begum say they are more vulnerable if the state orders a citizenship test [Ashish Malhotra/Al Jazeera]\n\nViolence at Jamia Millia Islamia\n\nAt Shaheen Bagh, the chilly air caused by New Delhi's record winter has a mix of both anxiety and determination.\n\n191216033648272\n\nFor 16 days and despite biting cold, crowds have gathered here non-stop, with a legion of volunteers running the show. Protesters huddle over bonfires with free snacks and tea, while women sit in an enclosure next to the stage.\n\nEvenings are particularly busy, with a variety of activities taking place - candlelight vigils, late-night singing, spirited slogans and speeches by activists.\n\nMany women, mostly housewives such as Kausar and Begum, say they have not gone home for days.\n\n\"I've been wearing the same set of clothes for the past three days\u2026 I have only managed to go home once,\" says Begum.\n\nI have nothing to prove [my status], I am just a poor man. Maqsood Alam, Protester\n\nShaheen Bagh is barely 2km (1.2 miles) from Jamia Millia Islamia, a predominantly Muslim university, which was the site of a brutal police crackdown on December 15.\n\nOver 100 students were injured when police stormed the campus with tear gas and batons following clashes at an area close to the university.\n\nPolice ransacked the campus, broke windows in the library and even fired tear gas inside a reading room. Many of the students injured and detained had not been involved in the protest.\n\nThe Jamia crackdown catalysed the protest at Shaheen Bagh, with a large number of its students having links to the community.\n\nDaily protests also take place at Jamia, but they generally end up moving to Shaheen Bagh by the end of the day.\n\n191218063347967\n\n\"The protest started the day female students at Jamia were brutally attacked and beaten up. Their hair was pulled,\" says Kausar.\n\nIn light of the Jamia crackdown and similar attacks in Muslim enclaves elsewhere, protesters in Shaheen Bagh worry that with every passing day that their sit-in might also get broken up.\n\n\"The authorities are rattled because they are facing problems because of us. Almost 150,000 cars [usually] pass through here every day,\" says Kausar. \"They want us to give way to one side of the road.\"\n\n'They woke us up, we were sleeping'\n\nBut with New Delhi currently in the midst of an unusually cold spell, Kausar has bigger worries.\n\n\"What I am concerned about are the women and children, they are on the road in this biting cold. Some have kids who are 2-3 months old. If something happens to them, who will take responsibility?\"\n\n\"It's not a small thing to sit on these highway roads\u2026 [But] until someone comes and convinces us that our demands have been heard, we aren't going anywhere.\"\n\n191224120708405\n\nBegum is equally adamant. \"They woke us up, we were sleeping,\" she says.\n\n\"It is better to die here [protesting] than be put in detention camps.\"\n\nHowever, many in this Muslim neighbourhood remain fearful of what lies ahead.\n\nAs the night wears on, the crowd gathers around a projector to watch a documentary about what the government's citizenship policies mean for them.\n\nIndia has witnessed massive protests since the citizenship law was passed earlier this month [Ashish Malhotra/Al Jazeera]\n\nA clip from one of Modi's recent speeches beams from the screen.\n\n\"Those who are creating violence can be identified by their clothes itself,\" says the prime minister, his voice booming across Shaheen Bagh through loudspeakers.\n\nMany in the crowd are wearing traditional clothes - men in skullcaps, women in burkas. Modi is speaking in innuendo, but he is talking about people like them.\n\nIt is one of the many comments made by BJP leaders and government officials, suggesting Muslims do not belong.\n\nFor 48-year-old Maqsood Alam, it couldn't be further from the truth. \"We were born in India. India is our soil. We love India,\" he says.\n\nYet, having to prove that he belongs is a frightening thought for Alam. Like many Muslims in this part of the capital, his status as a migrant worker only makes documentation more complex.\n\nAs a result, the father of five seems resigned to a fate of not passing a potential citizenship test.\n\n\"The future of our kids is at risk. We went to such lengths to allow them to study. Now where will they live, where will we live?\" he asks.\n\n\"A child is like a tree, it takes time and effort to grow,\" says Alam, breaking down as he finishes his sentence.\n\n\"They are asking for papers that go back years.

It is a book that is actually written to, for, and about the disciples that Jesus Christ called and the work that He was carrying on and continues to carry on through His disciples, the work of the resurrected Christ. It\u2019s an amazing book, and there\u2019s great lessons for us to look at and to learn from today as disciples of Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen you look into the first chapter, you need to go no further to begin to understand the importance of the actions that they took as they were commissioned by Christ to go take the gospel to the world and, in turn, make disciples of the gospel of the Kingdom of God and of Jesus Christ. There\u2019s a very interesting passage in Acts 1:10 at the point where Jesus Christ made His final ascension to heaven and the disciples are standing on the Mount of Olives just to the east of Jerusalem and they actually watched.\n\nAfter 40 days of the resurrected Christ appearing, being with them, teaching them the things of the Kingdom of God, Christ is making His final ascent, taking up into a cloud and He disappears. And the disciples are standing there, obviously amazed at this site, but they seem to linger just a little bit too long. Because as we read the account in verse 10, \u201cThey looked steadfastly toward heaven, looking up as He went up. Then, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,\u201d two angels appeared and began to look at them.\n\nAnd they said this to the disciples in verse 11, \u201cMen of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven?\u201d Again, the disciples were just mesmerized by what they were seeing. I would be, too. And you kind of linger a little bit too long. They went on to say, \u201cThe same Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.\u201d It\u2019s in that question, but to the disciples, \u201cWhy do you stand gazing? Why are you just looking up?\u201d In other words, \u201cDon\u2019t you have something to do? Get busy.\u201d\n\nIn Mark 16, we find where Jesus had appeared at one point to His disciples, shortly after His resurrection. And He found His disciples in the room where they had been used to gathering. And they were setting a table and He rebuked them. It says in Mark 16:14 , \u201cBecause they did not believe those who had seen Him after the resurrection. They had a hardness of heart,\u201d it says here, an unbelief. And so, Jesus had to rebuke them. And He said to them, \u201cGo to the world. Preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned.\u201d And He went on to give some signs. But, essentially, He rebuked them for their inaction and He said, \u201cGo to the world.\u201d\n\nAnd all of what we then read later in Acts 1 where they\u2019re standing, gazing up, and having to be prodded once again, really, is a lesson for us to consider as we think about our duties and our responsibilities as disciples. God\u2019s church moves forward, and it moves forward by the work of the resurrected Christ in His disciples who are called to that role. We\u2019re called to that role to be a disciple and we don\u2019t have the luxury of stargazing, of looking up. Our job, our calling is to get busy and to preach the gospel. An effective lesson, a very important lesson for a disciple, today\u2019s disciples from the very \u201cBook of Acts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cBT Daily.\u201d Join us next time.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Be Happy | United Church of God", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.ucg.org/beyond-today/blogs/this-is-the-way/be-happy", "comments": 1, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "They can be recognized by the serious expression on their faces.

There is a right time and place for laughter. True and genuine laughter leaves only a good effect behind. Jesus promised that His followers would laugh and leap for joy (Luke 6:21 .23). Ecclesiastes 9:7 and 9 tell us to live joyfully because God has accepted us.\n\nIt seems that being sour reflects a doubt that God loves us and has accepted us. It can become a lack of faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. There is a danger of convincing ourselves that God loves us in spite of the fact that we are not obeying Him. Many people manage to do that. Happiness that is healthy and permanent results from understanding and accepting the wonderful gift of forgiveness Christ offers and struggling to live according to God\u2019s laws. Paul came to that point after years of inner struggle. He told Timothy, \u201cI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith\u201d (2 Timothy 4:7 ).

And He goes on for quite a\u2026actually, through the whole rest of the chapter, making this point.\n\nAnd maybe we can turn it around a little bit and think of it a little bit differently, because Christ, in a sense, makes a greater point. He\u2019s really talking a lot about trust. When it comes to anxiety and fears and worry, here Christ begins to talk about the things that look to God, in a sense, for their life. The birds, they just live and God takes care of them. What about the flowers? Well, He talks about the lilies. And He goes on and on talking about those things, showing that God\u2019s gonna take care of them.

It is a characteristic of a true Christian. The Bible has many examples of those who prayed for others, most notably Jesus Christ. He even prayed for those who were crucifying Him saying, \u201cFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they do\u201d (Luke 23:34 ).\n\nIn his epistles, the apostle Paul consistently mentions his prayers for his brethren. He wrote to the Philippians, \u201cAlways in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy\u201d (Philippians 1:4 ). In another instance he tells the Colossians that he and his companions, \u201cdo not cease to pray for you\u201d (Colossians 1:9 ). As he prayed for others, Paul asked others to pray for him and his fellow workers. He wrote to the Thessalonians, \u201cBrethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified\u201d (2 Thessalonians 3:1 ).\n\nPaul is a great example of a true Christian who kept the needs of his brethren in mind. His chief concern was for their spiritual welfare and standing in the faith. Christians ought to pray likewise for their brethren. There is also continual opportunity to pray for the health needs of others. The apostle James wrote about this when he told Christians to \u201cpray for one another, that you may be healed\u201d (James 5:16 ).\n\nSince Christians are to be \u201cthe light of the world\u201d (Matthew 5:14 ), we should also pray in hopes of the world\u2019s salvation. This is how Daniel prayed for his nation, asking God to forgive the sins of his people which had caused their captivity in Babylon. Daniel chapter 9 records his remarkable prayer. Daniel set his \u201cface toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications\u201d (Daniel 9:3 ). He pleaded with God saying, \u201cO LORD, according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem\u201d (Daniel 9:16 ).\n\nLikewise, Moses beseeched God for the nation of Israel saying, \u201cPardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, according to the greatness of Your mercy\u201d (Numbers 14:19 ). Also, Paul exhorted that \u201csupplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1 ).\n\nAll these biblical examples of holy people making intercessory prayer, beseeching God for others, demonstrate the role of a mediator. This mirrors Christ\u2019s role as the \u201cMediator between God and men\u201d (1 Timothy 2:5 ). Centuries before Christ\u2019s ministry, Isaiah prophesied of Him pouring \u201cout His soul unto death\u201d and being \u201cnumbered with the transgressors\u201d for whom he \u201cmade intercession\u201d (Isaiah 53:12 ). Indeed, He died for our sake, and now, the risen Christ \u201calways lives to make intercession\u201d for us (Hebrews 7:25 ). He has entered \u201cinto heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us\u201d (Hebrews 9:24 ).\n\nWe have many biblical examples to follow showing how to make intercessory prayer. As Christians, we are called to \u201cbe imitators of God\u201d (Ephesians 5:1 ). Therefore, as Christ appears for us before God, so ought Christians come before God\u2019s throne in prayer on behalf of others. Making intercessory prayer to God for others is a defining characteristic of a true Christian.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "\u201cWho Says I Can\u2019t?!\u201d | United Church of God", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.ucg.org/beyond-today/beyond-today-magazine/who-says-i-cant", "comments": 1, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "As I combed my hair, brushed my teeth and walked to my car, it was a different sort of day.

Then also as I parked my car, got out and walked into work.\n\nAs I type this on my keyboard, I am so much more aware of my 10 fingers and my ability to sit here and do this. Again, it\u2019s a different sort of day.\n\nSo often we take for granted the wondrous body God has given us. He designed it to work so perfectly at our will. Are we grateful for this miracle? Do we use it for His glory?\n\nThere are people who do not have the same level of blessing many of us do in terms of fully functional bodies\u2014a fact brought home to me in a powerful way through a documentary I just watched about a young man named Robert Mendez.\n\nRobert was born May 9, 1988, without arms or legs, the result of a condition known as Tetra\u2013Amelia, a rare congenital disorder that prevents the formation of limbs during embryonic development. Now 31, he has lived his entire life without arms and legs. He is mobile thanks to the chair he controls with his head and neck. It has given him a life otherwise inaccessible.\n\nIt was humbling to see this program. Watching him move around on the floor as a child\u2014such a happy child even\u2014and then grow into the man he is today, I just sat there and cried.\n\nThis young man did not let his disabilities stop him from being all he could be! Mendez went on to become a remarkable high school football coach in America. His favorite phrase to the young men he coaches and his motto in his life is, \u201cWho says I can\u2019t?!\u201d\n\nMendez accepted the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the 2019 ESPYs (Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Award). In his acceptance speech, he was grateful, thanking his parents and also giving glory to God. He further stressed the importance of focusing on what you can do instead of what you can\u2019t. (You can find his speech on YouTube by searching for the name of the award.)\n\nAgain, are we grateful for what God has given us? Do we use it to be the best we can be for Him and for others, as Robert Mendez has tried to do? What an inspiration this man is to others\u2014including me.\n\nWhen Jesus Christ returns, He will begin the process of bringing healing to the whole world. But in the meantime, there are those like Robert who, though facing hardship, set an amazing example of gratitude while pushing themselves to be all they can be.\n\nThese examples humble us and teach us valuable lessons. Here are two lessons I take from Mendez\u2019s story.\n\nFirst, be grateful for what God has given you and to those who have helped you.\n\nAnd second, live your life to be the best you can be with what God has given you, so you can help and inspire others!\n\nThe opposite is mentioned in Romans 1:21 , which describes the corrupt world of this age, and the fruit of an ungrateful heart: \u201cFor although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.\u201d\n\nWe should always be giving God thanks for the things He has given us, and use them for His glory, and for the inspiration and encouragement of others.\n\nStart your day with such gratitude and purpose along with a \u201ccan do\u201d approach to life. Don\u2019t use the words \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d\u2014for with God\u2019s help, \u201call things are possible\u201d (Mark 10:27 ).\n\nRobert Mendez did not let his shortcomings stop him, but with gratitude and resolve, he rose above his challenges to inspire and help others. He certainly inspired me.\n\nLet\u2019s never take for granted the miraculous body God has given us! And let us always ask God for help where we lack or face challenges.\n\n\u201cWho says I can\u2019t?\u201d Let it not be us.

He said that the card can be used to buy groceries from utility stores as well.\n\nThe premier said that smartphones will also be distributed so the women have access to information.\n\nHe said that the next phase will see the distribution of cows and buffaloes, so women can not only provide their children nutritious milk but sell it for additional income.\n\n\"The biggest challenge to children's health in Pakistan right now is stunting and malnutrition.

She lives in the northeastern region of China\u2019s Jilin Province.\n\nAlso known as Falun Dafa, the spiritual practice that Gao follows teaches believers to be good people by following the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Yet in July 1999, the communist regime launched a brutal persecution in an attempt to eradicate the peaceful practice.\n\nAfter Gao\u2019s release on Jan. 28, she was able to tell the story of her endurance of inhumane torture. Her story about torture in prison for practicing Falun Gong is just one instance of the numerous crimes against humanity continuing inside China.\n\nChinese Regime Damages Faith and Family\n\nGao began practicing Falun Gong in 1995. Then in 1999, when Chinese media spent entire days dedicated to slandering the practice, Gao went to speak up for her faith in one of China\u2019s most renowned public places: Tiananmen Square.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, I was arrested right away, and they locked me up for 15 days,\u201d Gao told Minghui, a website that documents the persecution of Falun Gong in China. Police forced her family to pay for her release. Gao was not deterred.\n\nShe returned once more to Tiananmen in October 1999, but the results were much worse. After being detained once more, courts sentenced Gao to a forced labor camp for two years. Guards shocked her with stun guns on a regular basis. While she was locked up, government officials demanded that her family, who lived on a farm, turn over all their grain harvests.\n\nWhen Gao was released in 2001, she demanded to the government that their livelihood be returned, but was met with dismal and threats of repeated imprisonment. She said she had no choice but to travel to other cities, looking for work, according to Minghui. However, work was never stable, and it caused more problems for her family.\n\n\u201cMy 16-year-old daughter was forced to drop out of school,\u201d Gao said, because of financial problems.\n\nThen after eight years of relative peace, plainclothes police knocked at Gao\u2019s door in 2009.\n\nAt the time, she was taking care of her frail and ailing mother.\n\nGao recalled clearly what her dying mother said to her, as police dragged her away from her mother\u2019s hands: \u201cDon\u2019t arrest my daughter, she\u2019s a good person, she\u2019s the best person!\u201d\n\nPolice dragged Gao out of her house, while another group of officers ransacked the rooms. The shock was too much for Gao\u2019s mother, as she passed away soon after.\n\nIn the detention center, Gao showed her resilience against the wrongful detention. She was locked in a metal chair and interrogated by two officers. \u201cThey asked me this and that, but whatever they asked, I didn\u2019t answer,\u201d Gao told Minghui. This enraged the officers.\n\nThey then attacked her, beating her unconscious. Gao was awoken by water being dumped on her face. \u201cUntil into the night, I still didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nThen they locked her in a detention center, where she once more opposed the wrongful torture. This time, with a hunger strike. However, the police had another scheme. \u201cThey force-fed me, they shoved a pipe down my nose,\u201d Gao told Minghui. \u201cMy nose bled, my eyes teared \u2026 even now tears often uncontrollably run down my face.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years being locked in a detention center, Gao was then forced through a show trial. Her family members were not even contacted. The trial sentenced her to 10 years in prison in 2011.\n\nA Wrongful Imprisonment\n\nIn July 2011, Gao\u2019s horrific torture in the Changchun Women Prison began. Instead of just being incarcerated like the other prisoners, she became the target of abuse and violence\u2014this was done to force her to renounce her faith.\n\n\u201cThey punished me by making me sit on a small plastic stool, I had to have perfect posture, sitting upright, with my hands on my knees,\u201d Gao told Minghui. \u201cIf I moved at all, they would hit me and ridicule me.\u201d\n\nShe recalled that about 20 female prisoners were organized to surround her, and demanded she abandon her beliefs. Under that intense pressure, Gao just told them the truth about her faith and wrongful treatment.\n\nWhen guards realized that the conversion failed, the prison took a different approach. A woman named Pang Shuyan, who had shown good behavior during re-education through forced labor, was assigned to stay at Gao\u2019s side day and night, reporting on all behavior.\n\nGao had not escaped the punishment of sitting on a plastic stool. Now, Pang was given the authority to make Gao sit on the stool from 4 a.m. all the way until 10 p.m.\n\nAfter five to six days of sitting, Gao said that the prisoners watching her had the idea to put a photo of Falun Gong\u2019s founder, Li Hongzhi, on her stool, and demand she sit on it. Out of respect, Gao refused, even when they tried to force her down onto the stool.\n\nWhen Pang saw the resistance, she dragged Gao to the bathroom. \u201cShe flew into a rage, slapping my face, mouth, and since I wouldn\u2019t sit, they punished me with standing,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nGao was forced to stand for the same amount of time as she had sat, sometimes even longer. \u201cAfter about 20 days, varicose veins were showing on my legs, swelling up clear and thick,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\n\u201c[My legs] were like an elephant\u2019s, blood would even drip out of them.\u201d\n\nThe punishment then was made even worse.\n\nGao was ordered to continue standing for 24 hours at a time. \u201cI stood for five days and five nights, they didn\u2019t let me sleep,\u201d Gao told Minghui. Then Pang unfurled another scheme. She took the picture, which Gao refused to sit upon, and demanded that the other prisoners stick it to Gao\u2019s bare backside.\n\nThen Gao\u2019s restraint snapped, and in a fury yelled and shoved the women away from her as they attempted their plan.\n\nPang then forced Gao into a new kind of suffering. Believers of Falun Gong practice a siting meditation, where both legs are folded on top of each other. In yoga, this is called the \u201cdouble lotus.\u201d Pang made Gao sit in the double lotus for 12 hours. Gao further had to hold her arms above her head.\n\nThis was all on top of almost a whole month of the standing torture and a week of sleep deprivation. The pain and suffering still did not break Gao.\n\nPushed to the Final Limits\n\nPang, along with six or seven other individuals charged with crimes like murder, were assigned to watch Gao and the other imprisoned practitioners. The faithful were then deprived of their basic sanitary needs.\n\nGao was not allowed to use the restroom, and after days of holding back, she finally could endure no longer. The group of prisoners mocked her like school children: \u201c\u2018Gao Yuxiang is so old and wets her pants, she has no shame.\u2019 They insulted me, I bawled, and felt so ashamed,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nTo make matters worse, the wrongfully imprisoned women were forced to eat off the floor. Gao was not allowed to use the restroom again, and did not want to cause the floor to be soiled even further. In a muddleheaded moment, she agreed to the criminal\u2019s punishment: Insult the founder of Falun Gong in writing.\n\n\u201cAfter they let me go to the bathroom and I was more clear headed, my heart felt deep and painful regret,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nSome time later, Pang put Gao through a new form of torture. She made Gao kneel on the bed, laying forward, with her feet raised to her buttocks and hands holding her ankles. Gao had to sit this way for 12 hours a day without moving. Any resistance, and Pang would beat her head with a rolling pin.\n\nAfter 49 days of this daily punishment, Gao was sent to the prison infirmary, finding the extent to which her body was damaged. \u201c[They] couldn\u2019t even draw blood during the check-up,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nThe Edge of Insanity\n\nAfter that, Pang and the others didn\u2019t make Gao go through that same punishment again. They demanded Gao to write down the names of her relatives. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember my daughter\u2019s phone number, I couldn\u2019t remember my son-in-law\u2019s name,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\n\u201cI even forgot my grandson\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nThe prisoners ridiculed Gao with laughter. \u201cI was laughing too, but this laugh was extraordinarily abnormal,\u201d Gao told Minghui. Others even thought that she had snapped.\n\nBut then Gao began reciting words of teaching from her faith, and gradually she came back to herself.\n\nGao witnessed other women break under the same brutal treatment that she received. Other women who refused to sit on the plastic stools were beaten to the point of losing control of themselves.\n\nEven then, the prisoners still mocked and jeered at the persecuted women.\n\nOthers were barely given enough food or water to survive. Some had to secretly drink water from flushing toilets.\n\nBy 2016, Gao had to do forced labor in the prison, and she did not suffer the same forms of torture as before.\n\nThen on Jan. 28 this year, Gao was released from the prison, finally able to tell her story of brutal and wrongful persecution that she endured all those years.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "PC gamers in China are getting free porn games to encourage them to stay inside", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.pcgamesn.com/mirror/giveaway-china", "comments": 7, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "As the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China continues to make headlines, residents in affected areas have been advised to avoid travel, avoid contact with others, and stay home.

That I don\u2019t have to worry about God\u2019s law, and that sets the stage, because God is all about grace. Well, one of the problems with that is that God\u2019s law is in effect today. And can you prove that? I mean, what is the purpose of God\u2019s law?\n\nWell, in Romans, it reminds us very clearly about God\u2019s law. In Romans 3:20 , notice what it says. This is at the end of that verse. It says, \u201cFor by the law is the knowledge of sin.\u201d Okay, here\u2019s a problem then. If you say the law is done away, how do you define sin? How do you know what sin is? Would you say, there\u2019s no sin, if God\u2019s law is done away then you have no concept of what sin is. Why do you need to repent, why do you need to change? How do you define? Does everyone claim then to be sin-free when they say the law is done away? You see that\u2019s a contradiction in what the Bible really tells us. The Bible says the law tells us what sin is. We have knowledge of sin because of God\u2019s law. So it\u2019s a contradiction to say God\u2019s law is done away.\n\nAnd remember Romans 3:20 , it\u2019s one of those passages that show us very clearly that God\u2019s law is in effect, and by following God\u2019s law, we can begin to identify sin and then overcome sin with the help of God\u2019s spirit.\n\nThat\u2019s BT Daily.

It writes:\n\nThe official website of the World Muslim Communities Council said on social media that, after lengthy, scientific studies that closely examined the rules of justice contained in the Noble Koran, the American university of Harvard has ranked the Noble Koran as the best book on justice[.] ... In its final evaluation, Harvard University's Classification Committee cited verses from the Noble Koran which confirm that the Noble Koran is a book replete with the rules of human justice ... and that Islam has no room for injustice but rather includes tolerance and respect for the other.\n\nSeveral other leading news websites and newspapers \u2014 including Al Ahram, Egypt's most widely circulated and state-owned newspaper, founded in 1875 \u2014 carried the story, followed by all sorts of triumphant celebrations on social media.\n\nBut is it true? Did Harvard make such a pronouncement? No. The real story is that, back in 2012, a group of law students painted a number of historical quotes dealing with justice on the walls of a Harvard building.\n\nKnown as the \"Words of Justice,\" they consist of 33 quotes from a variety of thinkers and civilizations \u2014 including African, Chinese, European, and Hindu \u2014 from 600 B.C. to the present. Among some of the more recognizable names and documents quoted are Cicero; Augustine; Aquinas; the Magna Carta; Benjamin Franklin; Immanuel Kant; Gandhi; and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAmong these 33 quotes is one that is Islamic, derived from the Koran:\n\nO you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of both. So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. (4:135)\n\nThat's it \u2014 the entire story. There were no \"lengthy, scientific studies,\" nor \"classification committees,\" that led Harvard to announce that the Koran is the \"best book on justice.\" Rather, one Islamic quote was deemed worthy of inclusion with 32 other non-Islamic quotations.\n\nWhat to make of this shameful episode? Why would Muslims fabricate such a story? More to the point, why would they even care what infidel Harvard thinks in the first place?\n\nFor those in the know, the answer is simple: Muslims are ever and always looking for outside validation. Why? Because a growing number of them have a nagging suspicion that their religion is not just.\n\nIndeed, they need look no farther than to the very same Koran chapter/sura (4, al-Nisa', \"the Women\") whence the much celebrated \"justice\" verse (4:135) was excerpted to encounter any number of decidedly unjust verses, including permission to sexually enslave \u2014 buy and sell \u2014 women (4:3), permission for husbands to beat their wives \u2014 since men are \"superior\" to women (4:34) \u2014 and so on.\n\nAccordingly, what can be more reassuring than Western intellectual praise for Islam?\n\nConsider this Arabic op-ed on Islam's \"inferiority complex\" that I translated back in 2011. Although its author, Khaled Montaser, an Egyptian intellectual, focuses on all the hoopla that erupts whenever a Westerner converts to Islam \u2014 whether in reality or not \u2014 the essence of his arguments perfectly apply to and shed light on this recent Harvard fiasco:\n\nWe Muslims have an inferiority complex and are terribly sensitive to the world, feeling that our Islamic religion needs constant, practically daily, confirmation by way of Europeans and Americans converting to Islam. What rapturous joy takes us when a European or American announces their [conversion to] Islam \u2014 proof that we are in a constant state of fear, alarm, and chronic anticipation for Western validation or American confirmation that our religion is \"okay.\" ... And we pound our drums and blow our horns [in triumph] and drag the convert to our backwardness, so that he may stand with us at the back of the world's line of laziness, [in the Muslim world] wherein no new scientific inventions have appeared in the last 500 years. Sometimes those who convert relocate to our countries \u2014 only to get on a small boat and escape on the high seas back to their own countries.\n\nHe goes on to discuss how the Arab world \u2014 in the guise of \"our media and Internet sites ... our writers and intellectuals\" \u2014 exulted when it mistakenly thought the German writer Henryk Broder had accepted Islam, based on sarcastic remarks he had made: \"but we are a people incapable of comprehending sarcasm, since it requires a bit of thinking and intellectualizing. And we read with great speed and a hopeful eye, not an eye for truth or reality.\"\n\nMontaser continues:\n\nHow come the Buddhists don't hold the festivities we do for those who convert to their religion? And some of these converts are much more famous than Broder. Did you know that Richard Gere, Steven Seagal, Harrison Ford \u2014 among Hollywood's most famous actors \u2014 converted to Buddhism? What did the Buddhist countries of Asia do regarding these celebrities? What did the Buddhists in China and Japan do? Did they dance and sing praise and march out in the streets, or did they accept these people's entrance into Buddhism as a mere matter of free conviction? ... It is sufficient for the Buddhists that these celebrities purchase their nations' electronic goods \u2014 without any beggary or enticements.\n\nA closing thought: Muslim excitement over one small \u2014 and often fraudulent \u2014 compliment is only paralleled by the Western establishment's behavior: government, media, and academia are all in the habit of highlighting and fixating over one small (and often fraudulent) compliment to Islam \u2014 such as the \"Andalusian Paradise\" (a myth) \u2014 while suppressing Islam's numerous shortcomings.\n\nAnd it's a reminder that, instead of flattering Islam, openly and honestly criticizing it \u2014 objectively, without rancor or hyperbole \u2014 is potentially one of the Western world's most powerful, though largely untapped, strategies that could go a long way in neutralizing Islam, and without force.\n\nRaymond Ibrahim, author of Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West, is Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, Judith Friedman Rosen Fellow at the Middle East Forum, and distinguished senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "How to Potty Train your Puppy EASILY!

That\u2019s how he measures his progress. Wake up. Breathe. Put one foot in front of the other. He pours a cup of coffee, swallows his sorrows and gets on with the rest of his life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at peace,\" he said. \u201cNow I have to figure this crap out. How to live right. I\u2019ve got almost two or three years of this. Being honest. Used to be from the minute I woke up, I was telling lies.\"\n\nTuesday was special. Foerster stepped onto the football field at the University of Miami and watched the San Francisco 49ers go through a short practice for Super Bowl 54 Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nHired as a consultant by the 49ers two years ago, he didn\u2019t coach. He stood on the grass as offensive linemen teased him: \u201cOoh, they let you out of your cage.\u201d\n\nMetaphorically, they were right. Foerster had not been on a field with a football team in more than two years. It had been the one place where he felt free to be himself, where the lies he told, the drug use he concealed and his infidelity were left on the other side of the white lines.\n\n\u201cNobody could text. Nobody could call me. Nobody could ask me for anything. I was just me. Authentically, I could be Chris Foerster, the coach.\"\n\nIf you don\u2019t immediately recognize his name, chances are you will remember the video.\n\nYou will remember the Miami Dolphins offensive line coach, using a rolled-up $20 bill to snort a white powdery substance, in his office in the team facility. The video was made for one of his jilted girlfriends, who posted the disturbing image of a man taking a wrecking ball to a 36-year coaching career, a seven-figure salary, his marriage and his three children.\n\nFoerster became aware the video had been posted on social media around midnight Oct. 9, 2017, hours after the Dolphins had beaten the Tennessee Titans 16-10 at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nBy daybreak, he was asked to resign. By 7 p.m. Monday, at the urging of oldest son Jake, 28, and wife Michelle, he checked into the Hanley addiction treatment center in West Palm Beach for a 60-day evaluation and rehabilitation for drugs and alcohol. That was followed by 90 days as an outpatient at the Beachcomber Addiction Treatment Facility in Delray Beach and six months living in a spare bedroom in the home belonging to Bucs quarterbacks coach Clyde Christensen, who was the Dolphins offensive coordinator at the time.\n\nSunday afternoon, Foerster will board a 49ers team bus and return for the first time to Hard Rock Stadium. Since he is not a member of the coaching staff, he is not allowed to be on the field. Pre-game, during the game or post-game.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he watched the 49ers win the NFC Championship game over the Packers from his office in northern California. This time, he will be glued to the television from the 49ers locker room.\n\n\u201cThis time, I wanted to be part of the process,\" Foerster said.\n\nSince the humiliating video went viral, Foerster had not spoken publicly. He has been focused on battling addiction, getting healthy and putting the pieces of his life, marriage and family back together.\n\nHe declined several interview requests from the Tampa Bay Times this week before agreeing to meet for lunch Wednesday a few blocks from the 49ers\u2019 team hotel. He didn\u2019t want to take away attention from the team and he is quick to say that while he is healthy, he works at it every day and his recovery is not complete.\n\nFoerster detailed his journey, which included reconnecting with his children, moving back into his home in St. Petersburg and helping his wife during her battle with stage four cancer. He never stopped coaching, working out players sometimes with equipment stashed in the back of his car until eventually earning the opportunity as a consultant for the 49ers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a chance you relapse,\" Foerster said. \u201cLife happens. It happens to a lot of people. Only through the grace of God, that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nChris Foerster, right, shown here in a 1999 file photo, was Tony Dungy's offensive line coach during all six of his seasons in Tampa Bay. [Times]\n\n\u2018That video was pretty graphic\u2019\n\nSan Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan was among the first to reach out in his darkest hour. Foerster worked on the Washington coaching staff when Shanahan\u2019s father, Mike, was head coach and Kyle was the offensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him since Washington,\u201d Kyle Shanahan said this week. \u201cBut after talking to him, I know he had to go to rehab and talk about a lot of things he had to deal with in his life. Unfortunately, he had to hurt some people to get there, but when it was all said and done, I think he\u2019s a better man.\u201d\n\nWhen Shanahan presented the idea of hiring Foerster, general manager John Lynch needed some convincing. The 49ers had just released linebacker Reuben Foster following a November 2018 arrest for domestic violence. They came under further scrutiny when news broke that Foerster was working for them in some capacity.\n\n\u201cKyle came to me and said, 'Hey, John, I\u2019m thinking about doing this,\u2019\u201d Lynch recalled. \"And I said, 'Wow, Kyle, that (video) was pretty graphic.\u2019 He said, 'I understand that but I believe in giving people second chances.\"\n\nLynch said he even got a nudge from his mother, who reminded him that his own connections went deeper than their Tampa Bay Buccaneers days, when Lynch was launching his career as an All-Pro safety and Foerster was Tony Dungy\u2019s offensive line coach.\n\nIt was Foerster, a former Stanford assistant under Jack Elway and Dennis Green, who recruited a 17-year-old John Lynch to Palo Alto.\n\n\u201cMy mom even said, \u2018John, I think that would be wonderful. Chris is a good man. He made a bad mistake. Maybe numerous of them.' So then we set parameters, and Kyle and I think it\u2019s a blessing he has lived up to all of them,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a redemption story. As you know, with things like that, it\u2019s ongoing.\u201d\n\nThis is the third stop in San Francisco for Foerster, who was the 49ers offensive line coach in 2008-2009 and 2015. Lynch and Shanahan spoke at length this week about the ways he has helped them, including providing draft reports, advance scouting of opponents and individual work with offensive linemen.\n\nFoerster said he is the one who has been helped most.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so many people that have bent over backward,\" he said. \u201cOthers have said I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you. That\u2019s fine. I get that. I lied to a lot of people.\"\n\nThe toll remains. For one thing, it left the 58-year-old broke despite making an annual salary of $1 million for his last seven seasons. He blew it on drugs, alcohol and extra-marital relationships.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the drinking or the drugs,\" he said. \"The drugs, when I was getting into my 50s, crazy me, I found out I could stay awake so I could have fun longer. That was it. Boy, Miami keeps going after 2 a.m. Then I didn\u2019t have to shut down. Then you end up meeting a different crew of people between 2 and 5 a.m.\n\n\u201cThere were relationships. People I was involved with. And there were a lot of them. People I was giving money to and spending money on.\"\n\nSome of it went to the girlfriend who posted the video, a woman who goes by the name of Kijauna Nige. In an interview with a Las Vegas television station two years ago, she claimed to have met Foerster in Oxnard, Calif., where the Dolphins practiced for a week following Hurricane Irma. She said Foerster told her he was divorced. When Foerster ended the relationship, Nige posted the video.\n\nChris Foerster, left, and his family moved to St. Petersburg when he joined the Bucs coaching staff in 1996 and still resides there. [Times]\n\nGetting healthy\n\nIn spite of the embarrassment, the Dolphins kept Foerster on their insurance. After he resigned, they paid for 60 days of treatment.\n\n\u201cMy wife and son said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to go right now. Don\u2019t delay, don\u2019t sit out a day or two and get crazy thoughts,'\" Foerster said. \u201cImmediately, my son, who works in that field, picked out a treatment center.\"\n\nFoerster said the answers didn\u2019t come easy. Forty-five days passed without an ah-ha moment.\n\n\u201cThey were like, 'Dude, 60 days may not be enough. You may need more time,\u2019 because I wasn\u2019t getting it. And one day things kind of clicked for me and I was good by the time I left.\u201d\n\nHe learned he has a behavioral addiction and his compulsion to engage in drug, alcohol abuse or other destructive practices provided short-term rewards.\n\nHe discovered this behavior was present at least as early as college at Colorado State. He was a social chameleon, one who moved back and forth between Christian friends and hometown buddies who liked to drink.\n\nWhen Foerster finished rehab, he was sent to a halfway house. But work in football was scarce. Occasionally, he would visit Christensen at his Dania Beach high-rise and eventually was offered a place to stay.\n\nFoerster\u2019s agent, Richmond Flowers, called to say he had a few players in northern California who needed preparation for the NFL scouting combine. Foerster didn\u2019t have funds to pay rent, but it gave him work and some gas money.\n\nHe trained some players from Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas High School. He called up some Miami Dolphins offensive linemen and kept them in shape. He kept blocking pads in the trunk of his car.\n\n\u201cI told him he should have a big sign on the back of his car, 1-800-BLOCK,\" Christensen said.\n\nPrior to the 2018 NFL draft, Shanahan brought Foerster some work helping the 49ers prepare. From the balcony of Christensen\u2019s ocean-view condo, he wrote reports on 50 to 60 prospects.\n\nFormer Bucs offensive line coach George Warhop invited him to visit the Bucs during organized team activities. He was in Tampa when he got a phone call from someone who needed his help \u2014 his wife.\n\nCancer and connecting\n\nMichelle telephoned to say she was feeling sick. A trip to the doctor and tests revealed she had peritoneal cancer. The peritoneum protects and covers the organs in your abdomen.\n\nFoerster and his wife had built their house in St. Petersburg when he worked for Tony Dungy in the late 1990s. The family lived there without him when Chris took jobs in other cities. He hadn\u2019t been back since 2005 and didn\u2019t recognize the place.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show how little I was present when I was there,\" Foerster said.\n\n\u201cShe had a great support system there. It\u2019s not like she needed me, but (I am there) just to take care of the house.\"\n\nIt also afforded Foerster a chance to reconnect with his other children \u2014 the oldest Kathleen, 31, and Micah, 19, who was a high school senior.\n\n\u201cThey were all hit hard by it,\" Foerster said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk much. What I realized is there\u2019s no amount of \u2018I\u2019m sorrys.\u2019 There\u2019s only action. And time. And the action early doesn\u2019t matter because they\u2019re wondering if you will do it again.\"\n\nThrough surgery and aggressive therapy, Michelle is in remission.\n\nOne thing Foerster noticed being home. For one season after his resignation, the family no longer watched football.\n\nDuring his first tenure with the 49ers, Chris Foerster, left, was San Francisco's offensive line coach under Jim Tomsula. Now, as a game planning assistant, he is restricted to off-field coaching and activities. [AL GOLUB | ZUMAPRESS.com]\n\nNothing finer\n\nAfter having him write draft and scouting reports for a year, Shanahan decided it was time to move Foerster west and closer to the 49ers facility. He accompanied the team when it spent a week in Youngstown, Ohio, following the season-opening win at Tampa Bay, and when it practiced at IMG Academy in Bradenton in December between games in Baltimore and New Orleans.\n\n\u201cI felt proud to give him another chance,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nOffensive line coach John Benton has embraced Foerster and welcomed his help, which is rare in the territorial boundaries of the NFL. Pro Bowl tackle Joe Staley sought out Foerster this week for some film study.\n\nSaid Staley: \u201cHis understanding of this offense is one of the tops on the coaching staff. Just having another set of eyes. He\u2019s one of my favorite coaches that I\u2019ve had and having his input on practice film has been very beneficial.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Foerster\u2019s wife and kids will be at Hard Rock Stadium wearing Niners colors and cheering for their dad\u2019s team. They may have a better seat, but it\u2019s his vantage point that has changed.\n\n\u201cEverything came full circle and this is us again,\" Foerster said. \u201cEverybody is wearing Niner gear and everybody is all into this thing.\n\n\u201cI got one life, I got me. And it has reconnected me with my faith.\"\n\nBefore leaving the University of Miami field after one practice this week, the 49ers players, coaches and front-office personnel took their place on risers for an official team photo of the NFC Champions.\n\nLynch interrupted the photoshoot and invited Foerster to join them.\n\n\u201cWhen John had me take the Super Bowl picture \u2026 it was weird, you know?\" said Foerster, his voice breaking. \u201cI\u2019ll cry today. That meant the world to me.\"\n\nContact Rick Stroud at rstroud@tampabay.com.

Accordingly, the time period between the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization to the birth of the polis is known as the Greek Dark Ages by historians, simply because there are no contemporary written sources. In this essay, the term Dark Age will be used to designate a period of civilizational decline, with particular reference to Western Europe\u2019s Dark Ages (c. 500\u20141000 AD). This was quite possibly the worst period of civilizational decline in Western history, but is important because it shows us that civilization is separated from the worst bestial depravity by a thin line. What George Santayana wrote is instructive: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d Although this adage has become a clich\u00e9, it bears repeating since it\u2019s well-supported by past experience. If we must focus on the Old Dark Ages, it is because we risk forgetting how fragile civilization really is. If this is the case, we are in danger of rushing heedlessly into a New Dark Age\u2014if we have not already entered one\u2014since we have failed to internalize the lessons of the past.\n\nThe causes of the Dark Ages in Western Europe are considered complex and multifaceted by modern historians. The barbarian successor states that replaced the Imperium Romanorum lacked the ability and competence of the Imperial government. The result was inevitable. Under barbarian rule, there were \u201cvery substantial simplifications in post-Roman material culture in the fifth to seventh centuries.\u201d[1] Among these \u201csimplifications\u201d were the collapse of the empire\u2019s infrastructure, the decline in the production of manufactured goods and use of coinage, widespread depopulation and de-urbanization and, most devastating of all, the loss of much of the ancient world\u2019s cultural and intellectual patrimony. Although some contemporary historians stress continuity between Rome and the barbarian kingdoms, this is contradicted by the extensive archaeological record. From 500\u2014700 AD, there was a massive decline in European living standards since Roman times, when the Dark Ages had reached their lowest point.\n\nAs terrible as these Dark Ages were, it is not the only dark period in Western history, nor will it be the last. A New Dark Age has returned, more terrible than the first. We are its passive witnesses, confident that nothing can be done to stop it. The West is crumbling because the White race has collectively decided\u2014at the instigation of a hostile Jewish-dominated globalist elite\u2014that White racial suicide is a moral imperative. The visible signs of this deterioration are so obvious they can no longer be ignored, at least by those who can see beyond the smoldering ruins of this decaying civilization.\n\nA New Dark Age?\n\nThe signs of an emerging New Dark Age are fourfold, affecting the biological, intellectual, demographic and economic spheres of Western man\u2019s existence. This decline is apparently unstoppable; as time goes by, the darkness over Europe will only become darker. In the biological and intellectual sphere, we have seen IQs steadily decline since mid-19th century. This has no doubt been masked to a considerable extent by improvements in nutrition and healthcare, resulting in longer lifespans. On the other hand, feminism and women\u2019s sexual liberation have aggravated the decline: Low-IQ women breed prolifically, while high-IQ women influenced by feminism delay marriage for the sake of careers and education. It does not take a fertile imagination to realize the kind of dysgenic effect this has on society. In the largest North American and Western European urban centers, we see the crumbling infrastructure and growing social decay that comes with overcrowding and mass Third World immigration. More non-Whites shoveled into Western cities by globalist elites, many with anti-White ethnic agendas, means lower average population IQ, followed by a corresponding decline in quality of life as low-IQ people become an ever-increasing burden on society in terms of homelessness, drug addiction, lack of education, lack of work ethic, etc. In the absence of a technologically sophisticated elite able churn out inexpensive consumer goods, this would result in increasing \u201csimplification\u201d of post-Western material culture, analogous to the kind of \u201csimplifications\u201d archaeologists say occurred during the Old Dark Ages. Given declining IQs and racial hygienic standards, life will inevitably become a much simpler, but more brutal Darwinian struggle for survival, just as it was over a thousand years ago.\n\nThe West\u2019s declining IQs have led to declining educational standards. The universities are no longer bastions of intellectual inquiry, like they were during their heyday, i.e., La Belle \u00c9poque, but liberal indoctrination centers with little intellectual content. In this respect, they are similar to the late medieval universities that once policed orthodoxy and discouraged freedom of thought (i.e. the Catholic Aristotelians of the medieval arts and theology faculties who opposed the new astronomy of Galileo). The people who run them, far from being interested in knowledge for its own sake, are there to reap the rewards of an easy, well-paying job where they are able to spew leftist propaganda\u2014at the expense of their students, who still believe\u2014albeit naively\u2014that degrees are needed for good jobs. Mass education, far from being a benefit to anyone except the system\u2019s architects, has lowered curricular quality and increased prevalence of grade inflation across the board.\n\nOn a side note, Western philosophy\u2014the most important intellectual endeavor beside theoretical physics\u2014has been particularly hard hit by PoMo relativism. From the empyrean heights of Plato and Aristotle, it has descended to the low level of a feces-encrusted cesspit. The writings of Martin Heidegger\u2014liberal academia\u2019s biggest superstar\u2014are considered holy writ by his legions of adoring fans, even though they are pretentious, rambling, jargon-laced diatribes only famous because they can be interpreted to mean anything to anyone. Far from being a means of defining terms and refining methods to achieve greater clarity and understanding\u2014the way Socrates intended\u2014modern (especially continental) philosophy seeks to feign profundity through an unnecessarily turgid and obscure prose. Meanwhile, impenetrable jargon has become the trademark of the rest of the humanities, personified by academic superstars like Judith Butler.\n\nWhite populations worldwide are hurtling toward demographic free fall. The declining birth rates in virtually all White Western Hemispheric nations are symptomatic of the collapse of the monogamous family, the result of decades of indoctrination in feminist ideology and women\u2019s sexual liberation. Since women are no longer expected to settle down and marry, the worst aspects of female nature are now on full display. Student debt incurred by buying largely worthless (for many) college degrees is affecting the decision to marry. If there are no traditional values\u2014and Western society has done its best to jettison these in the name of fatuous \u201chuman rights\u201d\u2014 society will not adequately replenish itself, eventually withering away and dying.\n\nFinally, Western economies are being undermined from within by their own elites. Outsourcing by multinationals has decimated manufacturing sectors in all White Western countries, worsening the lives and prospects of the White middle- and working-class majority populations. Chinese goods have been allowed to flood Western markets, often with the collusion of domestic manufacturers who are able to outsource their labor costs. Real wages have stagnated and affordable housing has become increasingly scarce, as excess Third World immigrant demand places home ownership beyond reach of the ordinary citizen, particularly in the large urban centers.\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com\n\nMoreover, the importation of this cheap, non-White labor has a contraceptive effect, putting downward pressure on real wages which, in turn, put downward pressure on White fertility rates; working-class wages have stagnated since the 1970s. In the West, the growing reserve army of labor disincentivizes industry from rationalizing production and channeling surplus profits into research and development. Far from getting better, the economy worsens as wealth accrues to the top 1 percent of the population; meanwhile, the middle class shrinks and poverty becomes more widespread.\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com\n\nBecause of all of these factors, life in most of the White Western countries has progressively worsened, only made tolerable\u2014but just barely\u2014by the superabundance of inexpensive Chinese-made goods. That the majority of Whites and their globalist elites interpret these signs of deterioration as \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cimprovement\u201d is just more evidence we really are in a Dark Age.\n\nOld and New Dark Ages Compared\n\nThe similarities and differences between New and Old Dark Ages may be grouped under the following headings: (a) the reasons for demographic decline; (b) Western man\u2019s conscious decision to abandon his own civilization vs. Roman decline due to internal civilizational weaknesses, and; (c) the role of Christian ideology in the decline of Rome and Jewish ideology in modern Western culture.\n\nFirst, we begin with Rome\u2019s decline, which had a demographic dimension. After Hadrian had abandoned the territories conquered by Trajan\u2014for administrative and fiscal reasons, the quest for new land and new bodies to rule over ground to a halt. This precipitated a crisis. The number of bodies left to till the fields and man the auxiliary forces along the frontiers declined as the vices of civilization took root. Because of the dearth of bodies and taxable wealth, the empire lacked the capacity to control its vast territories. To remedy this, the Romans recruited barbarians from burgeoning migrant populations along the frontiers or from the armies of the defeated. The historian Cassius Dio says Marcus Aurelius, after defeating the barbarians in the Marcomannic Wars, would either send them on military campaigns or settle them on land in Dacia, Pannonia and elsewhere.[2]\n\nBy the fourth century, barbarian recruitment into the armies had increased; by the mid-5th century, the ranks of the army were largely occupied by Germanic and Hunnish mercenaries, at which point even the military chain of command was thoroughly barbarized. The magister militum, the most important position in the empire after the emperor himself, was occupied by Romanized Germans for most of the fifth century. These men were more powerful than the succession of weak emperors they could make or break with a single utterance. According to the \u201cbarbarization thesis\u201d: \u201cRome was fatally weakened when, in the fourth and fifth centuries, her army largely made up of foreigners no longer represented the people.\u201d[3]\n\nThe Imperial administration\u2019s need for barbarians was in some ways similar to Western elite demand for non-White immigrants. Like immigrants, the barbarians were cheap and expendable. Non-Whites are imported by globalists to do the work \u201cWhite men don\u2019t want to do.\u201d Similarly, the barbarians were recruited into the armies and allowed to settle Imperial lands because fourth- and fifth-century Romans had become the \u201csoyboys\u201d of antiquity\u2014soft, effeminate, milquetoast, peace-loving and totally lacking in all of the warrior virtues. Finally, like Western elites, the Imperial administration was a tax-hungry beast; but Roman justification for taxation was pragmatic, not ideological. This difference is best illustrated by the Western neoliberal economic model; predicated on perpetual growth, it serves as pretext for the White majority\u2019s suicidally impulsive need for never-ending supplies of non-White \u201cfresh meat.\u201d In the Roman case, a constant stream of bodies was needed to maintain an empire overextended beyond its logistical and financial capacities. By late antiquity, this state of affairs had become militarily and financially unsustainable. The barbarian invaders were simply kicking in the doors of an old house that was rotten to the foundation.\n\nThe inevitable result of Imperial greed for taxes and manpower was ethnic demographic replacement of the Roman population across wide swathes of Imperial land. This wasn\u2019t a conscious decision on the part of the Roman aristocracy. Given the empire\u2019s multi-ethnic character, the Imperial administration could not refuse entrance to barbarian migrants on ethnic grounds. The problems that afflicted the Imperium during late antiquity were the outcome of earlier expansionist policies that overextended the boundaries of empire, making it difficult to maintain and control without a constant supply of warm bodies and a steady flow of taxes. Population replacement by large numbers of foreigners, the end result of failed Imperial expansionist policies and Volkerwanderung, led to the alienation of the citizenry from the institutions from their own government. The more Germanized the empire became, the less people identified with it. In time, too much Germanization meant very little patriotism; no loyalty to Rome meant no desire to prevent the barbarian invasions from overrunning much of the Imperial territories. When Africa was lost to the Vandals, there was hardly any will to recapture the territory, despite its status as breadbasket of the empire. It even meant Roman contempt\u2014and sometimes outright ethno-racial hatred\u2014for the Germanic and Hunnish invaders. The second time Rome was sacked in a millennium\u2014by Alaric\u2019s Goths in 410 AD\u2014the underlying reason was contemptuous treatment of her barbarian auxiliaries and their sacrifices by the Romans, the outcome of reliance on cheap and expendable foreign labor.\n\nThe Volkerwanderung is not the cause of the empire\u2019s collapse, as its internal weaknesses date from the civil wars, natural disasters and barbarian invasions of the third century; however, Germanization, combined with lack of identification with Romanitas, played a role in hastening its decline. The barbarian successor states that replaced the Imperial administration lacked the know-how to run a civilization as sophisticated and as advanced as Rome, resulting in barbarism replacing civilization in most of Western Europe.\n\nEven though the causes of the Dark Ages in Rome and the modern West are different, it is instructive to note the final outcome in both cases was ethnic replacement by hostile foreigners, none of whom possessed the ability to maintain the civilizations they acquired either through force or by invitation. Among the main differences, the barbarians who terrorized Rome were mostly White, whereas the ones being imported by Whites into their own Western countries are overwhelmingly non-White. Unlike Rome, which at least valued Romanitas to the bitter end, the contemporary \u201cWest\u201d aggressively pursues its own racial demise at the hands of its non-White colonizers. While Rome\u2019s decline was the outcome of events rotting the Imperium from within, the collapse of modern Western societies and their descent into the New Dark Ages is entirely the fault of Whites being dominated by a hostile ruling elite.\n\nMany Whites, under the influence of an alien Jewish-dominated media elite, encourage their own women to prostitute themselves to non-White foreigners, while making it harder for men of their own race to reproduce by implementing aggressively feminist, women\u2019s liberationist and multicultural policies. This is a reason why fertility has declined to below replacement levels since the beginning of the \u201csexual revolution\u201d of the 1960s. Homosexuality, transgenderism and miscegenation have become the new Western values of the emerging post-Western cultures of Western Europe and North America, thanks to elite manipulation of White racial consciousness. As a result, the traditional values embodied by the institutions of monogamous marriage and the nuclear family unit are no longer influential. The image of the White woman in the minds of the non-White males encouraged by globalists to invade White-majority countries, is of a promiscuous and nymphomaniacal slut who will bed any man who desires her. This image has been exported abroad by Hollywood, but it is far from the truth, since women everywhere are biologically hypergamous. But there is no doubt this is a powerful draw for the Third World\u2019s oversupply of single males, who cannot afford wives for themselves in their own native countries. These policies are prudishly justified as much needed \u201ccivil rights legislation\u201d and \u201cmulticulturalism,\u201d but more appropriate labels would be pathological ethnomasochism and delusional racial self-hatred.\n\nLastly, the state religion of Rome had become Christianity in the fourth century. This deprived the Imperium of her ablest and most talented men. This late classical \u201cbrain drain\u201d further hastened a process begun during the crisis of the third century, when the Roman empire was divided between warring factions.\n\nItalian historian Arnaldo Momigliano writes:\n\n\u201cThe Church attracted the most creative minds\u2014St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, Hilarius of Poitiers, St. Augustine in the West; Athanasius, John Chrysostom, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Basil of Caesarea in the East: almost all born rulers, rulers of a type which, with exception of the scholarly emperor Julian, it was hard to find on the imperial throne. \u2026 Gibbon was simplifying a very complicated issue when he insinuated that Christianity was responsible for the fall of the empire, but he perceived that the church attracted many men who in the past would have become excellent generals, governors of provinces, advisers to the emperors. \u2026 People escaped from the state into the Church and weakened that state by giving their best to the Church. This is a situation which in its turn requires analysis and explanation. But its primary importance cannot be overlooked. The best men were working for the Church, not for the state.\u201d[4]\n\nThe rise of Christianity did not cause the Dark Ages\u2014an event without any single underlying cause\u2014but it did not help matters either. As the Christian church increased in wealth and power, more people took an active interest in pursuing clerical careers. Under the pagan emperors, familiarity with the classics was mandatory for those who wanted to work for the state, but it wasn\u2019t necessary for those who worked for the church. There was a \u201creduction in the number of administrative posts in the Roman empire\u2019s Western successor kingdoms because taxation was simplified and some administrative levels \u2026 disappeared entirely. This rendered classical culture less attractive, because the effort and investment necessary to master it became less socially profitable.\u201d[5] As a result, the classical curriculum declined in importance, becoming no longer necessary for secular advancement. In the early medieval period, the \u201cclericalization of the culture became the sociological norm after 550.\u201d[6] In the late sixth to seventh centuries, the classical education system was either replaced by monastic training or the study of patristics. This development negatively affected the survival of the ancient world\u2019s secular knowledge. Dirk Rohmann writes:\n\nMany early Christian clerics and ecclesiastical authors felt that the pagan texts of the past were completely unnecessary to lead a Christian life-style. \u2026 As classical education came to be less and less important for worldly career paths, and clerical career paths became more and more attractive, the preservation of the works of old was endangered.\u201d[7]\n\nSomehow these writings had become so \u201cendangered\u201d that almost none of them survived the sixth and seventh centuries, when Western man had sunk to the lowest depths. How could such an enormous loss occur in so brief a period of time (relatively speaking)? In the standard work on classical and medieval textual transmission, scholars Reynolds and Wilson write:\n\nThere can be little doubt that one of the major reasons for the loss of classical texts is that most Christians were not interested in reading them, and hence not enough new copies of the texts were made to ensure their survival in an age of war and destruction.[8]\n\nThe growth of the Christian church meant loss of interest in the ancient world\u2019s greatest achievements. Works of secular poetry, philosophy, science, and mathematics were left to rot on Western Europe\u2019s bookshelves. Reynolds and Marshall write: \u201cThe copying of classical texts tapered off to such an extent during the Dark Ages that the continuity of pagan culture came close to being severed.\u201d[9] The monks who dominated the medieval apparatus of textual transmission made sure to preserve thousands of copies of Greek and Vulgate New Testaments, but rarely copied the classics. According to Rudolf Blum:\n\nOf the Greek literature created before 250 B.C. we have only a small, even though very valuable, part. We do not even have the complete works of those authors who were included in the lists of classics compiled by the Alexandrian philologists. Of all the works of pagan Greek literature perhaps only one percent has come down to us.[10]\n\nRohmann wrotes: \u201cIt is estimated that for Latin literature less than one per cent of titles survive in total.\u201d[11] Because of its indifference to the achievements of the past, the Christian church had inadvertently prolonged the Dark Ages for centuries. It wasn\u2019t until the rediscovery of classical literature\u2014Aristotle, Plato, Euclid and so on\u2014beginning in the twelfth century, that Western man was able to free himself from the brutal indifference and crass superstitions of the Christian church.\n\nLike Christianity, cultural Marxism has played a similar role in the New Dark Ages, but with an important difference. Christianity did not cause the empire\u2019s disintegration, but only hastened its decline, whereas cultural Marxism is a central causal factor in Western decline. Under Cultural Marxist influence, globalist elites have aggressively promoted feminism, multiculturalism and mass immigration. Homosexuality, transgenderism and miscegenation have become enshrined as the new values of a decaying post-modern civilization. The church did not need to suppress classical culture to ensure Christian hegemony in Western Europe; there were a few skirmishes here and there, but indifference was more than enough. Cultural Marxists, unlike Christians, actively suppress knowledge of racial and sexual differences using social pressures, i.e., ostracism and shaming language (\u201cYou racist! You sexist!\u201d); economic pressures, i.e., depriving right-wing dissidents of their livelihoods, and; legal pressures, i.e., hate speech and anti-Holocaust denial legislation. On top of this, the globalist elites even have the power to shape the consciousness of the masses. By altering human perception of objective reality through control of mass media, such as newspapers, television, radio and billboards, they seek to neutralize the opposition, while proclaiming their new religion of liberal egalitarianism.\n\nLike Christianity, cultural Marxism has its own belief system. \u201cThere is no such thing as race or sex,\u201d proclaims the new religion, \u201call cultures are the same.\u201d These beliefs are impervious to reason, just like the beliefs of the devout Christian. Like Christian religious epistemology, cultural Marxist epistemology is faith-based. This does not bode well for the survival of our current, albeit degenerate post-Western civilization. As Edmund Burke pithily observed: \u201cA state without the means of some change, is without the means of its own conservation.\u201d\n\nChristian indifference prolonged the Dark Ages and the suffering of the people of Europe, until what remained of ancient secular knowledge was recovered between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, giving Europeans a solid foundation upon which to build. Without the rediscovery of the writings of Aristotle and others, the modern world would have taken much longer to emerge, assuming it would have emerged at all. The cultural Marxists, far from being indifferent to the Western intellectual tradition, draw much of their inspiration from the liberal Enlightenment, especially Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and various Marxist heterodoxies, like the Frankfurt School. Unlike the church, which has never actively suppressed any branch of human knowledge, cultural Marxist fanatics go out of their way to suppress the West\u2019s accumulated knowledge of race and sex differences, including the role of evolutionary biology in their origin and development. Although cultural Marxism is not an attack on all Western knowledge, its attempt to eliminate knowledge of racial and sexual differences will have the same effect as centuries of Christian indifference to the intellectual achievements of antiquity.\n\nBecause of the diligent efforts of cultural Marxists, few Westerners are aware of the size and extent of racial and sexual differences between populations, or even that such differences exist. This is not unlike the Christian theologians of the Old Dark Ages who hoarded what little remained of ancient philosophy, science and mathematics among themselves, while the populace remained totally ignorant of the intellectual achievements of classical antiquity. Cultural Marxism, unlike the Christian church, has not yet resulted in the loss of almost all branches of human knowledge, but its willful suppression of knowledge of race and sex differences is just as devastating, if not more so. At least there were still men of ability after the long, dark night of Christian indifference, able to rebuild on the wisdom of the past after the recovery of Aristotle in the twelfth century. With the abandonment of all knowledge of race and sex differences, the West\u2019s vast storehouse of knowledge will be lost because of the biological degeneration and extinction of the original populations of Western Europe and North America. Whites will always be able to abandon crass superstitions\u2014even if it takes centuries\u2014but a gene pool, once contaminated by an inferior population\u2019s low-quality genes, may never recover.\n\nWill Western Man Survive The New Dark Ages?\n\nThe Romans of late antiquity were oblivious to the fact their now moribund Western empire was slipping into the Dark Ages, although a few were prescient enough to notice the extent of the rot before it was too late. One such prescient Roman was the fourth-century pagan historian Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote:\n\nAt the time when Rome first began to rise into a position of world-wide splendour, in order that she might grow to a towering stature, Virtue and Fortune, ordinarily at variance, formed a pact of eternal peace; for if either one of them had failed her, Rome had not come to complete supremacy. Her people, from the very cradle to the end of their childhood, a period of about three hundred years, carried on wars about her walls. Then, entering adult life, after many toilsome wars, they crossed the Alps and the sea. Grown to youth and manhood, from every region which the vast globe includes, they brought back laurels and triumphs. And now, declining into old age, and often owing victory to its name alone, it has come to a quieter period of life.[12]\n\nOnly Ammianus\u2019s belief in an eternal Rome prevented him from swallowing the ultimate blackpill and taking his observations to their logical conclusion: Rome\u2019s days as a civilization were numbered. The Christians and the Germanic barbarians would be more interested in wielding their swords and chanting Christian hymns than rescuing the decaying Imperium Romanorum from oblivion.\n\nEven a few late-ancient Christians were not oblivious to the impending collapse of Rome. In a letter of 396, St. Jerome wrote:\n\nMy heart sickens when I go over the catastrophes that have happened in our time. For more than twenty years, not a day has gone past between Constantinople and the Julian Alps without the shedding of Roman blood. How many matrons, how many virgins dedicated to God, how many free-born women of noble blood, have fallen into the hands of those wild beasts, \u2026 bishops imprisoned, priests slaughtered, churches defiled, horses tethered to altars. \u2026 The world of Rome is falling to pieces.\u201d[13]\n\nThe pattern is the same with the New Dark Ages that have blanketed all of Western Europe and North America. Few notice what has happened before voices of protest are silenced indefinitely. As always, the masses carry on as if nothing has changed. No one ever knows they have really gone through a Dark Age until it has been pointed out to them centuries after the fact. It was over 300 years after the \u201cofficial\u201d end of the Old Dark Ages when the fourteenth-century humanist Petrarch first noticed the lights had entirely gone out in Western Europe for over a thousand years, beginning with the crisis of the third century and continuing until his own day. He had a special term for these intervening centuries: aetas tenebrae or \u201cage of darkness.\u201d[14]\n\nAges of darkness, like the one first recognized and described by Petrarch, are necessarily characterized by regnant ideologies that reflect the general ignorance and stupidity of the masses. Medieval man fervently believed in this child-like superstition despite the pointless suffering it caused all around him. Our own day is no different; in our New Dark Age, race and sex are believed to be illusions invented by racists and sexists to oppress and marginalize what cultural Marxists believe are \u201cdisadvantaged minorities.\u201d These beliefs are just as silly, but potentially more destructive than simple Christian beliefs. As religious or quasi-religious beliefs, they are impervious to reason because they are derived from faith-based epistemologies, which do not allow for the revision of the belief-system itself in light of new evidence.\n\nThere are no real solutions to the problems that confront what\u2019s left of Western societies. Only seismic shocks like what led to the Renaissance and Reformation were able to awaken medieval man from his \u201cdogmatic slumbers,\u201d to use Kant\u2019s phrase. With the end of ecclesiastical authority in Europe, medieval man was able to wean himself from his crass superstitions and singlehandedly create the modern world. On the other hand, it seems unlikely a new Renaissance will be enough to jolt Western man\u2014if indeed we can even call him that\u2014from his own \u201cdogmatic slumbers,\u201d given his newfound faith entails mental and biological degeneration of his own subspecies.\n\nOur only hope lies, not with any White awakening\u2014a totally unrealistic fantasy at this point\u2014but with natural selection. If even a few Whites can resist the poison of cultural Marxism, by breeding selectively among themselves and preserving their own bloodlines from non-White intermixture, they may be able to give future Whites the opportunity to rebuild a society of their very own upon the ashes of post-Western degeneracy.\n\n[1] Wickham, Chris.

Who knows what researchers will discover next?\n\n* * *\n\nOver the past few days, the mainstream press has vigorously pushed back against a theory about the origins of the coronavirus that has now infected as many as 70,000+ people in Wuhan alone (depending on whom you believe). The theory is that China obtained the coronavirus via a Canadian research program, and started molding it into a bioweapon at the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. Politifact pointed the finger at Zero Hedge, in particular, though the story was widely shared across independent-leaning media.\n\nThe theory is that the virus, which was developed by infectious disease experts may have originated in the Wuhan-based lab of Dr. Peng Zhou, China's preeminent researcher of bat immune systems, specifically in how their immune systems adapt to the presence of viruses like coronavirus and other destructive viruses. Somehow, the virus escaped from the lab, and the Hunan fish market where the virus supposedly originated is merely a ruse.\n\nNow, a respected epidemiologist who recently caught flack for claiming in a twitter threat that the virus appeared to be much more contagious than initially believed is pointing out irregularities in the virus's genome that suggests it might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon, and not just any weapon but the deadliest one of all.\n\nIn \"Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag\", Indian researchers are baffled by segments of the virus's RNA that have no relation to other coronaviruses like SARS, and instead appear to be closer to HIV. The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications.\n\nFor those pressed for time, here are the key findings from the paper, which first focuses on the unique nature of 2019-nCoV, and then observe four amino acid sequences in the Wuhan Coronavirus which are homologous to amino acid sequences in HIV1:\n\nOur phylogentic tree of full-length coronaviruses suggests that 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS CoV [Fig1]. In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV (NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1). On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the spike glycoprotein amino acid sequences of all available coronaviruses (n=55) [refer Table S.File1] in NCBI refseq (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) this includes one sequence of 2019-nCoV[Fig.S1]. We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020). We then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1. The first 3 inserts (insert 1,2 and 3) aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 (6 amino acid residues) and insert 2 (6 amino acid residues) in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 (12 amino acid residues) in 2019- nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 (8 amino acid residues) maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.\n\nWhy do the authors think the virus may be man-made? Because when looking at the above insertions which are not present in any of the closest coronavirus families, \"it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.\" Instead, they can be found in cell identification and membrane binding proteins located in the HIV genome.\n\nSince the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- \u201cGTNGTKR\u201d (IS1), \u201cHKNNKS\u201d (IS2), \u201cGDSSSG\u201d (IS3) and \u201cQTNSPRRA\u201d (IS4) (Figure 2). To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family (Supplementary figure). This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time. The insertions were observed to be present in all the genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV virus available from the recent clinical isolates. To know the source of these insertions in 2019-nCoV a local alignment was done with BLASTp using these insertions as query with all virus genome. Unexpectedly, all the insertions got aligned with Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). Further analysis revealed that aligned sequences of HIV-1 with 2019-nCoV were derived from surface glycoprotein gp120 (amino acid sequence positions: 404-409, 462-467, 136-150) and from Gag protein (366-384 amino acid) (Table 1). Gag protein of HIV is involved in host membrane binding, packaging of the virus and for the formation of virus-like particles. Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4.This binding induces structural rearrangements in GP120, creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine co-receptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5.\n\nAnd some visuals, which lead the paper authors to conclude that \"this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect\":\n\n3D modelling of the protein structure displayed that these insertions are present at the binding site of 2019-nCoV. Due to the presence of gp120 motifs in 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein at its binding domain, we propose that these motif insertions could have provided an enhanced affinity towards host cell receptors. Further, this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect. To the best of our knowledge, the function of these motifs is still not clear in HIV and need to be explored. The exchange of genetic material among the viruses is well known and such critical exchange highlights the risk and the need to investigate the relations between seemingly unrelated virus families.\n\nA good recap of the findings was provided by Dr. Feigl-Ding, who started his explanatory thread by pointing out that the transmission rate outside China has surpassed the rate inside China.\n\n2) Whoa- the rate of increase ***outside of China*** is steeper than inside of China or Wuhan!

To capture her boy who, just a few short months before, had been so full of life, energy, and love. To distill him into the two dimensionality of words on paper.\n\n\n\nThree weeks earlier, the thread that held Christine Cheers\u2019s world together had been ripped clean away, sending her whole life spinning like an off-balance top. On Wednesday, February 21, 2018, someone on the other end of the phone had said the words that bring any parent to their knees: \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident.\u201d\n\nHer son, 32-year-old Navy flight surgeon James Mazzuchelli had been injured in a helicopter training mission at Camp Pendleton. If she wanted to see him while he was still alive, she needed to get on the next flight from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Diego\u2014and she needed to pray.\n\nLt. James Mazzuchelli in an undated photograph. Courtesy U.S. Navy\n\nJames was still breathing when Christine and her husband, David, arrived at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California, the next morning. But it soon became clear that his condition would not improve. Machines were keeping him alive, and the doctors told Christine that what she was seeing was likely his future\u2014that her scuba-diving, world-traveling, over-achiever of a son was never going to wake up.\n\nThere in the sterile hospital room, Christine flashed back to James as a teenager, coming home from school and making a proclamation that surprised her. As he and his friends worked toward their learner\u2019s permits, they\u2019d sat through a presentation on organ donation. James walked in the door and told his mother frankly that he wished to be an organ donor. \u201cIt was kind of unusual for a kid that age,\u201d she remembers.\n\nJames Mazzuchelli loved adventure, was proud to serve in the Navy, and knew from a young age that he wanted to help people. Pat Heine\n\nUnder the fluorescent lights, with the rhythmic beeping of life-sustaining machines punctuating the silence, it was time for Christine to finish what James had started on that day 17 years before. It was time to honor the spirit of a man who had switched his major from commerce engineering to pre-med because he wanted to help people. It was time to make her very worst day some stranger\u2019s best one.\n\nChristine instructed the hospital to begin the organ donation process. She knew those few words, as hard as they were to say, were the right ones. What she did not yet know was the way those heavy words would ripple outward like a stone dropping into a still pond: allowing a man to return to work, a veteran to get his health back, and an ailing cyclist to get back on his bike. And how those little waves would slowly smooth out the edges of her own grief.\n\n.\n\nMike Cohen was in trouble. It was day one of his 1,426-mile ride across the United States, and his heart was not cooperating. They\u2019d gotten a late start out of San Diego. Perhaps he had not eaten enough or hydrated properly, or maybe it was a lack of rest\u2014the past few days had been packed with trip preparations. Whatever the cause, it didn\u2019t really matter. What mattered was that he had to keep his heart rate under 150 beats per minute, and the steep Cuyamaca Mountains east of San Diego were sending it sky high. The sun was setting, and he would soon be pedaling in the dark. But he had to take it easier: doctor\u2019s orders.\n\n\n\nHis friend Seton Edgerton rode alongside him. They had rigged up Mike\u2019s heart rate monitor so Edgerton could see it on his computer, and he watched the screen, helpless, as his friend\u2019s heart refused to cooperate.\n\nMike Cohen on the first day of his ride from San Diego, CA, to Jacksonville, FL. John Francis Peters\n\nMike had done a cross-county bike ride once before, back in 2012. This time was different. He was different. His body had been through so much since then. Both men were thinking to themselves: This is just day one. Should we even be attempting this? Neither dared to ask the question out loud.\n\nEighteen months earlier, on February 24, 2018, Mike Cohen was in the Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center at UC San Diego Health waiting for a new heart. Heart transplant priority lists are tricky. You have to be sick enough to truly need the new organ, but not so sick you can\u2019t withstand the 12-hour surgery, says Anuj Shah, MD, an interventional cardiologist based in New Jersey. Mike fit those parameters. With an active clot and a left ventricular assistance device (or LVAD) literally pumping blood that his heart was too weak to move, he\u2019d been at the top of the list for a month.\n\nMike had done a cross-county bike ride once before. This time was different. He was different.\n\nHe\u2019d turned 33 three days before, and as he blew out the candles, he wished for a new heart. Today, blood work showed the clot had dissolved enough that he could safely go home, but he probably wasn\u2019t going to get a new heart any time soon. Another tricky thing about the transplant list\u2014you get a month at the top. Tomorrow he\u2019d be kicked to the bottom.\n\nMike was just 18 when he\u2019d been diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia in 2004. Doctors warned him that the treatment protocol could cause lasting damage to his heart. At the time, surviving cancer seemed like the more pressing concern. He took his treatment seriously, doing the radiation and chemo, and even moving from New York to San Diego for his last year of chemo because his oncologist felt mild weather would be easier on his body. The risk had paid off\u2014two years after his diagnosis, he was cancer-free. And the move had been a good fit too. As soon as he was healthy enough to get outside, he was hiking in the nearby hills or riding his bike. A casual cyclist as a kid, Mike became bike-obsessed as a young adult, upgrading from a hybrid to a road bike, then adding a mountain bike to his collection.\n\nTo celebrate his sixth year without cancer, Mike decided to ride his bike from the hospital in San Diego where physicians had pronounced him cancer-free, to the hospital in Long Island, New York, where doctors had delivered his diagnosis. Like most grand adventures, the cross-country ride plan was hatched after a few drinks at his local bar. And like many alcohol-inspired adventures, it was kind of a disaster. Every day was a grind. Somewhere in eastern Arizona, Mike was so over it he nearly threw his bike into oncoming traffic. And between Kansas and the Eastern seaboard, his relationship with the friend accompanying him soured.\n\nWhat Mike didn\u2019t know during that ride was that his heart was beginning to fail; and in the years that followed, his health continued to deteriorate. Even on days he didn\u2019t ride his bike, he always felt tired and could not make it through the day without a nap. One evening in 2017, he started having chest pains. \u201cAt first I thought it was indigestion,\u201d he says. (He\u2019d just eaten a steak.) Then he felt a pain in his jaw and a shooting pain in his left arm. \u201cI took an inventory in my head and I was like, I don\u2019t recognize these feelings.\u201d He texted his brother: Get here now. I think I have to go to the hospital. He didn\u2019t dare put in the message that he thought he was having a heart attack. \u201cWho texts that?\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nAt the hospital, tests confirmed that a golf-ball-sized clot had lodged in his left ventricle. They tried blood thinners, but the clot wouldn\u2019t budge. Soon hospital staff was preparing him for open-heart surgery to install the LVAD, which would do the pumping that his heart\u2014now blocked by a clot\u2014couldn\u2019t accomplish. The doctors told him the device could work for eight months or eight years. Six months later, though, he was back in the hospital with another clot. His heart was failing.\n\nMike in 2017, after he had his LVAD installed. Courtesy Mike Cohen\n\nMike\u2019s old life\u2014where he rode his bike across the country and hiked and biked all over San Diego\u2014seemed like a thousand lifetimes ago. His implanted LVAD required constant access to an electrical outlet, which meant Mike was literally tethered to the indoors by a cord that ran out of his abdomen. Even with an emergency backup battery pack, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t go out in public because you couldn\u2019t trust that someone wouldn\u2019t knock into the cord,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even shower.\u201d He sold his bikes, including the nearly new Trek Stache 9.6 he\u2019d ridden precisely five times before his heart attack. It hurt to send them to a new home, but it hurt more to be reminded that he might never ride again.\n\nIn the cardiac unit on February 24, 2018, as Mike waited for his discharge papers, he walked a lap around the hospital floor, then packed his bag to go home. A nurse walked in. \u201cI have good news, and I have bad news,\u201d she said. Mike asked for the bad news first.\n\nThe nurse announced that he wouldn\u2019t be going home that day after all. The good news? They\u2019d found him a heart.\n\nMike knew better than to get his hopes up. Twice before, hospital staff thought they had a heart for him. But then the size wasn\u2019t quite right, or the organ wasn\u2019t healthy enough. Day stretched into evening. The signs started to look promising\u2014no one had come to tell him it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Nurses double-checked his height and weight and got his vitals one more time.\n\nA little before midnight, hospital staff wheeled Mike to an elevator. It was happening. He was more excited than nervous, ready to move on from the chapter of his life where he lived in a hospital full time. There was a chance that he\u2019d never wake up, he knew that. But the chance of waking up with a healthy heart far outweighed it. \u201cThere\u2019s a photo of me hugging my girlfriend and crying in her arms. It was like, we\u2019re finally there. Maybe this is the end. Maybe it\u2019s the beginning,\u201d he says.\n\n.\n\nChristine Cheers wasn\u2019t going home until every last one of James\u2019s organs left the building.\n\nShe and David watched hospital employees carry coolers from the operating room: his left kidney and pancreas en route to a man in San Diego; his right kidney to a veteran at Walter Reed Medical Center. Next James\u2019s liver headed to the Bay Area. His corneas went to the San Diego eye bank. Tissue and bone also went to nearby tissue and bone banks. All that was left was his heart.\n\n\u201cThat was the one I cared about most,\u201d Christine says. James was more than just her beloved boy; as a soldier and physician, he embodied the ideals of bravery and altruism. \u201cJames had such an amazing heart,\u201d she says.\n\nWith organ donor surgeries, time is critical; organs must be harvested and transported within hours to stay viable, and transplant surgeons move efficiently. Interactions with the donor family can complicate things, and the person charged with transporting James\u2019s heart had only a few hours to get the precious cargo to its new home. He picked up his cooler and headed toward a rear exit so he wouldn\u2019t pass the family.\n\nWhen a hospital representative delivered the news that James\u2019s heart had already gone, David Cheers felt a flash of anger. This was the one thing his bereft wife had asked for; the one thing. He ran into the hallway. He could see the image of someone holding a cooler reflected in a curved safety mirror. The person transporting James\u2019s heart had gotten turned around in the maze of hospital corridors and couldn\u2019t find his way out. Now he was backtracking. David yelled for Christine. The pair watched through the mirror as James\u2019s heart left the building.\n\n.\n\nOn February 25, 2018, Mike Cohen woke up in a hospital bed with a breathing tube in his mouth and James Mazzuchelli\u2019s heart beating in his chest.\n\nA heart transplant is a major surgery, and Mike was prepared for an arduous recovery. He\u2019d been sick for so long. First with cancer, then with a faulty heart. He\u2019d spent nearly his entire young adulthood focusing on his health.\n\n\n\nThis time, his energy seemed to improve immediately: He took his first steps around his hospital room just five days later and was walking the hallways shortly after. \u201cThe old heart was like a two. With the LVAD my energy went to like four to five,\u201d he says. \u201cThis heart is a 10.\u201d\n\nMike recovers in the hospital after his heart transplant surgery. Courtesy\n\nAfter a little more than two weeks, he was sent home with instructions to report to cardiac rehab, where, for the first few days, he was limited to slow walking on a treadmill. Across the room from the treadmill, he spied a stationary bike. He knew he wasn\u2019t ready yet, but it became a beacon. And two weeks later, with his doctor\u2019s okay, he finally threw a leg over and soft-pedaled.\n\nFrom there, it wasn\u2019t long before he started thinking bigger. He itched to get back on a bike outside. The new heart felt so dramatically different that he even dared to imagine whether another cross-country ride might be possible.\n\n.\n\nIn the weeks after James\u2019s death, Christine Cheers descended into a grief so deep that climbing out seemed impossible. She found herself needing to know that James\u2019s organs had helped people. That the recipients were doing alright.\n\nThe one part of the letter that Christine wanted to get right was the part about what organ donation had meant to her son. How glad he would be that his heart and kidneys and tissue were helping someone else. She didn\u2019t want the recipients to feel guilty about the heft and gravitas of the gift they\u2019d gotten.\n\nEvery day in America, 20 people die while waiting for healthy organs. James\u2019s decision to be an organ donor was unusual not just because he had been so young, but because just 58 percent of Americans follow through and tick that box at the DMV. \u201cI didn't get involved with organ donation until graduate school,\u201d says Tobias Reynolds-Tylus, PhD, a researcher who studies organ donation at James Madison University in Virginia. When he filled out the DMV form as a teen, he saw the spot where you could opt to donate your eyes. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable thinking about my eyes not being in my body, I just didn\u2019t sign up.\u201d\n\nEvery day in America, 20 people die while waiting for healthy organs.\n\nDiscomfort is just one of several barriers Dr. Reynolds-Tylus has identified in his research. Another is medical mistrust. \u201cThis idea of, \u2018I can\u2019t trust doctors, they\u2019re going to steal my organs,\u2019\u201d he says. Of course, that\u2019s a fallacy. Even if your driver\u2019s license says you\u2019re an organ donor, there\u2019s a national registry that administrators must consult before your status can be confirmed. Doctors do not have access to that registry.\n\nIt\u2019s also not uncommon for donors to hesitate because of the notion that the body should stay intact after death. And sometimes people just forget to sign up\u2014leaving the box unchecked while they think about what to do, and then they don\u2019t follow through.\n\nFollow-through was not something James lacked. After switching to pre-med, he\u2019d taught himself all the requirements to pass the MCAT (Medical College Admission Test). He became a Naval flight surgeon, but did additional air crew training so he could assist his team in the plane if needed. Of course he had checked the box to make sure he was an organ donor.\n\nOn March 19, Christine put the final copies of her letters in the mail.\n\n.\n\nMike still has the letter Christine Cheers sent him back in March 2018. Pat Heine\n\nMike was trying to achieve some semblance of a normal life. It was early May, a little more than two months since the surgery, and he was finally back to living in a normal apartment, not a hospital room. Just as Christine had been told not to expect a response, Mike had been told he might never hear from his donor\u2019s family. Some are simply too tightly wrapped in grief to reach out. But one morning, Mike got a call from the organization that had coordinated the transplant. They had a letter for him.\n\nHe unfolded the typewritten pages and took a breath.\n\nChristine described her son\u2019s love for serving his country, and the fact that he considered everyone a friend and never judged a soul. He was selfless, she wrote, had a quirky sense of humor, and was a brilliant and gifted doctor. She described his love for adventure, that he used his time off during a deployment in Japan to earn his scuba diving certification but also loved snowboarding and riding motorcycles. He was a frequent user of the phrase: \u201cGo big or go home.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Mike read Christine Cheers\u2019s letter, he began to understand just how special his new heart was. The average cardiac transplant recipient gets about eight years from their donated heart, says Dr. Shah. Reading the letter, Mike became determined to keep this heart as long as possible. \u201cAs clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I wanted them to know that James\u2019s heart was in a safe place,\u201d he says. \u201cThat I was going to do everything I could to protect it.\u201d\n\nOn the morning of the first day of his ride from San Diego, CA, to Jacksonville, FL, Mike took a moment to re-read the letter from Christine. John Francis Peters\n\nSince his surgery, Mike had spent a lot of time wondering about the man who granted him life every day. But until he read Christine\u2019s letter, Mike had known nothing about the heart he got except that the person it had come from must have been exceptionally healthy. He describes his health upgrade as going from a Huffy to a full-carbon road bike\u2014and strangely he found himself craving pizza, something he never had much of a taste for previously.\n\nAs Mike read Christine Cheers\u2019s letter, he began to understand just how special his new heart was.\n\nA curious thing that sometimes happens after a heart transplant is that recipients seem to take on one or two of their donor\u2019s traits. Food cravings are particularly common. Dr. Shah says there\u2019s no science to back this up, and never will be\u2014you can\u2019t make transplant recipients do a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on whether food preference transfers. But he estimates that between 20 to 30 percent of his patients report unexplained changes after the surgery. And he doesn\u2019t dismiss it.\n\nRegardless of the reason, for Mike, the change was marked and it was one tiny nugget he could grasp onto about this stranger whose life was now permanently plaited into his.\n\n.\n\nWhat Mike didn\u2019t mention in the letter he eventually sent to Christine was that the plan he\u2019d hatched in cardiac rehab was beginning to solidify. As soon as he was really and truly healthy, as soon as his doctor gave him the okay, he was going to ride across the country again.\n\nEager to know more about James, Mike typed his name into the Google search bar and learned that James had been buried in Jacksonville, Florida. The end point of his cross-country ride came into focus. Mike wanted to pay his respects in person. It seemed fitting to make the journey by bike\u2014to show just how transformative the heart was. Go big or go home.\n\nThe trip would be slow. Not because Mike wouldn\u2019t be fit, but because he had to be careful not to stress out his heart and immune system. Instead of 100-mile days like the last time, he began plotting a trip that would focus on fun: four hours of riding a day max, with his heart under 150 bpm, even if that meant crawling up hills. With a few days off in Tucson, El Paso, Austin, and Baton Rouge, he thought he could ride from the cardiac ward at UCSD to James\u2019s grave in Jacksonville in just under two months.\n\nTransplant patients take immunosuppressants for life, which prevent their bodies from rejecting the foreign organ. It\u2019s well-documented that intense physical exercise can further weaken the immune system, making a person especially vulnerable to colds\u2014which, in a transplant recipient, quickly can become very serious. So Mike recruited his brother, Dan (who had become certified as a medical assistant so he could care for Mike after his first open heart surgery), to tag along in an RV as support. Then Mike asked his friend Seton Edgerton to ride with him. This time, he wanted companions he could count on.\n\n.\n\nThere is no manual for navigating a relationship with the man who has your son\u2019s heart. No guidebook to figuring out exactly how you\u2019re related to the family that literally kept you from dying.\n\nChristine Cheers sent a total of four letters, one to each of the individuals who had received her son\u2019s organs. She got a response from two. The first was from the man who got James\u2019s kidney and pancreas. He thanked her, saying how the organs had changed his life\u2014that he could go back to work and provide for his family. But his letter had subtly hinted that the thank-you note was all the contact he wished to have.\n\nIt seemed fitting to make the journey by bike\u2014to show just how transformative the heart was. Go big or go home.\n\nIt took Mike a week to process Christine\u2019s letter and another week or so to write back. He wanted to get the tone of his letter just right, to accurately express how grateful he was, how much this heart had changed his life, and how he was determined to keep it beating for years to come. He needed to communicate his desire to stay in touch with James\u2019s family, if that\u2019s what they wanted.\n\n\n\nFor Christine, Mike\u2019s letter was a balm for a wound that had begun to feel like it would never heal. And so began the emails, the texts, the mutual Instagram stalking. The two were so similar, with their love of San Diego and adventure. And, yes, James had loved pizza as much as Mike now did. What were the chances they\u2019d be so much alike? Christine didn\u2019t know, but it was somehow comforting. Sometimes, she even read the captions Mike wrote on Instagram in James\u2019s voice. \u201cKnowing he was doing well really helped,\u201d she says.\n\nEven physicians who are schooled in science and facts and logic sometimes find themselves believing just a tiny bit in magic. Dr. Shah explains that when it comes to heart transplants, so much has to perfectly align. And in this case, it did. On the eve of Mike\u2019s rotation to the bottom of the transplant list, suddenly there was James\u2019s heart, in perfect health and an improbable 100 percent size and blood type match. The hospital where James had been taken after his accident was minutes from the facility where Mike was waiting. And James\u2019s accident happened on Mike\u2019s birthday\u2014the day he blew out the candles and wished for a new heart. For Mike and Christine, the serendipity was profound.\n\nBy September, Mike was back to riding and building up his mileage. He hired Randall Fransen, a Portland-based coach, to build him a training plan. His physicians were impressed by his progress and his cautious approach\u2014and ultimately gave their blessing for the cross-country ride.\n\nMike announced on social media that he was riding to his donor\u2019s gravesite. The Cheers family decided they would meet him there.\n\n.\n\nMike Cohen and Seton Edgerton roll from their RV during a stop along their cross-country route. John Francis Peters\n\nAcross Arizona, then on to Texas, Mike and Seton roll in matching blue jerseys, the struggles of that first arduous day behind them\u2014at least Mike\u2019s heart rate has settled down. Somewhere in the desert, they take a wrong turn and end up sloshing through deep sand. Somewhere in the middle of the country, Seton pins an American flag to his jersey. Somewhere in Texas Hill Country they get barbeque they still talk about three days later. In the first 1,000 miles, they get a combined 24 flat tires. Every time they fix one, another thorn or shard of glass seems to find its way into their lives. They try not to think about how many hours they lose to fixing flats.\n\nEven physicians who are schooled in facts and logic sometimes find themselves believing in magic.\n\nFrom Florida, Christine and David follow along on social media, worrying about traffic and dogs and all the things that can befall a rider in the middle of nowhere. A few times, when Mike and Seton can\u2019t find roads suitable for riding (or even just a direct-ish route), they detour onto the interstate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s illegal,\u201d David, a former police officer, says to Christine when he sees Mike\u2019s post about it. \u201cYou should tell them they can\u2019t do that in Florida.\u201d\n\nChristine winces at the thought of semis whizzing by those boys, that heart. If it had been her son, she might call him and dress him down for riding on the freeway. But Mike isn\u2019t her son; he is a stranger with her son\u2019s heart.\n\nCharlotte Kesl\n\nThe RV made life on the road much easier for Mike and his crew. His brother drove, he brought his dog, Lincoln, and there was plenty of space for all his anti-rejection medications. Charlotte Kesl\n\nOn November 20, 2019, Mike and Seton leave the Flamingo RV Park in Jacksonville and pedal the last dozen miles of their trip. It doesn\u2019t feel at all like the final day of his previous cross-country ride. \u201cLast time, I was limping toward the finish,\u201d he says while slathering thick white sunscreen onto his freckled skin. He warms up slowly on the road and thinks about what a gift it is to be healthy. How he doubted his body for so long, but how now he finally feels like there\u2019s a normal life ahead of him. He ignores the niggling pain in his knee, and the fact he has the beginnings of a cold, and instead focuses on how well his body has handled this challenge over the past two months.\n\nMike\u2019s nerves kick in as he get closer to the cemetery. He\u2019s not so much worried about whether the Cheers family will like him or not, but about what kind of emotion may be attached to meeting strangers who have already come to mean so much to him. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an intense moment to share with someone I\u2019ve never met,\u201d he says.\n\nChristine and David Cheers get to the gravesite early. They want some time alone with their son before Mike arrives. It\u2019s a perfect Florida winter day: sunny with a high of 72 and just a few passing clouds. They hear the whir of hubs as Mike and Seton coast into the cemetery.\n\nMike unclips from his pedals, hands his bike to Seton, and walks straight to Christine. At a loss for words, he manages a quiet \u201cHi.\u201d\n\nMike and Christine meet for the first time at James\u2019s gravesite. Charlotte Kesl\n\nIn that moment, Christine feels a deep sense of calm, as if she\u2019s known Mike her entire life.\n\nThey fold into a deep hug. Then the tears start, silent and punctuated by a few sniffles. These are not the deep weeping tears of grief. They are tears of relief\u2014from knowing that you\u2019ve done right by someone you love, and from knowing that you\u2019ve been accepted, or at least forgiven, by the family whose worst day was your best one.\n\nMike with Christine and David Cheers on the final day of Mike\u2019s cross-country ride. Charlotte Kesl\n\nThe two release, and together they walk to James\u2019s headstone. Mike squats down, balancing on the balls of his feet, and takes a deep breath, feeling the strong pulse of James\u2019s heart in his chest. Silently, he tells James how thankful he is for his sacrifice, and how sorry he is they\u2019ll never get to be friends. He promises to take care of his heart.\n\nSomeone runs back to the R.V. to grab the stethoscope from Dan Cohen\u2019s medical kit. Christine Cheers slides the cold metal head underneath Mike\u2019s blue jersey and listens. She shifts the instrument up, then down, and a little to the left.\n\nThen there it is, loud and clear.

It was a negative image of the world, in both the photographic and tonal senses.\n\nHere\u2019s a better picture.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Who is Responsible for Palestinian Honor Killing?", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.investigativeproject.org/8276/who-is-responsible-for-palestinian-honor-killing#.XjXRdvZ7en9.reddit", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "The young woman looks saucily at the camera, half-smiling, her hijab tightly wrapped to conceal her hair. Her lips are colored red, her eyes outlined heavily in black. Hers is the mischievous expression of a woman dutifully modest in her dress, yet delighting in the accoutrements of female vanity, even sexuality. She looks like someone it would be fun to know.\n\nBut Israa Ghrayeb, a 21-year-old Palestinian makeup artist, is no more, murdered last August by her family at the hands of her own brother. It was a long, torturous death, punishment for posting a photograph of herself and her fianc\u00e9 on Instagram before their engagement had been officially announced. Lawmakers from her home village of Beit Sahour in the West Bank refused to call it an honor killing.\n\nBut that is precisely what it was.\n\nBy now the numbers have become familiar. The United Nations estimates that, globally, 5,000 women are the victims of honor killings every year. It is a figure most experts dispute as being far too low.\n\nThe stories have also become tragically familiar: a young woman who falls in love with a man her parents didn't choose; an unwed couple who appear in public together; a girl who is seen not wearing her hijab; a wife who tries to escape the husband who regularly beats and rapes her \u2013 all murdered by their families in an effort to restore the family honor her misbehavior has threatened to destroy.\n\nGhrayeb's murder, unlike so many others, however, set off a wave of protests in the region, with women calling for stricter laws against such killings and demanding more attention be paid to domestic abuse. And rightly: in the West Bank and Gaza, Amnesty International reported in 2018, \"at least 21 women and girls were reported to have been killed ... mainly by male relatives in 'honor' killings, according to civil society organizations.\" Whether such killings are more or less frequent in the Palestinian territories than they are elsewhere in the region is impossible to know, says Phyllis Chesler, an authority on honor killings and the author of A Family Conspiracy: Honor Killing. Nonetheless, she told the Investigative Project on Terrorism, honor crimes are \"pandemic in Gaza and on the West Bank, and also among Arabs in Israel.\"\n\nBut even if they are not more frequent, honor killings in these territories carry one important distinction from those elsewhere: they are purportedly not the fault of the murderers. They are the fault of the Jews.\n\nThe argument goes something like this: if it weren't for those pesky Jews and the Israeli occupation, Arab men would not need or have weapons. And without those weapons, they would not be killing women. Or if it isn't because of the weapons, then it is because of the oppression of men and women by Israel, and the stress this puts on families. Or it is because \"the Israeli authorities remain passive and simply refuse to enforce the law,\" according to one Palestinian contributor to the Israeli-Palestinian magazine 972.\n\nThat this overlooks the killings of Palestinian women like 16-year-old Palestina Isa, slaughtered in unoccupied St. Louis, Mo. in 1989 by parents who believed she had dishonored the family, is obviously not the point. Nor is it apparently relevant that honor killings also take place at astounding rates in countries like Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, and in immigrant communities across the West. To be fair, one writer insists \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that honor killings in Afghanistan \"increased during the US occupation\" and, similarly, in Iraq during the \"occupation of Iraq.\"\n\nMoreover, none of these attempts at explanation recognizes the real, most insidious and tragic aspect of these killings: that they are not simple domestic violence. Honor killings, unlike domestic violence and murder, often involve the entire family, and are carefully planned in advance \u2013 as Ghrayeb's was. Where domestic violence is usually spontaneous and involves a dispute between two people, the plotting of honor killings might involve not just the immediate family, but extended family members \u2013 uncles, cousins, or in-laws \u2013 and even the community at large. The killers tend to feel relief, rather than remorse, grateful for the re-establishment of their family honor.\n\nAnd as Chesler has noted: \"Seldom is domestic violence celebrated, even by its perpetrators. In the West, wife batterers are ostracized. Here, there is an important difference in honor crimes. Muslims who commit or assist in the commission of honor killings view these killings as heroic and even view the murder as the fulfillment of a religious obligation.\" The vast majority of honor killings, Chesler says, occur within Muslim families.\n\nAnd so while some details of Ghrayeb's murder remain murky \u2013 when exactly she was killed and where \u2013 others, including a tape of her screams as her brothers and father beat her in the hospital where she was recovering from earlier wounds \u2013 make clear that this was no episode of regular domestic abuse. Her family wanted her dead; and even as she cried out for help from her hospital bed, no one, not even the nurses, came to her aid.\n\nIronically, there are ways in which Israel does play a role in the family violence of Palestinian communities. In her extraordinary study of Palestinian women terrorists, Israeli criminologist Anat Berko spoke with a number of failed suicide bombers held in Israeli prisons, several of whom told her they had chosen to blow themselves up as martyrs rather than live with the violence in their homes. Others had been forced by their families to volunteer as suicide bombers. And still others had deliberately turned themselves in, seeing prison as an escape, as the only place they could feel free.\n\nNot all Palestinian advocates, though, are blaming Israel for the deaths of women like Israa Ghrayeb. According to the BBC, the protests that have risen in her name have lead to \"much soul searching over the protection of women from gender-based violence in Palestinian society.\" True, in recent years the Palestinian Authority has repealed laws that permitted rapists to avoid prosecution if they married their victims, and other new laws have increased penalties for domestic abuse. But those changes have gone largely unacknowledged in the courts.\n\nBut this time may be different. In Ramallah, for instance, the attorney general called \"false\" the family's explanation that Israa had \"fallen\" from a balcony, and declared her death the result of \"torture and abuse.\" A Facebook page titled \"Justice for Israa (we are all Israa)\" documents her story. A Change.org petition declares, \"Men can't keep taking pride in killing their women...! And then walk free untouched because no one does anything about it[.] no woman should be beaten up or killed in the name of honor.\"\n\nThe voices behind such initiatives are those of courage; and that courage is heartening. But the truth is that nothing will ever truly change until Palestinians fully understand: The Jews didn't kill Israa Ghrayeb. And neither did Israel.\n\nYou did.\n\nAbigail R.

The 26-year-old has devised a way for her pup Stella to use human language to communicate her needs. Thanks to Hunger\u2019s ingenuity, the Catahoula/Blue Heeler mix can specify when she is thirsty, when she wants to go outside, and when she is looking for her favorite toy. Hunger documents Stella\u2019s burgeoning skills in short videos and their back-and-forth conversations are nothing short of amazing.\n\nSo, how does Stella talk? Hunger created an adaptive device that features rows of large, colorful buttons. Each switch corresponds to a different word that describes places like \u201cpark\u201d and objects including \u201cball\u201d as well as emotions ranging from \u201chappy\u201d to \u201cmad.\u201d When the button is pressed, Hunger or her fianc\u00e9\u2019s voice says the word. Stella can then string together multiple words to express what she\u2019s trying to say.\n\nIn one video, Hunger told Stella that it was time to lay down, but Stella responded with the word \u201cwater.\u201d When her human went to her dish, it turns out that it did need to be refilled. After Stella drank the water, Hunger again tried to get her to go to bed. Stella countered with \u201ctoy ball want\u201d to communicate that she wanted her Kong toy\u2014something that is always in her bed with her.

And his attorney, Sidney Powell, was just getting started.\n\nIn the 27-page-filing, an add-on to her previous motions, Powell demanded charges be dropped against Flynn based on previously withheld exculpatory documents by the government and the IG report on FISA abuse.\n\nThe net result was that federal prosecutors publicly considered, for the first time, that Flynn would get no jail time and instead be put on probation for his previous guilty plea in what we now know was the beginning of the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d operation against the Trump White House.\n\nPowell asserted that Flynn was innocent, claiming the \u201cIG Report is replete with exculpatory information that, had it been know to Mr. Flynn, he never would have pled guilty.\u201d\n\nThe filing included a statement by the retired \u2013 and now financially ruined \u2013 Army general to that effect. As Fox News reported:\n\n\u201cIn truth, I never lied,\u201d Flynn wrote in a new supplemental motion to withdraw his guilty plea filed Wednesday. \u201cMy guilty plea has rankled me throughout this process, and while I allowed myself to succumb to the threats from the government to save my family, I believe I was grossly misled about what really happened.\u201d\n\nPowell\u2019s allegations of Flynn being \u201cgrossly misled\u201d by his own attorneys were just the beginning. Powell averred that Flynn\u2019s first set of lawyers had a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d and worked against Flynn\u2019s interests by having him plead guilty to a charge of lying to FBI, a charge that itself was trumped up by Peter Strzok and another FBI investigator. That second investigator, identified by Powell as Agent Joe Pientka, it turns out, was in charge of the Crossfire Hurricane op against Trump. Powell claims they later lied and said their visit to the Trump White House was a defensive briefing and not a probe. Former FBI chief James Comey publicly laughed at the Flynn meeting saying he\u2019d sent his investigators over there on purpose at the chaotic transition time in order to take advantage of them. Video of his scoffing appears to have been scrubbed from YouTube.\n\nPowell accused Pientka of lying on FISA warrants and withholding information favorable to Flynn from official government documents.\n\nThe filing on Flynn\u2019s behalf was possible in part due to the Inspector General\u2019s report on FISA abuse. Powell claimed that the IG report is \u201creplete with information that is exculpatory to Mr. Flynn and damning of the conduct the FBI used against him. Flynn is one of the four original targeted by Crossfire Hurricane and unmasked by previous administration because of \u2018his puported ties to Russia.'\u201d Furthermore, the FBI got access to Flynn\u2019s information because of the Carter Page FISA warrant, at least two of which we now know were illegally obtained.\n\nPowell believes that the original \u201c302\u201d report on the Flynn meeting, in which FBI agents believed that Flynn was telling the truth, have been lost or worse.\n\nPowell called for all charges to be dropped against Flynn citing \u201cgovernment misconduct dishonestly wielded to destroy the National Security Advisor to President Trump as part of their larger anti-Trump scheme.\u201d She called the case against Flynn a \u201cmockery\u201d of due process:\n\nThe government\u2019s suppression of evidence, drove a three-star-military veteran of multiple conflicts to plead to a crime he did not believe he committed. It now raises the foremost intelligence officer of this generation, a combat veteran and war hero, will spend time behind bars. This is not only manifestly unjust, it makes a mockery of Brady [exonerating evidence] and due process.\n\nShe believes that the DOJ\u2019s Durham investigation into the underpinnings of the spying operation against the Trump campaign and presidency will uncover more information showing that Flynn is innocent.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Fh9xtJfkmQuSQD12h4sEmJjNBUwX7yjv89dMI5w1WYs.jpg"}, {"title": "India allocates 1.2 gigawatts in world's largest renewable energy storage tender", "score": 1, "url": "https://cleantechnica.com/2020/02/01/india-allocates-1-2-gigawatts-in-worlds-largest-renewable-energy-storage-tender/", "comments": 9, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "India Allocates 1.2 Gigawatts In World\u2019s Largest Renewable Energy Storage Tender\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1st, 2020 by Saurabh\n\nThe Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has successfully concluded world\u2019s largest renewable energy-cum-storage tender. The agency allocated 1.2 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity among two of India\u2019s leading developers.\n\nGreenko Energy Holdings and ReNew Power secured 900 megawatts and 300 megawatts of renewable energy capacity in a first-of-its-kind tender issued by SECI last year. As per the conditions of the tender developers are required to supply firm renewable energy throughout the day. Developers were required to bid separate tariffs for supplying power during peak and off-peak periods. Peak period constitutes 11 hours in a day.\n\nGreenko Energy Holdings has secured rights to develop 900 megawatts of capacity with a peak period tariff of Rs 6.12/kWh (US\u00a28.55/kWh) and an off-peak period tariff of Rs 2.88/kWh (US\u00a24.02/kWh). ReNew Power secured a capacity of 300 megawatts with peak period tariff of Rs 6.85/kWh (US\u00a29.57/kWh) and off-peak period tariff of Rs 2.88/kWh (US\u00a24.02/kWh). To meet the firm supply of 1.2 gigawatts, developers would be required to have storage capacity of 3,000 megawatt-hours.\n\nDuring the technical bidding round Greenko Energy had bid for 900 megawatts, ReNew Power for 600 megawatts, and HES Infrastructure for 120 megawatts. While ReNew Power halved its bid in the financial bidding round, HES Infrastructure did not participate at all.\n\nWhile ReNew Power is not known to have worked on any large-scale energy storage projects, Greenko Energy Holdings perhaps the most experience in this field among all Indian developers. We had reported earlier that the company is working on two renewable energy-cum-storage projects in the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. In each of the projects the company will set up 2 gigawatts of solar and 2 gigawatts of wind energy capacity. While the project in Andhra Pradesh will have pumped hydro storage capacity of 8,000 MWh, the project in Karnataka will boast a pumped hydro storage capacity of 9,600 MWh.\n\nGreenko Energy Holdings, which bought out SunEdison\u2019s India assets, is backed by the likes of Singapore government-backed group GIC and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). ReNew Power, one of India\u2019s leading renewable energy companies, counts Goldman Sachs, ADIA, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Global Environment Fund as its investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow CleanTechnica on Google News.\n\nIt will make you happy & help you live in peace for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/iYoiKdLoLkZrYM05gXGo82-UHvrRJrgKW2IWNknoi5s.jpg"}, {"title": "Peanut allergy drug approved by the US FDA: The US has approved its first treatment for peanut allergies in children.", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51342048", "comments": 1, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Peanut allergy is the most common food allergy in the US\n\nThe US has approved its first treatment for peanut allergies in children.\n\nThe drug AR101, or Palforzia, uses oral immunotherapy, with children given tiny but increasing amounts of peanut protein over a six-month period under medical supervision.\n\nAfter that, users must continue to take a daily dose to be able to tolerate accidental exposure.\n\nThe treatment is not a cure and makers warn that the risk of a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction remains.\n\nAnd patients must continue to avoid peanuts in their diet.\n\nPeanuts are the most common food allergen in the US, with an increase in the number of those affected by food allergies across the West in recent decades.\n\nWhile trials to desensitise patients with peanut allergies have previously taken place in the US and elsewhere, the drug is the first to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Lower death rates in the two leading causes of death \u2013 heart disease and cancer \u2013 contributed to Americans' increased longevity.\n\nAmericans can expect to live to an average age of 78.7 years, a gain of a 10th of a year compared with 2017 figures released a year ago. The gain reversed a three-year trend of decreases or no gains in life expectancy.\n\nStart the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\n\nMore than half of 2018's life expectancy was due to declines in cancer and accidental deaths. Drug overdoses account for more than a third of all accidental deaths in the USA.\n\nThe 10 leading causes of death remained the same for the third year in a row, and the only increases were from suicides and the flu coupled with pneumonia. In addition to lower death rates for heart disease and cancer, deaths rates dropped for unintentional injuries, lower respiratory diseases, stroke and Alzheimer's.\n\n\"While modest, it's really great news that the data show progress\" on the life expectancy and overdose fronts, said psychologist Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer at the nonprofit Well Being Trust, which released its own Healing the Nation report Thursday.\n\nAt a White House briefing, Trump administration officials said the increase in life expectancy and the drop in drug overdose deaths are encouraging signs and show the administration\u2019s efforts to combat opioid abuse are saving lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a turning point, and we hope it becomes a trend,\u201d said presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, who spearheads the administration\u2019s fight against the opioid crisis. \u201cWhat we are doing is working.\u201d\n\nReductions in overdose deaths are the result of a \"whole of government\" approach, and there is no \"silver bullet\" for addressing the challenge of drug abuse, said Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat this as a public health emergency, which we do,\" Giroir said.\n\nDespite the gain in 2018, \u201cwe still don\u2019t rate very well compared to the rest of the developed world\u201d in terms of life expectancy, he said.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank that combines ideas from both parties to promote health, security and opportunity, attempted to manage expectations and push for more hard work. In a statement, the center's chief medical adviser, Anand Parekh, noted, \"The (life expectancy) figure is no different than it was back in 2010.\"\n\nHe recommended \"rebdoubled\" prevention efforts focused on the top five leading causes of death \u2013 heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory diseases and stroke \u2013 and far more immediate attention on deaths from suicide, flu and pneumonia.\n\nParekh urged 50-state efforts to reduce overdose deaths, \"addressing the unmet need for treatment and recovery and preventing opioid use disorder in the first place.\"\n\nMiller credits the overdose antidote naloxone, which states and cities made available so emergency workers and others can save the lives of people overdosing on opioids.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment \u2013 prescription drugs that decrease the craving for opioids \u2013 has become more available to treat people addicted to opioids. Neither MAT nor naloxone prevent addiction or deaths from cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs people increasingly turn to as prescription opioid pain medicine becomes harder to get.\n\nThough overdose deaths were down overall, the CDC report showed pockets of trouble. From 2012 to 2018, the rate of drug overdose deaths involving cocaine more than tripled, and the rate involving methamphetamine and other \"psychostimulants with abuse potential\" were up almost fivefold.\n\n\"We have to be a little bit optimistic that some of our approaches to the problems worked, but let\u2019s strike while the iron's hot,\" Miller said.\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker\n\nIf you or family members are struggling with issues mentioned in this story and you would like to connect with others online, join USA TODAY\u2019s \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Life expectancy up for first time in four years, while drug overdose deaths drop by 4%", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Traffic Tickets For Black People Is White Supremacy", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.bitchute.com/video/psoqZrEctowU/", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "Reason\n\nSelect reason Child abuse, child exploitation or child pornography Terrorist material Credible threats or incitement to violence Sexually explicit content Unlawful Harassment Malicious Use - Including doxing, dogpiling, brigading, spamming or scamming Incorrect sensitivity - Should be NSFW or NSFL Incorrect category - This video has been placed in the wrong category\n\nPlease select the most appropriate reason from the list provided.\n\nNote: For copyright infringement claims see the Terms and Conditions.\n\nTime Offset\n\nPlease specify the time offset in the video where the issue occurs.\n\nAdditional comments\n\nPlease add any additonal comments that will help with the assessment of your report here.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-IL2b9PVUcKEceWpOxJj8yW5BVOf3nranPecCboEGl4.jpg"}, {"title": "Ukraine police are interested in deanonymization of every internet reader", "score": 1, "url": "https://empr.media/opinion/investigations/the-police-are-interested-in-deanonymization-of-every-internet-reader-in-ukraine/", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "Ukraine police are interested in the possibility of deanonymization of each and every reader as below investigstion shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent days, the Poltavshchyna technical support internet media received an e-mail from the State Department of Combating Cybercrime in Poltava region.

For this purpose, the cyber police department constantly interacts with all stakeholders who seek their own cyber security and counteract possible cyber incidents.\n\nAt the same time, cyber police do not install or insist on installing any programs that collect personal information about users or interfere with various resources.\n\nAccording to the information published in the media, an internal check is being conducted related to an official letter sent by the cyber police to one of the information resources. An appropriate decision will be made based on its results.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance has studied the issue and posted the following comment:\n\nThe colleagues kindly provided me with a copy of the tracking script fixed_mobile.js. It was posted on the cyberpolice website cyberpolice[.]gov[.]ua and was supposed to be installed on the websites of media outlets for spying on Ukrainians. Now the script has already been removed from the website. I was wrong in my assumption about WebRTC. Spyware does not work like that. The script collects information about the client device: screen resolution, browser name, time zone, and so on, then generates a \u201cfootprint,\u201d and sends it to the database. Now the \u201cfootrprints\u201d can be identified easily, and if you go somewhere through TOR, and then visit the news website without TOR, your \u201cfootprints\u201d and IP address can be identified more easily. Without a doubt, this is an example of mass, unauthorized surveillance. It is particularly sad that it is police that urge people to commit crimes (which fall under five different articles) and install tools for tacit information retrieval. \u201cA State in a Smartphone.\u201d And now the icing on the cake: in the script copy that I have (there were several on the website), the domain for which the statistics are collected is registered in the Russian Federation.

One of the key factors in its occurrence was the discovery of unused emergency aid in the Southern Puerto Rican city of Ponce. The unused emergency aid, including diapers, bottles of water, and canned food, was found in an empty government warehouse. The supplies dated back to 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria.\n\n\u201cThese supplies\u2026were specifically meant to be distributed during the 2017 Hurricane Maria\u2026 My best guess as to why it was kept there would probably be they wanted to keep it stored for emergency purposes for themselves,\u201d said Puerto Rico resident Joan Perez in an interview with The New Voice.\n\nOver the past few years, Puerto Rico has struggled with constant government corruption. Just last year its governor changed three times in a week due to high-profile scandals and angry street protests. The two resignations that allowed Governor V\u00e1zquez to be in power were due to a scandal called \u2018TelegramGate,\u201d where vulgar and offensive messages from a group chat containing former Puerto Rican governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and many other high government officials on the app Telegram were leaked. Rossell\u00f3 authored many of the messages, which contained misogynistic, homophobic, and generally insulting content.\n\nThe leak was followed by days of protests, which lead to Rossell\u00f3 resigning and nominating Pedro R. Pierluisi as his replacement. Pierluisi\u2019s swearing-in as governor was later deemed unconstitutional by Puerto Rico\u2019s Supreme Court, leaving Governor V\u00e1zquez in the position she is in today. It\u2019s quite possible, with the recent protests, that the people are signaling they do not want Governor V\u00e1zquez to be in power much longer either. She has been readily disliked since she came to office; with citizens using the hashtag #WandaRenuncia (#WandaResign) in an attempt to get her to step down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear nobody is happy with how she\u2019s handling the situation,\u201d said Perez.\n\nIn the wake of the warehouse discovery, Governor V\u00e1zquez fired the island\u2019s commissioner of the National Emergency Management and Disaster Relief Agency (NEMA), Carlos Acevedo. She deemed it unforgivable that the aid was undistributed. Housing Secretary Fernando Gil and Department of Family Secretary Glorimar And\u00fajar were also fired the day after, and an investigation was launched into the warehouse and the possibility of there being more like it.\n\n\u201cI have given 48 hours for this investigation. The investigation is to include this warehouse and any others which may exist,\u201d read a statement from Governor V\u00e1zquez. \u201cIn the same vein, I have decided to relieve Carlos Acevedo of his duties as the commissioner of the National Emergency Management and Disaster Relief Agency.\u201d\n\nAcevedo\u2019s firing and the newly launched investigation, however, is unlikely to save Governor V\u00e1zquez from more protests or cause citizens to regard her highly. Puerto Rican citizens are still facing undeniable hardships, and have been even before she became governor. There is a forty-three-percent poverty rate, only twenty percent of schools have reopened due to ongoing earthquake aftershocks, and over four-thousand people are still sleeping in emergency shelters due to the natural disasters that have occurred.\n\nSource: Scott Dalton/American Red Cross\n\nThis is due in part because the island has had an incredibly hard time recovering from 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria, which was the worst storm to strike the island in over eighty years. In a recent report from the Puerto Rican government, it said it expected the storm\u2019s damage to drive an 8% drop in the population by 2024. Puerto Rico lost an estimated 129,848 people between July 1, 2017, and July 1, 2018, alone.\n\n\u201cJust by living here you can tell nothing is particularly paid for and the quality of life in general here is really low,\u201d said Perez.\n\nThe island has also faced multiple earthquakes, which have burdened it with aftershocks, which the United States Geological survey says can last from years to decades with decreasing frequency.\n\nNonetheless, through rain, shine, earthquakes, and storms, the Puerto Rican people are resisting the corruption that plagues their island. They are, undeniably, fighting for equity, the end of government corruption, and their 18th-century twist to it is catching people\u2019s attention and giving them hope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat depressing that thousands of houses had to be destroyed for the people to finally stand up against abuse, but nonetheless the fact they\u2019re doing it at all gives me at least some good bit of hope,\u201d said Perez.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7XyN4Qt5ONpX78hxqD45Xb8Tx6YSJndf3p-BlPWgc58.jpg"}, {"title": "23 Dogs Apparently Forced to Eat Bones and Live in Feces Deserve Justice", "score": 1, "url": "https://forcechange.com/551769/demand-justice-for-dogs-allegedly-found-in-filthy-unlivable-conditions/", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-2-1", "transcript": "Target: Robeson County, NC District Attorney Matt Scott\n\nGoal: Give maximum penalty to person who allegedly kept dogs in unacceptable living conditions.\n\nJanice Maxine Brown allegedly kept forty dogs in disturbing and unsuitable conditions.

The story of a baby elephant, Moyo, is among the ones that still bring hope that things won\u2019t entirely go in the wrong direction soon.\n\nIn 2016, she was found starving and abandoned on the shores of Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, at just a few days old, after being swept away from her family whilst trying to cross a flooded river.\n\nYet, she was immediately airlifted to Wild is Life by rangers, which is a rescue and rehabilitation center located in the country\u2019s capital of Harare, founded and run by Roxy Danckwerts. The sanctuary has an elephant nursery, and its founder explained that babies are rescued, grown, rehabilitated, and re-wilded later.\n\nThis baby elephant was among the tiniest rescues, weighing 56 kilos, and was afraid and sickly.\n\nRoxy took on the role of a surrogate mother, spent the whole days with her at first, literally 24 hours, and even slept beside the little calf, to gain her trust.\n\nMoyo means \u201cof the heart\u201d and she found a special place in Roxy\u2019s heart and in her home. When she was still very small, she followed Danckwerts around her house, and never let her out of her sight.\n\nAt 14 months, The Dodo did an article on the elephant, and she was reported to still follow Roxy everywhere, while her rapidly growing size made this a little tricky.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with the BBC, Roxy explained that there are about 100 animals at their Zimbabwean sanctuary, of 15 different species, ranging from a hand-raised squirrel to the elephant family.\n\nShe added that young elephant calves need constant monitoring so she sets her alarm for every 2-3 hours every night to go outside and check their status.\n\nDespite the traumatic start in life, Moyo became \u201can elephant with a silver spoon in his mouth\u201d.\n\nWhen she was brought to the sanctuary, they all thought she was a boy, but eventually realized that she was a girl. While taking care of her, Roxy became an integral part of her life, and Moyo recognizes her voice, her smell and somehow always knows where she is.\n\nYet, Roxy maintains that Moyo is just as important to her, as she is to her, and they have an extraordinary deep bond of friendship, trust, and love.\n\nTherefore, letting her go would be hard for Roxy, but as all parents want the best for their children, this amazing woman was determined to give Moyo the freedom to roam, despite the nervous emotion collapse she believed she will experience due to it.\n\nNowadays, Moyo has grown up and managed to fight her childhood trauma and started swimming.\n\nShe is even leading her own herd of orphaned elephants as a young matriarch, and became a healthy, calm, and playful elephant, and some kind of ambassador to the nursery.\n\nSources:\n\ntruththeory.com\n\nwww.thedodo.com\n\nwww.bbc.co.uk\n\nnews.cgtn.com", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "It was uplifting to me", "score": 1, "url": "https://i.redd.it/gsdtv8ufs0k41.png", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-3-1", "transcript": "", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "WATCH: Coast Guard uses helicopter to pluck couple and their dog from boat stuck in rough waters Off Oregon coast", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/03/watch-coast-guard-uses-helicopter-to-pluck-couple-and-their-dog-from-stranded-boat-off-oregon-coast.html", "comments": 1, "date": "2020-3-1", "transcript": "A man, a woman and their dog had to be rescued from their boat by helicopter early Saturday morning after they became stuck in rough seas off the Oregon coast, officials said.\n\nOn Friday around 2:30 p.m., the Coast Guard received a call from the couple, who were concerned about crossing the Columbia bar, a notoriously dangerous part of the coastline where the Columbia River empties into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nA rescue boat was dispatched, arrived at the 44-foot vessel and made contact with the couple.\n\n\u201cThe rescue crew determined that it was unsafe to tow the vessel across the bar due to stability issues and deteriorating conditions,\u201d the Coast Guard said in a statement. \u201cThe crew instructed the boaters to don life jackets and remain offshore until weather improved.\u201d\n\nAfter another unsuccessful rescue by boat attempt around 2:45 a.m. Saturday, the Coast Guard launched a helicopter and hoisted the woman, 56, from the deck of the imperiled boat.\n\nThe conditions worsened and it became unsafe to hoist the man, 55, and the dog from the deck of the boat, which was rocking in 12-foot waves.\n\nThe man and his dog were told to jump into the 48-degree water, after which they were safely hoisted up to the helicopter.

There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus.\n\nAt the end of 2019, medical professionals in Wuhan, China, were treating dozens of pneumonia cases that had an unknown source. Days later, researchers confirmed the illnesses were caused by a new coronavirus (COVID-19). By January 23, 2020, Chinese authorities had shut down transportation going into and out of Wuhan, as well as local businesses, in order to reduce the spread of the disease. It was the first of several quarantines set up in the country and around the world.\n\nThe maps on this page show concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, a noxious gas emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. The maps above show NO 2 values across China from January 1-20, 2020 (before the quarantine) and February 10-25 (during the quarantine). The data were collected by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on ESA\u2019s Sentinel-5 satellite. A related sensor, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA\u2019s Aura satellite, has been making similar measurements.\n\nAccording to NASA scientists, the reduction in NO 2 pollution was first apparent near Wuhan, but eventually spread across the country. Millions of people have been quarantined in one of the largest such actions in human history. As of February 28, 2020, the virus had been detected in at least 56 countries.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,\u201d said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. Liu recalls seeing a drop in NO 2 over several countries during the economic recession that began in 2008, but the decrease was gradual. Scientists also observed a significant reduction around Beijing during the 2008 Olympics, but the effect was mostly localized around that city, and pollution levels rose again once the Olympics ended.\n\nThe drop in nitrogen dioxide in 2020 also coincided with Lunar New Year celebrations in China and much of Asia. Generally, businesses and factories close from the last week in January into early February to celebrate the festival. Past observations have shown that air pollution usually decreases during this period and then increases once the celebration is over.\n\n\u201cThere is always this general slowdown around this time of the year,\u201d said Barry Lefer, an air quality scientist at NASA. \u201cOur long-term OMI data allows us to see if these amounts are abnormal and why.\u201d Launched in 2004, OMI has been collecting global data on NO 2 and various air pollutants for more than 15 years.\n\nThe maps above show NO 2 values over three periods in 2020: January 1-20 (before Lunar New Year), January 28-February 9 (around New Year celebrations), and February 10-25 (after the event). The 2020 values are compared to the same periods in 2019 for reference. Lefer noted that the overall values in 2020 were lower than 2019 due to new environmental regulations that China has enforced over the past few years.\n\nWhile the Lunar New Year may have played a role in the recent dropoff, researchers believe the decrease is more than a holiday effect or weather-related variation. In a preliminary analysis, NASA researchers compared NO 2 values detected by OMI in 2020 with the average amounts detected at this time of year from 2005-2019. In 2020, NO 2 values in eastern and central China were significantly lower (from 10 to 30 percent lower) than what is normally observed for this time period.\n\nAdditionally, Liu and colleagues have not seen a rebound in NO 2 after the holiday. \u201cThis year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize spread of the virus.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: For more information on NASA\u2019s long-term measurements of nitrogen dioxide, see this page.\n\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Joshua Stevens, using modified Copernicus Sentinel 5P data processed by the European Space Agency.

Due to its size, health and age diversity \u2014 with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs \u2014 this grove represents \"the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,\" according to the group's president.\n\nKnown as Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove of Sequoiadendron giganteum packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.\n\nThat age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.\n\n\"Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,\" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. \"In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.\" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, \"it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.\"\n\nSRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official \u2014 until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public fundraising drive on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.\n\n'A thoughtful process'\n\nThe Stagg Tree, located in Alder Creek, is the fifth-largest tree in the world. (Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.\n\nThat won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.\n\nAs part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. \"This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,\" Hodder says. \"We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose.\"\n\nTrial by fire\n\n'Our focus will be on protecting the magnificent forest that already exists at Alder Creek,' Hodder says, along with planning for public access. (Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlthough people logged some giant sequoia groves in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the species' modern decline is largely due to misguided efforts last century to suppress natural forest fires. Giant sequoias are adapted to regular, low-burning fires, which help their seedlings by generating nutrient-rich soil, thinning the canopy to let more sunlight reach the forest floor, and creating open areas with less competition from faster-growing plants. Scientists have since realized the folly of suppressing natural wildfires, but despite phasing out that practice, the legacy of fire suppression still haunts the giant sequoia.\n\n\"Because we've been suppressing forest fires that used to occur on a regular basis in this landscape, all the species that would be kind of culled by a natural, low-burning fire have been allowed to grow to maturity in an unnatural way,\" Hodder says. \"So one of the challenges in stewardship of giant sequoia is finding a way to address that unnatural buildup of combustible fuels.\"\n\nThe logging of other species at Alder Creek might have inadvertently helped the giant sequoia, Hodder adds, replicating the effect natural fires would've had if they weren't suppressed. \"They eliminated some of the sequoia's competition, and as a result the sequoia themselves are remarkably healthy, and the property has lower fuel loads than the landscape around it.\"\n\nThat could be a significant advantage for the Alder Creek sequoias, since even this fire-adapted species seems to be increasingly at risk from wildfires. As climate change raises temperatures and worsens droughts in California, including the decline of Sierra Nevada snowpack, the lingering effects of past fire suppression have left many forests primed to erupt.\n\nWhile the purchase ensures Alder Creek won't be sold to a developer, it will be much harder to protect these or any sequoias from the effects of climate change.

The lawsuit notes that 8 million to 20 million tons of plastic end up in the world\u2019s oceans every year \u2014 and that much of it can be traced back to these few companies.\n\n\u201cAt this rate, plastic is set to outweigh fish in the ocean by 2050,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nThe lawsuit calls on these companies to pay to clean up the mess they\u2019ve allegedly made \u2014 and to stop labeling their plastic bottles as recyclable. Convincing the public that the solution to plastics pollution is recycling is fundamentally misleading, the complaint argues, because so little plastic actually gets recycled.\n\nRecent studies suggest of the plastic produced since the 1950s, 91% of it hasn\u2019t been recycled. Instead, the scrap winds up in landfills, burned in incinerators, or in the oceans.\n\nBut in 2018, China, which used to buy up most of the U.S.\u2019 plastic scrap, passed a ban on most types of plastic imports. Smaller countries have tried to pick up the pace on plastics recycling but haven\u2019t been able to sustain it. It\u2019s likely that less than 5% of plastic produced today is getting recycled, according to an estimate from the Plastic Pollution Coalition. The group projects that the rate will drop further if other countries follow China\u2019s lead and ban plastic scrap imports.\n\n\u201cThis is the first lawsuit directly to take on these plastic peddlers who for years have spread the fake narrative that their products can be recycled when they know in many cases this is simply not true,\u201d Josh Floum, president of Earth Island\u2019s board of directors, said in a statement.\n\nEarth Island is taking a page from the lawsuits brought against tobacco companies, claiming that these plastic-producing companies are doing something similar to what cigarette manufacturers did: contributing knowingly to a public harm and lying to the public about it.\n\n\u201cThese companies push a product and then create misinformation campaigns so the public isn\u2019t fully aware of the harms of the products when making purchasing decisions,\u201d Sumona Majumdar, general counsel for Earth Island, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit is aimed at several of the companies whose packaging was found most often in beach cleanups organized by another environmental group, Break Free from Plastic. Nestl\u00e9, Clorox, Crystal Geyser, Mars, and Colgate-Palmolive are among the other companies getting sued.\n\nSome of the companies sued have said they\u2019re already fighting plastics pollution.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s beverage companies are already taking action to address the issue by reducing our use of new plastic, investing to increase the collection of our bottles so they can be remade into new bottles as intended, and collaborating with legislators and third-party experts to achieve meaningful policy resolutions,\u201d a spokesperson for the American Beverage Association, which represents Coke, Pepsi, and others in the non-alcoholic beverage industry, said in a statement sent to the Guardian and Bloomberg Environment.\n\nCorrection: This story has been corrected to reflect that the defendants in the case aren't all of the 10 companies identified in the Break Free from Plastics audit, which was just one piece of information used to inform Earth Island's selection of defendants.\n\nCover: Bottles of Diet Coke sit on a shelf in a market in Pittsburgh, Wednesday, Aug. 8, 2018.

It's stuffed with 60 essential items \u2014 clothes, blankets, toys, a book, bedding, an assortment of personal care items, and probably also instructions for reaching Narnia. It's all designed with very IKEA-cute prints, and the box itself has been designed for safe use as a padded crib.\n\nI invite you to visit the maternity package website, where the Finnish government will treat you to a baby box unboxing video. Feast your eyes on the cutest baby snowsuit you've ever seen. Does your baby have a balaclava? Finnish babies do. According to Kela, everything in the box is chosen \"with a view to their significance for promoting the health and well-being of the mother and child.\" And if parents already have what they need, they can choose a voucher for \u20ac170 instead (and for the record: Finland gives the box to non-citizens living in the country, too).\n\nAnnie Fadely. Courtesy of Annie Fadely\n\nThe sign-up page for the maternity package helpfully includes information about everything else a parent might be interested in that the Finnish government offers: maternity, paternity, and parental allowances, child benefits, three different types of childcare allowances, child sickness and disability assistance, an adoption grant, and more.\n\nAmericans might find the idea of a baby box to be charming and, ultimately, frivolous. But the truth is that paying attention to these details matters. It's not a coincidence that Finland's under-five child mortality rate is 1.7 per 1,000 live births \u2014 the lowest in the world. In the United States, it's 6.53.\n\nFinland has also been ranked the most stable country in the world \u2014 as well as the freest and safest. The World Economic Forum says Finland has the least organized crime in the world, its judicial system is the most independent, its banks are the soundest, and its protection of property rights is the best. In 2016, the Sustainable Society Index found that Finland is the best country in the world in a multinational comparison of human well-being.\n\nAnd yet, in 2018, the Trump Administration reported that \"socialism\" has worsened the quality of life in Nordic countries \u2014 that living standards are 15% lower than in the US, and the returns on a college education are lower. This type of fear mongering isn't new. In fact, both parties are guilty of believing narratives like \"the undeserving poor,\" \"welfare queens,\" and \"pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.\" But it's kind of a waste of time to try to demonize socialism, because the Nordic countries aren't even socialist. They're capitalist, just like us.\n\nCapitalism is an economic system, not a political one \u2014 it's just the way that we organize the production of goods through a market that we create, with private ownership and profit incentives. The difference between Finland and America is that our Nordic friends have a much more harmonious marriage between democracy and capitalism; in Finland, the inequities that are created by capitalism don't cut as deep, because the government has established a minimum humane standard of living.\n\nAlthough low child mortality rates are largely the result of an excellent and freely accessible health care system, the baby box is a perfect example of how Finland uses its wealth to invest in the well-being of its people \u2014 and everyone is better for it. You could call that democratic socialism, but you can also just call it smart.\n\nLast week on the Pitchfork Economics podcast, we were joined by writers Anu Partanen and Trevor Corson, a Finnish-American couple living in Helsinki and the authors of the recent New York Times piece, \"Finland Is a Capitalist Paradise.\" When their daughter was born, though, they were living in Brooklyn \u2014 and thought they were going to have to forego the baby box tradition. After their friends managed to smuggle one across the world, Anu wrote:\n\n\"To me the box was home, and it was filled with love and support. It was a gift from a country that started out among the poorest in Europe, having endured famine, oppression and hardship, but that built itself up to be one of the wealthiest. But what matters to me most is what Finland has chosen to do with its wealth: Finland has chosen to invest in its people \u2014 all of its people \u2014 and especially to nurture its children \u2014 all of them. The path was not always straight or easy, and struggles continue even today. But I cannot imagine a better way to use one's freedom, independence, and fortune as a society than to ensure a good future for the nation's children.\"\n\nWhat if we used our freedom, independence, and fortune \u2014 all qualities Americans believe we enjoy more than the rest of the world \u2014 to do the same?\n\nThis week on the podcast, we're talking to Professor Steve Keen, who has spent his career building a new economics \u2014 one that will support creating a more inclusive democracy. He helps us imagine what American society could look like if we stopped believing in long-held fictions.\n\nFor now, if American progress or Finnish citizenship seem out of reach, companies like \"finnbin\" and \"Finnish Baby Box\" will sell you a replica of Finland's baby box.

The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.\n\nEffective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.\n\nEnergy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago.

Due to its size, health and age diversity \u2014 with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs \u2014 this grove represents \"the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,\" according to the group's president.\n\nKnown as Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove of Sequoiadendron giganteum packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.\n\nThat age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.\n\n\"Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,\" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. \"In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.\" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, \"it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.\"\n\nSRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official \u2014 until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public fundraising drive on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline.

The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.\n\nThat won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.\n\nAs part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. \"This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,\" Hodder says. \"We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose.\"\n\nTrial by fire\n\n'Our focus will be on protecting the magnificent forest that already exists at Alder Creek,' Hodder says, along with planning for public access. (Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlthough people logged some giant sequoia groves in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the species' modern decline is largely due to misguided efforts last century to suppress natural forest fires. Giant sequoias are adapted to regular, low-burning fires, which help their seedlings by generating nutrient-rich soil, thinning the canopy to let more sunlight reach the forest floor, and creating open areas with less competition from faster-growing plants. Scientists have since realized the folly of suppressing natural wildfires, but despite phasing out that practice, the legacy of fire suppression still haunts the giant sequoia.\n\n\"Because we've been suppressing forest fires that used to occur on a regular basis in this landscape, all the species that would be kind of culled by a natural, low-burning fire have been allowed to grow to maturity in an unnatural way,\" Hodder says. \"So one of the challenges in stewardship of giant sequoia is finding a way to address that unnatural buildup of combustible fuels.\"\n\nThe logging of other species at Alder Creek might have inadvertently helped the giant sequoia, Hodder adds, replicating the effect natural fires would've had if they weren't suppressed. \"They eliminated some of the sequoia's competition, and as a result the sequoia themselves are remarkably healthy, and the property has lower fuel loads than the landscape around it.\"\n\nThat could be a significant advantage for the Alder Creek sequoias, since even this fire-adapted species seems to be increasingly at risk from wildfires. As climate change raises temperatures and worsens droughts in California, including the decline of Sierra Nevada snowpack, the lingering effects of past fire suppression have left many forests primed to erupt.\n\nWhile the purchase ensures Alder Creek won't be sold to a developer, it will be much harder to protect these or any sequoias from the effects of climate change. Still, on top of reducing other risks and generally nurturing the forest's health, Hodder hopes the grove can serve as a kind of living laboratory, helping us learn whatever we can to help these ancient trees survive.\n\n\"This gives us the opportunity to understand what's going on with these new threats and exposures, and to do the forest management that needs to be done,\" he says. \"Science-driven forest stewardship to reduce the fuel load in a way that restores the natural balance for the giant sequoia. To help prepare these groves for the hotter, drier fires that are coming.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated since it was first published in September 2019.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EgA1swEEuSc1OUQwjnawuMCTvEPZaBowWGGU_yrc2yo.jpg"}, {"title": "Shenzhen could be first city in China to ban eating of dogs and cats", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/shenzhen-could-be-first-city-in-china-to-ban-eating-of-dogs-and-cats?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_rif_is_fun", "comments": 55, "date": "2020-3-1", "transcript": "Shenzhen is set to become the first city in mainland China to ban the eating of dogs and cats, if a draft regulation released by the municipal government in a wider push to restrict the consumption of wild animals is approved.\n\nOn Monday, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress issued an order to ban all consumption of wild animal meat and further restrict the wildlife trade nationwide. The measures are expected to be enshrined in the country\u2019s wildlife protection law later this year.\n\nThe ban is a swift response to the Covid-19 outbreak, thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan, Hubei province in early December.\n\nHowever, the Shenzhen government\u2019s potential ban on dog and cat meat is framed not as part of an effort to reduce disease transmission, but as an aspect of the special relationship between people and pets, which it has called the \u201cconsensus of all human civilisation\u201d.\n\n\u201cShenzhen might just be able to do it, as it is a progressive city in many ways,\u201d said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and expert on animal protection in China. \u201cI really hope so.\u201d\n\nConsumption of dog and cat meat is most common in Shenzhen\u2019s home province of Guangdong, neighbouring Guangxi, and parts of north-east China, though it is not universally practised across the country and has become less acceptable over time. Taiwan outlawed the consumption of dog and cat meat in 2017.\n\n\n\n\u201cDog eating has become increasingly controversial in China, with frequent violent clashes between dog thieves and angry dog owners,\u201d said Wendy Higgins, director of international media at Humane Society International (HSI).\n\n\u201cThere is a growing and vocal Chinese opposition to the dog and cat meat trade, and young people in China are far more likely to think of dogs as companions than cuisine,\u201d she said.\n\nThe draft regulation is now in a public comment phase running until 5 March and no timeline has been given for the final determination.\n\nIf the ban goes through, other animals identified as potentially carrying disease \u2013 such as turtles, snakes, some birds and insects \u2013 could be included on a list of prohibited animals for consumption in line with national rules that are expected in the coming months.\n\nUnder the Shenzhen ban, fines for serving banned animals at restaurants would range from 20,000 to 200,000 yuan (\u00a32,200\u2013\u00a322,000).\n\nHSI has estimated that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while protection group Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at roughly 4 million a year.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of dogs caught up in the trade in China are stolen pets and strays snatched from the streets,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cAfter being stolen or snatched, the animals are crammed in small cages in their hundreds, unable to move, and piled on the back of trucks, packed so tightly they can break limbs.\u201d\n\nAnimal protection groups have long been concerned with practices used in the dog meat trade, from rearing and theft to transport and slaughter.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Driven to Near Insanity From 10 Years of Torture\u2014A Woman's Story of Faith and Wrongful Imprisonment", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/driven-to-near-insanity-from-10-years-of-torture-a-womans-story-of-faith-and-wrongful-imprisonment_2980973.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-3-1", "transcript": "Driven to Near Insanity From 10 Years of Torture\u2014A Woman\u2019s Story of Faith and Wrongful Imprisonment\n\nOne woman watched her family suffer as she was wrongfully imprisoned for nearly 10 years, tortured to the brink of insanity, and all the while was shadowed by a criminal who wanted nothing more than to see her suffer, simply for her faith, according to a Minghui.org (Chinese) report published on June 6.\n\nGao Yuxiang, 58, is a believer of Falun Gong and a victim of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP\u2019s) persecution against the peaceful meditation practice. She lives in the northeastern region of China\u2019s Jilin Province.\n\nAlso known as Falun Dafa, the spiritual practice that Gao follows teaches believers to be good people by following the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Yet in July 1999, the communist regime launched a brutal persecution in an attempt to eradicate the peaceful practice.\n\nAfter Gao\u2019s release on Jan. 28, she was able to tell the story of her endurance of inhumane torture. Her story about torture in prison for practicing Falun Gong is just one instance of the numerous crimes against humanity continuing inside China.\n\nChinese Regime Damages Faith and Family\n\nGao began practicing Falun Gong in 1995. Then in 1999, when Chinese media spent entire days dedicated to slandering the practice, Gao went to speak up for her faith in one of China\u2019s most renowned public places: Tiananmen Square.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, I was arrested right away, and they locked me up for 15 days,\u201d Gao told Minghui, a website that documents the persecution of Falun Gong in China. Police forced her family to pay for her release. Gao was not deterred.\n\nShe returned once more to Tiananmen in October 1999, but the results were much worse. After being detained once more, courts sentenced Gao to a forced labor camp for two years. Guards shocked her with stun guns on a regular basis. While she was locked up, government officials demanded that her family, who lived on a farm, turn over all their grain harvests.\n\nWhen Gao was released in 2001, she demanded to the government that their livelihood be returned, but was met with dismal and threats of repeated imprisonment. She said she had no choice but to travel to other cities, looking for work, according to Minghui. However, work was never stable, and it caused more problems for her family.\n\n\u201cMy 16-year-old daughter was forced to drop out of school,\u201d Gao said, because of financial problems.\n\nThen after eight years of relative peace, plainclothes police knocked at Gao\u2019s door in 2009.\n\nAt the time, she was taking care of her frail and ailing mother.\n\nGao recalled clearly what her dying mother said to her, as police dragged her away from her mother\u2019s hands: \u201cDon\u2019t arrest my daughter, she\u2019s a good person, she\u2019s the best person!\u201d\n\nPolice dragged Gao out of her house, while another group of officers ransacked the rooms. The shock was too much for Gao\u2019s mother, as she passed away soon after.\n\nIn the detention center, Gao showed her resilience against the wrongful detention. She was locked in a metal chair and interrogated by two officers. \u201cThey asked me this and that, but whatever they asked, I didn\u2019t answer,\u201d Gao told Minghui. This enraged the officers.\n\nThey then attacked her, beating her unconscious. Gao was awoken by water being dumped on her face. \u201cUntil into the night, I still didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nThen they locked her in a detention center, where she once more opposed the wrongful torture. This time, with a hunger strike. However, the police had another scheme. \u201cThey force-fed me, they shoved a pipe down my nose,\u201d Gao told Minghui. \u201cMy nose bled, my eyes teared \u2026 even now tears often uncontrollably run down my face.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years being locked in a detention center, Gao was then forced through a show trial. Her family members were not even contacted. The trial sentenced her to 10 years in prison in 2011.\n\nA Wrongful Imprisonment\n\nIn July 2011, Gao\u2019s horrific torture in the Changchun Women Prison began. Instead of just being incarcerated like the other prisoners, she became the target of abuse and violence\u2014this was done to force her to renounce her faith.\n\n\u201cThey punished me by making me sit on a small plastic stool, I had to have perfect posture, sitting upright, with my hands on my knees,\u201d Gao told Minghui. \u201cIf I moved at all, they would hit me and ridicule me.\u201d\n\nShe recalled that about 20 female prisoners were organized to surround her, and demanded she abandon her beliefs. Under that intense pressure, Gao just told them the truth about her faith and wrongful treatment.\n\nWhen guards realized that the conversion failed, the prison took a different approach. A woman named Pang Shuyan, who had shown good behavior during re-education through forced labor, was assigned to stay at Gao\u2019s side day and night, reporting on all behavior.\n\nGao had not escaped the punishment of sitting on a plastic stool. Now, Pang was given the authority to make Gao sit on the stool from 4 a.m. all the way until 10 p.m.\n\nAfter five to six days of sitting, Gao said that the prisoners watching her had the idea to put a photo of Falun Gong\u2019s founder, Li Hongzhi, on her stool, and demand she sit on it. Out of respect, Gao refused, even when they tried to force her down onto the stool.\n\nWhen Pang saw the resistance, she dragged Gao to the bathroom. \u201cShe flew into a rage, slapping my face, mouth, and since I wouldn\u2019t sit, they punished me with standing,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nGao was forced to stand for the same amount of time as she had sat, sometimes even longer. \u201cAfter about 20 days, varicose veins were showing on my legs, swelling up clear and thick,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\n\u201c[My legs] were like an elephant\u2019s, blood would even drip out of them.\u201d\n\nThe punishment then was made even worse.\n\nGao was ordered to continue standing for 24 hours at a time. \u201cI stood for five days and five nights, they didn\u2019t let me sleep,\u201d Gao told Minghui. Then Pang unfurled another scheme. She took the picture, which Gao refused to sit upon, and demanded that the other prisoners stick it to Gao\u2019s bare backside.\n\nThen Gao\u2019s restraint snapped, and in a fury yelled and shoved the women away from her as they attempted their plan.\n\nPang then forced Gao into a new kind of suffering. Believers of Falun Gong practice a siting meditation, where both legs are folded on top of each other. In yoga, this is called the \u201cdouble lotus.\u201d Pang made Gao sit in the double lotus for 12 hours. Gao further had to hold her arms above her head.\n\nThis was all on top of almost a whole month of the standing torture and a week of sleep deprivation. The pain and suffering still did not break Gao.\n\nPushed to the Final Limits\n\nPang, along with six or seven other individuals charged with crimes like murder, were assigned to watch Gao and the other imprisoned practitioners. The faithful were then deprived of their basic sanitary needs.\n\nGao was not allowed to use the restroom, and after days of holding back, she finally could endure no longer. The group of prisoners mocked her like school children: \u201c\u2018Gao Yuxiang is so old and wets her pants, she has no shame.\u2019 They insulted me, I bawled, and felt so ashamed,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nTo make matters worse, the wrongfully imprisoned women were forced to eat off the floor. Gao was not allowed to use the restroom again, and did not want to cause the floor to be soiled even further. In a muddleheaded moment, she agreed to the criminal\u2019s punishment: Insult the founder of Falun Gong in writing.\n\n\u201cAfter they let me go to the bathroom and I was more clear headed, my heart felt deep and painful regret,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nSome time later, Pang put Gao through a new form of torture. She made Gao kneel on the bed, laying forward, with her feet raised to her buttocks and hands holding her ankles. Gao had to sit this way for 12 hours a day without moving. Any resistance, and Pang would beat her head with a rolling pin.\n\nAfter 49 days of this daily punishment, Gao was sent to the prison infirmary, finding the extent to which her body was damaged. \u201c[They] couldn\u2019t even draw blood during the check-up,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\nThe Edge of Insanity\n\nAfter that, Pang and the others didn\u2019t make Gao go through that same punishment again. They demanded Gao to write down the names of her relatives. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember my daughter\u2019s phone number, I couldn\u2019t remember my son-in-law\u2019s name,\u201d Gao told Minghui.\n\n\u201cI even forgot my grandson\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nThe prisoners ridiculed Gao with laughter. \u201cI was laughing too, but this laugh was extraordinarily abnormal,\u201d Gao told Minghui. Others even thought that she had snapped.\n\nBut then Gao began reciting words of teaching from her faith, and gradually she came back to herself.\n\nGao witnessed other women break under the same brutal treatment that she received. Other women who refused to sit on the plastic stools were beaten to the point of losing control of themselves.\n\nEven then, the prisoners still mocked and jeered at the persecuted women.\n\nOthers were barely given enough food or water to survive. Some had to secretly drink water from flushing toilets.\n\nBy 2016, Gao had to do forced labor in the prison, and she did not suffer the same forms of torture as before.\n\nThen on Jan. 28 this year, Gao was released from the prison, finally able to tell her story of brutal and wrongful persecution that she endured all those years.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Lithuania introduces plastic deposit scheme and within 2 years has a 92% recycling rate", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.enviro30.com/post/lithuania-introduces-plastic-deposit-scheme-and-within-2-years-has-a-92-recycling-rate", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-3-1", "transcript": "\n\n\n\nIn February 2016, the government of Lithuania implemented a \u201cdeposit return system\u201d, to give consumers an incentive to return used beverage containers for recycling.

France and in the UK, which is considering a deposit system.\n\nThe deposit system is widely viewed as the key to the Nordic country's success.\n\nCustomers pay a few extra cents when they buy a drink in a plastic bottle, and they're refunded that amount when they return their empties.\n\n\"When you have a deposit on the empties, you actually tell the consumers that they buy the product but they borrow the packaging,\" explains Kjell Olav Maldum, the head of Infinitum, a company created by manufacturers and distributors to run the deposit scheme.\n\nThe concept of returning empties has become so widespread there's even a verb in the Norwegian language for it: a pante (pronounced Oh pant-uh).\n\nAs an added bonus, the reverse vending machines give customers the choice of using their refund to buy a lottery ticket that benefits charity.\n\nUnsolvable Rubik's cubes\n\nMore than 1.1 billion plastic bottles and aluminum cans were returned in 2018 at collection points in supermarkets, petrol stations and small shops.\n\nIn Fetsund, about 30 kilometers northeast of Oslo, a steady stream of trucks dump thousands of empties at a time at Infinitum's main processing center.\n\nBouncing along on conveyor belts, the plastic bottles that once contained water, juice or soda are sorted, compacted and placed on pallets resembling enormous colorful Rubik's cubes, destined for a second life after recycling.\n\nEach new plastic bottle contains around 10 percent recycled materials, a level the country hopes to increase with a regressive tax that would encourage manufacturers to use recycled plastic instead of new plastic, which is currently cheaper.\n\nValuable waste\n\n\"We call it clean loop recycling: if you put your bottles into a machine, they sort of enter a clean loop,\" says

In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic that infected 8,000 patients in 26 countries, Chr\u00e9tien and Mbikay, researchers at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal (IRCM), began testing their idea that a derivative of quercetin, a plant compound known to help lower cholesterol and treat inflammatory disease\u2014and common, at low doses, in over-the-counter medication\u2014was a \u201cbroad spectrum\u201d antiviral drug that could fight a range of viruses.\n\nWhen an Ebola outbreak struck West Africa in 2014, the two scientists teamed up with the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg to test quercetin\u2019s effectiveness on mice infected with Ebola\u2014and found it effective even when administered only minutes before infection. It still needs to undergo clinical trials.\n\nBut when a new global health crisis erupted in Wuhan, China late last year, Chr\u00e9tien and his team once again got to thinking. They believed the drug might work on COVID-19, which has infected more than 130,000 people and killed 4,700, according to the World Health Organization. They knew a Swiss drug manufacturer, Quercegen Pharmaceuticals, could rapidly produce doses of the treatment in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe 84-year-old Chr\u00e9tien was, for a time, the world\u2019s seventh most cited scientist. His name runs atop more than 600 publications and he proudly affixes an Order of Canada pin to his lapel. His achievements rival those of his older brother Jean\u2014an impressive claim given that particular sibling served as prime minister of Canada for a decade. Michel has almost certainly saved more lives in his time.\n\nMichel Chr\u00e9tien has a long-standing connection to high-level scientists in China. While a student at the University of California, Berkeley, he received some training from a Chinese researcher, Dr. C.H. Li, an enduring connection that saw him visit and work in China eight times starting in 1979. In the 1980s, Chr\u00e9tien was an honorary professor at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. In 1984, when he started a decade-long stint as president of the IRCM, he trained emerging scientists from China there. One of those relative youngsters was Chen Zhu, a molecular biologist who, back home in China, eventually entered politics and served as minister of health from 2007 until 2013. When a novel coronavirus outbreak exploded in China this past January, Chr\u00e9tien contacted Zhu with an offer: \u201cCan we help?\u201d\n\nZhu contacted officials at the highest levels of the National Health Commission, the government agency managing the crisis. Word came back to Chr\u00e9tien and his team in mid-February. Last week, they invited Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s team to start clinical trials in China. The plan: send samples of quercetin to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan. The Canadian and Chinese scientists would collaborate on the trials, which would include about 1,000 test patients. Chr\u00e9tien and Mbikay plan to join colleagues from the non-profit International Consortium of Antivirals\u2014which Chr\u00e9tien co-founded with Jeremy Carver in 2004 as a response to the SARS epidemic\u2014in manning a 24/7 communications centre as soon as clinical trials go ahead.\n\nThe U.S.-based Food and Drug Administration has already approved quercetin as safe for human consumption, which means the researchers can skip testing on animals. If the treatment works, it\u2019ll be readily available. Now Chr\u00e9tien just needs the funding to start the trials. He estimates the teams need $5 million. But the payoff, he says, could be huge.\n\nChr\u00e9tien\u2019s team says their treatment would cost only $2 a day. They\u2019ve spent weeks pursuing officials at Global Affairs Canada, including senior staff in the office of Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. The Lazaridis Family Foundation has already contributed $1 million to the cause, enough to start clinical trials. There\u2019s no time to waste, says Chr\u00e9tien. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing science all my life. I\u2019ve stumbled on things my entire career, and this is probably the most urgent one I\u2019ve been confronted with,\u201d he says.\n\nQuercetin isn\u2019t the only possible treatment for COVID-19; Nature reported that 80 clinical trials on potential treatments are underway in China. But it remains one of the biggest potential leaps in finding a treatment for the deadly coronavirus strain; if it works, it could save thousands of lives.\n\nChr\u00e9tien, who has spent most of his extensive medical career wearing a lab coat and testing hypotheses, simply touts the benefits of academic freedom as he and his team go about their work. \u201cBasic science is worth doing for the sake of doing it, not knowing what the results will be in the short term or medium term,\u201d he says. \u201cLong-term returns can be big.\u201d\n\nMORE ABOUT CORONAVIRUS:", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Fun!

This particular grove of Sequoiadendron giganteum packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.\n\nThat age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.\n\n\"Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,\" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. \"In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.\" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, \"it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.\"\n\nSRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official \u2014 until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public fundraising drive on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline.

(Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.\n\nThat won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.\n\nAs part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. \"This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,\" Hodder says. \"We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose.\"\n\nTrial by fire\n\n'Our focus will be on protecting the magnificent forest that already exists at Alder Creek,' Hodder says, along with planning for public access. (Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlthough people logged some giant sequoia groves in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the species' modern decline is largely due to misguided efforts last century to suppress natural forest fires. Giant sequoias are adapted to regular, low-burning fires, which help their seedlings by generating nutrient-rich soil, thinning the canopy to let more sunlight reach the forest floor, and creating open areas with less competition from faster-growing plants. Scientists have since realized the folly of suppressing natural wildfires, but despite phasing out that practice, the legacy of fire suppression still haunts the giant sequoia.\n\n\"Because we've been suppressing forest fires that used to occur on a regular basis in this landscape, all the species that would be kind of culled by a natural, low-burning fire have been allowed to grow to maturity in an unnatural way,\" Hodder says. \"So one of the challenges in stewardship of giant sequoia is finding a way to address that unnatural buildup of combustible fuels.\"\n\nThe logging of other species at Alder Creek might have inadvertently helped the giant sequoia, Hodder adds, replicating the effect natural fires would've had if they weren't suppressed. \"They eliminated some of the sequoia's competition, and as a result the sequoia themselves are remarkably healthy, and the property has lower fuel loads than the landscape around it.\"\n\nThat could be a significant advantage for the Alder Creek sequoias, since even this fire-adapted species seems to be increasingly at risk from wildfires. As climate change raises temperatures and worsens droughts in California, including the decline of Sierra Nevada snowpack, the lingering effects of past fire suppression have left many forests primed to erupt.\n\nWhile the purchase ensures Alder Creek won't be sold to a developer, it will be much harder to protect these or any sequoias from the effects of climate change. Still, on top of reducing other risks and generally nurturing the forest's health, Hodder hopes the grove can serve as a kind of living laboratory, helping us learn whatever we can to help these ancient trees survive.\n\n\"This gives us the opportunity to understand what's going on with these new threats and exposures, and to do the forest management that needs to be done,\" he says. \"Science-driven forest stewardship to reduce the fuel load in a way that restores the natural balance for the giant sequoia.

Due to its size, health and age diversity \u2014 with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs \u2014 this grove represents \"the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,\" according to the group's president.\n\nKnown as Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove of Sequoiadendron giganteum packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.\n\nThat age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.\n\n\"Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,\" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. \"In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.\" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, \"it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.\"\n\nSRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official \u2014 until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public fundraising drive on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.\n\n'A thoughtful process'\n\nThe Stagg Tree, located in Alder Creek, is the fifth-largest tree in the world. (Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.\n\nThat won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.\n\nAs part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. \"This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,\" Hodder says. \"We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose.\"\n\nTrial by fire\n\n'Our focus will be on protecting the magnificent forest that already exists at Alder Creek,' Hodder says, along with planning for public access. (Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlthough people logged some giant sequoia groves in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the species' modern decline is largely due to misguided efforts last century to suppress natural forest fires. Giant sequoias are adapted to regular, low-burning fires, which help their seedlings by generating nutrient-rich soil, thinning the canopy to let more sunlight reach the forest floor, and creating open areas with less competition from faster-growing plants. Scientists have since realized the folly of suppressing natural wildfires, but despite phasing out that practice, the legacy of fire suppression still haunts the giant sequoia.\n\n\"Because we've been suppressing forest fires that used to occur on a regular basis in this landscape, all the species that would be kind of culled by a natural, low-burning fire have been allowed to grow to maturity in an unnatural way,\" Hodder says. \"So one of the challenges in stewardship of giant sequoia is finding a way to address that unnatural buildup of combustible fuels.\"\n\nThe logging of other species at Alder Creek might have inadvertently helped the giant sequoia, Hodder adds, replicating the effect natural fires would've had if they weren't suppressed. \"They eliminated some of the sequoia's competition, and as a result the sequoia themselves are remarkably healthy, and the property has lower fuel loads than the landscape around it.\"\n\nThat could be a significant advantage for the Alder Creek sequoias, since even this fire-adapted species seems to be increasingly at risk from wildfires. As climate change raises temperatures and worsens droughts in California, including the decline of Sierra Nevada snowpack, the lingering effects of past fire suppression have left many forests primed to erupt.\n\nWhile the purchase ensures Alder Creek won't be sold to a developer, it will be much harder to protect these or any sequoias from the effects of climate change. Still, on top of reducing other risks and generally nurturing the forest's health, Hodder hopes the grove can serve as a kind of living laboratory, helping us learn whatever we can to help these ancient trees survive.\n\n\"This gives us the opportunity to understand what's going on with these new threats and exposures, and to do the forest management that needs to be done,\" he says. \"Science-driven forest stewardship to reduce the fuel load in a way that restores the natural balance for the giant sequoia. To help prepare these groves for the hotter, drier fires that are coming.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated since it was first published in September 2019.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EgA1swEEuSc1OUQwjnawuMCTvEPZaBowWGGU_yrc2yo.jpg"}, {"title": "British Comedian Joe Lycett changes name to Hugo Boss in protest against the fashion house forcing small businesses to drop the name 'Boss' from their name", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/joe-lycett-hugo-boss-name-change-deed-poll-cease-desist-twitter-fashion-a9367401.html", "comments": 44, "date": "2020-3-1", "transcript": "Joe Lycett has legally changed his name to Hugo Boss after growing angry with the fashion house for allegedly targeting small companies and charities who use the word \u201cboss\u201d in their names.\n\nThe comedian made the announcement on Twitter after calling out the luxury company for costing these small businesses, including Swansea brewery company Boss Brewing, \u201cthousands in legal fees and rebranding\u201d.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \u201cSo @HUGOBOSS (who turnover approx $2.7b a year) have sent cease & desist letters to a number of small businesses & charities who use the word \u2018BOSS\u2019 or similar, including a small brewery in Swansea costing them thousands in legal fees and rebranding.\n\nDownload the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that @HUGOBOSS HATES people using their name,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for them this week I legally changed my name by deed poll and I am now officially known as Hugo Boss.

Giant sequoias are adapted to regular, low-burning fires, which help their seedlings by generating nutrient-rich soil, thinning the canopy to let more sunlight reach the forest floor, and creating open areas with less competition from faster-growing plants. Scientists have since realized the folly of suppressing natural wildfires, but despite phasing out that practice, the legacy of fire suppression still haunts the giant sequoia.\n\n\"Because we've been suppressing forest fires that used to occur on a regular basis in this landscape, all the species that would be kind of culled by a natural, low-burning fire have been allowed to grow to maturity in an unnatural way,\" Hodder says. \"So one of the challenges in stewardship of giant sequoia is finding a way to address that unnatural buildup of combustible fuels.\"\n\nThe logging of other species at Alder Creek might have inadvertently helped the giant sequoia, Hodder adds, replicating the effect natural fires would've had if they weren't suppressed. \"They eliminated some of the sequoia's competition, and as a result the sequoia themselves are remarkably healthy, and the property has lower fuel loads than the landscape around it.\"\n\nThat could be a significant advantage for the Alder Creek sequoias, since even this fire-adapted species seems to be increasingly at risk from wildfires. As climate change raises temperatures and worsens droughts in California, including the decline of Sierra Nevada snowpack, the lingering effects of past fire suppression have left many forests primed to erupt.\n\nWhile the purchase ensures Alder Creek won't be sold to a developer, it will be much harder to protect these or any sequoias from the effects of climate change.

Due to its size, health and age diversity \u2014 with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs \u2014 this grove represents \"the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,\" according to the group's president.\n\nKnown as Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove of Sequoiadendron giganteum packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.\n\nThat age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.\n\n\"Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,\" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. \"In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.\" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, \"it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.\"\n\nSRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official \u2014 until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public fundraising drive on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.\n\n'A thoughtful process'\n\nThe Stagg Tree, located in Alder Creek, is the fifth-largest tree in the world. (Photo: Max Forster/Save the Redwoods League)\n\nAlder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.\n\nThat won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\nOn Tuesday, Joe Bryan was released from prison after 33 years behind bars. \u201cThank you, Father, for taking care of me,\u201d he said, extending his hand toward the sky, his voice choking with emotion. \u201cHallelujah, praise Jesus!\u201d\n\nBryan\u2019s attorneys and a large group of family members had waited outside the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville for hours in cold, gloomy weather, craning for a view of the 79-year-old. Shortly before 11 a.m., as the sun burst through the clouds, parolees began to emerge from the prison, filing past the monolithic, red-brick structure that is home to the state\u2019s execution chamber. Bryan looked uncertainly ahead of him until he spotted familiar faces, then broke into a wide grin. A small bag, which a younger parolee carried for him, held all of his possessions.\n\nBryan, the subject of a ProPublica-New York Times Magazine investigation that questioned the integrity of the expert forensic testimony used to convict him, has always maintained that he had no part in the 1985 shooting death of his wife, Mickey. Bryan was twice convicted of her murder, which took place in their Clifton, Texas, home.\n\nBryan, then a high school principal, had been attending an education conference in Austin, 120 miles away, in the days surrounding the murder. By his account, he was asleep in his hotel at the time of the crime. His conviction rested largely on bloodstain-pattern analysis, a technique still in use throughout the criminal justice system, despite serious concerns about its reliability.\n\nWatch Joe Bryan Reunite With His Family\n\n\n\nBryan first became eligible for parole in 2007, after serving 20 years in prison. In the intervening years, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles denied him parole on seven occasions, despite his sterling disciplinary record. Bryan suffers from congestive heart failure, and the board\u2019s prior refusal to release him was seen as all but guaranteeing that he would die in prison.\n\nThis spring, after Bryan came up for review an eighth time, the board reversed course, and on March 19, it agreed to parole him. The reason for the board\u2019s change of heart is unknown; its deliberations are confidential and exempt from state open-record laws. But its actions followed a concerted effort by his parole attorneys, Allen and Shea Place, and his family to win his release.\n\nBryan\u2019s supporters, who wrote to the parole board on his behalf, included bestselling author John Grisham, who learned about Bryan\u2019s case from the ProPublica-Times investigation. The plot of Grisham\u2019s 2019 thriller, \u201cThe Guardians,\u201d was based in part on Bryan\u2019s story. \u201cI strongly believe Joe is innocent,\u201d Grisham wrote to the board. \u201cPlease do not allow Joe to die in prison.\u201d\n\nBryan\u2019s case has served as a warning about the unreliability of bloodstain-pattern analysis and the scant training that some of its practitioners receive.\n\nAt an evidentiary hearing in 2018 in Comanche, Texas, his attorneys presented evidence that the forensic testimony used to convict him was erroneous. In a sworn affidavit submitted to the court, retired police Det. Robert Thorman, who performed the bloodstain-pattern analysis in the case, wrote: \u201cMy conclusions were wrong. ... Some of the techniques and methodology were incorrect. Therefore, some of my testimony was not correct.\u201d\n\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThat same year, the Texas Forensic Science Commission \u2014 which investigates complaints about the misuse of forensic testimony and evidence in criminal cases \u2014 announced that the bloodstain-pattern analysis used to convict Bryan was \u201cnot accurate or scientifically supported.\u201d\n\nConcerns about the forensic testimony in Bryan\u2019s case inspired the commission to develop a new licensing program for analysts who perform crime scene reconstruction. \u201cMr. Bryan\u2019s case shows that we need to be ever-vigilant to ensure the forensic science put in front of judges and juries is based on science and not conjecture,\u201d Lynn Garcia, the commission\u2019s general counsel, said on Tuesday.\n\nBryan, meanwhile, is returning to a world transformed. He last walked free in the 1980s, when George H.W. Bush was president, before cellphones and the internet revolutionized everyday life. His release comes at an especially precarious time, when a stay-at-home order is in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Houston, where he will be living with his eldest brother, James, and James\u2019 wife, Joretta. Bryan was not aware of those restrictions \u2014 or basic facts about the spread of the virus \u2014 when he spoke with his brother on Monday night.\n\nReturning home at a time of social distancing will be difficult, as was evident on Tuesday, when Bryan\u2019s family members and attorneys, moved to tears at the sight of him, leaned in to embrace him. His family had hoped to celebrate Bryan\u2019s release with a large gathering that would include all four generations of their family, but instead opted to bring him home with little fanfare.\n\nRead the Investigation Blood Will Tell, Part I The murder of Mickey Bryan, a quiet fourth-grade teacher, stunned her small Texas town. Then her husband, a beloved high school principal, was charged with killing her. Did he do it, or had there been a terrible mistake? Blood Will Tell, Part II Joe Bryan has spent the past three decades in prison for the murder of his wife, a crime he claims he didn\u2019t commit. His conviction rested largely on \u201cbloodstain-pattern analysis\u201d \u2014 a technique still in use throughout the criminal-justice system, despite concerns about its reliability.\n\nJames explained that his brother will make peace with the current restrictions, given that Bryan\u2019s greatest desire did not involve venturing out. \u201cJoe told me he would really like to just play our piano \u2014 but only if the sound didn\u2019t bother me and Joretta,\u201d James said, chuckling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful,\u201d he added. \u201cBringing Joe home is the first step. The second step is making sure he is exonerated.\u201d\n\nThe next phase of litigation in Bryan\u2019s case will be in the federal courts. The Innocence Clinic at Texas Tech University School of Law, in partnership with the Innocence Project of Texas and Bryan\u2019s longtime attorney Jessica Freud, plans to file a federal appeal in Bryan\u2019s case. Last month, the clinic\u2019s four law students met with Bryan in prison, in Beaumont, Texas. \u201cThese are four very critical thinkers,\u201d said Allison Clayton, the clinic\u2019s director. \u201cAnd they walked away not only convinced of his innocence but energized to put in the work to prove it.\u201d\n\nBosque County District Attorney Adam Sibley declined to comment on the parole board\u2019s decision or how his office will respond to Bryan\u2019s future appeals.\n\nFreud expressed her relief that her client was being released just as the first cases of COVID-19 in Texas prisons are being confirmed. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful that Joe has been paroled, as he is a higher risk for severe illness from the virus because of his age and heart condition,\u201d she said. But her tone was sober as she assessed what he was leaving behind. \u201cThere are many people like Joe, who are trapped in prison and will get sick if not paroled,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully there will be legislative and executive action to reduce our incarcerated populations before it\u2019s too late.\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ZN_e6vFpjlzocQrzEtBcXK4aLtV3gW7yfdk0bpC9spQ.jpg"}, {"title": "Mountain goats take over Welsh town in coronavirus lockdown", "score": 1, "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/31/mountain-goats-take-welsh-town-coronavirus-lockdown-12483098/", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-4-1", "transcript": "The goats are in charge now (Picture: PA)\n\nGoats have been defying the lockdown in a North Wales town by taking advantage of the quiet streets to mount a takeover.\n\nEmpty roads in Llandudno proved a tempting habitat for the animals, who have been gorging on hedges and gardens.\n\nYes, nature does seem to be returning now that everyone in the UK has been told to stay at home.\n\nResident and reporter Andrew Stuart filmed the goats literally going to town in the seaside neighbourhood.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOne used a hedge as a chaise-longue (Picture: PA)\n\nOthers did some gymnastics on a garden wall (Picture: PA)\n\nMr Stuart, who works for the Manchester Evening News, said he called the police after he noticed the animals breaking isolation rules by gathering in a large group and not keeping the required two metres apart on Friday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Stuart said he noticed the goats having \u2018a midnight feast\u2019 on hedges, tweeting: \u2018They were probably going to run riot on the town, what with nobody being about due to the lockdown.\n\n\u2018I also wasn\u2019t sure if they were keeping the required two metres apart.\u2019\n\nI think I just got a group of goats in Llandudno arrested.\n\n\n\nLet me explain\u2026 first, I saw this from inside a dark pub (the one I live in currently).

This resulted in the deaths of two fishermen in 2006 and a US missionary, John Allen Chau , in 2018. [18] [19] [20]\n\nNominally, the island belongs to the South Andaman administrative district , part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands . [13] In practice, Indian authorities recognise the islanders' desire to be left alone and restrict their role to remote monitoring; they do not prosecute them for killing people. [14] [15] The island is in effect a sovereign area under Indian protection. In 2018, the Government of India excluded 29 islands \u2013 including North Sentinel \u2013 from the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) regime, until 31 December 2022, in a major effort to boost tourism. [16] In November 2018, however, the government's home ministry stated that the relaxation of the prohibition was intended only to allow researchers and anthropologists, with pre-approved clearance, to visit the Sentinel islands. [17]\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Act of 1956 [11] prohibits travel to the island and any approach closer than five nautical miles (9.26 km) in order to prevent the resident tribespeople from contracting diseases to which they have no immunity. The area is patrolled by the Indian navy. [12]\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tilted the tectonic plate under the island, lifting it by 1 to 2 metres (3 to 7 ft). Large tracts of the surrounding coral reefs were exposed and became permanently dry land or shallow lagoons, extending all the island's boundaries\u2014by as much as 1 kilometre (3,300 ft) on the west and south sides\u2014and uniting Constance Islet with the main island. [24] :347 [25]\n\nNorth Sentinel is surrounded by coral reefs, and lacks natural harbours. The entire island, other than the shore, is forested. [22] There is a narrow, white-sand beach encircling the island, behind which the ground rises 20 m (66 ft), and then gradually to between 46 m (150 ft) [23] :257 and 122 m (400 ft) [1] near the centre. Reefs extend around the island to between 0.93 and 1.5 kilometres (0.5\u20130.8 nmi) from the shore. [1] A forested islet, Constance Island, also \"Constance Islet\", [1] is located about 600 metres (2,000 ft) off the southeast coastline, at the edge of the reef.\n\nNorth Sentinel lies 36 kilometres (22 mi) west of the town of Wandoor in South Andaman Island , [2] 50 km (31 mi) west of Port Blair , and 59.6 kilometres (37.0 mi) north of its counterpart South Sentinel Island . It has an area of about 59.67 km 2 (23.04 sq mi) and a roughly square outline. [21]\n\nThe Onge, one of the other indigenous peoples of the Andamans, were aware of North Sentinel Island's existence; their traditional name for the island is Chia daaKwokweyeh.[2][24]:362\u2013363 They also have strong cultural similarities with what little has been remotely observed amongst the Sentinelese. However, Onges brought to North Sentinel Island by the British during the 19th century could not understand the Sentinelese language, so a significant period of separation is likely.[2][24]:362\u2013363\n\nBritish visits Edit\n\nBritish surveyor John Ritchie observed \"a multitude of lights\" from an East India Company hydrographic survey vessel, the Diligent, as it passed by the island in 1771.[2][24]:362\u2013363[26] Homfray, an administrator, travelled to the island in March 1867.[27]:288\n\nTowards the end of the same year's summer monsoon season, Nineveh, an Indian merchant ship, was wrecked on a reef near the island. The 106 surviving passengers and crewmen landed on the beach in the ship's boat and fended off attacks by the Sentinelese. They were eventually found by a Royal Navy rescue party.[24]:362\u2013363\n\nAn expedition led by Maurice Vidal Portman, a government administrator who hoped to research the natives and their customs, accomplished a successful landing on North Sentinel Island in January 1880. The group found a network of pathways and several small, abandoned villages. After several days, six Sentinelese, an elderly couple and four children, were captured and taken to Port Blair. The colonial officer in charge of the operation wrote that the entire group, \"sickened rapidly, and the old man and his wife died, so the four children were sent back to their home with quantities of presents\".[2][26][27]:288 A second landing was made by Portman on 27 August 1883 after the eruption of Krakatoa was mistaken for gunfire and interpreted as the distress signal of a ship. A search party landed on the island and left gifts before returning to Port Blair.[2][27]:288 Portman visited the island several more times between January 1885 and January 1887.[27]:288\n\nAfter Indian independence Edit\n\nLandsat map\n\nIndian exploratory parties under orders to establish friendly relations with the Sentinelese made brief landings on the island every few years beginning in 1967.[2] In 1975 Leopold III of Belgium, on a tour of the Andamans, was taken by local dignitaries for an overnight cruise to the waters off North Sentinel Island.[26] The cargo ship MV Rusley ran aground on coastal reefs in mid-1977, and the MV Primrose did so in August 1981. The Sentinelese are known to have scavenged both wrecks for iron. Settlers from Port Blair also visited the sites to recover the cargo. In 1991, salvage operators were authorised to dismantle the ships.[24]:342\n\nAfter the Primrose grounded on the North Sentinel Island reef on 2 August 1981, crewmen several days later noticed that some men carrying spears and arrows were building boats on the beach. The captain of Primrose radioed for an urgent drop of firearms so his crew could defend themselves. They did not receive any because a large storm stopped other ships from reaching them, but the heavy seas also prevented the Islanders from approaching the ship. One week later, the crewmen were rescued by a helicopter under contract to the Indian Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).[28]\n\nThe first peaceful contact with the Sentinelese was made by Triloknath Pandit, a director of the Anthropological Survey of India, and his colleagues on 4 January 1991.[27]:289[29] Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997.[2]\n\nThe Sentinelese survived the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its after-effects, including the tsunami and the uplifting of the island. Three days after the earthquake, an Indian government helicopter observed several islanders, who shot arrows and threw spears and stones at the helicopter.[2][24]:362\u2013363[30] Although the tsunami disturbed the tribal fishing grounds, the Sentinelese appear to have adapted.[25]\n\nIn January 2006, two fishermen fishing illegally in prohibited waters were killed by the Sentinelese when their boat drifted too close to the island. There were no prosecutions.[14]\n\nIn November 2018, John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old US missionary[31] trained and sent by Missouri-based All Nations,[32] was killed during an illegal trip to the restricted island, planning to preach Christianity to the Sentinelese.[33] Seven individuals were taken into custody by Indian police on suspicion of helping Chau's illegal access to the island.[32] Entering a radius of 5 nautical miles (9.3 km) around the island is illegal under Indian law.[34][35] Fishermen told police that they had seen the tribespeople dragging Chau's body around but the authorities had not been able to independently verify his death as of 25 November 2018.[12] The case is being treated as a murder but there has been no suggestion that the tribesmen would be charged.[36]\n\nChau's journal indicated he was aware of the risks he faced, having been shot at by an islander with a bow and arrow on a previous attempted visit, and of the illegality of his visits to the island. In a final note to his family sent via the fishermen, Chau wrote \"You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed ...\"[12] The family is not insisting on the return of the body to the US.[37][38]", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Legends make sacrifices", "score": 1, "url": "https://i.redd.it/cb7hzh3293q41.jpg", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-4-1", "transcript": "", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oZv2cJOfpxuM9uiO5I5ARkwNMF1Wp_fJ1tjFcu25fNs.jpg"}, {"title": "Today Google stops funding climate change deniers: company announcement", "score": 1, "url": "https://agreenergoogle.com/", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-4-1", "transcript": "[1] \"Mr. President: Stop the Paris Climate Treaty | Competitive Enterprise Institute\" https://cei.org/stopparisclimatetreaty.\n\n[2] \"Once the GOP rolls out climate policies, it endorses all the assumptions of the left\" 6 May. 2019, https://www.aei.org/articles/once-the-gop-rolls-out-climate-policies-it-endorses-all-the-assumptions-of-the-left/.\n\n[3] \"The Grover Norquist Show: The Real Science and Politics Behind Global Warming\" https://www.atr.org/grover-norquist-show-real-science-and-politics-behind-global-warming.\n\n[4] \"Keystone Haters Kill Jobs | Heritage Action For America.\" https://heritageaction.com/blog/keystone-haters-kill-jobs.\n\n[5] \"ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp's Testimony about the Clean Power Plan - ACU.\" https://conservative.org/article/acu-chairman-matt-schlapps-epa-testimony.\n\n[6] \"Global Warming | Cato Institute.\" https://www.cato.org/research/global-warming.\n\n[7] \"Covert Operations - The New Yorker.\" 30 Aug. 2010, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/30/covert-operations.\n\n[8] \"National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Ozone - Mercatus Center\" 12 Mar. 1997, https://mercatus.org/uploadedFiles/Mercatus/Publications/20060830_MR_RSP_PIC_EPA_NAAQS_Dudley_March_12_1997.pdf.\n\n[9] \"Special Report: Burgeoning Conservative Think Tanks\" 12 Jul. 1991, https://desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/Special%20Report%20-%20Burgeoning%20Conservative%20Think%20Tanks.pdf.\n\n[10] \"Publications - The Global Warming Crisis Is Over | Heartland Institute\" 19 May. 2015, https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/the-global-warming-crisis-is-over.\n\n[11] \"Action Plan for President Trump | Heartland Institute.\" https://www.heartland.org/topics/government-politics/trump-action-plan/index.html.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4vNzEa3jnmeJg0NJ3ht_2JK8k-i6Esho-EKXHgDeE90.jpg"}, {"title": "London air pollution levels lowest since records began in 2000", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-england-london-52114306", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-4-1", "transcript": "Image caption Views of London on lockdown and unhindered by smog\n\nLondon views, once covered in smog, are clearer.

That same day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Joanne Ou (\u6b50\u6c5f\u5b89) said that Australia has been purchasing the raw materials to make masks for many years, while about 90 percent of Taiwan's alcohol supply comes from Australia, reported Liberty Times.\n\nOu said that in this time of desperate shortages of epidemic prevention and medical supplies, Taiwan and Australia can join forces to combat the disease. She said that the two countries would provide each other with the raw materials at preferential prices.\n\nOu called Australia an important regional partner of Taiwan, as the two countries share universal values such as freedom and democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Ou said that since the coronavirus outbreak began, the two countries have maintained close cooperation, adding that they look forward to an early end to the epidemic and will continue to deepen their bilateral partnership and trade.\n\nThe latest agreement comes less than two weeks after Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (\u5433\u91d7\u71ee) announced a Taiwan-U.S. joint statement in which the two sides agreed to step up their cooperation on the development of drugs and vaccines to battle the coronavirus.

Stocks of the critical gear are disappearing during the coronavirus pandemic. Doctors say they are rationing gloves, reusing masks and raiding hardware stores. The C.D.C. has even said that scarves or bandannas can be used as protection as a last resort. \u201cI\u2019ve met the doctors, and talked with them every day. I think there\u2019s an interesting challenge here in that, currently, there\u2019s such a need that if they had anything, they would deploy it.\u201d The cries for help are mobilizing a wide range of innovators, some of them even joining forces through online messaging platforms like Slack. These are engineers, doctors and even high school students from around the world. They come from all walks of life, but say their goal is the same. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing because no one\u2019s asking which country are you from? They\u2019re just like, how can I help? What do you need?\u201d They\u2019re pitching in by crowdsourcing designs for masks, face shields and even ventilators that could be reproduced around the world. This is Nick Moser. He\u2019s an active player in one of the maker groups. His day job is at a design studio. Now, he\u2019s designing replicable face masks. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on three products: a face shield, a cloth mask and an alternative to N95-rated respirators. The face shield is the first line of defense for medical workers. It protects against droplets. If a patient coughs, it\u2019ll hit the face shield rather than them.\u201d Some designs are produced using 3-D printers or laser cutters. \u201cThere you go.\u201d Then, the prototypes are field-tested by health care workers. Even some university labs are experimenting with DIY techniques. A group at Georgia Tech is working with open-source designs from the internet to develop products. \u201cMy lab works in the area of frugal science, and we build low-cost tools for resource-limited areas. And now, we\u2019ve realized that I don\u2019t have to go that far. It\u2019s in our backyard, right? We need it now. So this is a plastic sheet I have \u2014 not too different from what you would get out from a 2-liter Coke or a soda bottle. I actually bought this from an art store. It\u2019s just sheets of PET, so we can cut these out. We are calling this an origami face shield, and it\u2019s the Level 1 protection. This is one idea. There are multiple different prototypes.\u201d \u201cThis headband can be reused, and a doctor or nurse could just basically tear this off and basically snap another one on. We\u2019re hearing that, in some cases, that they go through close to 2,000 of these a day.\u201d Because the need is growing so rapidly, the makers are also thinking about how to increase their production. \u201cSo how do we get from this one that someone made at home on a laser cutter or a 3-D printer, and then get it in the hands of thousands of doctors and front-line workers?\u201d They\u2019re working with mass manufacturers that can take their tested designs, and replicate them at a larger scale. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the phone talking to a number of suppliers, material suppliers. So I think one of the neat things that we\u2019ve done is not only the design, proving that you can make it rapidly, but then also trying to secure the entire supply chains.\u201d This is Dr. Susan Gunn, whose hospital system in New Orleans has even started its own initiative to 3-D print equipment. \u201cSo it starts with an idea. We put the idea into place. And then we make sure that it\u2019s professional-grade first. Infection control is looking at it, and we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re using the correct materials that would be approved by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization.\u201d Dr. Gunn says the gear is a safe alternative for those who might otherwise face a shortage. \u201cWe\u2019re creating face shields and we\u2019re creating these different PPEs, and we\u2019re putting them in the hands where people felt like they needed them.\u201d Another critical piece of equipment is the N95 mask, and the supply is dwindling fast. Nick and his team are designing a robust alternative for this mask that can hold any filter material, and be mass produced. \u201cIt is easily printable. This one is used in medical situations where there\u2019s an actively infectious patient. So nursing homes or obviously I.C.U. units would be the target to receive these.\u201d \u201cThese are really hard objects to manufacture because you\u2019re going to give it to a nurse, and then I want to be really confident that it will not let a virus through, right?\u201d This equipment is not approved by federal agencies, but the designers are testing their respirator prototypes for safety. \u201cThat was basically the first, almost the first question that was asked. Can we do anything that\u2019s actually going to be safe and helpful?\u201d Some makers are pursuing even more ambitious projects. An engineer named Stephen Robinson in New Haven, Conn., is working on designing ventilators to help patients breathe. Countries are facing a dire shortage of the lifesaving machines. Right now, these DIY ventilators are still prototypes. \u201cSo really, this should be thought of as the seed of an idea that could potentially be grown with, and absolutely requiring, the medical and the tech communities.\u201d But they could become key if critical supplies run out. \u201cWe\u2019re in very uncertain times, and I see explorations and projects as kind of an insurance policy that could potentially be leaned on if there was extreme circumstances.\u201d Health care workers are hopeful that these efforts could prevent an even worse outcome. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody \u2014 let\u2019s be clear \u2014 to use a bandanna to protect themselves. I hope it never gets to the point where we have to wear a bandanna. And I don\u2019t think, with this initiative that we will get there.\u201d For innovators like Saad, the challenge is personal. \u201cI just can\u2019t stop. I have to do stuff. And then I\u2019m currently at a hospital. That\u2019s why I have this uplifting little flower portrait. We\u2019re expecting a baby boy, and what do we tell him when he grows up about what we did when society needed us?\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Rural police delivering food to vulnerable people during outbreak.", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/grocery-delivery-coronavirus-police-sheriffs-office/index.html", "comments": 1, "date": "2020-4-1", "transcript": "New York (CNN Business) Major Bobby Reed of the Bourbon County, Kansas, sheriff's department had an idea when he saw that some stores were offering special hours just for elderly customers during the coronavirus crisis: He would start making grocery and prescription deliveries for at-risk residents himself.\n\n\"These people don't need to get out. They're in a vulnerable age group,\" the 10-year veteran of the department thought. So he posted on Facebook that he'd volunteer to deliver to elderly residents, shoppers with disabilities and veterans. His rural county, located five miles east of the Missouri border, has about 14,000 residents.\n\nThe calls to Reed quickly came in quickly from residents who had to stay inside because of the coronavirus concerns or because they couldn't find an open slot for pickup at. The Walmart in the Fort Scott, Kansas, area doesn't deliver. Neither does the local grocery store.\n\n\"There's nobody else here local to do it. We're a rural community and we don't have Uber, Lyft,\" he said.\n\nMajor Bobby Reed of the Bourbon County Sheriff's Department in Kansas has been delivering groceries to vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn the first week, he made almost 40 deliveries. Other deputies at the department are also helping out. \"It's really taken off,\" he said. \"It's very rewarding. It's very humbling.\"\n\nFor residents in the area like Cheryl O'Brien, 56, who has heart and lung illnesses and had a pacemaker put in last year, Reed is her \"lifeline.\"\n\n\"I was a little perplexed on how I was going to get everything I needed,\" she said. \"I thought I was going to have to put a mask on and risk catching something until I was told about this service.\"\n\nO'Brien has been using Reed to pick up her medication.\n\n\"I felt bad because he has gone so many times,\" she said. \"Somehow, someway, I'm going to try to repay him when this is all over. It's something that I'm never going to forget. I just pray to God they stay safe.\"\n\nThe Bourbon County Sheriff's Office in Kansas is not the only rural law enforcement agency that has taken on the unlikely role of grocery delivery service during this pandemic. Reed got two calls from other sheriffs departments in Kansas that wanted to start similar services for elderly residents in their communities.\n\nTennessee, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, It's also happening in Nebraska New Jersey and other states. In Appomattox County, Virginia, school resource officers are delivering groceries to elderly residents.\n\nMany small and family-owned grocery stores in rural areas have closed in recent years, making access to fresh food difficult. In rural Kansas, more than 100 grocery stores have closed since 2008, and in 50% of those communities a new store has not re-opened, according to the Center for Engagement and Community Development at Kansas State University.\n\n\"It's very rewarding. It's very humbling,\" Reed said.\n\nSmall, rural grocery stores do not always offer delivery, said Rial Carver, project manager with the program. Delivery is labor intensive and \"some of these rural grocery stores operate with a very limited staff.\"\n\nSo during the coronavirus crisis, cops are stepping up to fill the void. Some have more time on their hands right now to make deliveries.\n\n\"With schools closing down, with courts closing down, our guys were going to have a lot of free time. So we wanted to do something that would help,\" Matthew Henderson, a spokesperson for the Lincoln Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana, told a local television station.\n\nIn Sarpy County, Nebraska, sheriff's deputies took on the role because scammers had been offering to pick up groceries and supplies for residents and taking their money.\n\n\"The idea behind it was to help defeat the scammers who had already started, and to allow those who should be quarantined to stay that way,\" Sgt. Kris Yount told NPR's Nebraska station.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/O_ZpvCqoXDDdLOL8lQCS7OmEfd_PkhGJIs9PsdNN1ro.jpg"}, {"title": "Quarantine is boring?

You\u2019re minding your own business when you hear or see words\u2026 interesting, seductive, tantalizing words. Someone\u2019s speaking or maybe you read them in print. You want to hear more from this author. Maybe they have wisdom or humor or a great story. That\u2019s when, against your better judgment, you reach for it\u2026\n\nYou pick up that Kindle and order yet another book.\n\nHello. My name is Laurie and I can\u2019t stop reading.\n\nI\u2019m convinced being a book addict is like being a sex addict. You can never be sated. You\u2019re constantly craving the next thrill. And once you\u2019ve had one good experience (no matter how satisfying), you\u2019re ready for the next.\n\nI\u2019m not ashamed to admit, many authors have passed through my door. Some were notable and life changing. Classic storytellers Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Wolfe, and Harriett Beecher Stowe come to mind.\n\nOther encounters were quick and tawdry, yet strangely entertaining. I\u2019m talking about Jackie Collins, Judith Krantz and Sidney Sheldon.\n\nWhile others were in the middle \u2013comfortable but in the end we were ready to part ways. Best-selling mystery writers John Grisham, Sue Grafton and Lawrence Sanders I\u2019m talking about you.\n\nMy addiction began with Dr. Seuss in first grade. The Cat in the Hat showed how words rhyme, dazzle and bewitch. Words are magical. They leap from the page. They tell strange, funny stories about creatures that defy authority but don\u2019t get in trouble.\n\nIn elementary school I craved tales of girls having adventures like boys. I devoured biographies of Clara Barton, Eleanor Roosevelt and Amelia Earhart. I reveled in high-school sleuth Nancy Drew and Swedish explorer Pippi Longstocking.\n\nMy early teens brought Mad Magazine and steamy paperbacks from the back shelves of the Five and Dime store. A woman I babysat for had this incredible \u201cforbidden\u201d book collection. At fifteen my eyes bugged out reading, \u201cThe Sensuous Woman\u201d by J with its butterfly kisses and advice on how to make every man want you.\n\nThen in my late teens came Joyce Carole Oates. And that\u2019s when the game changed forever. In her novel, \u201cThem\u201d I discovered I could fall in love with a character. And when my heartthrob Jules was shot and \u201cthe spirit of the Lord left him,\u201d I had my first literary cry.\n\nThe years went on and my book lust continued. In college, I\u2019d lie on my narrow dorm room bed, absorbed in Erica Jong\u2019s \u201cFear of Flying.\u201d I daydreamed about sexy romps across Europe with a shaggy British lover and beat-up Triumph sports car.\n\nSome characters seemed so real I didn\u2019t want to say goodbye. I embarrassed myself weeping as I closed the covers for the last time on \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover,\u201d \u201cThree Junes,\u201d and \u201cThe English Patient.\u201d\n\nSometimes the right book turns up at the right time. Deepak Chopra, Napolean Hill and Edgar Cayce came into my life when I needed spiritual, social, and psychic guidance.\n\nYou\u2019d think by now this addiction would abate. After all, how much excitement can a girl take?\n\nBut if anything, the fever\u2019s grown. Right now I\u2019m reading, \u201cAutobiography of a Yogi\u201d by 19th century guru Yogananda. Before that was British classic, \u201cFar from the Madding Crowd\u201d by Thomas Hardy. Before that was the diaries of French writer Anais Nin. And before that was \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\u201d by the late Maya Angelou.\n\nI can\u2019t stop.\n\nSo what drives this addiction? Is it always the quest for THE ONE? Are we simply searching for the ultimate wisdom that inspires, guides, and helps us understand not only life but ourselves?\n\nOnce in a while, sometimes when I least expect it\u2026a book does exactly that. For me, it\u2019s usually a novel. I put it down and realize I\u2019ll never be the same.\n\nI laughed. I cried. And now I\u2019m spent. I need a break.\n\nBut all too soon, that siren song starts up again. A new author will be heard on the radio or talked about in the local coffee shop. Those words start to tantalize. My hand hovers over that Kindle.\n\nDo I really need another?\n\nAnd always the answer is\u2026 yes. Oh yes.\n\nYou bookworms out there understand. Will we ever be satisfied? Will we ever get enough?\n\nProbably not\u2026but maybe that\u2019s half the fun.\n\nWhat books changed your life? I\u2019d love to hear and if you like what you read, please share.

That quick work, coupled with the country's large number of intensive care unit beds and its early implementation of social distancing measures, could be behind Germany's relatively low death toll. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader, File)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Late last year \u2014 long before most people had heard of the new coronavirus now sweeping the globe \u2014 scientists in Germany sprang into action to develop a test for the virus that was causing an unusual respiratory disease in central China.\n\nThey had one by mid-January \u2014 and labs around the country were ready to start using it just weeks later, around the same time that Europe\u2019s most populous country registered its first case.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that if the epidemic swept over here from China, then we had to start testing,\u201d said Hendrik Borucki, a spokesman for Bioscientia Healthcare, which operates 19 labs in Germany.\n\nThat quick work stands in stark contrast to delays and missteps in other countries. Coupled with Germany\u2019s large number of intensive care beds and its early social distancing measures, it could explain one of the most interesting puzzles of the COVID-19 pandemic: Why are people with the virus in Germany currently dying at much lower rates than in neighboring countries?\n\nThe numbers are remarkable: As confirmed cases in Germany passed 71,000, the death toll Wednesday was 775, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In contrast, Italy has reported almost 106,000 infections and more than 12,400 deaths, while Spain has more than 102,000 cases with over 9,000 deaths.\n\nFrance has four times as many virus deaths as Germany and Britain has twice as many, even though both countries have fewer reported infections.\n\nThere may be many factors at play, but experts said early on that fast and widespread testing gave Germany an edge.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,\u201d said virologist Dr. Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the new virus at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital \u2014 established over 300 years ago to treat plague victims.\n\nHe estimated that Germany is now capable of conducting up to 500,000 tests a week.\n\nSpain, meanwhile, tests between 105,000 and 140,000 people each week, about 20% to 30% what Germany is capable of. Italy did around 200,000 tests over the past week, but that reflects a significant recent ramp-up.\n\nEarly access to the test from Drosten\u2019s team is only part of the reason for Germany\u2019s head start. Before the country even registered its first case, authorities agreed the tests would be covered by its universal insurance system, and be available to everyone with symptoms and either recent travel to virus hotspots or close contact with a confirmed case.\n\nStill, Germany may not be as much of an anomaly as it seems. The fact that Spain and Italy \u2014 which have seen much more intense outbreaks \u2014 are doing fewer tests indicates they are missing many mild or asymptomatic cases. That makes their fatality rates look worse than they are. But Germany, too, is likely missing cases, and experts say that all figures worldwide undercount the extent of the pandemic.\n\nLimited testing also means the true spread of the virus is hidden in those countries \u2014 further fueling the outbreak.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to to death.\n\nEnsuring those severely ill patients can be treated properly is key to managing the outbreak \u2014 and preventing deaths.\n\nAnd there again, Germany has an advantage.\n\nItaly had 8.6 intensive care unit beds per 100,000 people before the outbreak, according to the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development. By comparison, Germany\u2019s most recent available figure is 33.9 per 100,000, or about 28,000 in total, a number the government wants to double.\n\n\u201cWe are well prepared today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,\u201d said Dr. Uwe Janssens, who heads Germany\u2019s Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine.\n\nHospitals in the hardest-hit areas of Italy, are now buckling under the weight of treating so many ill patients at once, contributing the country\u2019s death toll \u2014 the highest in the world.\n\nIn the rare position of having beds to spare, German hospitals have taken in dozens of patients from Italy and France. While that will allow German doctors and nurses to learn how to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients, it also reflects a remarkable confidence in the country\u2019s ability to manage its outbreak at a time when many others are shutting their borders.\n\nFull Coverage: Virus Outbreak\n\nThe Robert Koch Institute, Germany\u2019s disease control center, has suggested that strong measures imposed almost three weeks ago, including closing schools and restaurants, and later barring more than two people from gathering outside, seem to have slowed the rate of new infections.\n\nExperts have bemoaned that many countries took similar steps too late.\n\nScientists advising the British government say major social distancing measures are necessary before there are 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people. According to the, albeit imperfect, data available, Italy imposed its lockdown four days after hitting that threshold but Germany\u2019s came a week before that level was reached.\n\nOfficials stress Germany is still in an early stage of its outbreak. But Dr. Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said countries that intervene early with aggressive measures should theoretically be able to avoid the tsunami of cases seen in Italy and Spain.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky to have had a long time to prepare,\u201d said Dr. Susanne Herold, a specialist for lung infections at the university hospital in Giessen. For weeks, her staff has been installing new ICU beds, training in the use of ventilators and planning for an emergency scenario.\n\nAmid the cautious optimism, there are those who warn against complacency.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 who is herself in isolation after her doctor tested positive \u2014 has resisted calls to loosen the lockdown. A top government medical adviser, Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute, said he wouldn\u2019t rule out Germany\u2019s health system reaching its limit, too.\n\n\u201cThis is still the calm before the storm,\u201d said Health Minister Jens Spahn.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Nicole Winfield in Rome, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin and Maria Cheng in London contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-ykOj3n7UJWEmhWw1INbjrkwJ0dQ1nhey6oT1TVuOGY.jpg"}, {"title": "Thornhill Medical to deliver 500 mobile ventilator systems (In Canada)", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/manufacturing/thornhill-medical-to-deliver-500-mobile-ventilator-systems-250148/", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-4-1", "transcript": "April 1, 2020\n\nby CM Staff\n\nToronto-based medical equipment manufacturer Thornhill Medical has agreed to produce and deliver 500 mobile compact ventilator systems as part of Canada\u2019s response to fight COVID-19.\n\nFollowing the recent signing of a letter of intent by the federal government, Thornhill says it moved immediately to scale up its production plans and expand its manufacturing partnerships and supply chain in anticipation of the March 31 initial order.\n\nThis announcement also comes shortly after an agreement signed with the Ontario government and Thornhill to produce and supply portable ICU units for use across the province.\n\nThe MOVES SLC portable life support and ventilator units will be available for use to support hospitals and health care facilities across Canada by early April, according to the company.\n\n\u201cWe are honoured to provide our Canadian-made ventilator system to support Canadians and our healthcare system in its efforts to fight COVID-19,\u201d said Thornhill Medical CEO Lesley Gouldie in a prepared statement. \u201cWe are also grateful to our existing and new partners that are joining us in scaling up our portable ICU technology which will provide increased life-saving capacity in these unprecedented circumstances.\u201d\n\nThornhill says it has partnered with advanced manufacturing company Linamar \u2014 headquartered in Guelph, Ont. \u2014 to enable increased production capacity.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_b2DzlDds34VDJTtRCQU2AWh-yAlwwOmHyP7Rw-W5Gs.jpg"}, {"title": "In a 2016 episode which criticized predatory collectors, John Oliver's \"Last Week Tonight\" team bought $14,922,261.76 of medical debt owed by 9,000 people (for less than $60,000 by creating a debt-acquisition company).

These predatory collectors attempt to recoup the debt they purchased using threats and other aggressive tactics without first verifying the exact details of the debt.\n\n\u201cOnce the company has bought your debt, whether the information is accurate or not, they are going to try to collect on it,\u201d Oliver explained on Sunday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the full segment\n\n\u201cDebt-buying is a grimy business and badly needs more oversight, because as it stands any idiot can get into it. And I can prove that to you because I am an idiot and we started a debt-buying company,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cAnd it was disturbingly easy.\u201d\n\nLast Week Tonight spent about $50 to create a debt-acquisition company in Mississippi. The corporation\u2019s name is Central Asset Recovery Professionals Inc \u2013 also known as Carp. According to Oliver, soon after its creation, Carp was offered a portfolio of medical debt worth $14,922,261.76 at a cost of \u201cless than half a cent on a dollar, which is less than $60,000\u201d.\n\nIn terms of TV giveaways the cost is far less than Oprah Winfrey\u2019s most famous handout. In 2004, she gave all 276 members of her studio audience a Pontiac G6 sedan. \u201cYou get a car! You get a car! You get a car! Everybody gets a car!\u201d Winfrey told the audience, at a cost nearly $8m.\n\nOccupy activists abolish $3.85m in Corinthian Colleges students' loan debt Read more\n\nBut Oliver\u2019s giveaway is likely to have a larger impact on the lives of more people. After the transaction was completed, Carp received a list of names, addresses and social security numbers of nearly 9,000 people who owed that $15m.\n\n\u201cWe bought it, which is absolutely terrifying because it means if I wanted to, I could legally have Carp take possession of that list and have employees start calling people, turning their lives upside down over medical debt,\u201d said Oliver.\n\nInstead of collecting the debt, however, Last Week Tonight partnered with RIP Medical Debt charity and decided to forgive that debt.\n\n\u201cThanks to this 5 June airing of the HBO comedy series, Last Week Tonight show with John Oliver, there are a lot more of us now privy to this collection industry practice and the debt treadmill it creates,\u201d said Craig Antico, co-founder of RIP Medical Debt. \u201cIn a painfully hilarious (debt as funny? Somehow, yes) piece, John Oliver triumphantly out-Oprah\u2019s Oprah in giving away valuable gifts.\u201d\n\nAs Antico points out this type of debt-buying for charity was pioneered by Rolling Jubilee, an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement. In 2013, Rolling Jubilee spent $400,000 to purchase $14,734,569.87 worth of personal debt \u2013 about $13.5m of it was medical debt \u2013 before abolishing it.\n\nOccupy Wall Street activists buy $15m of Americans' personal debt Read more\n\n\u201cNo one should have to go into debt or bankruptcy because they get sick,\u201d Laura Hanna, an organizer with the group, said at the time.\n\nA year later, in September 2014, Rolling Jubilee announced that it had bought another $3.8m worth of student debt belonging to more than 2,700 Everest College students. The debt had cost the activists about $100,000.\n\n\u201cThe Rolling Jubilee doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem. The Rolling Jubilee is a tactic and a valuable one because it exposes how debt operates,\u201d Thomas Gokey, one of the organizers, said. \u201cIt punches a hole through the morality of debt, through this idea that you owe X amount of dollars that the 1% says you owe.

[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nThis summer, the world-famous Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan province has been flooded with visitors, many of them school children on holidays accompanied by their parents.\n\nThe tranquil forest bases of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda located across Wenchuan county, Dujiangyan and Ya'an cities, Sichuan, have also witnessed a sharp rise in the number of tourists this year.\n\nLast year, there were 548 pandas in captivity worldwide. A total of 285 were in the bases of the conservation and research center, the largest facility of its type in the world, and 184 at the Chengdu panda base.\n\nThe successful programs are the result of more than three decades of hard work and research in Sichuan.\n\nIn the early 1980s, tourists had to visit the Chengdu Zoo if they wanted a glimpse of a panda.\n\nThe Chengdu panda base was not set up until 1987, while the conservation and research center had only one base located in inaccessible mountain terrain in Wenchuan county. In 1987, the Chengdu panda base had only six pandas, all rescued from the wild, while the conservation and research center had 10.\n\nThe sharp increase in the number of pandas in Sichuan has been largely due to researchers' painstaking efforts to solve panda breeding problems.\n\nZhang Hemin, executive chief of the conservation and research center, said \"it used to be difficult for captive pandas to become ruttish and mate and for their cubs to survive\".\n\nResearchers did not understand the pandas' habits. Thinking they preferred a solitary life, they kept each panda isolated in a tiny den. As a result, the pandas became depressed and had difficulty becoming sexually excited.\n\nResearchers provided captive pandas with more opportunities to interact. Pandas were placed in dens with members of the opposite sex so they would become familiar with each other's smell, in an attempt to encourage mating.\n\nWild pandas are active for many hours each day.\n\nTo encourage them to move around in captivity, the researchers placed biscuits in their dens in hard-to-get-to locations. They also gave the pandas frozen fruit which they had to handle in order for it to thaw, Zhang said.\n\nMany newborn panda cubs also died because of abandonment. Fifty percent of all newborns are twins, but the mother usually only cares for one. Researchers would take a deserted baby and feed it milk. The researchers would then from time to time switch it with the favored cub so the mother unwittingly supported both.\n\nResearchers also emulated the mother's behavior in other ways, including cleaning and grooming the cub, Zhang said.\n\n\"With the three primary obstacles hindering the breeding of captive pandas now overcome, a selfsustaining and growing panda population has been ensured,\" he said.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mJnQTYNwpJh1ui8zkVZsNR90GgF_FAWYKJmP9SNjucU.jpg"}, {"title": "Internet Through your Home Water Pipe", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.veiam.com/internet-through-your-home-water-pipe", "comments": 0, "date": "2020-4-1", "transcript": "Being able to leverage existing infrastructures to expand coverage has always been a pipe dream of Internet service providers.

She found it difficult to communicate with her family, none of whom knew sign language. So Allela \u2013 a 25-year-old Kenyan technology evangelist who works for Intel and tutors data science at Oxford University \u2013 invented smart gloves that convert sign language movements into audio speech.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roy Allela has developed a glove that translates sign language to speech via a bluetooth-enabled smartphone. Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering\n\nThe gloves \u2013 named Sign-IO \u2013 have flex sensors stitched on to each finger. The sensors quantify the bend of the fingers and process the letter being signed. The gloves are paired via Bluetooth to a mobile phone application that Allela also developed, which then vocalises the letters.\n\n\u201cMy niece wears the gloves, pairs them to her phone or mine, then starts signing and I\u2019m able to understand what she\u2019s saying,\u201d says Allela. \u201cLike all sign language users, she\u2019s very good at lip reading, so she doesn\u2019t need me to sign back.\u201d\n\nAllela piloted the gloves at a special needs school in rural Migori county, south-west Kenya, where feedback helped inform one of the most important aspects of the gloves: the speed at which the language is converted into audio.\n\n\u201cPeople speak at different speeds and it\u2019s the same with people who sign: some are really fast, others are slow, so we integrated that into the mobile application so that it\u2019s comfortable for anyone to use it.\u201d\n\nUsers can also set the language, gender and pitch of the vocalisation through the app, with accuracy results averaging 93%, says Allela. Perhaps most importantly, the gloves can be packaged in any style the user wants, whether that\u2019s a princess glove or a Spider-Man one, he says. \u201cIt fights the stigma associated with being deaf and having a speech impediment. If the gloves look cool, every kid will want to know why you have them on.\u201d\n\nThe gloves recently won the hardware trailblazer award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Allela is using the prize money to land more accurate vocal predictions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Sign-IO app, which vocalises words signed by the person wearing the gloves.

Queuing alongside patients requiring chronic therapy for health issues ranging from cancer to Aids, Hutiri wondered how he could apply technology to the problem and ease the burden for South Africa\u2019s overrun public hospitals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Neo Hutiri with his Pelebox smart locker, which is designed to cut down the amount of time that patients have to wait for their medication. Photograph: James Oatway/Royal Academy of Engineering\n\n\u201cWe have the biggest antiretroviral [ARV] therapy programme in the world: over 4.6m patients receive ARVs and with chronic therapy treatments like this you have to visit the facility every month to receive medication,\u201d says Hutiri.\n\n\u201cIt dawned on me that patients are spending a lot of time \u2013 4.3m man hours in total every month \u2013 just waiting in queues. So my initial hypothesis was to take patients\u2019 waiting time from three hours to under two minutes.\u201d\n\nHutiri\u2019s first move was to automate the filing system as much as possible by designing the Pelebox (pele for fast in Setswana), a smart locker that acts as a self-service kiosk. The locker is stocked by health workers, who scan a patient\u2019s medication into a specialised cubicle. The number of the locker and a one-time pin are sent directly to the patient\u2019s mobile phone, with the pin allowing the user to open the locker.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical council was intrigued by the Pelebox, but needed reassurance that the right medications would be delivered to the right patients, every single time. Hutiri piloted the project in Pretoria last year and was overjoyed at the results: 4,700 medications were delivered at a 100% success rate \u2013 and with an average collection time of under 36 seconds, says Hutiri.\n\nThe 30-year-old entrepreneur has now signed a contract with the department of health to roll the lockers out in eight of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces, a feat he is hugely proud of.\n\n\u201cEighty-three percent of the South African population relies on state-funded care \u2013 my parents are within that population and on long-term medication \u2013 but they get short-handed because there isn\u2019t enough of an incentive for entrepreneurs in my sector to serve them as they tend to be low-income,\u201d says Hutiri.\n\n\u201cI wanted to design something that you could place as easily in [the affluent area of] Sandton as in a township. I wanted the product to stand out because then the patients feel a high degree of pride, they think: \u2018This product was designed for me\u2019. When you treat people with respect, they pass that respect on to others.\u201d\n\nUganda: The Vertical Farm\n\nMore than two-thirds of Uganda\u2019s population engages in farming, but rapid population growth in the capital, Kampala, means that not everyone who would like to grow their own fruit and veg has the space or land to do so.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Matovu with his Vertical Farm, designed to hold up to 200 plants. Photograph: James Oatway/Royal Academy of Engineering\n\nThis was the issue faced by Paul Matovu, who was born into a family of 20 children and raised for a short time by his grandparents in rural Uganda, where he learned all about growing crops. After returning to Kampala as a cash-strapped university student, he began looking for space-saving ways to grow his own food. His solution was the \u201cfarm in a box\u201d, a sustainably sourced timber box measuring 90cm wide by 90cm high that can hold up to 200 plants.\n\nThe farms currently retail at 300,000 shillings (\u00a364), a high price for the average Ugandan, says Matovu, but as the boxes produce food worth 1.29m shillings (\u00a3275) every year, costs can be quickly recouped. The farms also have a wormery in their middle to compost household waste, the castings of which can then be used to fertilise the crops, helping to keep inputs low but still organic, he says.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to roll out the farms to the wealthy, because they do not mind how expensive the boxes are, and to produce three to five farms per day,\u201d says Matovu. \u201cThen we can subsidise sales to the poor.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The farm boxes have a wormery in their middle to compost household waste, which can then be used to fertilise the crops.

The work was tedious and difficult: every volunteer was required to register 200 children, but because some families were at work or out shopping or had simply moved away, the targets couldn\u2019t always be met.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Collince Oluoch\u2019s mobile platform helps improve the identification and registration of children targeted for life-saving vaccinations. Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering\n\nOluoch, 27, was faced with a choice: to invent names of children to meet the target (as many other health workers were doing), or to modify the existing pen-and-paper registration system into a digital database. He opted for the latter, and in 2016 built Chanjo Plus, an online vaccination platform that could be accessed by health clinics and hospitals across the country.\n\n\u201cThe initial plan was to have an accountable platform to put the faces behind the numbers,\u201d says Oluoch. \u201cWe have universal health coverage in Kenya and the aim is that by 2030 we will leave no one behind. But how do you leave no one behind if you don\u2019t even know who everyone is?\u201d\n\nThe database uses information compiled by community health workers to build a digital identity for each child, with details on which vaccinations were given and when and where they were given. These records can then be pulled up by any public health clinic anywhere, making it easy to identify which children are falling through the immunisation gaps and provide real-time data on vaccination drives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Across sub-Saharan Africa, one in five children still don\u2019t have access to life-saving vaccines. Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering\n\nChanjo Plus has so far enrolled 10,000 children at three clinics in Nairobi, and aims to scale up with the ministry of health to target the 1.5 million children born in Kenya every year, says Oluoch. He then hopes it can be a platform used across sub-Saharan Africa, where one in five children still don\u2019t have access to life-saving vaccines.\n\n\u201cPeople are still dying because of measles, polio, diarrhoea, and pneumonia \u2013 diseases that can be prevented and should not be causing deaths now. Getting every child access to vaccines translates into healthy lives for families: it means poverty reduction and greater access to education.\u201d\n\nKenya: Majik Water\n\nWhen Beth Koigi moved into her university dormitory in eastern Kenya, she was horrified that the water coming out of the tap was filthy and laden with bacteria. Within months, she had built her first filter and was soon selling filters to others. When drought hit in 2016 and water restrictions saw Koigi\u2019s water supply turned off entirely, she began thinking about water scarcity and its relation to climate change.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beth Koigi plans to use her Majik Water innovation to increase access to drinking water among low-income households. Photograph: Brett Eloff/Royal Academy of Engineering\n\n\u201cGoing for months without any tap water became a very bad situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere I used to live, we didn\u2019t get any tap water at all, so even doing simple things like going to the toilet \u2013 I would go to the mall instead. Having no water at all is worse than just having unpurified water, so I started thinking about a way to not have to rely on the council.\u201d\n\nWhile on a four-month programme at the Silicon Valley-based thinktank Singularity University, Koigi, 27, joined up with two other women \u2013 American environmental scientist Anastasia Kaschenko and British economist Clare Sewell \u2013 to create Majik Water, which captures water from the air and converts it into drinking water using solar technology.\n\nThe device \u2013 which won first prize this year at the EDF Africa awards \u2013 could provide a solution for the 1.8 billion people predicted to have a shortage of water by 2025, according to the UN, says Kaschenko.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an interesting relationship between climate change and the water in the atmosphere,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s six times more water in the air than in all the rivers in the world. With every 1F increase in temperature, water begins to evaporate on the ground but increases by about 4% in the atmosphere, and that\u2019s water that\u2019s not being tapped.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Majik Water system, which can generate up to 10 litres of filtered water a day.

Some two years later, their hopes were realized when a routine check of Mani\u2019s pouch found a newborn joey the size of a jelly bean.\n\nBefore poking its head out for the first time in early September, the joey spent about six months nursing and growing in Mani\u2019s pouch. During that time, the conservationists of Zoos Victoria were championing tree kangaroos on a whole other front\u2014by helping coffee farmers find profit in protecting the species\u2019 habitat.\n\nThe arrival of the joey, which is still unnamed, was a cause for rejoicing. It\u2019s the first successful birth at Healesville Sanctuary of the Goodfellow\u2019s tree kangaroo, one of the rarest among more than a dozen species of the animal found in parts of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Australia. The sanctuary and two zoos make up the Zoos Victoria organization, which works with like groups around the globe to ward off extinctions in the wild and also sustain species in captivity through breeding programs.\n\nGoodfellow\u2019s tree kangaroos have shorter legs and stronger forelimbs than their ground-hopping wallaby and kangaroo cousins. This anatomical trait gives them agility in the treetops but also makes them a bit clumsier than their cousins when they\u2019re on the ground. So being killed by hunters is one of the main threats they face in the wild, says Chris Banks, manager of conservation partnerships at Zoos Victoria. (See a baby kangaroo rescued from dead mother\u2019s pouch)\n\nA Caffeinated Conservation Strategy\n\nThe animals also are endangered by the loss of tropical forest habitat, Banks says. Zoos Victoria has partnered with the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program to help fight the loss of the animals in Papua New Guinea, using a strategy designed to help community members as well as wildlife. The program centers on a popular locally-grown beverage: coffee.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the land in the area is owned by the indigenous people. If they can thrive, Banks says, \u201cmore coffee farmers means more protected land and increased protection for populations of tree kangaroos, cassowaries, cuscus (a possum-like marsupial), and many other species.\u201d That\u2019s the inspiration behind the Conservation Coffee Project, which helps locals implement agriculture methods that preserve both wildlife habitat and the farmers\u2019 livelihood. \u201cBy generating a sustainable income for families,\u201d Banks says, the project also contributes to \u201cincreasing their food security and access to health and education services.\u201d\n\nThe project so far has resulted in more than 180,000 hectares of habitat being protected, and the establishment of a Conservation Coffee Cooperative with more than 600 farmers as members. Since 2011, Banks says, the effort has exported almost 90 tons of coffee beans\u2014a product that\u2019s on retail shelves at Zoos Victoria parks.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sc1Z6S0BIz0t1spJlbHKsqNx-gGDEtRu_W8PxeTVvc8.jpg"}, {"title": "Sadness is considered to be one of the basic human emotions and it is a natural response to situations involving psychological, emotional, and/or physical pain.", "score": 1, "url": "https://thezeroed.com/12-ways-to-pick-yourself-back-up/", "comments": 4, "date": "2019-1-1", "transcript": "It is very normal to feel sad or disappointed from time to time. It\u2019s all part of the human existence. The changes and rigors of day to day activity is bound to overwhelm us and bring us down. Various factors can cause us to feel sad \u2013 not reaching your set goals, a break up, loss of a loved one, even something as little as a spilled cup of milk can stir up emotions. Since this is constant in our lives, what then are the ways you can pick yourself back up?\n\nFirst not that feeling sad or disappointed can lead to depression. Depression leads a lot to procrastination. Procrastination leads to us postponing the important tasks we should be participating hence a reduction in productivity. This process continues to occur in a cycle, and you begin to feel like you can never be happy.\n\nHere are some the steps that have worked in helping me break this cycle and can also help you pick yourself back up:\n\nGet active and get out of your house\n\nThis is usually the first thing I do when I start feeling sad. Staying at home, just lying around doing nothing most of the time leaves me feeling depressed. My mind start to wander of the various possibilities \u2013 things I could have to have prevented myself from getting into the position I find myself and I end up getting more depressed. Staying at home can dampen your mood, you won\u2019t realize how much fresh air and sunlight would have on your mood until you step out.\n\nExercise\n\nWho wants to exercise when they are feeling sad or disappointed? You might not be in the mood to exercise, but doing it can help you pick yourself back up. It doesn\u2019t have to be something serious. You can go for a run or jog in the park, go to gym and run on a treadmill \u2013 the most important thing is that you are going out and doing something now. You don\u2019t need to engage in heavy exercise \u2013 just the simple act of moving your muscles and getting active can help uplift your mood.\n\nCreate a list\n\nOne of the causes of depression most of the time is that we get overwhelmed by the situation around us. Everything just seems too much for us to handle and we just break. You might be a fan of GTD, but sometimes the system might not seem to be working, maybe because you are not using a system suited for you or you just don\u2019t have the energy to do it. All these extra stuff you are supposed to be doing but not doing can be pretty overwhelming. It time to hit the refresh button.\n\nDon\u2019t think too much about it, just pick a pen and a paper, and make a list of all the important things that you need to do. The tasks could be anything \u2013 it can be things related to work, errands you to need to run for the homes, your goals that you want to reach, or even a combination of all these things. Making a list would help you put things into perspective. You know what you want to do and the exact time you need to be doing. The simple act of making a list can be a relief and get you closer in your bid to pick yourself back up.\n\nTake action\n\nYou just don\u2019t stop at making a list. You need to take action! Making a list won\u2019t stop you from feeling overwhelmed. On the contrary, if you make a list and do not work towards fulfilling the task on said list, your depression might graduate into becoming chronic. After writing your list, get started immediately. Is your first task a big one? Break it down into smaller pieces and start working on them. The first huddle is taking the first step. When you can cross the part, you would start to feel happier about yourself.\n\nI am not saying that your sadness or depression would be cured immediately. Remember that Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. Everything takes time. What I am sure is that once you\u2019ve started to get busy, you would start getting to your normal old self one task at a time.\n\nWhat is the point in sitting back feeling sorry for yourself when you get active and do something about it?\n\nTake care of your body\n\nI have watched a lot of romantic movies to know that after a sad event such as a breakup, the next thing to do would be to lie in your underwear all day, lick ice cream, cry and just be a dirty p**. While that might sound nice, laying all day in your bed all day won\u2019t do you any good. Avoiding your problems would not get them solved.\n\nOn the contrary, having a nice cool shower and grooming yourself does wonders in lifting up your mood. Instead of moping all day, brush your teeth, shave your beards, comb your hair, wear nice clean clothes and do the number 1 activity on this list \u2013 get the hell out of your house!\n\nListen to lively music\n\nMusic can do wonders for a sad soul. It can either uplift or depress you, depending on what you are looking. Since you are reading this article on how to pick yourself back up, the former is the case. Personally I love listening to pop or rap music. Find those songs that make you happy, crank it to the loudest volume, sing at the top of your voice, dance wildly \u2013 I am sure that do this would be improve your mood tremendously.\n\nFind someone to talk to\n\nEver heard the saying, \u201cA problem shared is a problem half solved\u201d. Well, this saying is very true. Find some to talk to. It could be anybody \u2013 a family member, a significant other or a good friend. A support group works fine also. You are probably not the first person going through your situation, finding someone to talk to can be very helpful.\n\nIn the instance where there is nobody you can talk to, you can make use of hotlines or the services of a professional. You can also join online forums. There is never a shortage of places where you can share your feelings. To pick yourself back up, you need to get rid of negative feelings. A hug from another individual can go a long way to making you feel happy.\n\nAnother beneficial reason to talking to another person that you get to see the problem from another person\u2019s point of view. You get to see something that you have been missing and get advice that could go a long way in helping you get yourself.\n\nRead books\n\nI have found that reading books can be a good way to distract you from your present situation. Some books also serves as a means of motivation or inspiration on how to solve your problems. Two books I enjoy reading when I start feeling down is \u201cThe 4-Hour WorkWeek\u201d by Timothy Ferris and \u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck \u2013 a counterintuitive approach to living a good life\u201d by Mark Manson. Reading these two books, always go a long way to help me feel good about myself. Any book that would help you feel better is worth a read.\n\nThere is no crime in crying\u2026 a little\n\nLaughter is the best medicine, I know. Crying can also be a good medicine when done in moderation. Somebody just asked now, isn\u2019t this article on how to pick yourself back up? You are right it is. You can get through a tough situation if you don\u2019t let yourself feel the emotions \u2013 frustration, anger, sadness, crying \u2013 that comes with it. If you don\u2019t let out that emotions, you might end up having a mental break down.\n\nI know that crying wouldn\u2019t solve your problem, but letting go a little would take you a step further to getting better. Trying not to cry in fact is counter-productive. It\u2019s okay to cry, not just too much. You don\u2019t want to spend your whole day crying and not get anything done. What I am advising here is that you let go a little bit so you can get yourself back.\n\nEat Healthy\n\nLike the romantic movie I mentioned earlier, guess what people eat when they are sad? A whole lot of unhealthy junk food. I have never seen anyone eating vegetables while crying in their week old underwear.\n\nWhen you do the opposite of eating unhealthy, your body would be eternally grateful. Grabbing healthy food or snacks \u2013 like vegetables, fruits, nuts would make you feel better. Not only would you feel better, you also provide with the nutrients it needs to function. Guess who is winning in both situations now? You!\n\nGet a pet\n\nHaving a pet can be highly therapeutic. Animals are very intuitive and can sense when you are feeling sad or depressed and try what they can to uplift your mood. Even if you don\u2019t have your own pet, you can try spending time with a friends pet or visit an animal shelter or zoo. Watching the animals can help you feel better.\n\nDo something exciting\n\nYou might be feeling sad or depressed, but one of the ways I have found out that you can use to pick yourself back up is by doing something exciting or spontaneous. Engaging in an exciting activity can help free you from negative thoughts. A good example of a spontaneous activity is going on a road trip, riding a bicycle to work, volunteering for community service and a lots more. The point is that you just add some excitement to your life.\n\nFollow Marvellous Aham-adi on Twitter\n\nwww.twitter.com/dikachi_", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Exceptional Facilities That You Can Expect in a Modern Hotel in Koh Samui", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.sooperarticles.com/travel-articles/hotels-lodging-articles/exceptional-facilities-you-can-expect-modern-hotel-koh-samui-1698730.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-1-1", "transcript": "With advanced information, you can go for choosing the best options.

They were, after all, abundant, completely free and believed to be unsinkable. Crazy as it sounded, the project was approved by British prime minister Winston Churchill himself.\n\nA prototype was built and tested at the lake over four months \u2014 and parts of it remain there, 50 feet below the surface. The ice has long melted, but Project Habbakuk still lives.\n\nStrategic material\n\nIn 1942, at a branch of the British War Office, an eccentric scientist named Geoffrey Pyke was trying to figure out how to protect Allied ships in the \u201cU-boat alley,\u201d an area of the Atlantic Ocean where Nazi submarines, out of the range of Allied warplanes, ruled the day. With building materials like steel in short supply, he thought, why not take a chunk of ice from the Arctic and tow it south to land planes on it?\n\nGerman U-boats being chased off the US coast in 1942. Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n\u201cPyke was a sort of holdover from the last Victorian boffins, someone we\u2019d never take seriously now because he didn\u2019t have multiple degrees. But he did have credibility,\u201d Susan Langley, a professor at St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland who\u2019s done doctoral research on the subject, said in a phone interview.\n\nAt the time, ice was considered almost indestructible: the International Ice Patrol, established to destroy icebergs after one had sunk the Titanic in 1912, had reported that blowing them up wasn\u2019t easy, even with torpedoes and incendiary bombs.\n\n\u201cPyke thought ice was the new strategic material that would win the war,\u201d Langley said. \u201cAnd Churchill was willing to entertain the idea.\u201d\n\nHe decided to call the ambitious design HMS Habbakuk, a misspelling of the name of prophet Habakkuk, who, in the Old Testament, wrote: \u201c\u2026be utterly amazed, for I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.\u201d\n\nThe largest warship ever\n\nBuilding a warship out of ice was just as hard as it sounds. \u201cOne problem was that if you wanted to launch aircraft off of something, it had to have 50 feet of freeboard above the water, but because icebergs are 90% submerged, that meant having almost 500 feet below the water,\u201d said Langley.\n\nSuch a vessel would be almost impossible to move. Also, when the tip of an iceberg melts, it makes it turn and roll, which would be a problem with aircraft trying to refuel on it. Finally, a flight deck of some other material was required for planes to land and take off.\n\n\u201cSo they decided to have a hull of ice, but build it like a conventional ship, which meant it had to be kept frozen through some kind of refrigeration system.\u201d\n\nThe proposed warship would be the largest ever built: 2,000 feet long and 200 feet wide \u2014 more than twice as big as the Titanic \u2014 with a weight of over 2 million tons and enough space for 300 aircraft. It would sail the seas at a speed of 7 knots (8 miles per hour) and withstand waves of 50 feet, giving Churchill his secret weapon against the U-boats.\n\nHe approved the project on Dec. 4, 1942 with a memo that was classified as \u201cMost secret,\u201d and asked for a prototype to be built.\n\n\u2018Mad wild schemes\u2019\n\nBritain now needed ice, so it turned to Canada for help. The experiment was assigned to the National Research Council, and the man in charge, C.J. MacKenzie, called the design \u201canother of those mad wild schemes.\u201d\n\nHe chose Lake Patricia in the Jasper National Park in Alberta as the test site due to the availability of an ironic source of free labor nearby: a camp of conscientious objectors. \u201cThey were never told what it was. They called it \u2018Noah\u2019s Ark.\u2019 They knew it was something for the war effort, but they didn\u2019t know what exactly,\u201d said Langley.\n\nIn early 1943, a 60-foot long prototype vessel was built with walls and floors of wood, tar, refrigeration pipes and a massive chunk of ice from the lake. \u201cIt was like a big shoe box, with a giant ice cube in the middle and the refrigeration piping running around it like a rib cage. Frozen into the middle of the ice was a smaller rectangle, where the refrigeration unit was,\u201d said Langley.\n\nA view of Patricia Lake, in the Jasper National Park, Canada. Credit: Education Images/Universal Images Group Editorial/UIG via Getty Images\n\nA roof was put on top of the structure to protect it from the elements and disguise it as a boat house.\n\nIt worked, but it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Some of the piping arrived damaged, so water couldn\u2019t be used for the cooling system and air was pumped through instead. There were doubts about the strength of the ice and the viability of the structure itself; although a better building material called \u201cpykrete\u201d (from Pyke and concrete) was developed around this time by adding wood pulp to the ice mix, it wasn\u2019t used in the prototype, and manufacturing it in the huge quantities needed for the Habbakuk seemed impractical.\n\nThree factors\n\nThe test had shown that the ice ship wasn\u2019t pure fantasy. But by mid-1943, the project started to sink.\n\nIts demise was a combination of three factors, according to Langley. First, Iceland could be used as a permanent base in the North Atlantic, which negated the need for floating aerodromes. Second, newer planes that could patrol for longer were introduced. And finally, the development of the centimetric radar helped track U-boats more accurately. The war was starting to turn in favor of the Allies.\n\n\u201cThose three things made it obsolete before it even reached fruition,\u201d said Langley. \u201cIt was viable, but not at the scale that Churchill wanted and as quickly as he wanted. It was feasible to build the structure, but impractical to actually implement it.\u201d\n\nA 1946 artist\u2019s impression of the proposed HMS Habbakuk. Credit: Illustrated London News Ltd/Mar\n\nIn June 1943, all testing in Canada was stopped and Churchill was informed.\n\nWhat\u2019s down there?\n\nOnce the project was abandoned, the refrigeration machinery was removed and the model was just left there, before subsiding into the lake. Although most people in the area had a rough idea of what had been going on, some mystique started to grow around it.\n\nLangley, who\u2019s also an underwater archeologist, overheard a conversation in 1982 about \u201can airplane made of ice\u201d that was still in Lake Patricia. \u201cI thought that was impossible, but I wanted to find out more.\u201d\n\nSo in 1984 she dived down to have a look. \u201cGood thing I had no idea what I was looking for, or I don\u2019t know what I would have thought, probably that a barge full of heating ducts or something had sunk. It was interesting, so I started getting grants to go back.\u201d\n\nA view of the wreckage in a 1984 underwater photo by Susan Langley. Credit: Susan Langley\n\nLangley summarized her research and multiple dives to the wreckage in a Ph.D dissertation, and is also writing a book. Her work has contributed to the rise of a small influx of divers visiting the area to see for themselves.\n\nThe wreckage sits on a diagonal, with the deepest corner at the 100-foot depth. It\u2019s not the easiest of dives, because the lake is at a 4000-foot altitude in the Rockies, so there\u2019s an increased risk of decompression sickness. Visibility is low and it\u2019s fairly dark all the time, not to mention an algae bloom in the summer. To help identify the wreckage, an underwater commemorative plaque was installed in 1988 in its proximity.\n\nA commemorative plaque sits underwater near the wreckage.

He was suffering from polycystic kidney disease \u2013 his kidneys were only functioning at about 4% \u2013 and he was facing a life on dialysis. The debilitating condition has no treatment and the only option is a kidney transplant.\n\nThe story stuck with McNeil, who went home and shared the heart-breaking tale with her husband, Justin McNeil. The story struck a chord with Justin, too, and he ultimately decided to donate a kidney to Villano. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ve got a kidney, you know, we could do this.

In Spain, that means that 26 coal mines are about to close up shop, according to Reuters.\n\nThis move away from coal is a refreshing bit of bluntness \u2014 letting the failed remnants of a fossil fuel industry fade away \u2014 compared to how the federal government in the U.S. is grasping at anything to keep coal alive. But it remains to be seen how much of an impact the coal closures will have in the ongoing effort to curb climate change.\n\nAlways a Bigger Fish\n\nThe deadline was set back in 2010 as the EU sought to move away from fossil fuel dependence, according to Telesur. The EU wanted to end public aid to coal mines sooner, but groups from Germany \u2014 which shuttered its last coal mine earlier this month \u2014 and Spain are responsible for extending the deadline all the way to the end of 2018.\n\nSpain has already decreased the portion of its electricity generated by coal down to about 14 percent, according to United Press International. And 90 percent of the coal burned in Spain is imported from Russia and Colombia anyway.\n\nStill, the deal that Spain struck with the EU dictates that nine of the 15 coal-burning plants in Spain must close by 2020, according to Telesur. That on its own is huge news for the transition to cleaner power, and marks a clear sign that major world powers are taking their responsibility to help prevent our impending climate change catastrophe seriously.\n\nThink Ahead\n\nOnce again in stark contrast to the U.S., where coal miners in Appalachia face a weak job market with few prospects, Spain\u2019s socialist government \u2014 largely supported by coal mining communities \u2014 made a deal with mining union in October to ensure that displaced workers will be taken care of, according to Reuters.\n\nAbout 60 percent of the people who worked in closing mines are expected to take advantage of an early retirement offer, while others have access to the 250 million euros that the government is making available to help launch new businesses or repurpose the land around the coal mines.\n\nThe headline of this story has been updated.\n\nREAD MORE: Spanish coal miners work last shifts before mines shuttered [Reuters]\n\nMore on coal: More Than 40 Percent of the World\u2019s Coal Plants Lose Money", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gMMb365CtUKgMXTT5cs5j_AlFjc3yFUFB4tuORukw_8.jpg"}, {"title": "\"Helium walks into a bar, The bar tender says \"We don't serve noble gasses in here.\" Helium doesn't react.\"", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/01/01/national/hydrogen-touted-clean-energy/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-1-1", "transcript": "As the world tackles global warming, hydrogen has gained attention as a clean-energy alternative to earth-polluting fossil fuels.\n\nSome hydrogen-powered cars and buses, which do not emit carbon dioxide, are already on public roads, and the government is hoping to display its technology by using hydrogen as a fuel for the Olympic torch and a power source for the athletes village for the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nHydrogen, which does not exist on Earth as a gas, has the advantage of being produced from various energy sources such as sunlight, biomass and petroleum. A large volume of hydrogen, when compressed, can be easily stored for long periods and transported over long distances. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity through chemical reaction with oxygen in the air, with water and heat as the only byproducts.\n\nIn September, the world\u2019s first passenger train powered by hydrogen fuel cells began operation in Germany.The zero-emission train, Coradia iLint, with a bright blue body painted with a motif of the chemical symbols H for hydrogen and O for oxygen, was developed by French rail manufacturer Alstom. \u201cThe emission-free drive technology of the Coradia iLint provides a climate-friendly alternative to conventional diesel trains, particularly on non-electrified lines,\u201d said Bernd Althusmann, Lower Saxony\u2019s minister of economy and transport, in a statement to celebrate the train\u2019s world debut a day before the launch of its commercial service.\n\nTwo of the hydrogen trains, capable of maximum speeds of 140 kilometers per hour, entered service in Lower Saxony, northwestern Germany. They produce very little noise and have no smell of exhaust or diesel, emitting only steam and condensed water, according to Alstom.\n\nCovering more than 40 percent of its total power generation with renewable energy sources, the state government decided to introduce the hydrogen-powered trains in anticipation of phasing out diesel trains within the next 30 years.\n\nIn Japan, the government adopted a basic hydrogen strategy in 2017, in consideration of the 2015 Paris climate accord obliging each signatory country to submit a progress report on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn the strategy to promote wider hydrogen use, Japan calls for global collaboration to lower costs and ensure stable supplies. In line with such policy, a range of verification tests of hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen stations have been conducted nationwide in efforts to make better use of the technology.\n\nStill reeling from the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima No.1 nuclear power plant, Fukushima Prefecture is pinning its hopes on one of the world\u2019s largest hydrogen-producing plants under construction there as a push toward its reconstruction efforts.\n\nOn a hill facing the Pacific, the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field is scheduled to start trial runs soon after its completion in October and launch operations in July 2020 after final confirmation tests in time for a plan to burn the Olympic torch during the Games with hydrogen produced in Fukushima.\n\nIt would be the first time for an Olympic torch to burn the environmentally friendly fuel.\n\nThe 10,000-kilowatt facility, sitting on grounds 10 times as large as the 47,000-square-meter Tokyo Dome, has many solar panels to generate electricity for producing up to 900 tons of hydrogen annually.\n\nThe site in the town of Namie, where the government\u2019s six-year evacuation order was lifted in March 2017, was planned for the construction of a nuclear power station by Tohoku Electric Power Co. The plan was abandoned due to the disaster and replaced by the hydrogen plant project.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to erase the negative image of the nuclear accident,\u201d a Namie town official said.\n\nHydrogen produced and stored at the facility will be used to power fuel cell vehicles and support factory operations. It will also be delivered to waterfront areas along Tokyo Bay by trailers for use as a power source at the Olympic athletes village.\n\nOther research is also taking place at a water purification plant in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, to incorporate hydrogen into renewable energy systems.\n\nAs part of projects by the state-run New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, the research involves a hybrid energy storage system, which makes hydrogen through the electrolysis of water using surplus electricity from solar power, to store the clean energy for future use.\n\nThe system is expected to make up for weaknesses in photovoltaic power generation, the output of which varies depending on the weather.\n\nIn the fall, Kyushu Electric Power Co. asked photovoltaic businesses to reduce their output for fear that the demand-and-supply balance might be disrupted due to surplus of electricity. Many of the businesses complied with the request.\n\n\u201cExcess electricity can be thrown away, but it can also be converted into hydrogen for long-term storage,\u201d said Makoto Tsuda, professor of electrical energy systems at Tohoku University. \u201cThe system will enhance the effective use of renewable energy,\u201d said Tsuda, who heads the ongoing research.\n\nElsewhere, the city of Fukuoka is carrying out a project to produce hydrogen with biogas extracted from sewage sludge. The produced hydrogen is used for fuel cell vehicles.\n\nMasaki Tajima, a research collaborator and professor of environmental energy at Tottori University of Environmental Studies, sees huge potential in utilizing sewage treatment plants.\n\n\u201cSewage treatment plants across the nation have the potential to power up to 1.86 million fuel cell vehicles with hydrogen,\u201d Tajima said.\n\nIn this regard, hydrogen has a promising future as a key player in using renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted and as a clean-energy source itself, emitting no greenhouse gases when used. But challenges remain for hydrogen energy, mainly in the high production cost, distribution and storage due to the current low use.\n\nProducing hydrogen from fossil fuels is the most common and least expensive method, but results in CO2 emissions. Therefore, this method requires an improvement in the technology to collect and store CO2. Another common method of producing hydrogen is through the electrolysis of water, using electricity from solar and wind power, along with other renewable energy sources. But zero-emission electrolysis is expensive.\n\nExperts say as an important energy carrier and a high-efficiency, pollution-free fuel, hydrogen requires further technology and infrastructure development to become more widely used in the future.\n\nDownload the PDF of this New Year Special", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-Ube2JUIQ_uDpW2MPUeRFLlb8V3oRlDjODn6NG_p8dk.jpg"}, {"title": "South Korea bans plastic bags at supermarkets", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/31/asia/south-korea-plastic-bag-ban-intl/index.html", "comments": 127, "date": "2019-1-1", "transcript": "(CNN) South Korea is joining a growing list of countries attempting to halt the use of disposable plastic shopping bags.\n\nMajor supermarkets will be banned from using plastic bags in an effort to conserve natural resources and manage recyclable waste, South Korea's Ministry of Environment said Monday.\n\nThe ban, which was introduced as part of an amendment to an existing law, comes into effect on Tuesday.

It is this celibacy that is cited by Hindu traditionalists as the reason women under 50 should not enter the temple. The fear is that the women could \u201ctempt\u201d the deity.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s head in Kerala, PS Sreedharan Pillai, called the visit \u201ca conspiracy by the atheist rulers to destroy the Hindu temples\u201d.

Here are the new details.\n\n\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d Season 5 might not be debuting on Netflix before the end of 2018, but it\u2019s become increasingly clear that \u201cBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u201d probably will, and it\u2019s most likely happening on December 28. What is \u201cBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u201d? A Netflix social media leak at the beginning of December suggested it could be the first episode of Seasn 5, but a new report from The Independent (via Esquire) reveals it\u2019s a \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d movie, which would be the first of its kind.\n\nWhile Netflix will not confirm \u201cBandersnatch,\u201d Esquire made note that an online Netflix page already exists for the title and labels it a \u201cNetflix film.\u201d Any Netflix subscriber can search for \u201cBandersnatch\u201d on the streaming platform and be directed to this landing page, which confirms it\u2019s not an episode but a film (see photo below). The leak at the start of the month said \u201cBandersnatch\u201d would drop December 28, which lines up with the end-of-the-year release of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d Season 4 in 2017. The landing page does not confirm December 28 but it does say 2018.\n\nPopular on IndieWire\n\nThe latest reported details on \u201cBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u201d are the most clear-cut yet. The movie\u2019s alleged official plot description reads: \u201cA young programmer makes a fantasy novel into a game. Soon, reality and virtual world are mixed and start to create confusion.\u201d That \u201cBandersnatch\u201d would be set in the world of video games lines up with recent fan theories, as \u201cBandersnatch\u201d was the name of a video game listed in the Season 3 episode \u201cPlaytest,\u201d directed by Dan Trachtenberg and starring Wyatt Russell. Additionally, \u201cBandersnatch\u201d was a video game developed in real life by Imagine Software in 1984, but it was never released to the public.\n\nNetflix/Screenshot\n\nIn addition to the plot description, The Independent reports \u201cBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u201d is directed by David Slade and stars \u201cDunkirk\u201d breakout Fionn Whitehead in the lead role. Slade is already a member of the \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d franchise, having directed the Season 4 episode \u201cMetalhead.\u201d Slade\u2019s film credits include \u201cHard Candy\u201d and \u201c30 Days of Nights,\u201d and he has also directed episodes of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cHannibal,\u201d and \u201cAmerican Gods.\u201d\n\nThe most interesting new detail is that \u201cBandersnatch\u201d reportedly has 312 minutes of footage, which is over five hours. A huge number like that would be ridiculously long for a feature film, but it would make sense given reports that \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is planning a choose-your-own adventure storyline.

And he's been fighting to end the illegal wildlife trade for more than 12 years. NBA all-star and Olympian Yao Ming is not just a WildAid ambassador, he's an integral part of WildAid's family and the conservation community.\n\nHear him speak, and you immediately begin to understand why Yao has been able to help convince a country of 1.4 billion people to stop buying ivory and galvanize support for China's domestic ban.\n\n\u201cWe don't need items to prove who we are; we should be more confident than that,\u201d Yao told Culture Express in 2018. \u201cWhen we reach into our pockets, there is a cost somewhere else.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been one year since the ban went into effect and ivory prices in China are at their lowest \u2014 $734.5 per kilogram. That\u2019s a drastic decline from $2,100 per kilogram in 2014. This downturn indicates less profit for traders and poachers, and fewer consumer purchases.\n\nElephants aren't the only animal to benefit from Yao's star power. Inspired by Jackie Chan's public awareness campaign for tigers, Yao wanted to curb consumption for shark fin soup. So he joined WildAid in 2006 and showed consumers how shark fin soup is made.\n\nA whopping 82 percent of respondents to a WildAid survey said they stopped consuming shark fin soup as a direct result of Yao's awareness campaign and prices and sales of shark fins in China declined by 50 to 70 percent.\n\n\u201cNow it's something almost shameful for young middle-class people to eat,\u201d Yao told The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nOver the years, WildAid's relationship with Yao has taken some unexpected but welcome turns. In 2017, he combined his passion for conservation with his other passion \u2013 wine \u2013 and launched a special release of Yao Family Wines' Napa Crest Red Wine.\n\nNow Yao has released three wines with a commemorative WildAid label that might look familiar.\n\nThe photograph of Yao walking with a baby elephant was taken by Kristian Schmidt in 2012 at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Nairobi. The elephant, named Kinango, was orphaned after his mother was butchered for her ivory tusks.\n\n\u201cWe all share this planet with each other and with these majestic animals,\u201d Yao said. \u201cWe all have a responsibility to do something to save Africa\u2019s elephants. We all have to do our part.\u201d\n\nThank you for doing your part, Yao. Let's cheers to another 12 years of working together to protect some of the world's most magnificent creatures.\n\nWant to do your part while enjoying a sumptuous glass of wine?

The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4 percent, a level where it had last been in June, a likely effect of the shutdown, according to the department. However, officials said federal workers generally were counted as employed during the period because they received pay during the survey week of Jan. 12. On balance, federal government employment actually rose by 1,000. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected payrolls to rise by 170,000 and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.9 percent.\n\nIn all, it was a powerful performance at a time when economists increasingly have said they expect growth to slow in 2019. January marked 100 months in a row of positive job creation, by far the longest streak on record. Stock futures and Treasury yields jumped in response to the better-than-expected report. The news was not all good, though, as data revisions pushed previous numbers lower. December's big initially reported gain of 312,000 was knocked all the way down to 222,000, while November's rose from 176,000 to 196,000. On net, that took the two months down by 70,000, bringing the three-month average to 241,000. That's still well above the trend that would be common this far into an economic expansion dating back 9\u00bd years. For the full year of 2018, the average monthly gain was 223,000.\n\n\"Certainly, the economy has slowed, and that will undoubtedly be apparent in other data in the coming weeks. Still, the jobs market remains a bright spot,\" Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said in a note. \"Employers are still hiring at a strong pace. That's good news for the consumer sector, and ultimately good news for the economy.\" A separate measure of unemployment that takes into account discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons jumped to 8.1 percent from 7.6 percent, with the January reading being around where it was in January 2018. Among individual groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics jumped to 4.9 percent from 4.4 percent in December. The rate for African-Americans rose to 6.8 percent from 6.6 percent while Asians saw a decline to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent.

It is reported by the regional public organization (ROO) \u201cSakhalin Environmental Watch\u201d on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court ordered the respondents and interested parties to submit their objections to the statement of claim before March 7, after which the date for its consideration will be set,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe defendants in the lawsuit are Rosprirodnadzor, the Ministry of Agriculture of Russia and the Federal Agency for Fishery. The interested parties are four commercial companies that caught animals for sale in foreign oceanariums (Afalina, DV Aquarium, White Whale and Sochi Dolphinarium), as well as the Primorsky Border Guard of the Federal Security Service of Russia, which organized an independent comprehensive expert assessment of the state of killer whales and beluga in January of this year.\n\nZoodefenders, according to the RPO, demand \u201cto recognize the inaction of Rosprirodnadzor as illegal, oblige it to free the killer whales and beluga whales from the illegal possession of commercial companies and to release them into their natural habitat.\u201d\n\nAmong the requirements is also to declare illegal a number of orders of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Federal Agency for Fisheries on the approval of the total allowable catch of killer whales and beluga whales in 2018, on the allocation of quotas for their catch and on the approval of plans for the implementation of fisheries for cultural and educational purposes.\n\n\u201cThree white whales disappeared from the adaptation center without a trace, and the condition of the killer whales deteriorated significantly, one of them is close to death. There are all legal grounds for returning animals to their natural habitat, but they not only continue to illegally be held in terrible conditions in captivity, but not a single state body has even filed a lawsuit about their release, \u201dthe RPO notes.\n\nZoodefenders state that for their numerous appeals the state structures of the issue of making decisions about the release of marine mammals \u201care carefully avoided.\u201d They report that \u201cin despair of getting practical action to release animals from the relevant state authorities,\u201d they decided to go to court themselves.\n\nAs reported, in 2018, 12 killer whales and 90 belugas were caught in the Sea of \u200b\u200bOkhotsk for sale to foreign dolphinariums and aquariums.\n\nAfter the intervention of the public, the active actions of the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the TFR revealed that the animals were caught with numerous violations of the law. The proceedings are being conducted in the framework of a criminal case initiated under part 3 of article 256 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal extraction of aquatic biological resources).\n\nInitially, the investigation was conducted by employees of the SSR Primorye SU, then they transferred the materials to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Khabarovsk Territory, and those to the regional SU of the TFR.\n\nIn December, three beluga whales disappeared from the enclosures, trappers claim that they swam away, environmentalists believe that the animals died. Experts who visited the whale prison in January reported that the animals look sick, one killer whale is not active at all. The water area where the enclosures are located is covered with ice, while staying in the ice is not typical for killer whales.\n\nSource: Maritime News of Russia", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Dog found after 9 years, already picking up where she left off", "score": 1, "url": "https://lbpost.com/news/after-9-years-long-beach-woman-is-reunited-with-lost-dog/", "comments": 2, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "When Suzanne Fierros received a message Tuesday morning saying her dog had been found, she texted her son to ask if the dogs had gotten out.

It was Sadie, the dog that disappeared in May 2010 that had turned up at the Long Beach Animal Shelter.\n\nThe 13-year-old Lhasa Apso escaped Fierros\u2019 backyard in Santa Fe Springs nearly a decade ago. Despite months of posting fliers, combing through shelters and websites, she was never found.\n\nAside from normal pain that comes with losing an animal, Sadie was not just any dog to Fierros; the dog had been a companion for her mother.

I\u2019ve been stressed and nervous. I could hardly sleep last night because I was so excited.\u201d\n\nShe called Animal Care Services early Wednesday morning to confirm that it was in fact Sadie that had been found. Then she made the trip to pick up her long-lost pup.\n\nShe said Sadie was scared and shaking while she was being held in the kennel, but she chalked that up to the chaotic atmosphere.\n\nThough Sadie didn\u2019t answer to her name, Fierros said that a fragment of memory must still exist because the reunion was so natural.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I picked her up she put her head on my shoulder which she always used to do,\u201d Fierros said. \u201cShe\u2019d always put her little head on my shoulder and kind of cuddle up against me.

More than 60% of those purchases were in the US, where PPAs to buy 8.5GW of power were signed, almost three times 2017\u2019s figure. However, there are signs that the sector is ready to expand rapidly in other markets as well.\n\nThe amount of power bought by companies puts them alongside utilities as the biggest buyers of clean electricity. This is a major change in the structure of the market, said Jonas Rooze, head of corporate sustainability for BNEF: \u201cCorporations have signed contracts to purchase over 32GW of clean power since 2008, an amount comparable to the generation capacity of the Netherlands, with 86% of this activity coming since 2015 and more than 40% in 2018 alone.\u201d\n\nFacebook was by far the biggest individual buyer, procuring 2.6GW of capacity, more than three times the amount purchased by the next biggest company, AT&T. Tech companies use a huge amount of power to run their data centres, which is why they are the biggest purchasers of clean energy and have made the running in the corporate procurement sector.\n\nFor the first time, an oil major signed a clean energy PPA for its own operations, buying 575MW of solar and wind in Texas.\n\nAnother notable development has been the emergence of smaller energy buyers aggregating their energy demands to enable them to sign PPAs with large clean energy projects \u2013 these buyers made up 31% of US demand. These firms are aggregating their electricity demand to reap the economies of scale from larger solar and wind projects. In many cases, they benefit from partnering with a bigger, more experienced buyer \u2013 known as an anchor tenant \u2013 who can offer a stronger balance sheet and expertise on accounting and legal nuances when signing a PPA.\n\nKyle Harrison, a corporate sustainability analyst for BNEF and lead author of the report, said: \u201cThe aggregation model has heralded in a new generation of corporate clean energy buyers. These companies no longer need to tackle the complexities of clean energy procurement alone. They can share risks associated with credit and energy market volatility with their peers.\u201d\n\nThere were also record volumes in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, with corporations doubling their clean energy purchases from 2017\u2019s 1.1GW to 2.3GW. The Nordics were once again the hot spot for activity, with companies attracted to strong wind resources and credit support from government bodies, BNEF said. Aluminium producers Norsk Hydro and Alcoa were the biggest buyers in Europe in 2018, but the region also saw activity from the tech giants Facebook, Amazon and Google.\n\nThe first corporate PPAs were signed in Poland, while Finland and Denmark saw their second deals during the year, with activity also picking up in the UK after a lull caused by the demise of a national subsidy programme, as well as in Mexico and Brazil. Policy changes in Germany and France saw several requests for proposals that suggest these could be significant markets in 2019.\n\nAsia Pacific is still a largely undeveloped market. Companies signed a record 2GW of PPAs but almost all of that came in India (1.3GW) and Australia (0.7GW) as these are the only markets that currently allow companies to buy power direct from generators.\n\nHowever, there are signs of reform that suggest the region will join the party soon. Nine provinces in China now have offsite corporate PPA mechanisms and the imminent passing of a renewable portfolio standard will give over 30,000 large commercial and industrial companies renewable electricity targets. Meanwhile, Japanese companies bought 21TWh of power in the country\u2019s third non-fossil certificate auction, three times the amount of power bought in the first two auctions combined. Thirteen companies in Japan have also established 100% renewable electricity targets, more than the rest of the region put together.\n\nIt is targets such as these, through initiatives such as RE100, that are driving the market. Almost 160 of the world\u2019s largest companies, in 23 different countries, have signed commitments through RE100 to procure 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. BNEF calculates that for these companies to meet their targets, they will have to buy 190TWh of electricity in 2030, requiring more than 100GW of new solar and wind capacity.\n\nRooze said: \"For companies that think seriously about sustainable growth, establishing clean energy and decarbonization targets lines up naturally with overall corporate strategies.

He was joined at a news conference at the library by several member of his staff, the mayor and other city leaders.\n\nThe Denver Public Library offers what it calls Plaza programming at a dozen branches where people from all over the world can get guidance and resources.

Public health officials in Georgia confirmed this week that three members of an unvaccinated family had fallen ill with the potentially deadly virus.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. saw the second-highest rates of measles since the disease was eliminated in 2000 (including in New York), partly due to parents not getting their children immunized.\n\nThe issue is not isolated to the U.S. Last month, the World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy as one of the biggest global health threats of 2019, and revealed late last year that reported measles cases in 2017 shot up in all the globe's regions due to breaks in vaccine coverage. Meanwhile, diseases such as polio continue to strike unvaccinated children in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n\"Since 2000, over 21 million lives have been saved through measles immunizations. However, reported cases increased by more than 30 percent worldwide from 2016,\" the WHO said in November 2018.\n\nThe myth that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot is dangerous, while measles is relatively harmless, has contributed to vaccine hesitancy.\n\nIn recent weeks, unvaccinated young people have turned to the internet for advice on getting immunized, worried that they too may fall ill.\n\nOne Reddit user called pzeolla, who said they were 15 years old and living in New York City, wrote: \"i never really thought about my parents not vaccinating me but now i have been doing some research about them and i dont really think they are harmful and i want to get a vaccine. Any advice on what to do?\"\n\nPuffPuffer, apparently a teenager in Washington, confided last week that their mother was \"against vaccines\" and asked, \"What are my options?\"\n\n\"I, as well as my siblings, hold the ideology that vaccines are a public health issue, and a personal responsibility to the benefit of the population, not a right you can revoke from your children,\" PuffPuffer wrote. \"Being a minor, I don't see a way for me to take my health into my own hands.\"\n\nAnother user, Kazabar, claimed in a post on Thursday that they are 13 years old with an \"anti vaxxer,\" mother. \"I was hoping i could get help or scientific proof to try and explain to my mom that i should get vaccinated,\" Kazabar wrote.\n\nUsers pointed out that minors are allowed to consent to vaccinations in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.\n\nDr. Litjen Tan, chief strategy officer at the Immunization Action Coalition, told Newsweek, \"The number of outbreaks and cases are worrying. The United States has school-entry vaccination requirements that vary from state to state. But these entry requirements have really helped maintain immunization coverage levels.\n\n\"Where outbreaks tend to happen is where we either have pockets of need [where access sometimes hinder vaccination] or where there are pockets of vaccine hesitancy.

PETERSBURG \u2014 You can't type \"tiny town\" into your phone's GPS app, or see it from the street driving through the confusing, industrial neighborhood where it hides. Instead, look for a patchwork fence of rusted sheet metal with the word \"Painter\" splashed across.\n\nYou can't call ahead because Dan Painter doesn't have a phone, but if you pound long enough, Jojo the boxer will start to bark and eventually the affable mayor might come to the door.\n\nIt can take so long that people think they're in the wrong place.\n\nTaylor Labuda went looking for the town with her boyfriend. They stood banging the door knocker made from an old wrench for 20 minutes before a big guy came to the door in his boxer shorts.\n\n\"Oh, hi,\" he said. \"Come on in.\"\n\n\"We ended up being there for hours,\" Labuda said. \"It's amazing. He told us his whole life story.\"\n\nThe first thing you see when visiting Tiny Town is WTNT, Tiny Town's tiny radio station with the see-through broadcast booth big enough for one person.\n\nThen you see the barbershop with classic barber pole, the seafood restaurant where Dan had just cooked breakfast and the Sailfish Pier fishing pier, which has a boardwalk that's the perfect size stage for a band.\n\nThe body of an old Ford is permanently parked at the drive-in movie theater. The last movie to screen was Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.\n\nNext door to that is Dan's Rattle and Crank, Tiny Town's auto shop. Then the Flamingo Motel. It has just one room with a twin bed, but there is a swimming pool.\n\n\"The pool is only for motel guests, of course, and closes at 10 p.m. sharp,\" Painter said. \"Just kidding, I'm in that thing like five times a day.\"\n\nThat's across from the single-pump gas station, and the Asian bathhouse, with functional shower. Tiny Town's trailer park is currently under construction. Keep in mind this is all on less than an acre, a lot less, though Painter isn't sure exactly how big the property is.\n\nPainter spent five years building his tiny fiefdom. It's immersive, detailed and tropically colorful. It definitely has an Old Florida vibe.\n\n\"I think maybe we were founded in the 1950s, but the time we're in now is the '70s. You know, it's that feeling when things are starting to get just a little wear on them.\"\n\n\"It's like you're somewhere else in an Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz way, where the world is kind of the same, but different,\" said Vince Pompei, a sculptor whose Pinellas Park gallery is called Monster Factory. \"When you're in there you feel like he found it all, but he built it all.\"\n\nIn reality, both are true. Painter built everything, but from found materials or scraps that were donated to him. He salvaged all the paint from the dump.\n\n\"My friends dubbed it leftover St. Pete,\" he said. \"When houses and stuff gets bulldozed or knocked down, they drop off the materials. I've just got to pull the nails and cut it up.\"\n\nSure enough, out front near the sidewalk was a big stack of white boards. He wasn't sure who'd left them.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nEvery building in Tiny Town represents a piece of Painter's life. An era, a job, a childhood memory.\n\nIn the back of the lot is the Officer's Club, a nod to his \"dads,\" father and stepfather, who were in the military.\n\nPainter, 56, wanted to be a Navy pilot. Wore a crew cut for years as a young man, got into the Navy's Aviation Officer Candidate School, but his eyes weren't good enough to fly. Plan B? Artist.\n\nHe has been called the Sasquatch of the St. Petersburg art scene. He's known as an artist's artist.\n\n\"He's been around forever, but it's always a rare sighting when you see Dan Painter,\" said muralist Derek Donnelly. \"It's, 'Oh my god, there he is.' \"\n\nThere was a little evidence of him around the city, like those eye-catching sculptures of horned, humanoid creatures mounted like hunting trophies in the now-defunct Amsterdam bar, but they didn't even have his name on them. A friend, he said, was basically just storing them there for him.\n\nHe had another art studio in the Warehouse Arts District, years before someone got the idea to promote the rough industrial neighborhood with that aspirational name. But his large-scale sculptures, like a galloping Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse that incorporated real horse skeletons, did not fit in neatly with the kind of stuff tourists buy to stick in their bathroom.\n\nHe has never shown his artwork. Never been in a gallery or taken part in a sidewalk art festival. He preferred to swing a hammer as a carpenter to make money, which meant he could make art to keep it or to give it away, which is how he prefers it.\n\nThere's something to be said for his lifestyle, said Gordon Rothwell, a friend and fraternity brother at Florida Southern College, now a lawyer in St. Petersburg.\n\n\"We had another fraternity brother of ours who tried to help him sell his artwork, but Dan wasn't going to bend. He'd paint the side of a circus tent with these amazing characters like a frog man and a bearded lady, 20 feet high, and the guy would say, 'Dan, paint something we can sell,' but that just wasn't part of it for him. If you had a house that could hold something that big, fine, but if not, oh well. ... He stayed true to himself and his belief and vision.\"\n\nPainter said he has been homeless twice, once in South Florida and another time when he was stranded for two years in the Ozark Mountains.\n\nHe looks like a burlier version of Jeff Bridges' \"The Dude\" from The Big Lebowski, and certainly has carefree, easy, dude-ness.\n\nSipping his black iced coffee from a mason jar, he said his foremost desire in life is to finish his projects, like Tiny Town, and his primary joy comes from working on them. Outside of that, it's about having a few beers at the end of the day and watching Jeopardy! outdoors with the friends who stop by.\n\nThe Tiny Town property, on Emerson Avenue S and not far from the Duncan McClellan Gallery, was nothing but a dirt lot without water or electricity. A lot of Painter's possessions were destroyed by the rain \u2014 a \"great purging,\" he calls it. He didn't work paid jobs, just worked full time on the town.\n\nHe has no money to speak of, but it doesn't feel accurate to call him broke.\n\n\"To actually live with no money and do it well is absolutely wonderful. You can feel very peaceful and content when you have no debt.\"\n\nFriends bring him clothes. Strangers who visit the town \u2014 there have only been about a dozen so far \u2014 have sometimes given him a few bucks for a burger, or some chlorine for the motel pool, but he said he'd never ask anyone to pay for a tour.\n\nThat doesn't mean he wouldn't like to make some money. Tiny Town used to have a hardware store, but that has since been sold and installed in a backyard in Tampa. He'd be happy to do the same with some of the other buildings, but avoids naming a specific price.\n\n\"It's a really wide range. If you're an a- -, you can't have one of my pieces. And if I can tell someone really loves a piece, we can work something out.\"\n\nHe also has plans to rent the place as an events venue. Corporate parties at Tiny Town? Weddings at Tiny Town? Sure, why not.\n\nMost fulfilling though, he said, will be if people finally see and enjoy it. He'd be happy to have you stop by.\n\nContact Christopher Spata at cspata@tampabay.com or follow @spatatimes on Twitter.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zSheFqrI8da2A7QDdD6Vo9s7QYkCIIcUjKqx5P_OuM8.jpg"}, {"title": "After one woman saved Chicago's homeless from the cold, an army of strangers followed her lead", "score": 1, "url": "https://us.cnn.com/2019/02/01/us/chicago-volunteer-homeless-cold-trnd/index.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "(CNN) A single act of generosity was multiplied again and again this week after a Good Samaritan paid for hotel rooms to shelter homeless Chicagoans from a historic and potentially deadly cold snap.\n\nDonations of transportation, food and money flooded in after strangers learned that real estate developer Candice Payne had booked 20 hotel rooms at the Amber Inn motel.\n\n\"I had strangers from social media who are now lifelong friends helping me,\" she told CNN.\n\nSoon, the improvised group had booked 60 rooms for more than 100 people, including children and families, Payne said.\n\n\"I have people dropping by daily to help who have seen the story on Instagram,\" she said. \"They have volunteered money and time and cars because we had to get them to the hotel.\"\n\nRead More", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "This person potentially saved dozens of lives", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.wfaa.com/mobile/article/life/heartwarming/report-mystery-person-pays-hotel-bill-for-70-homeless-people-during-record-freeze/285-2872efba-d83c-4e5f-af2a-af280a4fb75e", "comments": 2, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "As Chicago dropped into a deep freeze, a generous citizen stepped up.\n\n----\n\nAn anonymous good Samaritan picked up the hotel tab for dozens of homeless people during the big freeze in the Midwest, reports the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe city was gripped by temperatures as low as -25 degrees Fahrenheit early Wednesday, setting the record for the second coldest day ever in Chicago\u2019s recorded history.\n\nAs the cold gripped the city, Chicago officials took away a homeless camp\u2019s propane tanks after one of them reportedly exploded.

Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute . \u201cWith today\u2019s study, we have a potential way to restore that power. We\u2019ve shown that, with the right technology, these people\u2019s thoughts could be decoded and understood by any listener.\u201d\n\nIn a scientific first, Columbia neuroengineers have created a system that translates thought into intelligible, recognizable speech. By monitoring someone\u2019s brain activity, the technology can reconstruct the words a person hears with unprecedented clarity. This breakthrough, which harnesses the power of speech synthesizers and artificial intelligence, could lead to new ways for computers to communicate directly with the brain. It also lays the groundwork for helping people who cannot speak, such as those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or recovering from stroke, regain their ability to communicate with the outside world.\n\nDecades of research has shown that when people speak \u2014 or even imagine speaking \u2014 telltale patterns of activity appear in their brain. Distinct (but recognizable) patterns of signals also emerge when we listen to someone speak, or imagine listening. Experts, trying to record and decode these patterns, see a future in which thoughts need not remain hidden inside the brain \u2014 but instead could be translated into verbal speech at will.\n\nBut accomplishing this feat has proven challenging. Early efforts to decode brain signals by Dr. Mesgarani and others focused on simple computer models that analyzed spectrograms, which are visual representations of sound frequencies.\n\nBut because this approach has failed to produce anything resembling intelligible speech, Dr. Mesgarani and his team, including the paper's first author Hassan Akbari, turned instead to a vocoder, a computer algorithm that can synthesize speech after being trained on recordings of people talking.\n\n\u201cThis is the same technology used by Amazon Echo and Apple Siri to give verbal responses to our questions,\u201d said Dr. Mesgarani, who is also an associate professor of electrical engineering at Columbia Engineering.\n\nTo teach the vocoder to interpret to brain activity, Dr. Mesgarani teamed up with Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon at Northwell Health Physician Partners Neuroscience Institute and co-author of today\u2019s paper. Dr. Mehta treats epilepsy patients, some of whom must undergo regular surgeries.\n\n\u201cWorking with Dr. Mehta, we asked epilepsy patients already undergoing brain surgery to listen to sentences spoken by different people, while we measured patterns of brain activity,\u201d said Dr. Mesgarani. \u201cThese neural patterns trained the vocoder.\u201d\n\nNext, the researchers asked those same patients to listen to speakers reciting digits between 0 to 9, while recording brain signals that could then be run through the vocoder. The sound produced by the vocoder in response to those signals was analyzed and cleaned up by neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence that mimics the structure of neurons in the biological brain.\n\nAbove: representation of researchers' new approach to audio reconstruction that uses a vocoder and deep neural network model.\n\nThe end result was a robotic-sounding voice reciting a sequence of numbers. To test the accuracy of the recording, Dr. Mesgarani and his team tasked individuals to listen to the recording and report what they heard.\n\n\u201cWe found that people could understand and repeat the sounds about 75% of the time, which is well above and beyond any previous attempts,\u201d said Dr. Mesgarani. The improvement in intelligibility was especially evident when comparing the new recordings to the earlier, spectrogram-based attempts. \u201cThe sensitive vocoder and powerful neural networks represented the sounds the patients had originally listened to with surprising accuracy.\u201d\n\nDr. Mesgarani and his team plan to test more complicated words and sentences next, and they want to run the same tests on brain signals emitted when a person speaks or imagines speaking. Ultimately, they hope their system could be part of an implant, similar to those worn by some epilepsy patients, that translates the wearer\u2019s thoughts directly into words.\n\n\u201cIn this scenario, if the wearer thinks \u2018I need a glass of water,\u2019 our system could take the brain signals generated by that thought, and turn them into synthesized, verbal speech,\u201d said Dr. Mesgarani. \u201cThis would be a game changer. It would give anyone who has lost their ability to speak, whether through injury or disease, the renewed chance to connect to the world around them.\u201d\n\n###\n\nThis paper is titled \u201cTowards reconstructing intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex.\u201d Additional contributors include Bahar Khalighinejad and Jose L.

In return, CCA helped the villages build six primary schools, where there were none nearby, and a Crafts for Conservation program that\u2019s created a market for jewelry and other products crafted by the Mro women.\n\nThe Mro parabiologists monitor hunting and consumption of wild animals within these villages. If a parabiologist finds a turtle in a village home, he recovers the animal, takes its measurements, gives it an ID, and releases it back into the forest.\n\nMenrua Mro, a 21-year-old parabiologist, who lives in Dangli Para village in Bandarban district, is one such turtle and tortoise guardian. Menrua had seen Rahman since the researcher started visiting his village in 2011, he told Mongabay. But, like most other parabiologists in his team, he started working with CCA only after his neighbor, Passing Mro introduced him to Rahman in 2016.\n\nAt the time, Menrua had been unhappy working on a farm, and was \u201clooking for something else to do,\u201d he said. So training as a parabiologist seemed like a better option. Menrua now goes from one village to another trying to dissuade people from eating or harming rare animals and birds like tortoises and hornbills.\n\n\u201cWhat I like best about this work is that I get to make new friends all the time from different villages and even in Dhaka and from other parts of Bangladesh,\u201d Menrua said. \u201cWith the money I got through the work I was also able to pay back the debt my father had.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Mro men have rescued and released more than 100 highly threatened turtles and tortoises into the wild \u2014 21 of them in 2018 alone. In fact, Rahman\u2019s team estimates that the hunting of these reptiles has declined by at least 50 percent in the area they\u2019ve covered. They have also established the first in-country, captive breeding colonies of Arakan forest turtle and Asian giant tortoise to help secure the reptiles\u2019 future.\n\nIn general, though, wildlife populations seem to have declined in the area, Rahman said, and the local people likely don\u2019t find enough wild animals to hunt. Moreover, turtles and tortoises provide very little meat, so the Mro people have come to rely more on crabs and fish for their protein.\n\nApart from keeping an eye on turtles, some parabiologists act as protectors of nests of threatened great hornbills (Buceros bicornis). Some of the more senior parabiologists serve as community leaders, acting as a bridge between the research team and the rest of the Mro people. Others help with the plant nursery that\u2019s been established to cultivate both bamboo to reduce the communities\u2019 dependence on the forest for wood and rare native plants to help future reforestation efforts.\n\nThe researchers now work with 10 male parabiologists who each receive a monthly salary of about $100. They have upgraded to smartphones now to help with their monitoring work.\n\n\u201cThey take pictures and send me photos and all other evidences by Messenger \u2014 who is cutting trees, which hornbill is nesting where, and so on,\u201d Rahman said.\n\nThe Mro parabiologists have become so critical to the researchers\u2019 work that they are regularly listed as formal co-authors of scientific papers.\n\n\u201cAs scientists, we often have this ego that we know everything, but I can have five Ph.D.s and still never have the knowledge that these people have,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cThese people read the forest like pages in a book. You show them a picture of a bird, and they would tell you about when it breeds, when its mating season is, which tree it nests in, where it nests, what its call sounds like.\n\n\u201cA lot of information that we collect and publish wouldn\u2019t happen without them,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile this authorship may not matter to them at all, I think this is the respect they deserve.\u201d\n\nSometimes, the Mro men end up surprised by the status of their own forests. For example, Proroy Mro, who co-authored a 2017 study looking at pangolin distribution in the CHT region, told Mongabay last year that whereas he used to think Bangladesh harbored lots of pangolins, the surveys showed him how few there actually are, and that he felt lucky to have so many near his village in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n\nThe Mro-CCA partnership has earned Rahman several laurels, including, most recently, the 2018 Whitley Award, dubbed the \u201cgreen Oscars.\u201d\n\nM. Monirul H. Khan, a professor of zoology at Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka, said the Mro people had access to the deepest parts of the CHT, where the remaining forests and valuable wildlife occur, and they were the key to conserving whatever is left there. By gaining their confidence and partnering with them, CCA had \u201cmade a major breakthrough,\u201d especially since no other organization had been able to develop such a mutual partnership, Khan added. \u201cThe Mro people live with the forests and wildlife of the CHT and their role is critical for any successful conservation initiative,\u201d he said.\n\nRahman\u2019s group has had less success partnering with the local branch of the Forest Department, though.\n\n\u201cThey work separately, don\u2019t communicate or share information with us, and don\u2019t maintain good relations with us,\u201d said S.M. Golam Mowla, a forest officer with the Chittagong division of the department. \u201cThey take permission from the Dhaka office, not from us, despite their site falling within the jurisdiction of Chittagong. If we worked together, we could jointly visit the area, we could help them with our local staff.\u201d\n\nRahman acknowledged there was a lack of coordination between his conservation group and the local forest department. The Sangu-Matamuhuri Reserve Forest within the CHT region, where Rahman\u2019s CCA team works, officially falls under the jurisdiction of the forest department. But the department has little actual authority over the area, Rahman said, primarily because of the complex political landscape, including local armed conflict.\n\n\u201cIt is not their fault. It is because the area is remote, it is not safe, and they don\u2019t have adequate resources,\u201d Rahman said of the department. \u201cIf the forest department could find mechanisms to increase their presence there, the gap in communication will decrease and it would help us tremendously, and we could help them in return.\u201d\n\nKhan of Jahangirnagar University agreed that working in remote parts of the CHT was \u201cextremely difficult, and there was very little or no presence of government officials in some areas.\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/V2bpVbDbnaQZ8m8RaP6Kzgle6svyhWxFCxxado7LLFk.jpg"}, {"title": "Chicago woman booked hotel rooms to help homeless escape cold", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/video/candice-payne-homeless-in-chicago-hotel-rooms/", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "A Chicago woman's act of kindness helped homeless people stay warm during this week's dangerous polar vortex.

Det er et stort l\u00f8ft, sier hun.\n\nTallene Berg viser til, kommer frem i estimater over hvor mange mennesker i Oslo som bodde i et omr\u00e5de med farlig luft i 2014 sammenlignet med estimater for 2018. Disse estimatene er noe annet enn m\u00e5ledataene som viser niv\u00e5er under grenseverdiene.\n\nDen store nedgangen kommer fram om man sammenligner beregninger over antall Oslo-beboere som bodde i farlig luft i fra 2014 i tiltaksutredningen, med estimater over antall som bodde i omr\u00e5der med d\u00e5rlig luftkvalitet i 2018.\n\nEstimatene er usikre, og verdiene for 2018 er basert p\u00e5 beregninger gjort i 2016.\n\nDe rundt 10.000 menneskene i Oslo som if\u00f8lge estimatene for 2018 fortsatt ikke har god nok luftkvalitet, bor n\u00e6r sv\u00e6rt trafikkerte veier eller i sentrum, if\u00f8lge Bymilj\u00f8etaten.\n\n\u2013 Det viktigste vi gj\u00f8r er \u00e5 innf\u00f8re tiltak som funker. Det er det vi har gjort siden 2015, sier Berg.\n\nTiltaksutredningen gir ogs\u00e5 en framskrivning av luftkvaliteten som sier at i underkant av 10.000 personer vil v\u00e6re utsatt for farlig svevest\u00f8v i 2020. Men de m\u00e5lte svevest\u00f8v-verdiene i fjor var enda lavere enn det som er beregnet for 2020.\n\n- Gode nyheter, sier byr\u00e5d Lan Marie Berg.

Joss Greene is a Ph.D. candidate in the sociology department at Columbia University. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n\n(CNN) The Trump administration is considering a policy that is arguably the most significant federal attack on civil and political rights in at least a generation, one which, the New York Times reports, would define 1.4 million transgender Americans \"out of existence.\" The Department of Health and Human Services is leading an effort to legally define gender under Title IX as a \"biological, immutable condition, determined by genitalia at birth,\" removing federal recognition and thereby rights and protections for those who identify as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth.\n\nJoss Greene\n\nThis proposed policy -- along with a recent proposed ban on transgender individuals serving in the US military -- stands in stark contrast to the pride many Americans have expressed over the country's perceived world leadership on issues of LGBT rights. And yet the Trump administration's attempts to erase the humanity of transgender people serves to pull back the curtain on the long history of Western myopia, wherein we mistakenly imagine ourselves as the primary and leading source of freedom around the world.\n\nThe truth is other countries are several steps ahead of us. In 2004, England passed the Gender Recognition Act to allow transgender people to change their legal gender. England was followed by Spain in 2007 and Uruguay in 2009. In 2012, Argentina passed what the New Yorker's Jonathan Blitzer dubbed \"the most progressive gender-identity law in the world,\" allowing individuals to change their name or gender in public registries without a doctor or judge's approval and guaranteeing free access to hormones and gender-reassignment surgery. And, in 2015, Colombia passed a similar law that allowed citizens to change their legal name and gender marker by simply appearing before a notary public.\n\nBut European and Latin American countries aren't the only ones extending legal rights to transgender individuals. Just consider Pakistan, a country strongly influenced by its Islamic tradition. Last spring, its legislature passed the \"Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act.\" In doing so, Pakistan affirmed that it must respect \"a person's innermost and individual sense of self as male, female or a blend of both, or neither; that can correspond or not to the sex assigned at birth.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Supreme Court hands Trump win on transgender ban, defeat on DACA Replay More Videos ...

What's more, the Pakistani government will be required to provide protection centers and safe houses for those who feel at risk, and trans citizens will have the right to inheritance, to run for office and to assembly.\n\nRead More", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "The Bangladeshi tribe that\u2019s guarding turtles, co-authoring research papers", "score": 1, "url": "https://news.mongabay.com/2018/11/the-bangladeshi-tribe-thats-guarding-turtles-co-authoring-research-papers/?fbclid=IwAR1PaCPOkWmYrOAKnAUeewEmyOlKKppOyuesFAie656TvG3x9mcCfzuua5I", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "Becoming conservation leaders\n\nToday, the Mro parabiologists do much more than document the biodiversity of their ancestral forests for Western science.\n\nTo reduce hunting of turtles in the region, the CCA team has entered into a conservation agreement with six villages, establishing hunting moratoriums on highly threatened turtles and tortoises and other rare animals. In return, CCA helped the villages build six primary schools, where there were none nearby, and a Crafts for Conservation program that\u2019s created a market for jewelry and other products crafted by the Mro women.\n\nThe Mro parabiologists monitor hunting and consumption of wild animals within these villages. If a parabiologist finds a turtle in a village home, he recovers the animal, takes its measurements, gives it an ID, and releases it back into the forest.\n\nMenrua Mro, a 21-year-old parabiologist, who lives in Dangli Para village in Bandarban district, is one such turtle and tortoise guardian. Menrua had seen Rahman since the researcher started visiting his village in 2011, he told Mongabay. But, like most other parabiologists in his team, he started working with CCA only after his neighbor, Passing Mro introduced him to Rahman in 2016.\n\nAt the time, Menrua had been unhappy working on a farm, and was \u201clooking for something else to do,\u201d he said. So training as a parabiologist seemed like a better option. Menrua now goes from one village to another trying to dissuade people from eating or harming rare animals and birds like tortoises and hornbills.\n\n\u201cWhat I like best about this work is that I get to make new friends all the time from different villages and even in Dhaka and from other parts of Bangladesh,\u201d Menrua said. \u201cWith the money I got through the work I was also able to pay back the debt my father had.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Mro men have rescued and released more than 100 highly threatened turtles and tortoises into the wild \u2014 21 of them in 2018 alone. In fact, Rahman\u2019s team estimates that the hunting of these reptiles has declined by at least 50 percent in the area they\u2019ve covered. They have also established the first in-country, captive breeding colonies of Arakan forest turtle and Asian giant tortoise to help secure the reptiles\u2019 future.\n\nIn general, though, wildlife populations seem to have declined in the area, Rahman said, and the local people likely don\u2019t find enough wild animals to hunt. Moreover, turtles and tortoises provide very little meat, so the Mro people have come to rely more on crabs and fish for their protein.\n\nApart from keeping an eye on turtles, some parabiologists act as protectors of nests of threatened great hornbills (Buceros bicornis). Some of the more senior parabiologists serve as community leaders, acting as a bridge between the research team and the rest of the Mro people. Others help with the plant nursery that\u2019s been established to cultivate both bamboo to reduce the communities\u2019 dependence on the forest for wood and rare native plants to help future reforestation efforts.\n\nThe researchers now work with 10 male parabiologists who each receive a monthly salary of about $100. They have upgraded to smartphones now to help with their monitoring work.\n\n\u201cThey take pictures and send me photos and all other evidences by Messenger \u2014 who is cutting trees, which hornbill is nesting where, and so on,\u201d Rahman said.\n\nThe Mro parabiologists have become so critical to the researchers\u2019 work that they are regularly listed as formal co-authors of scientific papers.\n\n\u201cAs scientists, we often have this ego that we know everything, but I can have five Ph.D.s and still never have the knowledge that these people have,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cThese people read the forest like pages in a book. You show them a picture of a bird, and they would tell you about when it breeds, when its mating season is, which tree it nests in, where it nests, what its call sounds like.\n\n\u201cA lot of information that we collect and publish wouldn\u2019t happen without them,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile this authorship may not matter to them at all, I think this is the respect they deserve.\u201d\n\nSometimes, the Mro men end up surprised by the status of their own forests. For example, Proroy Mro, who co-authored a 2017 study looking at pangolin distribution in the CHT region, told Mongabay last year that whereas he used to think Bangladesh harbored lots of pangolins, the surveys showed him how few there actually are, and that he felt lucky to have so many near his village in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n\nThe Mro-CCA partnership has earned Rahman several laurels, including, most recently, the 2018 Whitley Award, dubbed the \u201cgreen Oscars.\u201d\n\nM. Monirul H. Khan, a professor of zoology at Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka, said the Mro people had access to the deepest parts of the CHT, where the remaining forests and valuable wildlife occur, and they were the key to conserving whatever is left there. By gaining their confidence and partnering with them, CCA had \u201cmade a major breakthrough,\u201d especially since no other organization had been able to develop such a mutual partnership, Khan added. \u201cThe Mro people live with the forests and wildlife of the CHT and their role is critical for any successful conservation initiative,\u201d he said.\n\nRahman\u2019s group has had less success partnering with the local branch of the Forest Department, though.\n\n\u201cThey work separately, don\u2019t communicate or share information with us, and don\u2019t maintain good relations with us,\u201d said S.M. Golam Mowla, a forest officer with the Chittagong division of the department. \u201cThey take permission from the Dhaka office, not from us, despite their site falling within the jurisdiction of Chittagong. If we worked together, we could jointly visit the area, we could help them with our local staff.\u201d\n\nRahman acknowledged there was a lack of coordination between his conservation group and the local forest department. The Sangu-Matamuhuri Reserve Forest within the CHT region, where Rahman\u2019s CCA team works, officially falls under the jurisdiction of the forest department. But the department has little actual authority over the area, Rahman said, primarily because of the complex political landscape, including local armed conflict.\n\n\u201cIt is not their fault. It is because the area is remote, it is not safe, and they don\u2019t have adequate resources,\u201d Rahman said of the department. \u201cIf the forest department could find mechanisms to increase their presence there, the gap in communication will decrease and it would help us tremendously, and we could help them in return.\u201d\n\nKhan of Jahangirnagar University agreed that working in remote parts of the CHT was \u201cextremely difficult, and there was very little or no presence of government officials in some areas.\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/V2bpVbDbnaQZ8m8RaP6Kzgle6svyhWxFCxxado7LLFk.jpg"}, {"title": "Okla. family asks for cards to make WWII Vet's birthday special", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Family-asks-for-cards-to-make-WWII-Vets-birthday-special-505190191.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "A World War II veteran from Marlow, Oklahoma is turning 93 on April 17th and his family is already trying to get cards sent to him for his birthday as a surprise.\n\nHis daughter Liz Anderson said her dad Recil Troxel, 92, loves getting any kind of mail, and is obsessed with checking the mail.\n\n\u201cHe sits here in this chair looking out the window every day,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWhen the mail is here, he\u2019s like the mail is here, we better go get the mail.\u201d\n\nBut, it's not very often Troxel finds something in there for him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get mail anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nTroxel's birthday is in April, but his family decided they\u2019d try to start his birthday celebration early so he can get enjoyment from one of his favorite things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting when he gets it because he will sit there and hold it\u201d Anderson said. \u201cSometimes he won\u2019t open it for an hour or two.

It also claimed that voters in eight states are worried about water and climate issues, disappointed in recent federal rollback of environmental protections and even willing to pay more taxes for conservation.\n\nThe survey, the ninth annual, said 73 percent of Arizona voters claim to be worried about climate change in 2019, up from 63 percent in 2016. That was higher than the 69 percent in the eight-state region who said they see climate change as a serious problem in 2019.\n\n\u201cConcern about climate change is rising pretty dramatically,\u201d said Dave Metz, president of Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz and Associates, one of two firms that did the poll. \u201cWhile it remains an issue where there are partisan distinctions \u2026 there have been increases across the board.\u201d\n\nThe poll was conducted by Metz\u2019s firm, which typically works with Democrats, and by New Bridge Strategy, which usually works with Republicans.\n\nNew Bridge Strategy\u2019s Lori Weigel agreed with Metz that while climate change \u201coften provokes a partisan response\u201d that was reflected among Democrats, Republicans and independents in the poll, concern over the issue rose in every group.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen an 8-point increase among Republicans and voters who are unaffiliated or independent,\u201d when it comes to climate-change concerns, she said.\n\nThe telephone poll of 3,200 voters was conducted from Jan. 2-9 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.65 percent for the overall survey. The margin of error rose to plus or minus 4.9 percent for results in each state: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nAmong the findings the survey said 65 percent of voters believe protection of public lands is more important than using them for energy production of natural resources, and 75 percent see the rollback of environmental laws as a serious problem.\n\nSpecifically, two-thirds disagreed with the reduction of national monuments, like the Trump administration\u2019s to reduce Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, and 60 percent looked poorly on the reversal of the Waters of the U.S. rule, an Obama-era regulation that had greatly increased waterways subject to federal oversight.\n\nArizona members of the Congressional Western Caucus, which believes in mineral development on federal land and wants to reduce the amount of public lands in federal hands, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the poll\u2019s findings.\n\nBut an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which advocates for market-based solutions to environmental problems, defended the rollback of some regulations. Jonathan Wood said there are \u201cmany reforms that would result in better management of public lands and advance the conservation and recreation interests on these lands\u201d through a market approach.\n\n\u201cFor instance, federal regulations currently prohibit or discourage conservation groups from bidding for grazing or drilling rights on federal lands, with the intention of conserving those lands rather than using them,\u201d Wood said in an email. \u201cThis regulation has led to unnecessary acrimony and frustrated market-based conservation.\u201d\n\nWhile he said voters should be concerned about climate change, Wood also questioned the survey\u2019s finding that more than two-thirds think it is a serious problem. He pointed out that of the four possible answers respondents could choose for that question, three were varying degrees of serious, from \u201csomewhat\u201d to \u201cextremely,\u201d and only one was \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\nOther findings were less surprising for voters in Western states. The poll said they were highly concerned about falling levels of water availability and rising numbers of wildfires. It said 36 percent of respondents thought changes in the climate were the biggest factor in wildfires, and 30 percent blamed drought.\n\nIt also said that 68 percent of voters \u2013 64 percent in Arizona \u2013 would be willing to pay higher taxes to fund conservation efforts, with almost all respondents citing forest management and protection of waterways as top conservation priorities.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing anxiety about a lack of resources for conservation,\u201d Metz said. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s why voters are supportive of raising additional revenue at the local level.\u201d\n\nWhile climate concerns were rising, the poll also found that the number of Arizonans who identify as \u201cconservationists\u201d fell 10 percentage points from last year.\n\nRobert Fanger, a spokesman for the Hispanic Access Foundation, said Latinos\u2019 views are in line with all of the findings of the survey and that they \u201coverwhelmingly disagree with the actions and policies of the current administration\u2019s energy-dominant agenda.\u201d\n\nFanger, who was on the conference call for the release of the poll, called on policymakers pay attention to its findings.\n\n\u201cWe just hope that those in Washington and in state government are paying attention,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not have to ask our elected officials to listen to their constituents.\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/HH85WaH-h5icepppbrVBlIluSrGpSxLbPJkg7-2m5NE.jpg"}, {"title": "911 dispatcher helps child who called for math homework help", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kid-calls-911-for-math-homework-help-lafayette-indiana-911-dispatcher-helps-him/", "comments": 10, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "A police dispatcher in Lafayette, Indiana, is being praised for her kindness toward a caller last week.

I just came to tell you that,\" he said.\n\n''When he told me he was having a bad day and I asked him what was troubling him he told me that he had homework,\" Bundy told CBS affiliate WLFI-TV. \"And at that point, I was able to determine that it was more of a 'I need help with homework' than an actual emergency.\"\n\nBundy was glad she wasn't too busy and she could focus on helping the boy with his homework. \"I've always been good at math. All the way through high school I enjoyed it. So it was something I was very happy I could help him with,\" she said.\n\nAntonia Bundy said she's always been good at math, so she was happy to help. WLFI\n\nThe boy read her the problem \u2014 what is 3x4 + 1x4 \u2014 and Bundy walked him through the steps to solve it. She said the brief interaction was a nice break to her otherwise busy day.\n\n\"It kind of takes the pressure off of it a little bit. Not too much, but just a little bit to be able to relax to take a step back and truly figure out what he needed and truly spend time with him and assist him in the best way I could.\"\n\nUsually, the emergencies she deals with are much worse, so a math problem was a welcome change. The boy said that was the only problem he needed help with, then thanked Bundy for her assistance.\n\n\"I'm sorry for calling you, but I really needed help,\" he told her.\n\n\"You're fine. We're always here to help,\" Bundy replied.\n\nThe dispatcher has dedicated her life to helping others, and this proves she goes above and beyond to do so.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Clemson Head Coach Dabo Swinney Surprises Special Needs Team Manager With Super Bowl Tickets", "score": 1, "url": "https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/01/dabo-swinney-surprises-special-needs-team-manager-super-bowl-tickets/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-2-1", "transcript": "Nearly a month after clinching the college football national title, Clemson Head Coach Dabo Swinney surprised one of the Tigers\u2019 team managers with tickets to this year\u2019s Super Bowl.\n\nDavid Saville, a team equipment manager with special needs, was presented the tickets from Swinney at practice, and the sweet moment captured on video was posted online by Clemson Football.\n\n\u201cYou do so much for this team, just the joy that you bring every day, the perspective, how hard you work \u2014 one of the hardest workers that we\u2019ve got around here,\u201d Swinney said as team was huddled up after practice.\n\nSaville, who just completed his eighth season as the team\u2019s equipment manager, threw his arms around Swinney\u2019s neck in a hug.\n\n\u201cHe gives our team and myself unbelievable perspective, and I have yet to see David Saville have a bad day,\u201d Swinney said.

Green was a 5-star recruit, finished as Georgia\u2019s third leading receiver despite only playing three seasons and has gone on to become one of the most consistently great wide receivers in the NFL.\n\nGeorgia fans and coach Kirby Smart have raved about Green before and what type of ambassador he is for the program. And on Thursday, Green returned the favor.\n\nDawgNation caught up with Green in Athens, and the standout wide receiver had some glowing things to say about Smart.\n\n\u201cThese last two years have been very exciting. He\u2019s given me a ton of bragging rights in the locker room,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m always talking a lot of trash, so these last two seasons have been great. Obviously I wish we had finished the season with the big one, but we\u2019re going to be real good for a long time.\u201d\n\nGreen is one of five former Georgia players on the Cincinnati Bengals. Since leaving Georgia, Green has made seven Pro Bowls and racked up six 1,000 yards seasons. The only reason Green didn\u2019t eclipse 1,000 yards this past season was because he played in only 8 games due to a toe injury.\n\nGreen didn\u2019t play for Smart when he attended Georgia from 2008-10. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Smart from making Green feel like a vital part of the Georgia program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome and you go there like he recruited you,\u201d Green said He makes it feel like home and he\u2019s a great guy. He really changed this program these last two years and it\u2019s been wonderful to see.\u201d\n\nGreen isn\u2019t the only former Bulldog to make those types of comments this week. David Andrews of the New England Patriots made similar comments with regards to how Sam Pittman has treated him when Andrews has come back to Athens.\n\nAndrews is one of four Bulldogs playing in the Super Bowl this weekend, joining Sony Michel, Todd Gurley and Ramik Wilson.\n\nTo hear more of what Green had to say about Georgia, the future of the wide receiver position and much more, make sure to check out DawgNation Daily on Friday.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc.\n\nEarlier this month, Representative Ilhan Omar tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby!\u201d in response to a report about AIPAC, a pro-Israel organization. Omar\u2019s tweet echoed a longstanding anti-Semitic trope \u2014 in particular, the implication that Jewish political influence operates entirely (\u201call about\u201d) through money.\n\nAfter wide condemnation, Omar apologized. It seemed fair to read her tweet generously: Perhaps she was not familiar with the particular vein of anti-Semitism she happened to echo. Indeed, progressives often make crudely reductive statements about the influence of money in supporting policies they oppose (to wit: everything Bernie Sanders says), so it wasn\u2019t necessarily anti-Semitic for Omar to extend that thinking to Jews. Her apparently sincere apology seemed to set to rest a minor offense.\n\nBut at an event last night, Omar went much farther, reports Laura Kelly. After an audience member shouted out, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins,\u201d at which, according to Kelly\u2019s reporting, she smiled. (Jeremy Slevin, Omar\u2019s press secretary and strategist, denies she acknowledged that line from the audience.) Later she stated, \u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d\n\nThis is much worse. Accusing Jews of \u201callegiance to a foreign country\u201d is a historically classic way of delegitimizing their participation in the political system. Whether or not the foreign policy agenda endorsed by American supporters of Israel is wise or humane, it is a legitimate expression of their political rights as American citizens. To believe in a strong American alliance with Israel (or Canada, or the United Kingdom, or any other country) is not the same thing as giving one\u2019s allegiance to that country. Omar is directly invoking the hoary myth of dual loyalty, in which the Americanness of Jews is inherently suspect, and their political participation must be contingent upon proving their patriotism.\n\nOf course, she is attempting to couch her position as a defense of free speech, and against a tendency to reflexively dismiss all criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic. And it\u2019s certainly true that many Israel hawks do label criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic without a good basis to do so. There should be more space in American politics to advocate criticism of Israel and support for Palestinian rights.\n\nBut Omar is using that cause to smuggle in ugly stereotypes. And whatever presumption of good faith she deserved last time should be gone now.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/DD1O2WY_w1_m-EG1eS5RlCdu2CZAndpSzMqONeIGQUk.jpg"}, {"title": "Sign up now for the web hosting referral program and earn $10 per referral for every person you sign up.

Clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam are now prohibited for use on crops.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever France has gone a step further and set the high bar in the effort to save the bees. Given the importance of pollinators to nature and the survival of the biosphere, this could not happen too soon!\n\nStudies have reported that the neonicotinoid pesticides attack the central nervous system of insects, leading to loss of memory and homing skills, in addition to reduced fertility. Bees that cannot find their way back to the hive quickly die. However the pesticides have also been shown to affect butterflies, birds and other pollinating insects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a reason why France is ahead of the field in this regard: The \u201cbee killing\u201d pesticides were tested first on French fields in the 1990\u2019s \u2013 and the French farmers witnessed first-hand the catastrophic effects that occurred in 1994; describing \u201ca carpet of dead bees\u201d. 400,000 bee colonies died within days \u2013 yet the story was buried under a layer of corruption and distorted science.\n\nSince that time, activists and manufacturers have battled to control the situation. We covered this story in full in a previous post: Overwhelming Evidence Linking Neonicotinoid Insecticides To Massive Die-off Of Bees And Songbirds\n\nThe new move is certain to be celebrated by ecologists and sets an example of protection of nature that the rest of the world needs to follow.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rdfqqoL4-lv1qdxHm0kiV2q0UwvKdu_ddCGr_wLBjkw.jpg"}, {"title": "The Earth is Greener Than it Was Two Decades Ago, And it is Because of India And China", "score": 26, "url": "https://www.news18.com/news/tech/the-earth-is-greener-than-it-was-two-decades-ago-and-it-is-because-of-india-and-china-2052191.html", "comments": 2, "date": "2019-3-1", "transcript": "You might be surprised to hear this, but there is now more green cover on earth than it was, 20 years ago. This is according to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which says there are now more trees on earth in comparison with two decades ago. The NASA study also shows that it is China and India leading the way, with their ambitious tree plantation projects.\n\nOn 5 July 2017, India planted as many as 66 million trees in one day, along the Narmada in the state of Madhya Pradesh, creating a new world record in the process. Before that, 800,000 volunteers in the state of Uttar Pradesh planted 50.4 million trees in just 24 hours.\n\n\u201cChina and India account for one-third of the greening, but contain only 9% of the planet\u2019s land area covered in vegetation \u2013 a surprising finding, considering the general notion of land degradation in populous countries from overexploitation,\u201d says Chi Chen of the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University, in Massachusetts, and lead author of the study.\n\nThe greening phenomenon was first detected using satellite data in the mid-1990s, and the 20-year old data comparison is now possible because of NASA instrumentation orbiting the earth on two satellites. It is called the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS, and NASA says its high-resolution data provides very accurate information. This allows researchers to calculate the changes in spread of the green cover and vegetation, down to the level of 500 meters or about 1,600 feet on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis long-term data lets us dig deeper,\u201d said Rama Nemani, a research scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, and a co-author of the new work. \u201cWhen the greening of the Earth was first observed, we thought it was due to a warmer, wetter climate and fertilization from the added carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to more leaf growth in northern forests, for instance. Now, with the MODIS data that lets us understand the phenomenon at really small scales, we see that humans are also contributing.\u201d\n\nThe ambitious tree plantation projects are a part of the Government of India\u2019s strategy to tackle climate change. At the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, India had committed to spend as much as $6 billion to regrow forests on 12 percent of the country\u2019s land area, and also increase the forest cover by up to 29 percent.\n\nChina also has similar projects in place to conserve and expand forest cover.\n\nThe research also suggests that 82 percent of green cover seen in India is because of intensive cultivation of food crops. This includes multiple cropping practices, because of which a field is replanted to produce more than one harvest in a year. This has also meant that production of grains, vegetables, fruits and more have increased by about 35-40 percent since the year 2000.\n\nHowever, the researchers also warn us that the increased greenb cover in China and India does not offset the damage from loss of natural vegetation in tropical regions such as Brazil and Indonesia.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7v4tZdPsVrKLsm6LGDZp5PsafVluLu9uXgT4KgsLM7E.jpg"}, {"title": "SEO SMM ZONE", "score": 1, "url": "https://seosmmzone.com", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-3-1", "transcript": "", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "New Malaysian State Park Tripled in Size, to 74,140 acres \u2014 nearly three times the size of San Francisco", "score": 42, "url": "https://www.rainforesttrust.org/new-malaysian-state-park-tripled-in-size-through-the-support-of-rainforest-trust/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-3-1", "transcript": "In 2018, Rainforest Trust helped establish and then expand Malaysia\u2019s new Kenyir State Park.

The creation and management of this new protected area is a collaborative effort involving the Terengganu State Government and the local nonprofit organization Rimba, in partnership with Rainforest Trust, Panthera and the Woodland Park Zoo.\n\nThe Kenyir State Park is the first ever state park for the State of Terengganu and the first state park to be gazetted in Peninsular Malaysia since 2007.

By answering the questions, you help to reduce the amount of interpretation involved. At times this can be a daunting situation to employers, particularly if applicants have not listed their experience in such a way that it\u2019s evident they possess the essential skills and experience needed to meet minimum qualifications and succeed in the position.\n\n\n\nWithout a doubt, good candidates who are qualified may be overlooked because they have failed to highlight certain skills and/or experience that meet the minimum requirements for the position. An experienced Human Resources professional may be able to make certain inferences as to whether applicants have acquired the needed skills and/or experience based upon prior positions held and their list of responsibilities and accomplishments. Nonetheless, this is not a desirable, nor effective means of screening applicants.\n\n\n\nWell developed and relevant job application supplemental questions increase certainty and may actually circumvent the loss of a well-qualified candidate. The subject matter for supplemental questions should directly address minimum qualifications. Is it important that an applicant possess experience in interacting with represented employees and organized labor groups? Is 3-5 years supervisory experience important? Is it an absolute necessity that this candidate know something about the new laws surrounding storm water pollution prevention? Answering job application questions such as these properly is a major step towards getting the job.\n\n\n\nOftentimes, job application questions are used to inquire about certain skills and experience that will enable a candidate to address the unique needs of an agency, including certain deficiencies or desirable attributes that were heretofore nonexistent. Unfortunately, while these supplemental questions are important. They may not necessarily be the kinds of questions that address whether the candidate possesses the minimum qualifications for the position.\n\n\n\nEmployment application questions have been developed that will enable the reviewer to properly assess whether candidates meet the minimum qualifications, then one or two questions can be added that will enable the reviewer to identify and bring forward the most qualified applicants for the position.

The new law keeps the ban in place.\n\nThat\u2019s also tempered excitement from tenant groups, who say the cap still allows rent increases that could impose a significant financial hardship for renting families.\n\nBrown said lawmakers and the Oregon Housing and Community Services Department should report back on how the bill is working during the 2021 legislative session, including its impact on the rental housing supply.\n\nMeanwhile, she said the Legislature should approve $400 million in housing-related budget requests for affordable housing development, rental assistance and homelessness prevention.\n\n-- Elliot Njus\n\nenjus@oregonian.com; 503-294-5034; @enjus\n\nVisit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Couple buys 45 hotel rooms for homeless in the snow", "score": 9, "url": "https://abc7.com/community-events/couple-buys-45-hotel-rooms-for-homeless-in-the-snow/5162236/?fbclid=IwAR29LKu4DnMhV6R9qk9sKjtOsHPdKnAs9QijUHoIZJWhIiTvB6WLsQmq8LQ", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-3-1", "transcript": "MEDFORD, Ore. -- Amberly and Ryan Batten are being praised in their community after paying for 45 rooms at Americas Best Value Inn in order to get homeless people off the snowy streets.

Last month, studies conducted by USC and San Diego State found that just four of the top 100 highest-grossing films in 2018 and 15 percent of the top 500 were directed by women, both counts signifying a drop from the year before. But this year\u2019s slate of studio releases may be a sign that diversity efforts in Hollywood are starting to bear fruit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we have known for a long time. Movies about and by women are showing they can be successful at the box office, and the industry is following,\u201d Women in Film Executive Director Kirsten Schaffer told TheWrap. She notes that diversity initiatives like WiF\u2019s Reframe program are finding success because they are challenging studios to look at every stage of how they make their movies.\n\n\u201cWhen people start the work of examining that unconscious bias, that\u2019s when we see the systemic changes necessary. They start thinking about who makes the decisions, which directors and producers are the first considered for hiring. And it goes down from there for every aspect of a film\u2019s production.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Female Protagonists in Top-Grossing Films Hit All-Time High in 2018 - Yet Men Still Dominated\n\nIndeed, some studios are trying to send the message that they are asking such questions about themselves. Last week, Paramount CEO Jim Gianopulos announced in a company-wide memo that the studio would establish a \u201cContent Creation Council\u201d with the goal of making Paramount\u2019s greenlight and development process more inclusive at all levels of production.\n\n\u201cSpecial attention will be paid to our storylines, our talent in front of and behind the camera, our vendors and our shooting locations,\u201d Gianopulos wrote.\n\nReps for all six studios declined to comment for this story, though all confirmed their current release slates.\n\nFor this survey, TheWrap did not consider releases from art-house divisions like Fox Searchlight and Sony Pictures Classics, which often rely on acquisitions as opposed to developing projects in-house and hiring the filmmakers involved.\n\nHere is the 2019 outlook at each studio, as well as major projects slated for 2020 or currently in development.\n\nAlso Read: Grammy Awards Analysis: Women Seize the Spotlight, But Kendrick Lamar Still Can't Catch a Break\n\nDISNEY\n\nAs usual, the current box office kings have the smallest number of 2019 releases, with just 10 films (at least until the studio completes its expected acquisition of Fox\u2019s film and TV assets). Of those 10, two with $100 million-plus budgets have women sharing a director credit. First is next month\u2019s \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d (pictured above), which Anna Boden directed with \u201cMississippi Grind\u201d partner Ryan Fleck, making her the first woman to direct a Marvel Studios release.\n\nThen, in November, \u201cFrozen\u201d director Jennifer Lee returns with the film\u2019s sequel, \u201cFrozen II,\u201d which is co-directed by Chris Buck. Lee was also named chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation following the departure of John Lasseter amid sexual misconduct accusations.\n\nDisney has announced several female-directed films beyond this year, including Niki Caro\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cMulan,\u201d set for 2020.\n\nPixar\u2019s Domee Shi, who won the Best Animated Short Oscar on Sunday for \u201cBao,\u201d is in the early stages of developing her feature debut.

More than $2.3 billion has now been committed under the ERF.The new money \u2013 which will be about $200 million annually starting from January 2020 - will be used to partner with farmers, local government and businesses to reduce emissions. The government gives as examplesIn a Monday speech, part of which has been released ahead of delivery, Morrison defends the government\u2019s record on climate and attacks Labor\u2019s policy as irresponsible.The speech will contain further environment announcements beyond the $2 billion.Climate change was an issue to the forefront in the Wentworth byelection, the loss of which threw the Coalition into minority government. It is considered a potent issue in Victoria, where the government has several seats at risk. In the high profile contest in Warringah, NSW, independent Zali Steggall, Tony Abbott\u2019s main opponent, is running hard on it.There has been debate over whether Australia could on present policies meet its Paris target - that Abbott set - of reducing emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030.Morrison has repeatedly said this will be reached \u201cin a canter\u201d. But the annual UN Environment Emissions Gap Report, released late last year, had Australia among a number of countries that are not on track to reach their 2030 target or have uncertainty based on current projections.Morrison\u2019s announcement will shore up Australia\u2019s effort.Moderate Liberals, in particular, have been pressing for more action from the government on the climate front.In his speech Morrison says: \u201cOur government will take meaningful, practical action on climate change, without damaging our economy or the family budget.\"Our Climate Solutions Package will ensure Australia meets our 2030 emissions reduction target \u2013 a responsible and achievable target \u2013 building on our success in comprehensively beating our Kyoto commitments\u201d.He says that Liberals and Nationals \u201cdon\u2019t believe we have to choose between our environment and our economy.\"We acknowledge and accept the challenge of addressing climate change, but we do so with cool heads, not just impassioned hearts\u201d.The government\u2019s 2030 target is the equivalent of cutting per capita emissions by about 50%, one of the largest cut of any G20 country, Morrison says in his speech.The target is not \u201ca slouch\u201d but nor is it reckless, he says. In contrast.

The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since India and Pakistan came into being in 1947. Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged. How did the dispute start? After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad. Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control. In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held. In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders. What was Kashmir\u2019s special status? Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\n\nAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest. On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule. What do the militants want? There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.\n\nUntil 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with extreme force in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters. For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists.\n\n\n\nMichael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe\n\nPakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, had announced his impending release in parliament on Thursday, calling it a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d.\n\nThe pilot\u2019s homecoming sparked jubilation in India. Large crowds gathered near the border post cheering, dancing and waving Indian flags in scenes broadcast live on major TV news channels, who counted down the hours to Varthaman\u2019s return throughout the afternoon and evening. A Bollywood filmmaker has already applied to copyright the movie title Abhinandan.\n\nVarthaman\u2019s return had been scheduled for the afternoon but was delayed for hours without explanation, leading TV anchors to speculate something may have gone wrong. At around 9.15pm Indian time, he appeared on the Pakistan side of the border crossing, straight-backed and wearing a blue blazer and grey trousers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People gather at the Wagah border, on the outskirts of the northern city of Amritsar, India. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters\n\nThe diminutive iron gates on both sides of the border slid open and Varthaman strode out onto the no-man\u2019s land in between. For a moment soldiers from both sides came face-to-face. Varthaman shook the hand of an Indian officer, and another took him by the waist and walked him onto Indian soil. The two gates were slammed shut behind him.\n\nIndia\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, tweeted:\n\nNarendra Modi (@narendramodi) Welcome Home Wing Commander Abhinandan!\n\n\n\nThe nation is proud of your exemplary courage.\n\n\n\nOur armed forces are an inspiration for 130 crore Indians.\n\n\n\nVande Mataram!\n\nVarthaman\u2019s parents flew from Chennai to Delhi on a midnight flight on Thursday, where they received a standing ovation from passengers. They drove to Amritsar, the closest city to the Wagah border, soon after touching down in the capital.\n\nAround the time he was crossing the border, Islamabad released what appeared to be a heavily edited video in which Varmathan recounts his capture, praises the way he was treated and criticises the Indian media. \u201cThe Indian media always exaggerates. They embellish the smallest thing, present it as if on fire, and people fall for it,\u201d the footage shows him saying in Hindi.\n\nThe fate of the pilot had become a major concern in India after a series of videos were released showing him being beaten by a mob near his crash site and then interrogated by Pakistani officers while blindfolded and wearing a bloodied uniform. He gave his name, rank and religion, but when prompted for more, calmly replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, that\u2019s all I\u2019m supposed to tell you.\u201d\n\nThe footage was widely circulated on WhatsApp and social media and broadcast nationally in both countries, including on India\u2019s stridently nationalistic evening talk shows.\n\nFor Kashmir, there is only one strategy left to try: peace | Mirza Waheed Read more\n\nPakistan appeared to seize on Varthaman\u2019s potential to be a circuit breaker in the conflict by the evening, releasing a video showing the detainee drinking chai, saying he was being treated well and lauding his captors as \u201cthorough gentlemen\u201d. \u201cThe tea is fantastic,\u201d he added.\n\nIndia had lodged an official complaint about the \u201cvulgar display\u201d of the prisoner in the videos and demand his immediate return without conditions.\n\nKashmir, a Himalayan region the two countries claim in full but rule in part, has been the trigger for three India-Pakistan wars since 1947. The pair regularly trade mortar fire over the heavily guarded line of control separating the two armies, including on Friday as Varthaman was being repatriated.\n\nThe stakes of the latest flare-up have been heightened by an impending general election in India and the introduction of social media and cable news in both countries, which have created new and influential public lobbies.\n\nFalse news and videos including of pilots killed or injured in earlier accidents and supposed footage of India\u2019s strike on Pakistan that later turned out to be a clip from a video game were also widely circulated.\n\nModi, who is currently campaigning for re-election, trumpeted the strikes against Pakistan from the hustings on Friday.\n\n\u201cFrom 2004 to 2014 there were several terror attacks,\u201d he said, speaking at a rally in Tamil Nadu state. \u201cThe nation expected perpetrators to be punished but nothing happened \u2026 Today, we are in an era where the news reads: armed forces have full freedom to do what they want.\u201d\n\nVarthaman\u2019s release on Friday was lauded as a \u201ctitanic win for India\u201d by more jingoistic elements of the country\u2019s media, but Khan\u2019s announcement puts pressure on Delhi to reciprocate in a way that eases tensions before it is has necessarily achieved its strategic goals.\n\nThe current crisis was sparked by a 14 February suicide bombing by a Pakistan-based militant group in the disputed region of Kashmir that killed 40 Indian paramilitaries.\n\nIndian jets flew more than 50 miles inside Pakistan to strike what Delhi has said was a militant training centre in reprisal, the first attack on undisputed Pakistani territory since a war between the countries in 1971.\n\nIndian government officials said on Thursday the attack was intended to raise the costs for Pakistan of continuing to allow jihadi groups to operate with free rein on its soil. India has previously practised \u201cstrategic restraint\u201d in response to attacks by Pakistan-based militants, including a four-day bombing and shooting operation in Mumbai in 2008 that killed or injured nearly 1,000 people.\n\nIndia wants Pakistan to take verifiable action to show it is cracking down on Islamist militia groups, an issue it says Islamabad has sought to distract from by creating the impression the two nuclear-armed countries are on the brink of war.\n\nPakistani jets struck Indian territory near Kashmir\u2019s ceasefire line on Wednesday morning. Both countries say they shot down an opposing jet in the ensuing aerial combat, including Varthaman\u2019s, which landed in Pakistan-held territory.\n\nThe clashes led to the closure of airspace across Pakistan and northern India, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded as airlines cancelled flights to the region or scrambled to find alternate routes.\n\nShah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, was asked by CNN on Thursday night if his country would arrest Mahmood Azhar, the leader of the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which claimed responsibility for the attack on the Indian paramilitaries. \u201cAccording to my information he is very unwell,\u201d Qureshi said. \u201cHe is unwell to the extent he cannot leave his house.\u201d\n\nIndia has given Pakistan a dossier of evidence on the involvement of Azhar and JeM in the plot. Qureshi has said he would examine the dossier but told CNN that India needed to \u201cgive us evidence which is acceptable to the courts of Pakistan\u201d before it arrested the militant leader.\n\n\n\nPakistan has not explained why more evidence than JeM\u2019s claim of responsibility would be necessary.\n\nThe country\u2019s climate change minister, Malik Amin Aslam, told Reuters on Friday he planned to lodge a complaint against India at the UN, claiming its airstrikes had destroyed pine trees in a forest reserve. \u201cWhat happened over there is environmental terrorism,\u201d Aslam said.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/GcRZZIcIgAjXfkJpBlVyUWDZuDVsN7qHSfkTQm9zkWE.jpg"}, {"title": "World War II Veterans Celebrate Over 70 Years Of Marriage", "score": 1, "url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/40040089/world-war-ii-veterans-celebrate-over-70-years-of-marriage#.XHlvxuC5RtI.reddit", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-3-1", "transcript": "So here\u2019s the deal: their daughter Kathleen wanted to make their next birthdays and anniversary very special.

He was diagnosed with a slew of mental illnesses during his formative years, from bipolar disorder to obsessive compulsive disorder. It was easy for him to feel down about himself.\n\n\"I realized how I was thinking was contributing to my struggles,\" said Crowder, a 26-year-old Tampa native. \"But I couldn't climb out of it.\"\n\nSo he started filling sticky notes with positive, affirmative messages, and leaving them around his house. On one note, he remembers penciling, \"You deserve to spend time with people who care about you.\"\n\nIt made a difference. For just a few seconds a day, he'd feel better. But eventually the notes became commonplace, and their effect seemed to wear off.\n\nSo he decided to try it another way. This time, by sending uplifting text messages to his friends to see how they reacted.\n\n\"The first text, I sent to about 32 friends in my contacts, with the same message. Nearly everyone responded,\" he said. \"They interpreted it differently based on their own lives, but I was surprised to see so many of them replied with 'How did you know?' Like I knew they were going through something.\"\n\nThat's how Crowder founded Cope Notes.\n\nIt's a text messaging service aimed at those going through a difficult time. Every day, a Cope Notes user will get a random message, usually something uplifting, but it could also be advice about an exercise to try or tips to boost positivity. Users are encouraged to text back, and to use the thread as their own \"digital journal,\" Crowder said.\n\n\"People would rather text their friends than talk to them about something difficult,\" he said. \"We wanted to create something that was optionally interactive. Some of the texts are prompts, and while it's not necessarily a two-way conversation, we want the platform to foster independence. The goal is not to be something people rely on forever.\"\n\nRELATED: When suicide threats come calling: 'I try to make a connection.'\n\nCrowder's timing, it seems, is important. Depression diagnosis rates rose 33 percent from 2013 to 2016, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Health of America Report. Children and millennials seem to be the most at risk, with diagnosis rates spiking by 63 percent and 47 percent, respectively, over the same period.\n\nWomen, too, seem to suffer from depression more often, with diagnosis rates that are double those of men, according to the Blue Cross report.\n\nWhat's more, the report said, people with depression are nearly 30 percent less healthy on average than those without it, and 85 percent also suffer from other chronic health conditions.\n\nCope Notes launched quietly nearly a year ago from Crowder's South Tampa home, and now has about 1,000 users. Crowder said they range in age from 14 to 40. He's the one writing the messages that are delivered each day, but they are reviewed by a panel of mental health counselors and professors, public relations professionals and privacy compliance officials.\n\nThe service costs $9.99 a month, or $8.99 a month for an annual subscription. There's also an option of a one-week free trial.\n\nA recent example of a Cope Notes message: \"When you hold the door open for someone, and they step on your foot, you should still be proud. Their bad decision doesn't invalidate your good one.\"\n\nAnother one said, \"The entire world was changed by people just like you. Normal folks who didn't think they were just about to change the world. Don't underestimate yourself.\"\n\nAnd this: \"Coloring for 15 minutes can help clear your mind and soothe anxiety. It may sound childish, but how do you think adult coloring books became best sellers?\"\n\nCope Notes is not meant to replace therapy or clinical treatment, but it can supplement it, said Kristin Kosyluk, an assistant professor in the Department of Mental Health Law & Policy at the University of South Florida. She said Crowder and his text messaging platform are also good examples of where mental health care is headed.\n\n\"We're moving toward a recovery model and away from a medical model,\" Kosyluk said. \"It gives someone like Johnny, who has been through the system and has personal experience, the authority and credibility to provide support to others.\"\n\nKosyluk cited the \"Alcoholics Anonymous\" community \u2014 where people who have suffered from the same afflictions, comfort and support one another \u2014 as a good example of a recovery model.\n\n\"Cope Notes has that piece to it because Johnny is open about his experiences,\" she said. \"A lot of times, people are seeking help in a clinical setting and not finding support in their own communities. A simple text message that somebody receives, that's an intervention being delivered in the moment.\"\n\nKosyluk is working with Crowder to potentially collect research data from Cope Note users in the future.\n\nALSO READ: Pediatricians are the new allies in the battle against teen depression. They can spot it early.\n\nBefore becoming a mental health activist in 2011, speaking about his survival story to community groups and schools, Crowder tried just about anything that would help as he struggled with depression.\n\n\"I tried meditation apps, the Tony Robbins 'walk on coals' type self-help people. You name it, I was hungry for anything that would help me cope with what was happening to me.\"\n\nBut what bothered him most about the programs he tried were the promises of an overnight cure.\n\n\"It takes a long time to feel better. There's no flip of a switch in your brain that makes everything normal,\" he said. \"It takes a lot of tiny steps and nudges in the right direction over time to heal and come up with healthy coping practices.\"\n\nContact Justine Griffin at jgriffin@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8467.

Though less than 9,000 square miles in size Belize is a surprisingly diverse and colorful country. Here are five interesting facts you may or may not know about the nation of Belize:\n\n5 Facts You Might Not Know\n\n1\n\nPerhaps Belize is best known for the Belize Barrier Reef, located off of the country's coast. The Reef is massive, second in size only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Because of the Reef's great size, there are over 200 islands of varied sizes just off the Belize coast, many of which are not populated.\n\n2\n\nBelize is home to over 900 known Mayan historical and archaeological sites. The Mayan civilization was one of the largest and most powerful Native American groups to occupy South America. Their unique and striking art and architecture have drawn awe from many.\n\n3\n\nLargely because of protective acts, a great deal of the natural forests in Belize have remained untouched and today retain their unique diversity. In Belize forests range from the thick, tropical variety to, in fact, the only pine tree forest in South America. Because these areas have remained undisturbed a great deal of natural wildlife continues to inhabit the country.\n\n4\n\nStanding apart from the rest of the Central and South American countries, the national language of Belize is English. This has lead to Belize becoming a popular destination for English-speaking tourists and expatriates. But English is not the only language in use in Belize ' it is not uncommon to hear Creole and Spanish as well, among others.\n\n5\n\nBelize is home to the first endangered jaguar preserve in the world, the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. Established in the 1980s, the sanctuary covers an area of almost 150 square miles in the southern region. There are even parks within the preserve which people are welcome to visit and observe the wide variety of flora and fauna including nearly 300 different species of birds.\n\n\n\nThe capital of Belize is Belmopan. The currency of Belize is the Belize Dollar(BZD) Flag of Belize\n\n\n\nBelize belongs to the North American continent\n\n\n\nAirports in Belize\n\nBelize International Airport\n\n\n\nThe Country dialling code of Belize is +501, and the TLD (Top-level domain) of Belize is .bz\n\nMap of Belize\n\nPopulation\n\n294,385\n\nLanguages spoken in Belize\n\nEnglish\n\nCoordinates (in Latitude & Longitude) of Belize\n\n17 15 N, 88 45 W\n\nKilometers of coastline\n\n386 kilometers\n\nSquare kilometers of land\n\n22,806 square kilometers\n\nSquare kilometers of water\n\n160 square kilometers\n\nBirth rate\n\n28.34 / 1000 population\n\nDeath rate\n\n5.76 / 1000 population\n\nIrrigated land\n\n30 sq km\n\nInformation about Belize is brought to you by \"List of countries of the world\", your first stop in discovering all countries of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2DU9Fn1\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2GcUlnE\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2BnpFfz\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2DU9Fn1\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2GcUlnE\n\n\n\nTravel the world's many wonders that has little known places of interest to visit and enjoy:\n\n\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2TuConO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbelize,travel,belize travel,belize city,travel vlog,belize tourism,belize travel guide,travel belize,belize travel vlog,things to do in belize,belize travel video,tourism,belize travel packages,travel vlogger,travel to belize,travel tips,belize (country),travel guide,belize barrier reef,travel diary,central america,belize travel tips,belize tourism board,caye caulker belize,belize resorts,belize video travel guide", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Community shows up to pay respects to veteran with no family", "score": 1, "url": "https://fox2now.com/2019/03/01/community-shows-up-to-pay-respects-to-veteran-with-no-family/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-3-1", "transcript": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated.

A sort of restoration of faith in our humanity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely humbling to see that the community would come out and support veterans. Unclaimed veterans,\u201d said Krissy Stone, a Patriot Guard rider.\n\nThe cemetery was packed and strangers wept for Sgt. Wunderlich\n\nThe cemetery was packed with fellow military members, veterans, and community members showing their support. They had never even met Sergeant Wunderlich.\n\n\u201cAll military men deserve family at their closing. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d said Jeff Hirsch, a Patriot Guard rider.\n\nThere was no picture of him Sgt. Wunderlich. And nothing is known about his service record.\n\nBut on this day, Sgt. Wunderlich had an honor guard and a community standing watch as he was laid to rest with full military honors, including the folding of the US flag and the playing of the taps. The flag was given to a friend who was in the hospital with him.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\n38.501414 -90.288167", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price offers big hug to young fan whose mom died of cancer", "score": 15, "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/carey-price-young-fan-1.5038658", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-3-1", "transcript": "Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price did a good thing.\n\nLast year, as Brantford, Ont., mother Laura McKay was dying of cancer, she promised her son Anderson Whitehead she would do everything she could to make sure he met Price, his idol.\n\nAnderson, who is 11, met the all-star during the morning skate in Toronto last week.

The main user groups cover homemakers, mature royal sisters, delicate young girls and housewives.\n\nImage: Parent-child product live room / Southern Metropolis Daily via Tencent News\n\nOver the past three years, the rise of Taobao Live has enabled a group of anchors to \" fly\" through the air. For example, \" Taobao Live One Sister\" Weiya has repeatedly refreshed the historical record of the transaction amount of Taobao Live anchor live broadcasts, from 70 million in 5 hours on October 10, 2017 to 150 million in 5 hours on October 10, 2018. \" Lipstick First Brother\" Li Jiaqi, who sold 15,000 slogans in 5 minutes on the 11th of last year, has so far failed to break the record. On March 8th this year, on Women's Day, Li Jiaqi sold lipstick in the live teaching at Taobao University's Talent College, with 183,300 live viewers, 23,000 deals and 3.53 million deals.\n\nSouthern Metropolis Daily Reporters Talk to \" Taobao Live First Sister\" Weiya and \" Lipstick First Brother\" Li Jiaqi\n\nTaobao Live Broadcast in 2019 will continue to simplify the threshold to attract more anchors. Wen Zhong announced the \" Star of Light\" plan on the spot, which will create 1,000 anchors across platforms, domains and identities. At the same time, Taobao Live will also use more efforts to empower the participants of live broadcast ecology and build 10 anchor colleges and 100 gold medal bases in 2019. With the improvement of 5G technology and the improvement of live broadcast experience, Wen Zhong believes that Taobao live broadcast will become more and more visible, covering more and more scenes and fields, and also bringing about stronger interaction between users and anchors. Before and after the Spring Festival in 2019, Taobao Live TV's Independent APP went online in a low profile. \" Mobile Taobao is equivalent to an aircraft carrier, with many, many things on it. Live broadcasting is only a form. The channel for the host to reach fans is not particularly strong in hand panning, because so many products want to be sent out, but hand panning can only send out a few pieces a day. Therefore, we want to use independent clients to help improve the reach efficiency of anchors and fans. \" Wen Zhong said that independent apps are also more suitable for doing something with strong interaction. Once Taobao Live Broadcast is carried out, it will adhere to the dimension based on living consumption and will not specifically do the reward function.\n\n\" Village Sowing\" Brings Goods to Support Net Red Agricultural Products\n\nIn terms of industry cooperation, Wen Zhong said that the head categories broadcast live on Taobao in 2018 are clothing, jewelry, gourmet food, beauty makeup, etc. In 2019, there will be more opportunities in such potential categories as men's clothing, department stores, mothers and babies, musical instruments, outdoor and home decoration.\n\nIn addition, Taobao Live Broadcast Ceremony announced the launch of the \" Village Broadcast Plan\": 1,000 anchor farmers with a monthly income of more than 10,000 will be trained in 100 counties to help agricultural products go up in the form of anchors carrying goods.\n\nImage: Agricultural product live room / Southern Metropolis Daily via Tencent News\n\nAccording to reports, in the past year, Taobao Live held more than 150,000 live broadcasts of agricultural products and more than 400 million people watched them online, forming a special live broadcast featuring \" anchor+county magistrate+star\". During last year's Taobao Double 12, 28 poor counties' high-quality agricultural products became \" Taobao Township Red\". Taobao set up poverty alleviation venues for these agricultural products and voted for online red agricultural products. Taobao anchors brought goods free of charge during prime time, opening up new markets for agricultural products in poor areas.\n\n\" We hope that Taobao Live Broadcast can really empower local villagers, such as targeted excavation and cultivation of local village broadcast\" Internet Red \" so that villagers can become rich on their own. At the same time, agricultural products will reach consumers in a more vivid and intuitive way, and direct broadcasting will be the fastest and most convenient way to help the poor through science and technology. \" The head of Taobao Live and PGC, Qi Lan, said.\n\n\" There are two dimensions to doing village broadcasting. The first is that people in rural areas faced many difficulties when doing live broadcasting in the past, including not knowing much about logistics and e-commerce packaging. On the other hand, it is to raise the temperature of the business, \" Wen Zhong said.\" Today we can do it with better services, including calling on the anchor to go to the countryside to do it first, and at the same time allowing local TV stations and county heads to try live broadcasting. The exploration in the past four or five months has now brought the opportunity for live broadcasting in the countryside to mature. \"\n\nArticle source", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "How to Get Access to Pointofsale \u2013 Find the Top POS Software Development Company", "score": 1, "url": "https://pos-systemsforretail.blogspot.com/2019/03/how-to-get-access-to-pointofsale-find.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "\n\n\n\nPOS Systems or PointofSale is an advanced retail management system helps you in a number o fways.

Surrounded by housing societies like Koral Town, Fazaia Housing Colony, Madina Town and Gulzar-e-Quaid Housing Colony, the Ghauri Town Housing Society is majorly targeted at buyers from the mid-range income group.\n\nGhauri Town however has been operating without a No Objection Certificate (NOC) and is declared illegal by the Capital Development Authority (CDA). Owners of the housing scheme never obtained an NOC from the civic agency to pursue transaction of commercial and residential schemes. CDA has ask for an NOC and the housing scheme owners are busy dealing with.\n\nClose by Islamabad Expressway, Ghauri Town is located at a prime location. Educational institutes are easily accessible. Airport Chowk, Koral Chowk, PWD, Park Road and Faizabad Interchange are within reach. Daily commute to the commercial hub of Rawalpindi and Islamabad takes no more than 40 minutes.\n\nGhauri Town Islamabad comprises of 8 Phases. Phases 1-5 of Ghauri Town are situated on both sides of the main road passing through Ghauri Town.

A market in the locality of Phase 7 and 8 have already been planned and are undergoing rapid development. Availability of underground sewerage, public transport, town security, graveyard, recreational parks and mosques makes it an attractive residential place to live in.\n\nPhase 8 of Ghauri Town is a development of great value situated near Islamabad Express Way. Only 2 km away from the Airport Chowk, this phase is attached to Ghauri Garden main road and Ghauri Town Phase 5. It is accessible from Gulberg Islamabad and Lehtrar Road is right next to it.

One is the surgical knife. The other is the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine.\n\nThe latter is an unforgettable and disorienting experience. The patient rests on a table propped against a large tube-shaped machine. Inside the tube are several coils, designed to induce a strong magnetic force against the object inserted inside of it. MRIs are used as a form of noninvasive imaging technology, allowing doctors to see what\u2019s going on inside your body without having to cut you up to do so.\n\nThe important thing for me is not that there will be nice pictures but that we can quickly set the right diagnosis on the patient...We do not always need the best resolution\n\nThe experience of going under the MRI scan can be frightening, with many patients reporting feelings of anxiety and claustrophobia on entering it. The combination of the confined space and the irregular sound of the machine\u2014a mix between a buzzsaw and a buzzer\u2014makes for an experience that children often find frightening.\n\nWith scans taking anywhere between ten minutes to an entire hour, hospitals across the world have tried various methods to make their MRI machines less frightening to children. Some offer headphones, some paint the machine in bright colours, and some even offer sedatives and anti-anxiety medication to those who need it. But a new development in Sweden could make the process exponentially less scary by reducing the total time under the machine to less than a minute.\n\nResearchers Stefen Skare and Tim Sprenger at the Karolinska Institute in Solna devised the new method using 5,000 lines of code and existing technology. MRI scans currently use a variety of scanning techniques, with the images combined together to make for multiple inferences. One of these techniques, Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI), allows for images to be taken really quickly. Skare and Sprenger managed to mix EPI and MRI scans into one method (EPI-Mix) that could substitute against traditional imaging techniques. The result is a blurrier image, but one that corresponds with traditional MRI scans at about 97 percent according to the as-yet unpublished study. After initial results proved promising, they formed a larger team to investigate the feasibility of the new technique.\n\nSpeaking to Dagens Medicin, researcher Anna Falk Delgado (a specialist physician in radiology) said, \u201cThe important thing for me is not that there will be nice pictures but that we can quickly set the right diagnosis on the patient, therefore this method is so interesting. We do not always need the best resolution.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Skare and his team successfully demonstrated a 70-second brain scan on a moving subject using the process, with the results syncing up well with traditional MRI scans. To demonstrate the technique\u2019s efficiency, Skare has released a video showing 30 patients receiving multiple scans in under an hour.\n\nSprenger, who works for GE Healthcare\u2014the company that makes the MRI machines used \u2013 says the technology has been released to researchers across the world. \u201cWe have made the method available to anyone who wants to test it. So far, there are twelve other universities and hospitals in the United States, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Sweden that have begun to use it. It is very valuable because then we get feedback on what they think and what can be problems.\u201d\n\nThe team won the 2018 Athena Prize for their findings.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tgkZ68lmwP0O4ZiTq-i0FlYjIOskSV9I-5MYCqG6aQM.jpg"}, {"title": "Electrical Engineering Jobs in Sydney \u2013 Apply at Electrician Xchange", "score": 1, "url": "https://electricianxchange.wordpress.com/2019/03/25/electrical-engineering-jobs-in-sydney-apply-at-electrician-xchange/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "Are you looking for electrical engineering jobs in Sydney or looking for electrician jobs according to your requirement?\n\nAfter completing B.

On Oprah\u2019s XM Radio Show she interviews Esther Hicks about her involvement in \"The Secret.\" Oprah and Esther Hicks also talk about the Law of Attraction, and how Esther Hicks learned to channel Source Energy, called Abraham.\n\n\u25ba\u25baIn this video, Oprah talks about why both she and the mainstream population were not yet ready for \u201cAbraham\u201d and Esther. Abraham is the name for the collective entity that channels through Esther Hicks. Oprah is a big fan of spirituality and enjoys talking about anything that has to do with personal development.\n\nWhile she embraces Abraham, she just felt that the general public would not embrace the thing with channeling. For many it seems to be quite \u201cspaced out\u201d. That is why Esther wasn\u2019t invited to one of Oprah\u2019s TV shows. A radio interview is what Oprah thought would be best, and it would be easier to embrace since many her radio listeners are open to things in terms of spirituality. Oprah further talks about the enormous impact that the \u201cThe Secret\u201c movie have done on people, and how the interest is growing for this topic about the Law of Attraction. Esther Hicks who is the co-author of \u201cThe Law of Attraction: The Basics of the Teachings of Abraham\u201d, mentions that as inspirational speaker she is not working by herself. She channels a \u201ccollective voice\u201d which is called \u201cAbraham\u201d. That is why she likes to call the material that is coming through for \u201cAbraham-Hicks\u201d. During the radio session, there is an opportunity when Oprah gets the chance to communicate with \u201cAbraham\u201d. Esther prepares herself by breathing, relaxing before allowing the collective voice to come through her. Oprah does not really know what to expect when she experiences Esther channeling the collective consciousness, but she is very excited about it. Once Esther is channeling, Oprah notices that Esther is speaking in a little bit different way with another tone to her voice. Esther mentions for Oprah of what Abraham can bring to people. Abraham is not interested in telling people exactly what they should or should not do, because everyone is to create their own true reality. Abraham is only interested in communicating how everyone can create their own life path. Every circumstance and event that you are involved in is attracted to you, by you. With your thoughts, you are able to change any circumstance you want. Oprah concludes that with an understanding of the Law of Attraction, together with the understanding that you deliberately can create your own life, will without doubt show you a way to complete freedom as long as you practice and allow it.\"\n\n\n\nLaw Of Attraction Affirmation:\n\nI AM WHOLE\n\nI AM PERFECT\n\nI AM STRONG\n\nI AM POWERFUL\n\nI AM LOVING\n\nI AM HARMONIOUS\n\nI AM HAPPY\n\n\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: All audio content belongs to their original creators/owners.

Hot on their heels are Austria, Greece and Latvia, who look certain to hit their targets.\n\nImage: Eurostat\n\nIt is unlikely to come as a surprise to hear that the Nordics are well-represented among the strongest performers; Sweden came top with 54.5% of its energy coming from renewable sources. That was a long way ahead of the second-placed country, Finland, with 41% \u2013 followed by Latvia with 39% and Denmark with 35.8%. Despite its strong performance, Latvia is yet to hit its target but is only around 1% away.\n\nBringing up the rear, the Netherlands is the furthest away from its goal \u2013 7.4 percentage points (pp) away from its 2020 objective. France is next (6.7 pp), followed by Ireland (5.3 pp) and the UK (4.8 pp).\n\nReductions in fossil fuel use per year, 2016 Image: EEA\n\nThe first year in which the share of renewable energy was measured across the EU was 2004, when it made up 8.5% of the total. By 2016 that had risen to 17% and 17.5% for 2017.\n\nBut while the overall share of renewables being used to meet the energy needs of EU member states has doubled since 2005, the rate of adoption is slowing down. If that trend continues it could cause several member states, and possibly the whole EU, to miss its 2030 target of at least 32% renewable contribution to energy consumption.\n\nThe share of renewables increased by an average of 5.5% per year between 2005 and 2015. But that rate of growth decreased by 0.2 percentage points in 2016 and by 0.3 percentage points in 2017 when compared with the 2005-2015 pace of change. This was mostly due to an increase in the total amount of energy consumed \u2013 put simply, renewables weren\u2019t able to keep up with demand \u2013 and the European Environment Agency is calling for more investment and more ambitious infrastructure projects.\n\nHeadline investment figures don\u2019t always tell the whole story Image: Bloomberg NEF\n\nLast year, global investment in renewables like wind and solar energy, along with energy tech such as smart meters, topped $332 billion. But that was a decrease of 8% on the previous year. The biggest player in the clean energy sector for 2018 was China, which invested around $100 billion \u2013 a 32% drop on the 2017 figure. There was also a 53% decline in China\u2019s ongoing investment in solar power, prompted by the withdrawal of generous subsidy rates.\n\nDespite that falling trend in investment, there are some positive trends in the clean energy world. Falling costs have been an influence on the overall level of spending, with cost-per-unit falling while the number of installations has risen. Although there was a 24% drop in global solar spending in 2018, solar installation capacity hit 109 gigawatts in 2018, up from 99 gigawatts the previous year, according to Bloomberg.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fN24pbv1kzNOnWCR92cxEWrD39QHYzaDVWx3LUmiUl4.jpg"}, {"title": "New York approves statewide plastic bag ban", "score": 113, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-approves-statewide-plastic-bag-ban/", "comments": 7, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "New York's Democrat-controlled legislature worked into the night Sunday to wrap up work on a new state budget that includes new tolls on motorists driving into the busiest parts of Manhattan and a statewide ban on plastic bags. The Senate and Assembly began voting on budget bills Sunday and hoped to finish their work on the $175.5 billion spending plan early Monday.\n\nIn addition to new tolls and the bag ban, the budget calls for closing up to three yet-to-be-determined state prisons, eliminating cash bail for misdemeanor and non-violent felony arrests, a permanent, annual 2 percent cap on local property taxes, and another $1 billion for public education.\n\n\"This budget is probably the strongest progressive statement that we've made,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters Sunday as lawmakers worked through hours of debate and voting on the budget. \"If you have big problems, it calls for big solutions.\"\n\nIn an agreement reached earlier last week but not officially announced until Sunday, most single-use plastic bags provided by supermarkets and other stores will be banned statewide starting March 1, 2020. Individual counties will have the option of charging 5 cents for paper bags, with 2 cents going to local governments and 3 cents to the state's Environmental Protection Fund.\n\nNew York would be just the third state with a statewide ban. California's ban has been in place since 2016. All of Hawaii's counties ban plastic bags but it's not a state-mandated ban.\n\n\"The convenience of plastic bags is simply not worth the environmental impact,\" said Carl Heastie, D-Yonkers. \"By reducing our state's usage, we will see less litter in our communities and less plastic pollution in our waterways.\"\n\nMajor issues that didn't make it into the spending plan include legalization of recreational marijuana. Cuomo and legislative leaders have said the issue was too complex to rush into the budget. Instead, it could be handled in separate legislation worked out over the last three months of the legislative session, scheduled to end June 19.\n\nThe Manhattan tolls plan known as congestion pricing will be the first of its kind in the nation. State leaders said a review board will determine the toll amount, exemptions and credits for drivers headed into the borough's central business district. The billions the tolls are expected to raise will go toward fixing New York City's ailing mass transit system, though a portion of the revenue will go to the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North\n\nAn earlier estimate had put the toll amount for personal vehicles at nearly $12. Cuomo said without the tolls, either the subways could continue to deteriorate or fares for subways and city buses would have had to go up 30 percent.\n\n\"That was the choice,\" he said of the toll. \"You need a viable mass transit system.\"\n\nThe state budget also will include two other dedicated revenue sources for the subways: a \"mansion tax\" on Manhattan homes that sell for $25 million or higher, and an internet sales tax levied on retailers who sell merchandise online.\n\nThe funding streams for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority include a reorganization plan and other reforms Cuomo has demanded for the agency that runs the city's buses, subways and commuter trains.\n\nIn addition to eliminating cash bail for some charges, other criminal justice reforms include requiring prosecutors and defense lawyers to share all case information well in advance of trials, and speeding up the time it takes for a case to go to trial.\n\nThe budget agreement also establishes a state commission that will come up with a system for public financing of legislative and statewide offices, with up to $100 million in taxpayer funds authorized annually for such a system.\n\nCuomo and legislative leaders also agreed to legislation that would allow three hours of paid time off for New Yorkers to vote on Election Day and expand voting hours upstate in primary elections to begin at 6 a.m. instead of noon to match general election hours.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wRjgHd1nv1sPOzB7o4ESdm8jlCBCxZ0NaNZVqnnUsGw.jpg"}, {"title": "AN INTRODUCTION To GPS (\"Global Positioning System\") TECHNOLOGY", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=qrQtsc672Ig&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAWp6KUQCjBk%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "WWII veteran celebrates 100th birthday, makes plans for Honor Flight", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.seniorveterans.care/blog/wwii-veteran-celebrates-100th-birthday-makes-plans-for-honor-flight-217", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - Wayne Trimpe celebrated his 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening.

Though the wall is currently only about 15% percent complete, it has already dramatically impacted the participating countries.\n\nOver 12 million acres (5 million hectares) of degraded land has been restored in Nigeria; roughly 30 million acres of drought-resistant trees have been planted across Senegal; and a whopping 37 million acres of land has been restored in Ethiopia \u2013 just to name a few of the states involved.\n\nWATCH: Island on the Brink of Disaster Plants Thousands of Trees and is Now a Poster Kid for Adapting to Climate Change\n\nByproducts of the restored landscape include many groundwater wells refilled with drinking water, rural towns with additional food supplies, and new sources of work and income for villagers, thanks to the need for tree maintenance.\n\nContinuing the wall\u2019s development is currently being backed by a host of international governments and conservation groups from around the world \u2013 and once the wall is completed, it will the largest living structure on the casinoplay planet, three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\u201cThere are many world wonders, but the Great Green Wall will be unique and everyone can be a part of its history,\u201d said Dr. Dlamini Zuma, chairperson of the African Union Commission. \u201cTogether, we can change the future of African communities in the Sahel.\u201d\n\n(WATCH the 2017 BBC video below) \u2013 Photo by Great Green Wall\n\nPlant Some Positivity By Sharing The Good News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Sen.

Other Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have also given their full-throated support of the bill, signing on as co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cThe War on Drugs has not been a war on drugs, it\u2019s been a war on people, and disproportionately people of color and low-income individuals,\u201d Booker said in a statement provided by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). \u201cThe Marijuana Justice Act seeks to reverse decades of this unfair, unjust, and failed policy.\u201d\n\nThe failed War on Drugs has really been a war on people\u2014disproportionately criminalizing poor people, people of color & people with mental illness. I\u2019m reintroducing the #MarijuanaJustice Act to begin reversing our failed federal drug policies. Join us: https://t.co/K4Xgmai5xk \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) February 28, 2019\n\nThroughout his career, Booker has been intensely focused on marijuana law reform. He first tried to introduce a version of the Marijuana Justice Act in 2017; although the bill was introduced to the Senate in August of that year, it failed to progress further, according to Congress.gov.\n\nSince announcing his presidential run, Booker has made it clear that federal legalization will be a cornerstone of his campaign. In his first radio interview after publicly announcing his candidacy, Booker told radio show host Tom Joyner that criminal justice reform would be a major focus of his campaign: \u201cIt means changing our drugs laws. Ending prohibition against marijuana,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough recreational marijuana is currently legal in ten states, as well as Washington, D.C., it is not legal on the federal level. According to data from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), black people are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, even though both groups use marijuana at similar levels.\n\nWhile the Marijuana Justice Act is intended to combat the disproportionate effects of criminalization on people of color, it\u2019s not entirely clear whether that would be the case. A 2018 report by the Drug Policy Alliance, for instance, found that even in states where marijuana is legal, people of color were still arrested more often than white people on marijuana possession charges.\n\nYet Booker is hopeful this sweeping legislation can affect broader change. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to simply decriminalize marijuana. We must also repair the damage caused by reinvesting in those communities that have been most harmed by the War on Drugs,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cAnd we must expunge the records of those who have served their time. The end we seek is not just legalization, it\u2019s justice.\u201d\n\n", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wvAGYRIm5NdJ7rCdUGhG1E49yGIVuB9ACipfwSH5Ibk.jpg"}, {"title": "Marshall University fundraiser to help needy families", "score": 7, "url": "https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Marshall-University-fundraiser-to-help-needy-families-507945101.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "Marshall University is conducting an annual fundraiser this month to help feed needy families.\n\nThe university says in a news release the 16th annual Empty Bowls event will take place April 12 at the First Presbyterian Church in Huntington.\n\nMarshall students and volunteers are making ceramic bowls for purchase at the four-hour event.

These overarching aims were set last June as part of Ikea\u2019s refreshed \u2018People and Planet Positive\u2019 sustainability strategy.\n\nPublished late last week, the sustainability report reveals that 60% of all the raw materials Ikea sourced to produce products during 2018 were from \u201crenewable\u201d sources such as cotton and bamboo, with a further 10% accounted for by pre or post-consumer recycled material. It claims that Ikea is \u201con track\u201d to achieve 100% by 2030 but will need to work with industry to spur the creation of larger supply chains for recycled materials such as wood, plastic and fabrics.\n\nThe 59-page report additionally notes that 100% of the cotton sourced by Ikea during 2018 was certified as sustainable for a second year running, while the proportion stood at 85% for wood \u2013 up from 77% in 2017.\n\nWith regards to renewable power, the report reveals that Ikea now uses renewable generation to meet 86.7% of the heating and 81.1% of the electricity needs across its manufacturing supply chain. Key renewable arrays installed during 2018 include an 18,240-panel rooftop solar solution on Ikea\u2019s Industry production unit in Portugal and an innovative solar cooling system at its Alexandra store in Singapore. The system converts thermal heat into chilled water for air conditioning in the store and has reduced the site\u2019s energy consumption by almost one-quarter (24%) to date.\n\n\u201cWe always think long term, innovating to ensure that our actions to meet people\u2019s needs today do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs,\u201d the Inter Ikea Group\u2019s head of sustainability Lena Pripp-Kovac wrote in the report foreword.\n\n\u201cThis requires us to rethink and inspire changes in lifestyles and consumption and to transform our way of working \u2013 from linear to circular, from consuming to regenerating resources.\u201d\n\nClimate positive challenges\n\nThe progress update comes as Ikea is striving to become \u201cclimate-positive\u201d by 2030 \u2013 an aim the firm has defined as fulfilling its contribution to the Paris Agreement through an emissions reduction across the value chain that is aligned to climate science.\n\nThe multinational is targeting an 80% climate footprint reduction from stores and operations in absolute terms by 2030 \u2013 against a 2016 baseline \u2013 which aligns to a 2C target and aims towards the 1.5C trajectory towards the end of the century. Ikea claims that reducing emissions by 15% from the value chain by 2030 translates to a 70% reduction in climate footprint on average per product, and is therefore working to decarbonise key materials, food ingredients and transport, while setting more ambitious reduction targets for direct suppliers.\n\nAccording to the new sustainability report, the climate footprint of Ikea\u2019s value chain during 2018 was 2.8% higher than in 2016, largely due to the expansion of the business. It lists the key contributors to the business\u2019s overall climate footprint as raw materials (36.4%), product use at home (22.2%) and customer travel and home deliveries (15.5%).\n\n\u201cDecoupling our growth from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will take time, and we expect our emissions to increase for a few years before decreasing,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cBecoming climate positive will be a huge challenge for Ikea. We will only achieve it by joining together with others and listening to feedback from our stakeholders on how to improve.\u201d\n\nLiving Lagom\n\nThe report also lists a number of other key sustainability challenges which lay between Ikea and the achievement of its sustainability goals, including the improvement of working conditions throughout its supply chains, the need to bolster value chain reporting and the urgency of inspiring new sustainable consumption models among the general public.\n\nThe latter of these challenges has long been addressed by Ikea\u2019s \u201cLive Lagom\u201d campaign, which urges consumers to adopt its Swedish cultural vision of creating a home in which they create a harmonious lifestyle by not wasting resources or energy. The scheme has included the launch of dozens of innovative products designed to make home living more sustainable, including meatless meatballs, a kitchen made using 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and PCR wood and energy-efficient lighting.\n\nNew products unveiled within this range last year include air-purifying curtains, a water-saving mister nozzle and vegetarian hotdogs, while Ikea is also in the process of transforming its offerings and store models to encourage more sustainable consumption and travel habits. The firm\u2019s new Greenwich store, for example, includes an interactive upcycling hub and lab, a network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers and real-time displays of public transport information. It additionally offers customers the chance to have their items delivered by e-bike or electric van and to send their end-of-life products for recycling when they receive a delivery of new goods.\n\nTurning Ambition into Action at edie Live 2019\n\nIn a similarly honest fashion to Ikea, a number of big businesses including Landsec, Sky and Waitrose will appear at edie Live (21-22 May 2019) to discuss the challenges and opportunities to achieving a sustainable future.\n\nThe two-day show \u2013 edie's biggest event of the year \u2013 has become a highlight of the calendar for sustainability, energy and environment professionals looking for new ideas and solutions that will help them achieve a low-carbon, resource efficient and profitable future for their business.\n\nRegister for your free edie Live 2019 pass here.\n\nSarah George", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ENHaqN8bQNC17A5VRF7LwG77ZFTXjFEsCZgO4Mi8qCE.jpg"}, {"title": "Public Heaps Praise On Michigan Boy Seen In Video Filling Potholes", "score": 21, "url": "https://wwjnews.radio.com/articles/michigan-boy-video-filling-potholes", "comments": 3, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "MUSKEGON HEIGHTS, Mich.

Any trees that are diseased or near death will be replaced with new, healthy trees.\n\nThe trees were to be cut down on Monday, just ahead of Nashville's annual Cherry Blossom Festival. The festival includes a walk along the cherry tree-lined downtown riverfront on April 13. The 2019 NFL draft takes place in Nashville April 25-27.\n\nThe Tennessean reports the NFL and Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. had previously said they would donate 200 cherry trees each to Metro Parks for planting throughout the city.\n\nAfter plans to cut the cherry trees were made public, Nashville Tree Foundation Board president Noni Nielsen called the removal \"incredibly short-sighted\" for a one-time event that will last only a few days.\n\nTracey Shafroth, an advocate for tree planting across the city, said the new trees were not a replacement for the old ones because it would take many years for them to reach maturity.\n\n\"We don't plant trees for ourselves, we plant them for our grandchildren,'' Shafroth said. \"They take a long time to grow, and their benefits grow as they grow.''\n\nAccording to city officials, Briley's office discussed removing the trees with Metro Parks Horticulturist Randall Lance after learning that the size of the NFL draft stage and other structures would require it.\n\nLance planted the majority of the trees a number of years ago. He said some of the trees in the area are dead or compromised and should be replaced. The city had planned to use their removal as an opportunity to restore the soil and replant new, healthy trees.\n\nOn Saturday, Briley said in the news release that in addition to the 21 trees that will be relocated, the NFL and Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. will plant 17 more cherry trees at downtown Riverfront Park in previously vacant and new locations.\n\nAlong with the 200 trees to be planted in other parts of the city, the plan will allow Nashville to \"continue to honor our relationship with Japan and longtime partnership with the Cherry Blossom Festival,\" Briley said.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9-PupxfUbji7BWKD1m2xk6k8dzZupExbEh2a-f4FUyI.jpg"}, {"title": "Meet The 61-Year-Old Hero Who Gave Give Birth To Her Own Granddaughter", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/woman-gives-birth-granddaughter_n_5c9e5890e4b0474c08ce4c1b", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "When Matthew Eledge and his husband Elliot Dougherty began talking about starting a family three years ago, they looked to their tight-knit family for their thoughts.\n\nWhat they got in return was so much more than just advice.\n\nA casual joke about Cecile Eledge, Matthew\u2019s mom, lending a hand in the process turned into a miraculous joint effort when she delivered the couple\u2019s daughter, Uma, on March 25.\n\nLea Yribe, Elliot\u2019s sister, supplied the egg, Matthew supplied the sperm, and Cecile served as the surrogate. In an effort to clarify the confusion (of which there was much) about exactly who was involved in the pregnancy and how, Matthew devised a lovingly hilarious way to explain his mom\u2019s participation in the process.\n\nAriel Panowicz Cecile Eledge and her granddaughter Uma.\n\n\u201cSometimes even really intelligent people hear this story and think it\u2019s incest,\u201d Eledge told HuffPost. \u201cWe get really honest questions from really smart people like, \u2018Are you scared of the genetic abnormalities?\u2019 It\u2019s a fine question, it\u2019s a unique situation, but I think it\u2019s easiest to spell it out in layman\u2019s terms: My mother was simply the oven.\u201d\n\nCecile\u2019s pristine health made her a perfectly viable candidate to carry an embryo, despite the fact that, at 61, she had already gone through menopause. So she agreed to be the surrogate for Matthew and Elliot and underwent a series of intense cardiology, pulmonary and physical tests \u2015 and then braced herself to receive bad news.\n\n\u201cThere was a part of me thinking, it will be a miracle if we pass every test, there is going to be something,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cI knew if I wasn\u2019t going to be a healthy candidate, I would never put the baby in jeopardy. Every time I would go talk to another doctor, whether my internist or cardiologist, they looked and said \u2018There\u2019s absolutely no reason you can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe family worked with Dr. Carolyn Doherty, a reproductive endocrinologist at Methodist Reproductive Health Specialists in Omaha, Nebraska. She told HuffPost that \u201cpretty much no 61-year-old\u201d would typically be a candidate for surrogacy, citing health risks like high blood pressure, hypertension and heart failure, to name only a few. But Cecile was cleared of any issues and approved to carry her own grandchild.\n\nI looked at my husband and said, \u2018Well, I guess we\u2019re gonna go on a little adventure. Cecile Eledge\n\nThere was also the matter of money \u2015 lots and lots of it. Eledge estimates that they spent around $40,000 for the entire process. Using Cecile as a carrier meant that at least they could eliminate the cost of paying a surrogate, which can run between $25,000 and $35,000 on top of any health-related expenses, according to Doherty.\n\n\u201cI think the one thing people don\u2019t understand is how expensive it is to hire a surrogate,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cWhen you have to pay all the medical expenses for a surrogate \u2015 no insurance covers that \u2015 and then that person ends up in the hospital, that could bankrupt someone.\u201d\n\nCecile was put on estrogen to bring back her period, and then she did something she says she never in her wildest dreams ever dreamed she\u2019d do 30 years after her last child was born: She got pregnant.\n\n\u201cI looked at my husband and said, \u2018Well, I guess we\u2019re gonna go on a little adventure,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAriel Panowicz Matthew and Elliot look on as Cecile holds baby Uma.\n\nThe family was especially fortunate in that the egg retrieval and the insemination process were both successful on the first try. Doherty explained that success is based on the age of the egg.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we were using very young eggs from Elliot\u2019s sister was really to Cecile\u2019s benefit,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus, they had undergone pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy [chromosomal abnormalities], so we knew to the best of our ability in this day and age that it was genetically normal, which helps out, too.\u201d\n\nPregnancy was a bit different for Cecile this time around than it was 30 years ago. The guidelines of what you can and cannot do have changed, and she said she felt things like morning sickness a bit more intensely. Luckily, though, \u201cWe never had any big hiccups \u2015 I can\u2019t complain,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat they did have to deal with, however, were the seemingly unending questions people had about the unusual circumstances surrounding the pregnancy.\n\nAriel Panowicz Elliot Dougherty, Matthew Eledge and Kirk Eledge share an emotional moment during Uma's delivery.\n\n\u201cThere was always general confusion, which never really offended me because it\u2019s such a unique situation,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cThere was always serious curiosity and then when you explain it, it was like \u2018Oh, this is amazing! Your mom is a rock star.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cRock star\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to cut it, especially considering doctors often won\u2019t allow someone over 50 to undergo in vitro fertilization. Doherty said her practice begins carefully scrutinizing potential surrogates beginning at age 45, but noted it\u2019s not necessarily the case for all reproductive endocrinologists.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is my health was good,\u201d Cecile said. \u201cI kept thinking 60s are the new 40s, and people in their 40s are having babies. Sixty-one is just a number; it\u2019s how you feel and your health that was really the motivation.\u201d\n\nCecile was admitted to the hospital earlier than planned when her blood pressure rose into a range that concerned her doctors \u2015 but Uma was strong and healthy, and Cecile delivered the baby vaginally. Cecile said she was calm and relaxed after the birth, knowing her work was done.\n\nAriel Panowicz Matthew Eledge, Elliot Dougherty and baby Uma.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would say, \u2018Are you going to be able to hand this baby over when you\u2019ve been carrying her for nine months?\u2019\u201d Cecile said. \u201cEvery time we went to an ultrasound or an appointment, I looked at her as my granddaughter \u2015 never something I owned or possessed. All I visualized was being able to deliver naturally and to hand her over to Matt and Elliot, who were so desperate and so deserving of making their dream a reality.\u201d\n\nMatthew revealed there were some visual boundaries in the delivery room \u2015 \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to see everything, right?\u201d he said, laughing \u2015 but described seeing his mother as a warrior through the experience. \u201cShe tapped into this primitive, visceral spirit and dug deep and just did it. To see her on such an intense level, bringing life to this beautiful, healthy, awesome baby was so cool for me to see.\u201d\n\nConsidering how open Cecile has been about her incredibly intimate experience, it may come as a surprise to learn she views herself as a private person. But it was important to the entire family that their story be shared \u2015 and each member had his or her own reason as to why. Cecile was floored by the fact that since the pregnancy involved two men trying to have a child, the process was considered uterus donation and was not covered by insurance.\n\nAriel Panowicz Baby Uma.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen first-hand the discrimination gay couples here who want a child experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t get coverage whatsoever, and I struggle with that. To see discrimination is heartbreaking, and I would like to see that change down the line with our health care and [I want to be an] advocate for that.\u201d\n\nKirk Eledge, Matthew\u2019s father and Cecile\u2019s husband, hopes people can understand that all couples should have the same opportunities. \u201cWe have a granddaughter who has the blood and DNA from both Elliot and Matt running through her, and that\u2019s what this whole journey was about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deserve to have families just like everyone else.\u201d\n\nMatthew told HuffPost he \u201ccrumbles\u201d when he looks at Uma, and plans to tell her \u201cevery freaking thing\u201d about her miraculous journey into the world, though he predicts she won\u2019t be quite as taken with the story as the whole family is right now.\n\nAs for what life is now like for the two new happy dads, things have \u2015 obviously \u2015 changed a lot. Matthew is completely in new parent mode and finds there are often moments when he\u2019s too happily distracted by taking care of Uma to attend to little daily matters. In fact, he recently found himself answering his front door with only one sandal on, and when he brought Uma home from the hospital, he realized he hadn\u2019t brushed his teeth in days. \u201cI was like, oh my god, this is disgusting,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nBut at least one thing has stayed nearly the same.\n\n\u201cIt sounds so cliche and I hate it, but it\u2019s true \u2015 nothing could have prepared me for how I feel right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives me a deeper respect and love for my husband to see us be so anxious and nervous and passionate about something together, and it\u2019s refreshing because we\u2019re at a place [in our lives] where we come home, order Thai food and watch \u2018Real Housewives of New York City.\u2019 I mean, the first night we came home we watched \u2018Housewives,\u2019 but we did it with Uma and Thai food and just switched off shifts.\u201d\n\nAriel Panowicz Cecile Eledge gave birth to her granddaughter on March 25.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "How to Prep Your Product Launch with a Coming Soon Page [internetMarketing]", "score": 1, "url": "http://blog.ebulkemailmarketing.com/how-to-prep-your-product-launch-with-a-coming-soon-page/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "You include an amazing thought.

These overarching aims were set last June as part of Ikea\u2019s refreshed \u2018People and Planet Positive\u2019 sustainability strategy.\n\nPublished late last week, the sustainability report reveals that 60% of all the raw materials Ikea sourced to produce products during 2018 were from \u201crenewable\u201d sources such as cotton and bamboo, with a further 10% accounted for by pre or post-consumer recycled material. It claims that Ikea is \u201con track\u201d to achieve 100% by 2030 but will need to work with industry to spur the creation of larger supply chains for recycled materials such as wood, plastic and fabrics.\n\nThe 59-page report additionally notes that 100% of the cotton sourced by Ikea during 2018 was certified as sustainable for a second year running, while the proportion stood at 85% for wood \u2013 up from 77% in 2017.\n\nWith regards to renewable power, the report reveals that Ikea now uses renewable generation to meet 86.7% of the heating and 81.1% of the electricity needs across its manufacturing supply chain. Key renewable arrays installed during 2018 include an 18,240-panel rooftop solar solution on Ikea\u2019s Industry production unit in Portugal and an innovative solar cooling system at its Alexandra store in Singapore. The system converts thermal heat into chilled water for air conditioning in the store and has reduced the site\u2019s energy consumption by almost one-quarter (24%) to date.\n\n\u201cWe always think long term, innovating to ensure that our actions to meet people\u2019s needs today do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs,\u201d the Inter Ikea Group\u2019s head of sustainability Lena Pripp-Kovac wrote in the report foreword.\n\n\u201cThis requires us to rethink and inspire changes in lifestyles and consumption and to transform our way of working \u2013 from linear to circular, from consuming to regenerating resources.\u201d\n\nClimate positive challenges\n\nThe progress update comes as Ikea is striving to become \u201cclimate-positive\u201d by 2030 \u2013 an aim the firm has defined as fulfilling its contribution to the Paris Agreement through an emissions reduction across the value chain that is aligned to climate science.\n\nThe multinational is targeting an 80% climate footprint reduction from stores and operations in absolute terms by 2030 \u2013 against a 2016 baseline \u2013 which aligns to a 2C target and aims towards the 1.5C trajectory towards the end of the century. Ikea claims that reducing emissions by 15% from the value chain by 2030 translates to a 70% reduction in climate footprint on average per product, and is therefore working to decarbonise key materials, food ingredients and transport, while setting more ambitious reduction targets for direct suppliers.\n\nAccording to the new sustainability report, the climate footprint of Ikea\u2019s value chain during 2018 was 2.8% higher than in 2016, largely due to the expansion of the business. It lists the key contributors to the business\u2019s overall climate footprint as raw materials (36.4%), product use at home (22.2%) and customer travel and home deliveries (15.5%).\n\n\u201cDecoupling our growth from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will take time, and we expect our emissions to increase for a few years before decreasing,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cBecoming climate positive will be a huge challenge for Ikea. We will only achieve it by joining together with others and listening to feedback from our stakeholders on how to improve.\u201d\n\nLiving Lagom\n\nThe report also lists a number of other key sustainability challenges which lay between Ikea and the achievement of its sustainability goals, including the improvement of working conditions throughout its supply chains, the need to bolster value chain reporting and the urgency of inspiring new sustainable consumption models among the general public.\n\nThe latter of these challenges has long been addressed by Ikea\u2019s \u201cLive Lagom\u201d campaign, which urges consumers to adopt its Swedish cultural vision of creating a home in which they create a harmonious lifestyle by not wasting resources or energy. The scheme has included the launch of dozens of innovative products designed to make home living more sustainable, including meatless meatballs, a kitchen made using 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and PCR wood and energy-efficient lighting.\n\nNew products unveiled within this range last year include air-purifying curtains, a water-saving mister nozzle and vegetarian hotdogs, while Ikea is also in the process of transforming its offerings and store models to encourage more sustainable consumption and travel habits. The firm\u2019s new Greenwich store, for example, includes an interactive upcycling hub and lab, a network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers and real-time displays of public transport information. It additionally offers customers the chance to have their items delivered by e-bike or electric van and to send their end-of-life products for recycling when they receive a delivery of new goods.\n\nTurning Ambition into Action at edie Live 2019\n\nIn a similarly honest fashion to Ikea, a number of big businesses including Landsec, Sky and Waitrose will appear at edie Live (21-22 May 2019) to discuss the challenges and opportunities to achieving a sustainable future.\n\nThe two-day show \u2013 edie's biggest event of the year \u2013 has become a highlight of the calendar for sustainability, energy and environment professionals looking for new ideas and solutions that will help them achieve a low-carbon, resource efficient and profitable future for their business.\n\nRegister for your free edie Live 2019 pass here.\n\nSarah George", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "A BUSINESS Trip Going TO CHINA", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=1QI8prtvubs&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4skNcXmtiyA%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "Published on Apr 1, 2019\n\nThis is more or less like going Around The World in 80 Days From A to Z.\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE FOR DAILY VIDEOS: http://bit.ly/2BnpFfz\n\n\n\n#travel #worldtravel #aroundtheworldin80days\n\n\n\nSubscribe to my channel: http://bit.ly/2BnpFfz T\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2DU9Fn1\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2GcUlnE\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2BnpFfz\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2DU9Fn1\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2GcUlnE\n\n\n\nTravel the world's many wonders that has little known places of interest to visit and enjoy:\n\n\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2TuConO\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Lenaaround: \"In today's video I'm going to share with you guys a few things you should know before traveling to Beijing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\nChina is a place of amazing beauty, many curiosities and a wealth of interesting facts.

Researchers interviewed dozens of corporations, public sector employers and Indigenous employees and found many employees often don't apply for jobs because of a lack of education, life skills and housing support.\n\nWhen it comes to Indigenous employment in mining, Nunavut is the front runner. Ninety-seven per cent of Nunavut residents who work in the industry in the territory are Indigenous. In the Northwest Territories, it's 52 per cent.\n\nThe study highlighted a set of training programs run by Agnico Eagle, which owns the Meliadine mine near Rankin Inlet and the Meadowbank mine north of Baker Laker. It offers week-long, Indigenous-run training programs which teach potential mine employees life skills, such as punctuality and how to cope with homesickness.\n\nOnce they've completed that course, participants are invited to Meadowbank where they are trained to fill a variety of entry-level jobs.\n\n\"After completing the program, interested participants are considered as candidates and are typically hired within a month,\" the study states.\n\nOnce employed, Agnico Eagle works with its Indigenous employees on a plan to get them into a more skilled, higher paying position.\n\nThe program has had amazing results, the study says. In the N.W.T, non-Indigenous employees make 24 per cent more than their Indigenous co-workers mainly because Indigenous employees are often hired for less-skilled and lower paying positions.\n\nBut, in Nunavut, there is no noticeable salary difference between non-Indigenous and Indigenous employees.\n\nAffordable housing an issue\n\nAnother major barrier that often prevents employers from recruiting is a lack of housing support, particularly in Nunavut.\n\nPotential employees who may be a good fit for a job won't apply because it doesn't include housing.

The system converts thermal heat into chilled water for air conditioning in the store and has reduced the site\u2019s energy consumption by almost one-quarter (24%) to date.\n\n\u201cWe always think long term, innovating to ensure that our actions to meet people\u2019s needs today do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs,\u201d the Inter Ikea Group\u2019s head of sustainability Lena Pripp-Kovac wrote in the report foreword.\n\n\u201cThis requires us to rethink and inspire changes in lifestyles and consumption and to transform our way of working \u2013 from linear to circular, from consuming to regenerating resources.\u201d\n\nClimate positive challenges\n\nThe progress update comes as Ikea is striving to become \u201cclimate-positive\u201d by 2030 \u2013 an aim the firm has defined as fulfilling its contribution to the Paris Agreement through an emissions reduction across the value chain that is aligned to climate science.\n\nThe multinational is targeting an 80% climate footprint reduction from stores and operations in absolute terms by 2030 \u2013 against a 2016 baseline \u2013 which aligns to a 2C target and aims towards the 1.5C trajectory towards the end of the century. Ikea claims that reducing emissions by 15% from the value chain by 2030 translates to a 70% reduction in climate footprint on average per product, and is therefore working to decarbonise key materials, food ingredients and transport, while setting more ambitious reduction targets for direct suppliers.\n\nAccording to the new sustainability report, the climate footprint of Ikea\u2019s value chain during 2018 was 2.8% higher than in 2016, largely due to the expansion of the business. It lists the key contributors to the business\u2019s overall climate footprint as raw materials (36.4%), product use at home (22.2%) and customer travel and home deliveries (15.5%).\n\n\u201cDecoupling our growth from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will take time, and we expect our emissions to increase for a few years before decreasing,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cBecoming climate positive will be a huge challenge for Ikea. We will only achieve it by joining together with others and listening to feedback from our stakeholders on how to improve.\u201d\n\nLiving Lagom\n\nThe report also lists a number of other key sustainability challenges which lay between Ikea and the achievement of its sustainability goals, including the improvement of working conditions throughout its supply chains, the need to bolster value chain reporting and the urgency of inspiring new sustainable consumption models among the general public.\n\nThe latter of these challenges has long been addressed by Ikea\u2019s \u201cLive Lagom\u201d campaign, which urges consumers to adopt its Swedish cultural vision of creating a home in which they create a harmonious lifestyle by not wasting resources or energy. The scheme has included the launch of dozens of innovative products designed to make home living more sustainable, including meatless meatballs, a kitchen made using 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and PCR wood and energy-efficient lighting.\n\nNew products unveiled within this range last year include air-purifying curtains, a water-saving mister nozzle and vegetarian hotdogs, while Ikea is also in the process of transforming its offerings and store models to encourage more sustainable consumption and travel habits. The firm\u2019s new Greenwich store, for example, includes an interactive upcycling hub and lab, a network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers and real-time displays of public transport information. It additionally offers customers the chance to have their items delivered by e-bike or electric van and to send their end-of-life products for recycling when they receive a delivery of new goods.\n\nTurning Ambition into Action at edie Live 2019\n\nIn a similarly honest fashion to Ikea, a number of big businesses including Landsec, Sky and Waitrose will appear at edie Live (21-22 May 2019) to discuss the challenges and opportunities to achieving a sustainable future.\n\nThe two-day show \u2013 edie's biggest event of the year \u2013 has become a highlight of the calendar for sustainability, energy and environment professionals looking for new ideas and solutions that will help them achieve a low-carbon, resource efficient and profitable future for their business.\n\nRegister for your free edie Live 2019 pass here.\n\nSarah George", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ENHaqN8bQNC17A5VRF7LwG77ZFTXjFEsCZgO4Mi8qCE.jpg"}, {"title": "Keanu Reeves Took a Road Trip With Fellow Passengers After His Plane Made an Emergency Landing", "score": 1, "url": "https://i.redd.it/b7tfze9taop21.jpg", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/j_Pyx6BD4AoAecjDQxhQPAImxdu5YQRb8cV2p5-LWmg.jpg"}, {"title": "A MINIMALIST Super Makeup SPRING TUTORIAL", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=7WBg-fQ_45Y&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1GqTGXpWZG0%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-4-1", "transcript": "Published on Apr 1, 2019\n\nTHANKS FOR SUBSCRIBING TO THIS CHANNEL TO RECEIVE MORE AVANT GARDE VIDEOS IN THE BEAUTY, FASHION AND MAKEUP WORLD OF THE FAMOUS CELEBRITIES AND THE SPECIAL HUMAN BEINGS AMONG US: http://bit.ly/2RFgmgt Take Advantage of the Beauty Food Bible: http://bit.ly/2SvVU5Z Get the Scar Solution: http://bit.ly/2tbPF92 The Real Beauty Breakthrough is here: http://bit.ly/2UNSd9t The High in Demand Makeup Remover Cloth http://bit.ly/2Dgm9UB Find Out More About Getting Makeup Brushes http://bit.ly/2Gi8nor \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Sarah Nourse: \"Hey Guys!

Teenagers.\n\nThanks to the robotics team at Farmington High School, Cillian now has his ride \u2013 a functioning power wheelchair hand-built from a Power Wheels riding toy.\n\n\u201cThese kids took time out of their busy schedules to do this for our son,\u201d said Cillian\u2019s mother, Krissy Jackson. \u201cWe\u2019re so grateful.\u201d\n\nCillian was born with a genetic condition that makes mobility difficult. \u201cHe has an especially hard time controlling his body. He has a lot of symptoms you\u2019d see in someone who has cerebral palsy,\u201d said Tyler Jackson, Cillian\u2019s father.\n\nTyler Jackson reached out to the robotics team at his former high school after he realized an actual power wheelchair would be cost prohibitive for his family and unlikely to be covered by insurance due to Cillian\u2019s young age.\n\nFarmington robotics coach Spencer Elvebak says there was no hesitation by his students. \u201cI brought it up to the kids at a meeting, \u2018Is this something we want to step up and do?\u2019\u201d Elvebak recalled. The sentiment was unanimous. Yes!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the great part of my job, to work with these kind of kids,\u201d Elvebak said.\n\nThe members of the robotics team replaced nearly every electrical component in the Power Wheels toy, mounted a seat from a bicycle carrier and designed a joystick to fit Cillian\u2019s needs the students fabricated on a 3D printer.\n\nAlong the way, they sought technical assistance from \u201cGOBABYGO!\u201d - a program at the University of Delaware that helps give mobility to children with disabilities.\n\nBut mostly the Farmington students relied on skills they learned building their competition robots.\n\n\u201cInstead of completing a task, we\u2019re helping change someone\u2019s life,\u201d team member Drew Eisenzimmer said.\n\nCillian took to his ride immediately.\n\nLast week, four months after receiving his wheelchair, Cillian returned with his family to the school and was reunited with the teens responsible for his gift.

Cillians' father said insurance reimbursement isn't an option at this time.\n\n\"Cillian still lacks some of the maturity and focus to drive an electric wheelchair in a public setting, which is the primary reason why he hasn't been approved for one. Frankly, we haven't even tried yet because we know he would be denied based on the proficiency requirement,\" Tyler Jackson said.\n\nIn the meantime, Jackson said, his son \"has the ability to keep working on that proficiency while simultaneously being able to explore on his own to help with his cognitive development.\"\n\nThe Farmington High School Robotics Team has earned more than its share of trophies over the years, but this is different.\n\n\u201cI think we won here more than we do in our competitions,\u201d team member Nicole Cash said.\n\nPHOTOS: Land of 10,000 Stories: Robotics team wheelchair 1/7\n\n2/7\n\n3/7\n\n4/7\n\n5/7\n\n6/7\n\n7/7 1 / 7\n\nWatch more of Boyd Huppert's Land of 10,000 Stories below.\n\nOn a mobile device you can watch more Land of 10,000 Stories here.\n\nSubmit your story ideas to Boyd by filling out the form below.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Volvo did it with the seatbelt, now they are doing in once again.

Shadowing her research is the ever-present awareness that 120 Americans take their lives every day, nearly 45,000 a year.\n\nRibeiro\u2019s paper, titled \u201cPredicting Risk of Suicide Attempts over Time through Machine Learning,\u201d will be published by the journal Clinical Psychological Science.\n\nThe study offers a fascinating finding: machine learning \u2014 a future frontier for artificial intelligence \u2014 can predict with 80-90 percent accuracy whether someone will attempt suicide as far off as two years into the future. The algorithms become even more accurate as a person\u2019s suicide attempt gets closer. For example, the accuracy climbs to 92 percent one week before a suicide attempt when artificial intelligence focuses on general hospital patients.\n\n\u201cThis study provides evidence that we can predict suicide attempts accurately,\u201d Ribeiro said. \u201cWe can predict them accurately over time, but we\u2019re best at predicting them closer to the event. We also know, based on this study, that risk factors \u2014 how they work and how important they are \u2014 also change over time.\u201d\n\nRibeiro\u2019s research represents an extraordinary development in suicide prediction that is desperately needed. A recent study by FSU Psychology Assistant Professor Joseph Franklin revealed that 50 years of suicide prediction research had not produced any real progress in being able to predict who will try to kill themselves. The traditional risk factors identified over the past half century to predict suicidal behavior \u2014 such as depression, stress or substance abuse \u2014 could muster an accuracy rate not much better than random guessing.\n\nA coin flip is as accurate on suicide attempts as the brightest suicide experts in the world.\n\n\u201cIt was really sad,\u201d said Ribeiro, who worked with Franklin on that study. \u201cFifty years of research with really smart people working on this and no real change. We can see that in the suicide rates. I\u2019m not saying machine learning is the panacea, but these kinds of techniques and changes in the status quo can really disrupt a stagnant research area.\u201d\n\nRibeiro\u2019s project was born out of Franklin\u2019s startling findings. She and Franklin, along with Colin Walsh of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, successfully accessed a massive data repository containing the electronic health records of about 2 million patients in Tennessee. The project was the largest research study of its kind in history, a \u201chuge opportunity,\u201d Ribeiro said. The team combed through the electronic health records, which were anonymous, and identified more than 3,200 people who had attempted suicide.\n\nHaving that information was crucial; it contained detailed medical histories of thousands of people leading up to their suicide attempts. Using machine learning to examine all of those details, the algorithms were able to \u201clearn\u201d which combination of factors in the records could most accurately predict future suicide attempts.\n\n\u201cThe machine learns the optimal combination of risk factors,\u201d Ribeiro said. \u201cWhat really matters is how this algorithm and these variables interact with one another as a whole. This kind of work lets us apply algorithms that can consider hundreds of data points in someone\u2019s medical record and potentially reduce them to clinically meaningful information.\u201d\n\nThat kind of meaningful information could be used to develop an alert system for clinicians identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior. For example, the system would issue a \u201cred light warning\u201d or \u201crisk score\u201d for every person so when they come into a hospital with acute symptoms, an emergency room doctor could see an elevated risk for suicide and get a psychiatrist to respond immediately.\n\n\u201cJust like you get a cardiovascular risk score, you would get a suicide risk score that is informative for clinicians and helps direct them on what steps to take next,\u201d Ribeiro said.\n\nToo often, those next steps never happen. Studies show about 60-90 percent of people who die by suicide had visited their medical provider within the past year and the clinician never saw it coming.\n\n\u201cThis algorithm funnels our attention to the folks who are most likely to attempt suicide so our resources are better devoted to people we\u2019re missing now,\u201d Ribeiro said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re missing a large proportion of people who are at risk that we never even think about.\u201d\n\nHealth care systems are building national and international infrastructures of electronic records that could be analyzed with machine learning to identify people at risk of suicide. But the data might have to be modified for research purposes, so that\u2019s one challenge still ahead.\n\nMore organizations like the U.S. military and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are already in a position to move ahead with machine-learning methods for their own electronic health records. Ribeiro is currently working on a study with the Military Suicide Research Consortium based at Florida State that uses machine learning to identify people with an imminent risk of suicide.\n\nThe suicide rate has not changed much over the past century: In 1915, it was around 13 per 100,000 people; in 2015, it was 13.26 per 100,000 \u2014 little progress over a century despite some of the most brilliant minds scrutinizing the problem and billions of dollars being spent on mental health care. But Ribeiro remains hopeful about her team\u2019s work and believes it will meet ambitious goals. She envisions breakthroughs on being able to identify and treat large-scale populations of those who need help the most.\n\n\u201cThe whole focus of my research program is to be able to accurately detect suicide risk for all people at all points in time,\u201d Ribeiro said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to work toward. What we have so far is promising, but it\u2019s just a start.

After the potholes were fixed, most locals decided that it was all because of the power of the \u2018willy\u2019 and are now eternally grateful to the mystery artist. A local man, called Brad Nicholson, reported that one particular pothole was fixed almost immediately after being defaced. It had previously gone unnoticed and unfixed for almost a year before that.

A spokesperson for the Middlesbrough council, under which Teesside resides, announced that the matter of potholes had been their priority for a long time, depending upon how serious a danger they pose to people. However, due to the fact that they were working on pre-planned projects in the Acklam area, there had been a delay. It just so happened that they were fixed after the willies were drawn on. That delay must have mysteriously fixed itself.\n\nQuite interestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time that genitalia has been used in a situation like this. A street artist, who goes by the name \u2018Wanksy\u2019 has dedicated his life to creating sketches of penises over potholes to ensure that they come into spotlight and get fixed. He is just like the famous street artist \u2018Banksy\u2019, except he uses penises.

When a child acts out, know that it is most likely because they are struggling to understand complex emotions that they are feeling for the first time in their lives.\n\nSchools in England have started to tackle this problem in a new way, and that is by teaching mindfulness and meditation in the classroom to improve the youth\u2019s overall mental health. In 370 schools across the country, children will be taught how to meditate, techniques for muscle relaxation and breathing exercises for mindfulness. The secondary school students will also get a more hands-on education to learn about awareness and how to increase this in their everyday lives. This program is being done under the mental health study that the British government is running up until 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from the increasing number of young children that are showing signs of early onset depression and anxiety, NHS reports have also shown that 1 in 8 British children have mental disorders. Despite these facts, only 1 out of 5 children with mental issues are able to get access to treatment.\n\nEngland isn\u2019t the only country that has added mindfulness as a subject among schools. In 2016, a school in Baltimore decided to replace detention for an area where the children could go to an practice some breathing and stretching exercises instead. This is a way to keep the students calmer in order to increase their focus within the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nA student that was sent to the \u2018mindful moment room\u2019 for pushing and name-calling a fellow classmate describes it to CNN as: \u201cI did some deep breathing, had a little snack, and I got myself together.

Skipping vaccination or not breastfeeding the child is considered 'neglect'.\n\n\"We want to make parents and the community at large aware of their responsibilities,\" said Dr Shahraban Abdulla, Chairperson of the Dubai Health Authority's (DHA) Standing Child Protection Committee.\n\nWadeema's Law, which was passed in 2016, is the backbone of the committee that actively started its work from September 2018 at all medical entities across Dubai. In an exclusive interview with Khaleej Times, Dr Shahraban said that by law, nurses, doctors, social workers and teachers are mandated to report child abuse cases, even if it is just a suspicion.\n\n\"These cases could be physical, emotional, sexual, psychological or even neglect. In our experience, most cases that we come across are of neglect,\" she said.\n\nDr Shahraban said an instance where a child has a chronic disease and the parents fail to give him/her adequate treatment and medication can also be considered neglect.\n\n\"In this regard, not having a child vaccinated is considered medical negligence because this falls under a human being's civil rights and, subsequently, health rights,\" said Dr Shahraban, who is also a consultant paediatric cardiologist at the Latifa Hospital.\n\nA child's right starts from antenatal care onwards. Under the Wadeema Law, the age of a child is defined from before birth to 18 years.\n\nShe referred to the recent resurgence of measles due to anti-vaccination campaigners. \"There is no scientific proof that vaccines are linked to autism or have any other side effects, therefore, we consider vaccination a child's right,\" she said.\n\nShe also said that breastfeeding falls under the same gamut. \"A mother cannot say no to breastfeeding her child unless there is a medical reason,\" explained Dr Shahraban.\n\nIn Islam, the requirement is to breastfeed a child up to two years of age and for mothers who are working, there is a way of expressing their milk for their baby, she said. \"We are aiming for a baby-friendly country and not breastfeeding a child is not an option,\" said the doctor.\n\nLaw meant to protect kids\n\nThe law is, however, a protection for the future generations and does not aim for punishments unless it is specifically found that there has been sexual or physical violence against a child. \"That then becomes a police case,\" said Dr Shahraban.\n\nIn many such cases, families need support that could be financial, psychological or even simple counselling. \"We are trying to help here. Once such a case is brought to our attention, we discuss and dig deeper through home visits or connecting them with groups, among other actions,\" she explained.\n\nYou are required by law to report child neglect\n\nWhile cases of medical negligence are spotted by medical professionals and reported to the committee, the Wadeema Law also defines the responsibility of the community. \"Every adult is mandated under the law to report even a suspected ill happening towards any child,\" said Dr Shahraban Abdulla, Chairperson of the Dubai Health Authority's (DHA) Standing Child Protection Committee.\n\nThese cases can be reported to the Community Development Authority, the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children and even the Dubai Police. \"If you see children not being taken to school or sick and not being attended to by the parents, it is the duty of every community member to report such cases,\" she said.\n\nUnder this law, any person who smokes with a child under 18 years in a car should be reported to the CDA or police. \"If you can talk to the person politely and explain to them that the smoke is harmful for their child, you can do that else take the number of the car and inform the CDA or police about the incident,\" said Dr Shahraban.\n\nThe law protects the community and keeps the identity of anyone who is reporting such cases anonymous, she added.\n\nKT NANO EDIT\n\nProtect kids your responsibility\n\nYoung minds are vulnerable to a host of risks, and it is the primary responsibility of the parents to shield them from any danger. Providing good education, access to health services, and ensuring a life that allows them to realise their potential and develop into mature beings is important. The UAE has invested significantly in ensuring a children-friendly environment. The Wadeema Law is also an attempt to safeguard the interests of children. Parents and caregivers should be more supportive.\n\nasmaalizain@khaleejtimes.com", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xtNtBs-nTvRGhc-5TTK9PWu8zaww1uO723MZ_PgC7Gw.jpg"}, {"title": "Thank you Moon my friend for taking the hit", "score": 0, "url": "https://www.space.com/meteorite-hits-moon-during-2019-lunar-eclipse.html?utm_source=notification", "comments": 5, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "A meteorite smashed into the moon's surface at 38,000 miles per hour (61,000 kilometers per hour) while our lunar neighbor was in total eclipse in January, a new report reveals.\n\nObservers saw a flash during the Jan. 20 to 21 eclipse , when the object collided with the moon and carved out a crater about 10 to 15 meters (33 to 50 feet) in diameter. It was traveling fast enough to have been able to cross the United States in just a few minutes, but, luckily for Earth, it slammed into the moon instead.\n\nAstronomers measured a 0.28-second flash from the impact, the first ever filmed during a lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses happen when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow during its normal orbit around our planet.

Observing flashes is a great way to test our ideas on exactly what happens when a meteorite collides with the moon,\" Madiedo said.\n\nThe scientists added that knowing the rate of lunar collisions will be especially important in the protection of the safety of astronauts, who may venture back to the surface of the moon as soon as 2024 .\n\nThe new research was detailed April 27 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "So old", "score": 1, "url": "https://i.redd.it/ordtiwlvdlv21.jpg", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fOLEnUXFPTYlqxQBLmIR7_hI_nqJnv92ARTOAq3Ev1w.jpg"}, {"title": "Democrats announce agreement with President Trump to spend $2 trillion on 'big and bold' infrastructure plan", "score": 7, "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-split-hiking-gas-tax-ahead-infrastructure-meeting/story?id=62700887", "comments": 17, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "Democrats announce agreement with President Trump to spend $2 trillion on 'big and bold' infrastructure plan Democrats met with Trump to begin bipartisan infrastructure talks Tuesday.\n\nIn sharp contrast to previous acrimonious showdowns and amid bitterly--disputed investigations, congressional Democrats on Tuesday emerged from a White House meeting with President Donald Trump calling it \"constructive\" and announcing an agreement to spend $2 trillion to tackle U.S. infrastructure in a \"big and bold way.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters outside the West Wing the hour-and-a-half meeting with Trump, top aides and Cabinet officials was \"very productive,\" a characterization echoed in a statement by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\n\"We have to invest in this country\u2019s future and bring our infrastructure to a level better than it has ever been before,\" Sanders said.\n\nWhile fireworks flared at previous White House meetings, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said there was \"goodwill\" during Tuesday's discussions.\n\nSchumer said the plan isn't short term -- it's hoped it will have an impact for \"25 years.\" Improving roads, bridges, highways, and water systems were discussed, and, according to Schumer, broadband and the power grid \"so we could bring clean energy from one end of the country to another.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will announce just how sweeping the \"big and bold\" plan will be, according to Pelosi.\n\nThe group will meet again in three weeks to discuss specific proposals and the president will present his ideas on ways to foot the giant bill.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, April 29, 2019.

He didn't bring it up,\" Schumer told Karl. \"I believe, we can do both at once.\"\n\n\u201cWe can come up with some good ideas on infrastructure and we want to hear his ideas on funding,\" Schumer said. \"That's going to be the crucial point in my opinion.

She was joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and top policy stakeholders at the White House.\n\nPelosi and Schumer wrote a letter to Trump on Monday outlining Democratic priorities, \"which we wanted you to be aware of before the meeting,\" including \"substantial, new and real revenue,\" clean energy and resiliency priorities, and \"strong Buy America, labor, and women, veteran and minority-owned business protections.\"\n\n\"We look forward to hearing your ideas on how to pay for this package to ensure that it is big and bold enough to meet our country's needs,\" Pelosi and Schumer wrote. \"This bill can and should be a major jobs and ownership boost for the American people -- manufacturers, labor contractors, and women, veteran and minority-owned businesses.\"\n\nBut heading into the meeting, Democrats had not coalesced around a dollar amount for a package, and they weren't expected to present the president with a list of offsets to potential infrastructure spending.\n\nA source close to Schumer warned that unless Trump considers \"undoing\" elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, \"Schumer won't even consider a proposal from the president to raise the gas tax, of which the poor and working people would bear the brunt.\"\n\nBut several Democratic aides said Schumer's red line is not representative of all Democrats, given that the 2017 tax cut measure is arguably Trump's greatest legislative achievement.\n\n\"It's not a likely outcome,\" one senior Democratic aide predicted ahead of the meeting. \"People see what he's trying to do there, but I think there are others who think it complicates what's already a complicated situation.\"\n\nChairman Peter DeFazio conducts a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing in the Capitol Visitor Center, Feb. 7, 2019, in Washington, DC.

Made from a seaweed-based substance, the discarded wrapping will naturally decompose in four to six weeks \u2013 roughly the same time as a piece of fruit.\n\nOoho pods are made by Skipping Rocks Lab, a London-based startup led by Royal College of Art graduates Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez and Pierre Paslier.\n\nCapsules filled with Lucozade Sport\n\nDuring the marathon, the capsules were filled with energy drink Lucozade Sport Orange and handed out to runners from a station 23 miles into the 26.2-mile course.\n\nIntroduction of the capsules formed part of a push from London Marathon organisers to make this year's event the most sustainable marathon ever.\n\nLast year an estimated 760,000 plastic bottles were thrown onto the city's streets by runners and spectators. The target for 2019 was to bring this number down by 215,000.\n\nThe total number of drinks stations was reduced from 26 to 19, including the one distributing edible Ooho pods. Plus two of the stations were handing out drinks in compostable cups.\n\nTo further reduce the marathon's carbon footprint, plastic bottles dropped in the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Greenwich and Southwark are being taken to a recycling plant where they will be turned into new bottles, as part of a closed-loop system.\n\nDecomposes faster than PLA bioplastic\n\nRodrigo Garcia Gonzalez and Pierre Paslier first started developing the technology for Ooha in 2013, after graduating from the RCA's Innovation Design Engineering programme, which is in partnership with Imperial College London.\n\nToday they manufacture their Ooho drinks bubbles using a material they developed, called Notpla. They make this material using brown seaweed, so it naturally decomposes much faster than PLA, one of the most widely used bioplastics.\n\n\"It's really simple because it\u2019s a membrane, and membranes are the technology that nature uses to encapsulate things using the minimum amount of material,\" explained Gonzalez in a talk at the Design Indaba conference in January.\n\nRelated story Adidas unveils fully recyclable Futurecraft Loop sneaker\n\n\"Seaweed is an amazing resource,\" he explained. \"It doesn't use farmland, you don't need to water it or use fertiliser.\"\n\nNotpla can also be used as a waterproof and greaseproof coating on cardboard food packaging.\n\nOoho pods can contain soft drinks or alcohol\n\nThe Ooho bubbles can be used for almost any drink, so the company often works with brands. They have previously used them to offer cocktails at music festivals, and also as sachets for ketchup and other sauces.\n\nThey are produced on site, using a manufacturing machine developed by Skipping Rocks Lab.\n\nLucozade Sport first trialled the capsules at the Richmond Marathon in September 2018 and has since distributed them at several races. But the London Marathon presented an opportunity to hand out pods to more people than ever before.\n\nThe brand was also handing out drinks in plastic bottles, all of which were made from recycled plastic.\n\n\"We are proud to say that all 380 millilitre Lucozade Sport bottles distributed on course at mass-participation sporting events from now on will be made from 100 per cent recycled plastic,\" said Michelle Norman, director of external affairs and sustainability for Lucozade Ribena Suntory.\n\n\"These ambitious initiatives mean we can continue to address the global issue of plastic waste and continue to minimise our impact on the environment.\"", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Deaf man adopts deaf rescue puppy and teaches him sign language", "score": 54, "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/deaf-man-adopts-deaf-rescue-puppy-teaches-sign/story?id=62700366", "comments": 3, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "Deaf man adopts deaf rescue puppy and teaches him sign language \"Whenever they're together, Emerson is always finding a way to lean on Nick.\"\n\nA man who was born deaf is now the owner of a sweet puppy who is also unable to hear.\n\nNick Abbott, 31, of Maine, adopted his dog Emerson through the foster-based rescue, NFR Maine.\n\nAt 6 weeks old, Emerson was rescued from a shelter in Florida and later transferred up north.The black lab mix experienced seizures and an infection known as canine parvovirus.

That's never happened before.\n\nCoal, long the king of the power sector, has already been dethroned by natural gas , a much cleaner burning fossil fuel. Now, coal is facing intensifying pressure from wind and solar power.\n\n\"Five years ago this never would have been close to happening,\" Dennis Wamstead, research analyst at IEEFA, said in an interview. \"The transition that's going on in the electric sector in the United States has been phenomenal.\"\n\nEven a decade ago, America's renewable energy had little presence other than hydro power. But a wave of investment \u2014 first into wind, and then solar \u2014 has made these new technologies far cheaper.\n\nAt the same time, increased awareness about climate change has led many American businesses, households and state legislatures to demand cleaner energy.\n\n\"Renewables are just a better bet at the moment,\" Wamstead said.\n\nThe IEEFA report cited US government statistics that project renewable energy (hydro, biomass, wind, solar and geothermal) will start to sporadically exceed coal in 2019 and 2020. In other words, this year renewables will likely start to generate more energy than coal's 240 gigawatts of remaining capacity, at least on a month-by-month basis, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nWhile such a milestone would highlight the shift away from coal, some of it is also because of seasonal issues.\n\nFor instance, some coal plants shut down for maintenance during the spring when demand for electricity is low. The spring also tends to be a strong period for hydro and wind power.\n\nRenewable power isn't expected to surpass coal on an annual basis for at least several years.\n\nIt was only in 2016 that coal was surpassed by natural gas as America's No. 1 power source.\n\n39-year low in coal consumption\n\nThe clean energy transition is accelerating.\n\nRenewable energy is projected to be the fastest-growing source for power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA numbers published earlier this year.\n\nCoal, on the other hand, continues to rapidly decline. Coal's share of total power generation tumbled from 45% in 2010 to 28% in 2018. And it's expected to dip to just 24% in 2020.\n\nDespite President Donald Trump's promise to rejuvenate the coal industry by slashing regulation, America's coal appetite continues to shrink. US coal consumption declined by about 4% in 2018 to the lowest level since 1979, according to the EIA.\n\nMore coal retirements loom\n\nThe problem for coal is economics. Wind and solar costs have plunged so drastically that 74% of the US coal fleet could be replaced by renewable energy and still save customers money, according to a report released last month by nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation.\n\nAnd America's coal power plants aren't getting any younger. The average coal plant is about 40 years old, according to Wamstead. Coal plants typically last around 40 to 60 years before getting phased out. As they age, these plants require more maintenance and repairs, making renewable power all that much more attractive.\n\n\"A lot of plants are staring normal retirement age right in the face,\" Wamstead said.\n\nSome power companies are preemptively retiring other coal plants in a bid to be more environmentally friendly.\n\nXcel Energy XEL For instance,has shut down a quarter of its coal power plants and plans to pull the plug on another quarter. The Minneapolis-based power company recently announced a plan to deliver zero-carbon electricity by 2050 \u2014 an ambitious goal that will require plenty of wind and solar energy.\n\n\"Wind is already beating fossil fuel alternatives \u2014 even with low natural gas prices,\" Xcel CEO Ben Fowke recently told CNN Business last month.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "A REAL STORY Going From $0 TO $224K Per MONTH Shopify Dropshipping SUCCE...", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=CImf8PovPKw&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DG8G51dAym3s%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "Published on May 1, 2019\n\nAM's Marketing Guru today shows you how you can take risks in business and in life so that you will be able to achieve quick results with this great motivational video! http://bit.ly/2XygJgX\n\n\n\nDO BE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE REGULAR VIDEOS ON HOW YOU CAN EARN LEGITIMATE AND SUBSTANTIAL INCOME TO PAY FOR REAL BILLS AND NOT JUST PENNIES RIGHT HERE.

For those who don\u2019t like it, Facebook\u2019s intrusive. The sidebar \u201cad-stalking\u201d gets weird. There\u2019s more information overload in one day than our ancestors probably received in a year\u2026 if not their lifetime. So why am I addicted? There\u2019s only one answer.\n\nFacebook is fun. It\u2019s become the virtual water cooler we all stand around and talk about\u2026 everything. Over the years I\u2019ve noticed how posts (and posters) fall into eight main categories.\n\nThe Celebrators \u2014 They\u2019re usually raising a glass, surrounded by family and friends. There\u2019s always a graduation, wedding, or birthday. Sometimes they\u2019re just enjoying pizza at the local joint. Their joie de vivre is infectious. Like all of us, they have tough times, but they rarely show those. Instead they focus on the positive. They remind me to live in the present and enjoy life.\n\nThe Nurturers \u2014 They\u2019re quiet and modest. They rarely post about themselves. But they\u2019re first to react or applaud or share someone else\u2019s news. They feel most comfortable in the background, but you know they\u2019re there by their thoughtful comments and many \u201clikes.\u201d When they do post, I pay attention. They teach me that sometimes the quietest people speak the loudest.\n\nThe Humanitarians \u2014 They use Facebook for the good. They\u2019re always working to build awareness for the vulnerable \u2014 abused women, sick children, stray animals, and the homeless. They take me out of my problems and put things in focus. Having a bad hair day or need to lose a few pounds? Here\u2019s an African village praying for water. Ahem\u2026perspective given. These posters care deeply about their fellow earthlings. They inspire me to do the same.\n\nThe Sharers \u2014 They tell everything \u2014 and I mean everything \u2014 going on in their lives, the good, the bad, and the\u2026slightly embarrassing. They need to vent. And boy they do. They remind me that life can be hard and painful. We all cope with stress differently. They\u2019re not afraid to say when they need help. What\u2019s interesting is how they bring out the best in others who jump in with advice, solace, and kind words. The Sharers teach me that sometimes we just need to be heard.\n\nThe Debaters \u2014 They bring intellectual heft to Facebook. They\u2019re always disputing the \u201chot button\u201d issues \u2014 politics, guns, race, women\u2019s rights, health care, the best sushi places in San Francisco, the most overrated rhythm guitarists. They\u2019re eloquent and persuasive, each taking a turn at the podium. They teach me to listen to other\u2019s opinions with a more open mind (or at least try). The Debaters show how most of us have passion and a viewpoint and deserve to be heard.\n\nThe Comedians \u2014 They\u2019re always sharing the latest \u201cCats Gone Loco!\u201d video or dogs wearing dumb hats or the most biting political satire. And for a few minutes, it works. You forget your troubles. In their own way, the Comedians help me see life through a different lens. I\u2019m grateful to them. They teach me not to take anything (including myself) too seriously. It all goes fast. Enjoy the ride.\n\nThe Mystics \u2014: Their specialty is spirituality, new age wisdom, and inspiration. They focus on the beauty of living and the holier realms above. They remind me to stop fixating on the phone or computer and look up and out. They remind me there\u2019s still magic in the world. And yes, I have to think about whether fairies are guiding me to my higher purpose, but I like pondering the question.\n\nThe Strangers Who Turn into Friends \u2013- Okay, this isn\u2019t a style of posting, but had to throw it in. I\u2019ve been amazed at the wonderful people I\u2019ve met on Facebook. We\u2019ve connected over writing, family, art, life stages, dance, pets, mutual acquaintances, cupcakes, everything. Even cooler is the fact these people live everywhere. I strike up sometimes daily conversations with posters from Australia, India, and the UK like we\u2019re in the same room instead of half a planet away. I love that.\n\nLet\u2019s face it. Facebook is the human condition writ large, with all its joy, sorrow and rage. Everyday it reminds me of one thing. We\u2019re not alone. We\u2019re there for each other. Facebook is society (and Planet Earth) in all its dysfunctional, fascinating, squabbling togetherness.\n\nMaybe Shakespeare was right.

That's never happened before.\n\nCoal, long the king of the power sector, has already been dethroned by natural gas , a much cleaner burning fossil fuel. Now, coal is facing intensifying pressure from wind and solar power.\n\n\"Five years ago this never would have been close to happening,\" Dennis Wamstead, research analyst at IEEFA, said in an interview. \"The transition that's going on in the electric sector in the United States has been phenomenal.\"\n\nEven a decade ago, America's renewable energy had little presence other than hydro power. But a wave of investment \u2014 first into wind, and then solar \u2014 has made these new technologies far cheaper.\n\nAt the same time, increased awareness about climate change has led many American businesses, households and state legislatures to demand cleaner energy.\n\n\"Renewables are just a better bet at the moment,\" Wamstead said.\n\nThe IEEFA report cited US government statistics that project renewable energy (hydro, biomass, wind, solar and geothermal) will start to sporadically exceed coal in 2019 and 2020. In other words, this year renewables will likely start to generate more energy than coal's 240 gigawatts of remaining capacity, at least on a month-by-month basis, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nWhile such a milestone would highlight the shift away from coal, some of it is also because of seasonal issues.\n\nFor instance, some coal plants shut down for maintenance during the spring when demand for electricity is low. The spring also tends to be a strong period for hydro and wind power.\n\nRenewable power isn't expected to surpass coal on an annual basis for at least several years.\n\nIt was only in 2016 that coal was surpassed by natural gas as America's No. 1 power source.\n\n39-year low in coal consumption\n\nThe clean energy transition is accelerating.\n\nRenewable energy is projected to be the fastest-growing source for power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA numbers published earlier this year.\n\nCoal, on the other hand, continues to rapidly decline. Coal's share of total power generation tumbled from 45% in 2010 to 28% in 2018. And it's expected to dip to just 24% in 2020.\n\nDespite President Donald Trump's promise to rejuvenate the coal industry by slashing regulation, America's coal appetite continues to shrink. US coal consumption declined by about 4% in 2018 to the lowest level since 1979, according to the EIA.\n\nMore coal retirements loom\n\nThe problem for coal is economics. Wind and solar costs have plunged so drastically that 74% of the US coal fleet could be replaced by renewable energy and still save customers money, according to a report released last month by nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation.\n\nAnd America's coal power plants aren't getting any younger. The average coal plant is about 40 years old, according to Wamstead. Coal plants typically last around 40 to 60 years before getting phased out. As they age, these plants require more maintenance and repairs, making renewable power all that much more attractive.\n\n\"A lot of plants are staring normal retirement age right in the face,\" Wamstead said.\n\nSome power companies are preemptively retiring other coal plants in a bid to be more environmentally friendly.\n\nXcel Energy XEL For instance,has shut down a quarter of its coal power plants and plans to pull the plug on another quarter. The Minneapolis-based power company recently announced a plan to deliver zero-carbon electricity by 2050 \u2014 an ambitious goal that will require plenty of wind and solar energy.\n\n\"Wind is already beating fossil fuel alternatives \u2014 even with low natural gas prices,\" Xcel CEO Ben Fowke recently told CNN Business last month.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Foraging for Wild Garlic, Forest Garden Maintenance, Planting out Polycultures - Week 4 - The Polyculture Project", "score": 1, "url": "https://balkanecologyproject.blogspot.com/2019/04/foraging-for-wild-garlic-forest-garden.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "It's been a while since my last post and it feels as though within that time span everything has changed.

But now news has emerged that one city - Leeds - has been making some progress.\n\nFigures presented to the European Congress on Obesity suggest Leeds has managed to reduce the number of children who are extremely overweight.\n\nThe data showed there had been a 6.4% fall in obesity rates over recent years.\n\nHow significant is this?\n\nA fall of 6.4% may not seem much - but given obesity rates have remained stubbornly resistant to attempts to shift them, the efforts of Leeds are being widely praised.\n\nThe data - compiled from the official school measuring programme - showed 8.8% of four- to five-year-olds in the city were recorded as obese in the past five years. That compared with 9.4% from 2009 to 2013.\n\nAnd that has been judged to be statistically significant by experts.\n\nBut what has been particularly impressive is the fact that the biggest falls have been seen among the most deprived areas.\n\nRates of obesity fell by nearly 9% in these neighbourhoods.\n\nHow has Leeds done it?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThose involved in the Leeds project point to the work done with pre-school children.\n\nThe city council developed a child-obesity strategy a decade ago that made this age group a key priority.\n\nStaff who work with pre-school children, including children's centres workers and health visitors, were trained to promote healthy eating.\n\nAnd parenting classes encouraged healthy snacking, eating as a family and the importance of cooking nutritious meals from scratch.\n\nThe council has taken other steps too. There has been a big focus on getting children active through dance, while there has been an active local campaign to encourage families to reduce their sugar intake.\n\nWhat have parents been taught?\n\nThe work with parents has been done in partnership with a charity called Henry, which runs programmes across the country.\n\nIn Leeds parents have been offered eight-week courses.\n\nHenry chief executive Kim Roberts says they focus on some key messages.\n\nShe says it is important to give children a choice. \"Offer them a choice of peas or carrots and let them decide,\" she adds.\n\nParents are encouraged to set a good example by eating healthily too.\n\nOne of those who has benefited is Belinda Mould and her daughter.\n\nThe three-year-old used to only eat beans, sausages and mash potato, but now likes a range of fruits and vegetables from mangoes and strawberries to cucumber and sweetcorn.\n\n\"Her absolute favourite is broccoli. She can eat loads of it,\" Belinda says.\n\nShould other areas copy Leeds?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhile the progress has been impressive, Leeds has not seen a similar shift among older children.\n\nThe school measuring programme also involves those at the end of primary school - 10- and 11-year-olds.\n\nAnd the obesity rates for this age group have remained stable.\n\nWhat is also true is that other places have also seen some small chinks of light in the battle against the bulge.\n\nPublic Health England is working with areas including Luton, the London boroughs of Lewisham and Tower Hamlets and Stockton-on-Tees to see what can be learned.\n\nThey have all seen some progress in reducing obesity rates - whether it is with older or younger kids.\n\nSo what can we take from the experience of Leeds?\n\nOxford University's Prof Susan Jebb, who has helped analyse the figures, says the key thing is that they give hope.\n\n\"It is sometimes too easy to think nothing is working, this shows something can be done,\" she says.\n\n\"What we need to do now is understand exactly why Leeds has seen the progress it has and also to look at the experience of other areas.\n\n\"They could hold the key to tackling child obesity\"", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/hmDRB-VlPHeuqvs0bqA3sjLRX5jeZipbMp0E7XVKxL0.jpg"}, {"title": "What Is The INFORMATION REVOLUTION And What Does The INFORMATION REVOLUT...", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=CekrqODG2pU&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeC-93r0j5_Y%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "Published on May 1, 2019\n\nFrom AM's Techno Logical: We will examine the implications involved in the use of CLOUD COMPUTING Technology!

What does INFORMATION REVOLUTION mean? INFORMATION REVOLUTION meaning - INFORMATION REVOLUTION definition - INFORMATION REVOLUTION explanation. Source: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/... license. The term information revolution describes current economic, social and technological trends beyond the Industrial Revolution. Many competing terms have been proposed that focus on different aspects of this societal development. The British polymath crystallographer J. D. Bernal introduced the term \"scientific and technical revolution\" in his 1939 book The Social Function of Science to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society. He asserted that science is becoming a \"productive force\", using the Marxist Theory of Productive Forces. After some controversy, the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then-Soviet Bloc. Their aim was to show that socialism was a safe home for the scientific and technical (\"technological\" for some authors) revolution, referred to by the acronym STR. The book Civilization at the Crossroads, edited by the Czech philosopher Radovan Richta (1969), became a standard reference for this topic. Daniel Bell (1980) challenged this theory and advocated post-industrial society, which would lead to a service economy rather than socialism. Many other authors presented their views, including Zbigniew Brzezinski (1976) with his \"Technetronic Society\". The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of information. Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as the Platonic Academy, Aristotle's Peripatetic school in the Lyceum, the Musaeum and the Library of Alexandria, or the schools of Babylonian astronomy. The Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging. Information is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, including Shannon's (1949) Information Theory and Wiener's (1948) Cybernetics. Wiener stated: \"information is information not matter or energy\". This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with matter and energy as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy.\n\nThe term information revolution may relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms as Industrial Revolution and Agricultural Revolution. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm.\"", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "RWE Abandons All Present &amp; Future Coal Plans", "score": 1, "url": "https://cleantechnica.com/2019/04/30/rwe-abandons-all-present-future-coal-plans/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "RWE Abandons All Present & Future Coal Plans\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 30th, 2019 by Joshua S Hill\n\nRWE, one of Germany\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d utilities, announced last Friday that it has cancelled plans for the BoAplus lignite coal-fired power station at the company\u2019s site in Niederaussem, near Cologne, Germany, and promised to cease investing in new coal generation capacity.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of our responsibility and continue to drive the energy transition with resolve,\u201d explained Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG. \u201cNew coal-fired power stations no longer have a place in our future-oriented strategy. Following the completion of the transaction with E.ON, RWE will be one of the world\u2019s leading renewable energy players.\u201d\n\nThus, plans for the Niederaussem BoAplus lignite coal-fired power station \u2014 which was originally planned all the way back in 2012 and intended to be equipped with \u201ccutting-edge and extremely efficient technology\u201d \u2014 will be scrapped as the company instead focuses all its future activity on \u201celectricity generation from renewable energy sources.\u201d\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s big announcement isn\u2019t necessarily all its cracked up to be. RWE insisted in its press release that \u201cexisting coal-fired power stations will be needed to provide backup capacity\u201d in the future, \u201cgiven the fact that renewables currently contribute about 40% to the German electricity mix.\u201d Even though RWE admits that coal\u2019s \u201cshare in the electricity mix will decline gradually,\u201d that the company insists it must remain for the time being is discouraging.\n\nFurther, while RWE has promised to invest in electricity generation from renewable energy sources, later on in its press release it explains that the company will \u201cinvest in renewable energies, storage technologies, and low-carbon technologies such as gas-fired power stations if market conditions allow for it.\u201d\n\nRWE is hedging its bets, making a splashy announcement that will earn it a seat at the cool kids\u2019 table moving forward, while still allowing it to hold on to business-as-usual practices until it is no longer financially profitable. What is needed, however, is for companies to fully commit to renewable energy and energy storage technologies now \u2013 rather than at some unknown point down the path \u2013 so as to better support the development of these technologies so that they can become more financially viable and profitable sooner, rather than later.\n\nThis point was made by the German chapter of Friends of the Earth, Bund f\u00fcr Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland, which highlighted their belief that \u201cRWE needs to do more.\u201d According to BUND energy expert Tina L\u00f6ffelsend, the cancellation of the BoAplus project was bound for failure in either case. It has been clear for years that a new coal-fired power plant can neither be justified from a climate perspective nor an economic one. The abandonment was long overdue and is in itself not yet a certificate for taking climate responsibility. If RWE is serious about its climate responsibility, it would need to close its old power stations in Neurath and Niederaussem as of 2020. Further, L\u00f6ffelsend pointed to the German Kohlekommission\u2019s (coal commission) findings that 3 GW of lignite capacity could be decommissioned, and that Germany should aim for a complete exit from coal by 2038.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow CleanTechnica on Google News.\n\nIt will make you happy & help you live in peace for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-qh2pzU0KBZBZXwJAyz11iHwH1IOzfR8cSfB7liGIUQ.jpg"}, {"title": "Doctor uses \u201cBaby Shark\u201d to motivate toddler with spina bifida to learn to walk.", "score": 10, "url": "https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-pinellas/baby-shark-song-helps-2-year-old-girl-with-spina-bifida-learn-to-walk-at-st-petersburg-hospital", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "ST.

The date intentionally coincides with the 30th anniversary of the Call to Action, which saw the French anti-poverty campaigner Father Joseph Wresinski ask the international community, in front of 100,000 Parisians, to \u201cstrive to eradicate extreme poverty\u201d.\n\n\n\nTo mark the occasion, Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, was featured in a short video assessing the current state of world poverty. Despite noting such issues as unemployment, inequality, and conflict continuing in some regions, Guterres correctly observed that since 1990 the world has made \u201cremarkable progress in eradicating poverty.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile it is valuable to acknowledge that problems remain, it is important to reflect on just how far we\u2019ve come.\n\n\n\nThe speed of poverty alleviation in the last 25 years has been historically unprecedented. Not only is the proportion of people in poverty at a record low, but, in spite of adding 2 billion to the planet\u2019s population, the overall number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen too.\n\n\n\nAs Johan Norberg writes in his book Progress, \u201cif you had to choose a society to live in but did not know what your social or economic position would be, you would probably choose the society with the lowest proportion (not the lowest numbers) of poor, because this is the best judgement of the life of an average citizen.\u201d Well, in 1820, 94 percent of the world\u2019s population lived in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day adjusted for purchasing power). In 1990 this figure was 34.8 percent, and in 2015, just 9.6 percent.\n\n\n\nIn the last quarter century, more than 1.25 billion people escaped extreme poverty - that equates to over 138,000 people (i.e., 38,000 more than the Parisian crowd that greeted Father Wresinski in 1987) being lifted out of poverty every day. If it takes you five minutes to read this article, another 480 people will have escaped the shackles of extreme of poverty by the time you finish. Progress is awesome. In 1820, only 60 million people didn\u2019t live in extreme poverty. In 2015, 6.6 billion did not.\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s consider those people who are still trapped in extreme poverty. The Oxford University scholar Max Roser\u2019s website, Our World in Data, used World Bank databases to estimate that in 2013, there were 746 million people living in extreme poverty. Of these people, slightly more than 380 million resided in Africa, with Nigeria being home to largest number (86 million). Meanwhile, 327 million of those in extreme poverty lived in Asia, with India having the largest proportion by far (218 million). China had 25 million. The remaining 35 million lived in South America (19 million), North America (13 million), Oceania (2.5 million) and Europe (0.7 million.)\n\n\n\nPut differently, of those who live in extreme poverty, over 40 percent resided in just two nations: India and Nigeria.\n\n\n\nSince its economic liberalization reforms in 1991, India\u2019s average income has increased by 7.5 percent per year. That means that average income has more than tripled over the last quarter century. As wealth increased, the poverty rate in India declined by almost 24 percent. But most significantly, for the Dalits \u2013 the poorest and lowest caste in Indian society \u2013 the poverty rate during this period declined even faster, by 31 percent. That means that in the nation that has by far the largest number of people in extreme poverty, it is the people at the very bottom of the social strata who are getting richer faster.\n\n\n\nA similar trend can be seen in Nigeria. Since the new millennium, gross domestic income per capita has increased by over 800 percent, from $270 to over $2,450. There is much work to be done, but this level of progress shows that even in the poorest countries, the speed of economic growth is encouraging.\n\n\n\nIn order to help the poorest, consider the impact free-market capitalism has had in the last 200 years in alleviating extreme poverty. The Industrial Revolution turned the once impoverished western countries into abundant societies. The new age of globalization, which started around 1980, saw the developing world enter the global economy and resulted in the largest escape from poverty ever recorded. That is something that the late Father Wresinski would have been eager to celebrate.\n\n\n\nThis first appeared in FEE.\n\nAlexander C. R.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in February about her Green New Deal, she said that her goal was bigger than just passing some new laws. \"What I hope we're able to do is rediscover the power of public imagination,\" she said.\n\nWell, we're unleashing our imagination and exploring a dream, a possible future in which we're bringing global warming to a halt. It's a world in which greenhouse emissions have ended.\n\nSo \u2014 what does this world look like?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Panoramic Images/Getty Images Panoramic Images/Getty Images\n\nMass Electrification (Batteries Hold The Power)\n\n(Editor's note: Each story has two sections, the first reflecting the present and the second imagining the world of 2050.)\n\n2019: I went looking for people who've mapped out this world without greenhouse emissions. I found them in Silicon Valley.\n\nSila Kiliccote is an engineer. The back deck of her house, high up in the hills, overlooks Cupertino. Apple's circular headquarters is hidden in the morning mist. It's a long way from Istanbul, in Turkey, where she grew up; a great place to conjure up future worlds.\n\n\"Maybe you'd like some coffee?\" Kiliccote says.\n\nHer coffee machine is powered by solar panels on the roof. So is her laptop and her Wi-Fi.\n\n\"Everything runs on electricity in this house,\" she says.\n\nThis is the foundation of a zero-carbon world: Electricity that comes from clean sources, mainly the sun and the wind, cheap and increasingly abundant.\n\nToday, it powers this house; tomorrow, it could drive the world.\n\nLast year, Kiliccote quit her job at Stanford University and launched a startup company, eIQ Mobility, helping companies replace their fleets of vehicles, such as delivery vans, with electric-powered versions.\n\n\"In order to have impact, timely impact, I figured that I need to leave research and focus on impactful things that I want to do. And fast,\" she says.\n\nIt has to happen really fast. Last year, the world's climate scientists put out a report showing what it will take to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C by the end of this century, averting the worst consequences of climate change. It requires bringing the globe's net greenhouse emissions down to zero by 2050.\n\nIt's a giant leap for humankind.\n\nSo Sila Kiliccote and I take that leap. Sitting in her kitchen, with solar panels overhead and an electric car parked outside, we pretend that it has happened. It's 2050 and we've stopped climate change.\n\n\"Any sense of how we did it?\" I ask her.\n\nShe pauses. \"Yes,\" she says.\n\n2050: The first step was electric cars. That was actually pretty easy\n\n\"By 2025, battery technology got cheaper,\" she says. Electric cars were no longer more expensive. \"At that point there was a massive shift to electric vehicles, because they were quieter, and cleaner, and [required] less maintenance. No oil change! Yippee! You know?\"\n\nHeating and cooling in homes and office buildings have gone electric, too. Gas-burning furnaces have been replaced with electric-power like heat pumps.\n\nWe needed more electricity to power all this right when we were shutting down power plants that burned coal and gas. It took a massive increase in power from solar and wind farms. They now cover millions of acres in the U.S., 10 times more land than they did in 2020. Huge electrical transmission lines share electricity between North and South America. Europe is connected to vast solar installations in the Sahara desert, which means that sub-Saharan Africa also has access to cheap power.\n\n\"It just changed Africa,\" Kiliccote says. \"It actually fueled the economies of Africa.\"\n\nWe now store electricity so that it's always there when we need it. With batteries, of course, but in lots of other ways, too. For instance, cities are using electricity to heat and chill massive tanks of water, which then heat or cool buildings at any hour of the day or night.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR\n\nSally Benson, co-director of the Stanford Precourt Institute for Energy, is so ready to take the leap and imagine this zero-carbon world 2050, it's a little startling.\n\n\"I regularly take a helicopter, an electric helicopter, from here to San Francisco,\" she assures me, totally deadpan.\n\n\"You can run a helicopter on batteries?\" I ask, not quite believing it.\n\n\"Oh, yes! Oh, God, yes. That happened a long time ago,\" Benson says, laughing. \"That happened in the 2030s. That was great.\"\n\nBut she says that even in this all-electric world, there are some holdouts. Some things have just been really hard to electrify.\n\nSome big cement and steel plants still are burning coal or natural gas, but they also have to install massive plants to capture carbon dioxide from their smokestacks and put it back underground.\n\n\"We just had to kind of bite the bullet and say, 'OK, if you're making cement or steel, you are capturing and sequestering that CO2,'\" Benson says. \"And in some cases we actually had to say, 'We're not going to make those things here anymore'\" because it wasn't economically feasible to capture the CO2 emissions from that factory.\n\nBig, long-distance freight trucks were a problem, too. \"They're really heavy, and batteries are really heavy, and if you have to put a whole bunch of batteries on a truck it's really inefficient,\" Benson says.\n\nIn some areas, like this one, our picture of the future gets a little fuzzy. Different guides to this 2050 world show me slightly different things.\n\nSome of my guides see \"electric highways\" with wires overhead, and trucks tapping into the electric power in those wires the same way trains do. Others see trucks running on hydrogen fuel; we make that hydrogen using solar or hydro power.\n\nIt appears that aircraft still are burning jet fuel. When you buy a plane ticket, you're also paying to cancel out that flight's carbon emissions, capturing an equivalent amount of CO2 from the air. This makes air travel expensive. Fortunately, we now have much faster trains. Teleconferencing helps, too.\n\nSally Benson is absolutely convinced about one thing. The hardest part of this journey wasn't finding technical solutions. They all existed, even back in 2019. The hardest part was navigating the social disruption.\n\n\"The transformations were so profound that it really needed to be a collective effort,\" she says.\n\nEntire industries died \u2014 like oil exploration and gas furnace manufacturing. Others rose to take their place, as the country rebuilt its electrical systems. People didn't know what would happen and they were scared. The changes only moved ahead when people were convinced that they weren't getting ignored and left behind. It was the political struggle of a generation.\n\nNow, in 2050, there's a tremendous sense of accomplishment.\n\n\"Are there children who look around at all the old buildings and say, 'What are those things they call chimneys? What were they for?' \" I ask.\n\n\"They do,\" Benson says with a chuckle. \"You know, it's like a historical artifact, but you know, they find it very touching. They are appreciative, because they're living in a world where they don't need to worry about climate change anymore.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy and it wasn't free, Benson says. But it was absolutely worth it.\n\nThe air is so much cleaner. Cities are quieter. And we're no longer heating up the planet.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR\n\nThe Urbanization Of Everything (A Desire Named Streetcars)\n\n2019: I'm taking a walk through downtown Toronto, in Canada, with Jennifer Keesmaat, the city's former chief planner.\n\nKeesmaat wants me to see one particular street. King Street. It's the seed of a zero-carbon future, she says.\n\nKing Street has a little bit of everything: glass-walled office buildings, theaters, old brick warehouses.\n\nEnvironment Toronto's King Street May Lead To A Carbon-Neutral City Toronto's King Street May Lead To A Carbon-Neutral City Listen \u00b7 6:08 6:08\n\nTwo years ago, a new set of traffic rules went into effect here. \"Basically, what we've done is, we've limited through-traffic for cars,\" Keesmaat says. It forced cars away from King Street and launched a whole cascade of changes.\n\nThe streetcars that run down the middle of King Street weren't stuck in traffic anymore.\n\nThey became the best way to get across town at rush hour. \"The volume of people being moved is astronomical!\" Keesmaat says, as one rolls by. The streetcars, of course, are powered by electricity, and one passes every two or three minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of people have been moving into this downtown neighborhood, buying condos and renting apartments. Keesmaat knows one of them. He's the father of one of her friends.\n\n\"He said to me a few weeks ago, he thinks he takes out his car about once every two weeks,\" Keesmaat says. He walks to shops, restaurants and basketball games. His neighbors walk to jobs in the financial district right down the street. He's not heating a big free-standing house, either.\n\nHe has cut his energy use, and his greenhouse emissions, dramatically.\n\n\"That wasn't the driver for him,\" Keesmaat says. \"He didn't say, 'How do I in fact live smaller?\" It just happened naturally in this new urban geography.\n\nFor a city planner, like Keesmaat, this is totally inspiring. \"When we provide people with real choices, better choices, it can open up our minds!\" she says. \"We can change our minds about what we thought was the only way to live.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR\n\n2050: At this point, Keesmaat and I open up our minds and take a leap into a world that could be. Greenhouse gas emissions have dropped to zero.\n\nHow did we do it? By gradually reshaping our cities so that they look more like this neighborhood, with lots of people living close together, within walking distance of many of the things they need.\n\nKeesmaat can already see this city in her mind, and describe it. \"The vast majority of streets have been pedestrianized; that's how people get around, by walking down the street,\" she says.\n\n\"What has happened to the sprawling suburbs?\" I ask. \"Are people living there? How are they getting around?\"\n\n\"Some of the large homes haven't changed at all,\" Keesmaat says. They've just been turned into multifamily units.\" Other free-standing houses that once lined suburban cul-de-sacs have disappeared; each one has been replaced with a building that contains five or six homes. With the local population booming, those neighborhoods also attracted shops and offices. Suburban sprawl morphed into urban density.\n\nCars have mostly disappeared. \"There are cars, but people don't own cars,\" Keesmaat says. \"Because a car is something that you use occasionally when you need it.\" Streetcars and buses go practically everywhere in the city now, and you rarely have to wait more than a couple of minutes to catch one. Fast buses and trains connect towns. For other destinations, there's car-sharing.\n\n\"2050? It's a wonderful life!\" says Daniel Hoornweg, another one of my guides to this zero-carbon world. He's a professor of energy systems at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. Years ago, he wrote a big report on cities and climate change for the World Bank.\n\nHe also can describe this new city, and how it took shape. Local governments created it, he says. First, they gave people new ways to get around: subways, bike lanes, buses and streetcars.\n\nBut along with those carrots, there was also a stick. Cities took control of the precious real estate known as \"roads\" and started charging for the right to use them. \"Maybe the most powerful thing that got us here, is [that] we got the pricing right,\" he says. \"So, you want an autonomous vehicle? Bless your heart, but it costs you more to drive that autonomous vehicle on the road by yourself. If you ride-share, it's a little bit less.\"\n\n\"And this is even if they are electric vehicles?\" I ask.\n\n\"Even more if they're electric vehicles!\" Hoornweg says. Personal electric cars for everyone couldn't solve the problem, he explains. First of all, electricity is precious. We can't waste it powering everybody's electric car.\n\nSecond, electric cars could have clogged the streets of our densely populated cities the same way gas-burning cars once did, back in, say, 2019. Our city of 2050 functions because streets are clear for buses and streetcars and bikes.\n\nThe basic recipe \u2014 densely populated neighborhoods linked by mass transit \u2014has been the same for cities all over the world, Hoornweg says. But the details came from constant experimentation. If an idea worked in one place, other cities snatched it up. For instance, way back in 1991 the city Curitiba, in Brazil, built dedicated roads for fast buses, kind of a train system running on wheels. That kind of system has now spread around the globe.\n\nAnd it wasn't just technology, Hoornweg says. Over the past three decades, from 2020 to 2050, a huge cultural shift has taken place.\n\nJust one example: In Toronto, the sharing economy that started decades ago with Uber and Airbnb is everywhere now. \"Sharing rides, sharing tools, sharing somebody to look after your dog when you're not there.\"\n\nYes, we apparently still have dogs in 2050.\n\nIn part, people are forced to share things; cars are scarce and homes are smaller. (Scores of home builders went belly-up in the 2030s when millions of people suddenly decided that big houses weren't just expensive; they were lonely, too.)\n\nBut the scale of zero-carbon life also makes it easier to share. We're living closer together and run into neighbors all the time. \"We have more acquaintances \u2014 somebody we met in our ride pool or car pool or whatever,\" Hoornweg says. \"There's no better way to [meet your neighbors] than sitting in a [shared] car and you can't get away from them for 20 minutes or whatever.\"\n\nSome people hated losing their yards and their solitary commutes at first. Others loved the changes. Eventually, Hoornweg says, it just became normal. People stopped talking about it.\n\nLife now goes on as it always did. But there's one huge difference. We're no longer heating up the planet.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR\n\nFarmers Cut Down On Greenhouse Emissions (This Grass Really Is Greener)\n\n2019: Jacobo Arango was traveling in a forested part of his country, Colombia, when he ran into one big reason for global warming. He didn't see it, but he could hear it.\n\n\"You could hear the chainsaw cutting the forest; and the locals [were] telling us that this is nothing unusual for them, that they were hearing that every day,\" says Arango, who is a researcher at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, or CIAT.\n\nEnvironment Fighting Global Warming Requires Changes In How Cows Are Fed Fighting Global Warming Requires Changes In How Cows Are Fed Listen \u00b7 5:05 5:05\n\nThis was totally illegal. But local farmers didn't dare report it. \"They said, if you do that, your life could be in danger,\" Arango recalls.\n\nUsually, what follows land clearing in the tropics is cattle grazing. It's a careless, destructive form of cattle grazing, and Tim Searchinger, at the World Resources Institute, says it's incredibly common. \"Grazing land is about two-thirds of all agricultural land, and about a third of that came right out of clearing forests,\" he says.\n\nIt's a climate disaster. First, cutting down trees and tearing up forest soil releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Then, cattle release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, as microbes in their stomach digest grass and leaves.\n\nThere are greenhouse emissions from other kinds of farming, too \u2014 from plowing and from fertilizer. Add it all up, and growing food accounts for a quarter of the entire climate change problem. That could increase, too, because billions of people around the world are getting richer; they want more beef, too.\n\n\"There is no solution to climate change that doesn't dramatically reduce the land use demands and greenhouse emissions of agriculture,\" Searchinger says.\n\nHe and his colleagues at WRI released a report last year that laid out a road map for how to do this. It includes lots of things, from wasting less food to reducing greenhouse emissions from fertilizer.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR\n\nBut perhaps the single biggest piece of the solution is something we don't often hear about.\n\nJacobo Arango wants to show it to me.\n\nHe's brought me to a farm in the Pat\u00eda valley, not far from Colombia's Pacific coast.\n\nThis is cattle-grazing country. I see wide, grassy pastures, lined by trees. Nohely Angulo Mosquera, the leader of a farmers cooperative, is clapping his hands, calling his cows, inviting them to move to a new pasture.\n\nThis pasture is a bovine buffet. The grass is up to my waist. This is not ordinary grass that grows wild in this region. These are varieties with names like Mulato, and Cayman, which researchers at CIAT bred and selected to be top-quality cattle feed.\n\nAngulo Mosquera says that these grasses grow so fast, and they're so nutritious, he can keep four or even six cows on land that used to support just one. He does have to manage the cows more carefully; moving them every few weeks to new pastures when the grass is ready.\n\n\"More milk, more meat,\" he says.\n\nHe doesn't mention it, but it's also true: In the old days, his cows took a long time to gain weight or produce a gallon of milk, but their gut microbes still kept churning out methane, day after day, year after year. Now, because the animals are growing so much faster, they aren't releasing nearly as much methane per pound of milk or meat.\n\nWe're looking at an essential part of a world without climate change.\n\nAnd as we stand there, Jacobo Arango and I just start imagining it's already happened, and talking as though it's real.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR\n\n2050: The same way we stopped mining coal to generate electricity, we've stopped mining the soil to grow food.\n\n\"It's different now, in 2050,\" Arango says with a smile.\n\nIn a world without climate change, this is what cattle grazing looks like, all over the tropics. Farmers aren't letting cows wander across the landscape in search of something to eat. They're treating their pasture like a valuable crop, which it really is.\n\n\"This was critical, to change the mindset of cattle growers,\" Arango says.\n\nAs a result, production is way up and \"there is no need to cut the Amazon to do livestock production,\" Arango says.\n\nAnother critical change: Americans are eating a lot less beef now \u2014 per person, half what they ate in 2020. \"That's a really, really big deal,\" Searchinger says.\n\nTraveling the country, you now see alternatives to beef and dairy products everywhere. There are blended mushroom-beef burgers in fast food chains and non-dairy cheese on pizzas. They even taste pretty good, thanks to the creative genius of America's finest food scientists.\n\nPeople who stop at these places don't really think about the big global impact of what they're doing, any more than they did when they were eating all hamburgers.\n\nBut they've been part of something amazing. It's 2050 and there are almost 10 billion people in the world. They are eating better \u2014 yet the Amazon forest is still there. It hasn't been sacrificed to grow food.\n\nIn fact, in parts of North and South America, including that farm we visited in Colombia, more trees are growing. We're not mining the soil anymore. We're replenishing it.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "From The Bassmans Band It's Blue Bossa", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=SKmIcRJWQak&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6lZn9us5Z4s%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-5-1", "transcript": "Published on May 1, 2019\n\nClick Below to Subscribe.

Sheriffs talk about the rise in permitting. Also in today's podcast: The city of San Diego is taking proposals for Pechanga Arena, and part two of Mexico's American gun flow problem. Aired: May 1, 2019 | Transcript\n\nThere were around 1,300 concealed weapons permits (CCW) issued in San Diego County in February of last year. Through this April that number has risen to more than 2,400 permits.\n\n\"To get a concealed carry permit you have to have good cause,\" said San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore. \"We\u2019re evaluating the good cause \u2014 we\u2019ve expanded some of the categories and that\u2019s why you see the increase.\"\n\nGore said to get a concealed weapons permit people need to show they are in harms way. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department website stipulates, \"Applicants for a CCW should be able to set forth a set of circumstances that distinguishes the applicant from other members of the general public and causes him or her to be placed in harm\u2019s way. Simply writing 'self defense' or 'personal protection' on an application does not provide the requisite proof of good cause.\"\n\nGore said the sheriff\u2019s department has been working to more broadly define what \"good cause\" means.\n\nYour browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.

The group has a section on it's website titled, \"How to apply for a CCW.\"\n\nGore said the county has always had a high standard for concealed weapons permits. He said self defense is not \"good cause.\"\n\n\"Be able to articulate your good cause \u2014 why you need it,\" Gore said. \"Obviously, you have to have good moral character \u2014 no criminal background \u2014 but the big change has been in getting people to apply and how we interpret that good cause.\"\n\nGore said there was a myth in the past that San Diego county never gave out concealed weapons permits.\n\n\"'Don\u2019t even apply because the sheriff doesn\u2019t give them out\u2019 that's never been \u2014 couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\" Gore said.\n\nSan Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said he has worked to more broadly define what \"good cause\" means to get a concealed weapons permit.

And, most importantly, it is adversely affecting wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans at a high rate. Not only land but an increase in plastic waste is also affecting waterways and oceans the most.\n\nHowever, certain people started to look for positive initiatives for changing the current tragic state that we are living in. Yes, there are examples which are proving all hope isn\u2019t lost to save our planet. And, one of those great examples is this Indian couple who operates a school that charges students in plastic instead of money for education and also transforming the entire town. Let\u2019s know more about it!\n\nAbout Indian Couple Who Took This Initiative\n\nSource = Wtvideo\n\nHere we are talking about Parmita and Mazin, one other great couple same as the Brazilian couple who restored a destroyed forest. But here, the story is a little different.\n\nParmita & Mazin is the Indian couple that created this unconventional school in India where students carry bags of plastic every day on their way to school. Shocking but true!\n\nMazin had arrived in India from New York back in 2013 on a different school project. Due to his work, he later met Parmita, who was a Master\u2019s student in Social Work at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). And coincidentally, she was also planning to work in the education sector.\n\nBefore this school was established, most of these children worked as laborers in the local stone quarries. But the founders began to increasingly attract more children to school because of their focused curriculum and a passion for teaching and bringing the community together. They started with 20 children at first, but now they have grown to 110.\n\nAbout Akshar Foundation\n\nAkshar Foundation's revolutionary model gives underprivileged students all the skills they need to build productive lives for themselves.\n\nIt was started in June of 2016 by Parmita Sarma and Mazin Mukhtar in the northeastern Indian state of Assam on the southern boundary of the Himalayas.\n\nApart from regular studies, the foundation teaches students how to take responsibility for their environment and how to improve it.\n\nAnd, this school became the first one where students pay their \"school fees\" in the form of clean plastic waste from their homes. Also, they let students participate in the school Recycling Center while learning environmental science.\n\n\u200bHow They Got the Idea?\n\nSource = Twimg\n\nAccording to Sarma and Mukhtar, the key moments that led to the idea of recycling was when their classrooms would fill with toxic fumes as people nearby would burn plastic waste during the winter to keep their place warm.\n\nThey said that it was common in their area. Families there collect waste, including plastics and then burn piles to keep their place warm during the winter, not knowing of the serious environmental and health harm from such a method.\n\nHence by looking at such a situation, the couple was determined to make a positive change within the community both educationally and environmentally. Hence, they began to encourage their students to bring plastic waste as a form of tuition since many of them struggled to afford the fees required to attend school.\n\nSource = Time8\n\nIn an interview, Mazin Mukhtar, the Co-Founder of the school, mentioned that he & his wife together came up with the idea.\n\n\u201cWe were both already dreaming of starting a new kind of school specifically designed for children in poverty. We formed Akshar that same year we met and we started our school, Akshar Forum, in 2016.\n\nWhen we started the recycling center, parents were not cooperative at first. So we came up with the \u201cPlastic School Fees\u201d idea to compel the parents to recycle. The school was free for years before we started that policy. In reality, it\u2019s more like mandatory homework than school fees but calling it plastic school fees serves to remind the parents: the school is entirely free but the least you can do is help us and help yourselves by sending your clean, dry plastic waste from home.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that, Parmita Sarma, one of the school founders, said,\n\n\u201cWe wanted to start a free school for all but stumbled upon this idea after we realized a larger social and ecological problem brewing in this area. I still remember how our classrooms would be filled with toxic fumes every time someone in the nearby areas would burn plastics. Here, it was the norm to burn waste plastic to keep warm. We wanted to change that and so started to encourage our students to bring their plastic waste as school fees\u201d\n\nHow Do They Work?\n\nSource = Creapills\n\nAs we mentioned earlier that before the school established, most of the children worked as laborers in the local stone quarries. There they would make around $2.50 a day.\n\nHowever, the school can\u2019t pay to children. Hence, they found an alternative. Akshar Foundation allows older students to teach younger ones. Instead of money, those young teachers earn toy currency notes that let students buy snacks, clothes, and papers. Hence, it was a learning experience for the school as well.\n\nMoreover, those young ones can also ask their teachers to buy something online if they need anything from there. So the teachers order anything the student wants from Amazon by changing their earned notes to real money.\n\nMeanwhile, the Akshar Foundation teaches their students and parents about the adverse effects of plastic usage. Parmita said that before the parents got the awareness, they used to burn plastic to warm their homes.\n\nShe added that they were shocked to learn about the hazards they were exposing their children to once the school started educating the community.\n\nSource = Creapills\n\nWhile speaking about the teaching methods at school, Mazin said,\n\n\u201cWe use child labor to fight child labor \u2013 kids in poverty need to earn money to stay in school, learning and earning. We employ children as tutors and social workers. This ensures that younger children receive daily tuition from an older, caring student.\n\nOur students learn more to earn more \u2013 we pay them based on their skills and knowledge, and fine them for bad behaviour. As students move from one grade level to the next, their wages increase. Also, wages increase with teaching skill. Students are strongly incentivised to behave like model students.\u201d\n\nHe added,\n\n\u201cPlace every student directly into a career \u2013 kids stay in school until the school finds a career for them \u2014 via college or apprenticeship in a high skill trade. Teens develop vocational skills, in addition to teaching, during the critical 12-18 age group. Students learn English, Math, and Science, but in secondary school, the curriculum incorporates Carpentry, Embroidery, Recycling, Photography and soon, a more developed Solar Technician course. We are developing a \u201cSchool-to-Career Pipeline\u201d.\n\nCharge them plastic school fees \u2013 teach them to be responsible for their surroundings. If every school does this, it can impact the plastic crisis. Students learn to address the problems afflicting their communities, and they develop machines and inventions as part of their coursework to address the problems.\u201d\n\nSource = Wixstatic\n\nPer week, around 25 pieces of plastic waste every student brings as their contribution to the community.\n\nThey continued saying,\n\n\u201cInitially, most of our teenage boys were dropouts and child laborers. Now, they earn money in school by teaching during school hours and operating our Recycling Center after school.\u201d\n\nAmong all these students, some of the at-risk teens are employed to compress dozens of plastic packets into plastic bottles to make \u201cEco-bricks.\u201d Such Eco-bricks are utilized for construction work by fixing them with cement.\n\nIt can be seen that in the picture of the small tree planter below, they used roughly 200 plastic bottles and 4,000 plastic packets ( half of them were non-recyclable).\n\nSource = Creapills\n\nMazin Mukhtar said,\n\n\u201cNext, we plan on building a dedicated girl\u2019s toilet using a combination of normal bricks and Eco-bricks.\u201d\n\nAt last, Parmita and Mazin, the couple that created this school, said that they aspire to create 100 schools like this across India in the future.\n\nWatch This Video to Learn More about the Foundation:\n\nHats Off to the Couple!", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Different Types of Cases of Deportation", "score": 1, "url": "https://immigrationlawyerusa.blogspot.com/2019/06/different-types-of-cases-of-deportation.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "Do you interested to work in the field of human rights?

Santanu Paul/CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nDeep in the Sundarbans in southwestern Bangladesh, one of the world\u2019s largest mangrove forests saw its tigers disappear at an alarming rate. The population of big cats had begun to disappear at the turn of the 21st century, snatched by poachers and pirates who snuck their way into the wildlife sanctuary in search of tiger skin. But a recent effort to double down on illegal poaching has allowed the population of Bengal tigers in the Sundarbans to increase for the first time in 15 years, according to a new tiger census released on May 21, 2019, the Dhaka Tribune reports.\n\nSplit between Bangladesh and India, the Sundarbans mangroves spread their roots throughout 4,000 square miles in the Bay of Bengal, according to National Geographic. It is the largest mangrove forest in the world, and the only one occupied by tigers. In its prime, the forest was a labyrinthine, waterlogged jungle, almost impenetrable to humans\u2014in other words, the perfect place to be an endangered animal. The forest\u2019s entwined roots, brackish water channels, and mosaicked chain of islands protected the endangered Bengal tiger and other rare species, such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, until poachers found a way in and reduced the wild population of big cats to a fraction of what it once was. In 2015, only 106 bengal tigers remained in the Sundarbans\u2014less than a quarter of the 440 counted in 2004.\n\nBut the most recent census, taken in 2018, counted 114 tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarban forest, according to the Dhaka Tribune. This averages out to 2.55 tigers per 100 square kilometers, as opposed to 2015\u2019s average of 2.17. Bangladesh\u2019s minister of forestry, Shahab Uddin, considers this eight percent increase a \u201cgreat success,\u201d according to Phys.com.\n\nA tiger steps out in a biosphere reserve in the Sundarbans. Soumyajit Nandy/CC BY 4.0\n\nCounting tigers in a remote, relatively untouched wildlife sanctuary is no easy feat. Researchers relied on camera traps, strategically deployed at 536 locations in the Sundarbans over 640 square miles of land. The cameras documented 63 adult tigers, four juveniles, and five cubs over the course of 249 days. Researchers extrapolated from this number to arrive at the 114 tiger estimate.\n\nThis resurgence didn\u2019t happen out of nowhere. Since the alarming report in 2015, Bangladeshi authorities have adopted a conservation program for the big cats, including doubling the size of the wildlife sanctuary in the forest and also commissioning a security force. One strategy in the program offered a gun buyback scheme, which resulted in 200 pirates trading in their weapons and ammunition to the police for legal aid, mobile phones, and cash. The program also launched a patrolling program to catch future poachers in the act.\n\nBut still, Bangladesh\u2019s Bengal tigers face an even greater threat in the form of climate change, according to a story in The New York Times. Around 70 percent of Sundarban land lies just a few feet above sea level, and a new report predicts tigers will have entirely vanished from the Sundarban by 2070.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3sdq6zaxa3n3jdfhhq15hg6QNgjYFJtNYp1FYFB5I54.jpg"}, {"title": "This 26-Year-Old Man Is Restoring Faith In Humanity By Reviving Dead Lakes in India", "score": 404, "url": "http://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2019/04/this-26-year-old-man-is-restoring-faith-in-humanity-by-reviving-dead-lakes-in-india.html", "comments": 7, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "The world is facing the worst ever water crisis, according to recent reports, with 844 million people lacking access to clean water. One of the main problems that cause that is water pollution. Fortunately, there are people like 26-year old Ramveer Tanwar from India, that can\u2019t stand ignoring this problem and who\u2019ve decided to take action.\n\nOne day, Ramveer Tanwar realized that the lakes and ponds where he played with his friends when they were children, had started to disappear. Many of the wetlands were polluted and had instead become dumping areas. He decided that it's time to change this and educate people about the significance of having clean water.\n\nRamveer gave lessons to students from his village at the beginning, and they felt they had to do something about the dying water resources. Ramveer told the children to warn their parents about the existing problem with water conservation and water pollution. Sadly, this did not work, since the villagers refused to believe that they could ever run out of water.\n\nAfter that, Ramveer decided that he had to do this on his own. Therefore, he went from house to house, to each villager, explaining the issue of the depleting water resources to them. He later told the students to gather their parents together each Sunday in a special place, where he'd facilitate a discussion and suggest methods for water conservation. Finally, it began to happen, and the villagers began to realize the problem they were facing.\n\nThe authorities recognized his effort, and the meetings were officially named \u201cJal Chaupals.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Ramveer along with his team of volunteers, the students, and their parents removed the garbage from that pond. They did not only clean it, but they also planted trees around it. Later, they invited the local administration to come and see the glorious restoration. The good news spread fast; soon enough locals from other villages and districts began to go to Ramveer to ask for the help of their local lakes.\n\nThanks to the help of volunteers and enthusiasts, many lakes and ponds have been restored. The most critical thing in cleaning those bodies of water was to prevent further pollution. Once the water has been cleaned, the group digs out a separate pit to collect garbage. They then install a double filtration system, which is a filter made of wooden planks and a patch of grasses, to prevent garbage pieces from making their way into the water in the future.\n\nPits and filters are cleaned once a week.\n\nRamveer wanted to continue to preserve water in the country and has had to wear many hats in this effort. The government helped him and set up \u201cGroundwater Army\u201d organizations in every district of Ramveer\u2019s state, and the young hero has now become the coordinator of his community. Together they focus on water conservation in the areas. Unfortunately, the government has no fund for those types of awareness programs, and Ramveer had to spend his money to continue what he started.\n\nPreview photo: Ramveer Tanwar / facebook", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Recruitment Made Easy with Recruiting Software", "score": 1, "url": "https://staffingsoft.wordpress.com/2019/06/01/recruitment-made-easy-with-recruiting-software/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "Talent acquisition the process is not just time consuming and money demanding, but it is highly crucial for the success and growth of the organization as well.

She and her husband were family friends when I was younger. Grace was kind, generous and fun-loving. She was interested in your thoughts, your life and your welfare. She was loved, respected and admired by just about everyone who knew her.\n\nGrace was able to show the love of God and demonstrate to my young mind the fruit of the Spirit of God by the way she lived and carried herself. Charm, kindness and love flowed from her. I didn\u2019t realize it back then, but in the brief time our paths crossed Grace taught me some of my first lessons about the pricelessness of grace.\n\nAs I sit down to write about how life can be transformed by the Spirit of God, I remember the generous and gracious life of this person I once knew.\n\nCan I convey in one article how to let God live in us through His Spirit? We all need to set our hearts to do so and achieve the state of grace personified by the lady named Grace I knew long ago.\n\nI can think of no more pressing topic for us than to under-stand how God wants to have a relationship with us through the essence of His nature, the Holy Spirit.\n\nCreated to share glory\n\nJesus Christ tells us that \u201cGod is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth\u201d (John 4:24 ). God the Father and Jesus Christ exist in a harmony and unity beyond what we can humanly understand. They are without beginning or end, eternal, but wanting and willing to share Their way of life and glory with Their human creation. You were created in the image of God with the ability to share part of the glory of God in this life today. But how?\n\nGod graciously gives us the gift of His nature by and through His Holy Spirit. With that Spirit we can live a transformed life beyond any semblance of our life before that. In short, God offers us the opportunity to take on His divine nature, thus becoming like Him in character, thought and action.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how we receive that Spirit, what that Spirit is and what it can do for our lives.\n\nRepentance to life\n\nWhen the apostle Peter gave his defense to the Church members in Jerusalem after baptizing the gentile (non-Israelite) converts of the household of Cornelius, he summarized the essence of what happens when one receives the Spirit:\n\n\u201c\u2018And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, \u201cJohn indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\u201d If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gaveus when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?\u2019 When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, \u2018Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life\u2019\u201d (Acts 11:15-18 , emphasis added throughout).\n\nThe change of your mind and heart that leads you to seek the crucial connection with God leads to receiving the essence of His nature, the Holy Spirit. This changed orientation is called repentance. It leads to a new life with the potential for a close personal relationship with God.\n\nGodly repentance is a change of mind and attitude toward God. It follows conviction by the Holy Spirit and the Word of God acting on our conscience. Repentance involves an awareness of personal sin, which is the transgression of God\u2019s holy and righteous law (1 John 3:4 ). It is accompanied by sincere remorse and resolution to respond to God\u2019s calling by obedience and submission to His way of life.\n\nRepentance toward God is not a temporary emotional response. It is a response resulting in a permanent change of thought, behavior and direction of life. It results in a determined commitment to turn to God, to forsake a life of sin that separates us from God and to walk forward in all of God\u2019s commandments.\n\nScripture shows that such a mind change\u2014coming to understand that we are sinners who must forsake sin and turn to following God\u2014should be followed by baptism and the laying on of hands by a minister of God (Acts 2:38 ; Acts 8:17 ; Acts 22:16 ). It is then that God gives His Spirit to those who obey (Acts 5:32 ). It is then that a life of the Spirit can begin\u2014a life graced by God\u2019s presence dwelling in us through that Spirit.\n\nStanding in grace\n\nThe apostle Paul explains the reality of this new life in some remarkable passages of Scripture. In his letter to the Romans he explains the gift of grace we have through the forgiveness of sin and God\u2019s Spirit\u2014His essence\u2014dwelling in us.\n\nHe explains the grace we have as something \u201cin which we stand\u201d (Romans 5:2 ). The step of faith leading to repentance, baptism and receiving God\u2019s Spirit produces peace with God and our Lord Jesus Christ and a deep relationship built from confidence that our Father and our Elder Brother love us. God understands us fully. When Paul says we \u201cstand\u201d in God\u2019s grace, he refers to a wonderfully comforting relationship with God, a relationship that is enduring and faithful.\n\nHaving made that commitment, we need not worry that God will instantly condemn us when we slip and sin (see Romans 8:1 ). God does not remove Himself from us (Hebrews 13:5 ). The connection remains as long as we do not turn completely away from God in refusal to ever repent, totally quenching the Holy Spirit in us.\n\nWhen we veer from God\u2019s gracious relationship with us, through sin or neglect, we will suffer the devastating impact of sin. God has not moved, but we have. Life will hit us in the face with excruciating impact. We then have a choice whether to return to a right relationship with God. Yet this is also an aspect of God\u2019s grace, as the difficulties are meant to help us, God working all the while to rescue us. Of course, the choice to continue with God, following the lead of His Spirit, ultimately remains ours. And we must strive to maintain that.\n\nPaul explains the work of the Holy Spirit in us as the basis for our hope of sharing in the glory of God. The Spirit of God in us will create the essential quality of endurance and character to withstand the trials of our lives. Grace and righteousness are gifts that create a stable life. Paul explains that grace reigns through righteousness that leads to the hope of eternal life through Christ (Romans 5:21 ).\n\nSo when he then asks, \u201cShall we continue in sin that grace may abound?\u201d the obvious answer is \u201cCertainly not!\u201d (Romans 6:1-2 ). God\u2019s gift of grace and His Spirit should lead us away from sin\u2014away from our corrupt natural inclination that leads us toward sin. Paul then explains that baptism\u2014immersion in water\u2014is a symbol of putting to death the old self, an outward sign of our inner desire to live a new life with new priorities and a completely different orientation.\n\nPaul likens our emergence from the \u201cwatery grave\u201d of baptism to Jesus Christ\u2019s resurrection from the grave, with us rising to then walk in a new way of life. With Christ we then live a new life to God, \u201cdead indeed to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d (Romans 6:8-11 ).\n\nHow are we doing?\n\nThe only right we have to call ourselves Christian\u2014to bear the name of Christ\u2014is through a genuine repentance in faith and baptism in Christ\u2019s name. Have you ever examined yourself by this standard? Several scriptures convict us to do so. To the Church members in Corinth Paul said: \u201cExamine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?\u2014unless indeed you are disqualified\u201d (2 Corinthians 13:5 ).\n\nThe key, we see here, is Christ in us. That is the test as to whether or not we are truly Christian!\n\nPaul expands on this in his letter to the Church members in Rome: \u201cLetting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace. For the sinful nature [of the fleshly mind] is always hostile to God. It never did obey God\u2019s laws, and it never will. That\u2019s why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.\n\n\u201cBut you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.) And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God.\n\n\u201cThe Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same Spirit living within you\u201d (Romans 8:6-11 , New Living Translation).\n\nHere is a key fact to understand about the Holy Spirit. Receiving God\u2019s Spirit makes God our Father in a literal manner. That Spirit makes us sons of God. When God gives us His Spirit, the divine nature enters our life, making us literal children of God. To use a parallel, as physical children carry in their makeup genes passed on from their parents, God\u2019s Spirit\u2014the essence of His divine nature\u2014literally becomes a part of our life when we are baptized and receive that Spirit.\n\nThe beginning of grace\n\nThrough this relationship with God, we enter into the life of the Spirit. This is where we begin to live in grace and demonstrate the gracious nature of God. When I noticed the appealing and kind nature of my friend Grace all those years ago, I was seeing the wonderful qualities Paul called the fruit of the Spirit of God (Galatians 5:22-23 ) coming out in the warmth of her eyes, the gentle tone of her voice and the kindness shown toward so many people. These qualities drew people to her in friendship. She was using the Spirit to be like God in character.\n\nHow? She let God live in her life. That is what we do when we let God live in us through His Spirit.\n\nThis is profound. The truth of the Bible on this subject is never more needed. So many people live confused, complicated lives of despair. Seeking meaning in life often leads down a dead-end street. Don\u2019t you want to connect to the purpose for your life? You can! That is what this article intends for you, through Scripture, to come to understand. When God invites us to understand His purpose for creating human life, we are connected to the most important of all knowledge!\n\nAt the heart of this revealed truth is the Holy Spirit of God, the divine nature of God in us as a force we can use to live with power, love and a sound mind. Fear need not be a part of our life (2 Timothy 1:7 ).\n\nChrist in us\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the point made above that we are literally sons and daughters of God. This is not a vague symbolic religious thought. It is a fact of Scripture, and most people read right over the verses that reveal this truth, never stopping to grasp what God offers us in this life.\n\nAs human children we have the DNA of our biological mother and father in every cell of our body. The language in the DNA strands determines our features so that we are literally formed in the image of our parents. DNA is the definitive identifier of our lineage.\n\nThe Spirit of God joins with our spirit to make us children of God. Romans 8:16 tells us: \u201cFor his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God\u2019s children. And since we are his children, we are his heirs. In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God\u2019s glory\u201d (NLT). By the Spirit we are literal heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. We are part of the God family. God is preparing us, as His children and heirs, to inherit all things (Revelation 21:7 ).\n\nWith the Holy Spirit we are \u201cpartakers of the divine nature\u201d (2 Peter 1:4 ). God\u2019s \u201cspirit DNA\u201d is in us, and we take on the character and nature of God our Father and Jesus Christ our Brother and High Priest.\n\nThink on this. What Paul writes takes on new meaning. \u201cI am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me\u201d (Galatians 2:20 , King James Version). Paul plainly tells us that through the Spirit, Christ lives in us.\n\n\u201cI will come to you\u201d\n\nPaul here adds depth to what Christ told His disciples on the eve of His death. Before His arrest, He explained why He had to be killed and then raised and what that would mean for them and all who would follow after as disciples\u2014including you today. Jesus promised a \u201cHelper\u201d or \u201cComforter,\u201d from the Greek word parakletos. This presence would be with us\u2014in fact, the presence and power of the Father and the Son dwelling within us. Christ called it \u201cthe Spirit of truth\u201d and said it \u201cdwells with you and will be in you.\u201d And He added, \u201cI will not leave you orphans; I will come to you\u201d (John 14:16-18 ).\n\nChrist\u2019s words speak to us today, explaining how we can have a relationship with Him and access the power of the Spirit to live out a meaningful life touched by the kindness and grace of God. His suffering and death provided the means for this to happen. His resurrection from the dead forever made possible the Father sharing His glory with humankind.\n\n\u201cAt that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you\u201d (verse 20). Jesus Christ and the Father are one in purpose and intent. They share the glory we will inherit. They also share the peace and power we desire and need to live successfully today. Christ is explaining the key to success in life. Through the Spirit of God living in us, we have power to cope with whatever life deals us.\n\nHope without despair\n\nA friend of mine recently called to tell me his only daughter had died. She was 39 years old, and though she had some health issues, the sudden death was unexpected. He and his wife were devastated. As we talked he commented on what life sometimes deals us. \u201cIt is sometimes a bad hand,\u201d he said, using the well-known analogy of being dealt a hand of playing cards. \u201cAnd you have to work with it. You cannot change it.\u201d How true. Real life circumstances cannot be turned back. We must \u201cplay the hand\u201d we\u2019re dealt.\n\nHow much better for us to \u201cplay the hand\u201d with the power of God in us, the life of Jesus Christ? That is what God offers with the promise of a \u201cComforter\u201d or \u201cHelper.\u201d God in us gives hope when there is despair. The Father in us gives a quality of love that leads to a patient endurance of the sorrow and pain. God does not intend that the trials of this life be endured without the calming salve of His grace. It is a bitter experience to go through this life, what William Shakespeare called \u201cthis vale of tears,\u201d without the comfort of God\u2019s presence.\n\nThis abiding presence of God is like a soothing salve, a lotion that calms and aids in healing. God\u2019s grace ultimately works like a balm that comforts our heart and soul with kindness and patience and love. The abiding presence of God in us provides the hope beyond the hurt, the expectation of joy beyond the depth of sorrow and the gentleness of spirit when life and people cause hurt and harm.\n\nCheck the headlines of your life. Chaos? Lack of purpose? Fear? A search for understanding among competing ideas? Life is not meant to be like that. You can find the way out of fear and confusion to a place of love and a sound mind\u2014a place of grace. You can find it in the pages of a book you probably have in your home\u2014the Bible. It contains the words of God waiting to speak to you and reveal the mind of the Creator of life to you.\n\nWired into your makeup is the need for this connection with God. The yearning you have to be loved and to be understood\u2014to understand and to show love\u2014comes from the fingerprint of God on your life from conception. We are at first an incomplete creation, in need of the Spirit of God to join with our spirit, forming the connection of grace by which God lives His life in us\u2014transforming us into His image.\n\nYou can choose to begin today!\n\nJesus Christ added another crucial thought while teaching His disciples: \u201cIf anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come and make Our home with him\u201d (John 14:23 ). By the Holy Spirit, the essence of Their nature, both the Father and Son live in the believer. Thus, Christ presented Himself and the Father to be the Source of comfort, help and encouragement provided through the promised Comforter. Part of His purpose in this passage was to point out that He would do far more through the Spirit dwelling in them than He did while He lived among them in the flesh. And this was borne out by the work Christ did through the Church, as recorded in the book of Acts.\n\nWe have access today to this power that can make all the difference in our lives. What I saw in my friend Grace was the fruit of the Spirit in her life. Her words and deeds gave benefit and grace to those she knew. To this day I remember her as an example of the grace of God shown through the life of one person. It is what happens when we submit to God in faith and allow Him to live in us.\n\nPaul lists the fruit of the Spirit as \u201clove, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control\u201d (Galatians 5:22-23 ).

They were terrified. They didn\u2019t know, were they looking at a ghost or a spirit? Then He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s me. Feel me, touch me, I am He.\u201d He asked for food and He said, \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d And He calmed them down. The story is told in Luke 24 and it gives us a great deal of instruction about some things that we need in our life and we look for. We want peace, we want peace of mind, we want the courage that comes from that, we want our minds not to be troubled, terrified, full of fear. We want that. But to get to that point, there is something else that we need and Jesus is going to tell His disciples how to get to that next step from peace to have a satisfied, successful life.\n\nWhat He did beginning in verse 44 of Luke 24 was to then, when He calmed them down, speak to them and teach them and He actually just began to explain the scriptures to them. He said, \u201cThese are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you. That all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, the prophets and the Psalms concerning me.\u201d And so He then began to open their understanding that they would understand the scriptures that spoke to the prophecies about His time, His life, death, and resurrection. And He said it is written that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins be preached in His name to all nations beginning a Jerusalem and you were witnesses of these things and they were indeed witnesses of those things\n\nAnd so, the teaching of the Word, He first calmed them down. He said, \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d And then He actually sat down and had a meal with them, which in itself has a calming effect. The fellowship, the talk, the conviviality that goes with such an occasion can settle people\u2019s hearts and minds. But it set them up for the teaching that He would give them from the scriptures and then He said one more thing to them. There was one more element that they would need. He began by saying \u201cPeace be to you.\u201d There was one other element that Christ gave to them and told them that they would need. What was that? Let\u2019s read in verse 49. \u201cBehold,\u201d He says. \u201cI send the promise of my Father upon you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d He said, \u201cin Jerusalem until you are given power from on high.\u201d That power is the Holy Spirit which was given to them a few days later on the day of Pentecost.\n\nAnd so we have two elements here in this story of Christ, peace and power. The power that comes by the presence of God in us through His Spirit. \u201cPower that comes from on high,\u201d as Jesus said. That\u2019s what we need to live a successful life, to banish fear, uncertainty, and worry that is going to come all too quickly in our own physical lives. Christ gave that to disciples. He gave that through His words, through His instruction in the word, the Word of God, explaining the scriptures to them and through that promise that He made to them of having power from on high. Peace and power, that\u2019s what we need to have a successful confident life. Christ living His life with us.\n\nThat\u2019s BT Daily.

There is a perspective that it is a Russian Iskander missile, or it is a new tactical ballistic missile,\" he said.\n\n\"There are data that we can verify, and we are working off those data to make sure we have a verification.\"\n\nJeong was responding to a question on whether the tests were a violation of a military agreement between South and North Korea last September to halt acts of aggression against each other.\n\nHe said the North was \"in fact acting within the boundaries\" of the agreement and tensions between their militaries \"have been lowered to a significant extent.\"\n\n\"So currently the actions done by the North Korean regime have the intent to carry out the peace process through dialogue and talks. And I believe that's the hidden intent behind the lines in terms of their missile launches.\"\n\nJeong called on the international community to \"assure North Korea that the decision to denuclearize is indeed the right decision.\"\n\nHe said that South Korea sees humanitarian aid and the lowering of military tensions as ways \"to lead North Korea into conversation and away from ... the ways of the past.\"\n\nNorth Korea itself has defended the launches, saying it was exercising its right to self-defense.\n\nThe U.S. and Japan say the short-range ballistic missile tests on May 4 and 9 were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The tests ended a pause in launches that began in late 2017, and came amid deadlocked negotiations to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons.\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya, who spoke at the same session on Korean security, stressed that a strict implementation of sanctions against North Korea was necessary.\n\nHe specifically directed his comments at South Korea, China and Russia.\n\n\"We need to enhance surveillance on a global scale while strengthening effort locally to ensure the full implementation of sanctions,\" Iwaya said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told the Shangri-La Dialogue conference that North Korea \"remains an extraordinary threat\" and has \"neared a point where it could credibly strike regional allies, U.S. territory, and our forward-deployed forces.\"", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0BMH0_CsVgvQFKhWqOFj-oMfvWJEtUf7xnxctrMZ-hY.jpg"}, {"title": "Norway bans biofuel from palm oil to fight deforestation - The entire European Union has agreed to ban palm oil\u2019s use in motor fuels from 2021", "score": 6221, "url": "https://www.cleantechexpress.com/2019/05/norway-bans-biofuel-from-palm-oil-to.html", "comments": 148, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "The action against palm oil is particularly harsh as it contributes a lot to deforestation.

It gives us something that no other human writer, no other human source, no other medium or part of culture can give us. It is the hope of God\u2019s intervention upon the world.\n\nThe Bible contains many dramatic scenes but nothing grabs the attention of readers of the Bible like the 4 riders of the horses of Revelation.\n\nAcross the landscape of history these 4 riders on these multi colored horses ride with dramatic fear, uncertainty, and wonder upon the world scene.\n\nA white horse, a red horse, a black horse, and a pale horse all bringing scenes of judgment, all bringing a message of warning upon a world that is out of control at a critical moment in human experience. But also at a time that will show the dramatic ability of the God of creation to control history.\n\nThis story begins with a scene in heaven and a voice of great thunder. It begins with a scroll that has 7 seals that are found to be at the very throne of God. Multiple angelic beings are there at the presence of the Father and of the Son and the Lamb and no one is found worthy, it says in the scriptures, to open that particular scroll with its seven seals except for the one describe as the Lamb. Only the Lamb, we are told, is worthy to open and to reveal the meaning of these scrolls that will unfold.\n\nThe story begins in Revelation 5 and let\u2019s read that for a moment and look and before we go into the story of the 4 horsemen that begin their ride upon human history in verse 8 of chapter 5 in the book of Revelation. The Lamb takes that scroll and it says when He had taken that scroll the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb. The Lamb represents Jesus Christ. Each have a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song saying you are worthy, meaning the Lamb, to take the scroll and to open its seals for You were slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation and have made us kings and priests to our God and we shall reign upon the earth.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that the Lamb is the one who has the ability to take the scroll and open and break all of the seals. Because what we read here beginning in chapter 6 of Revelation is a parallel to the Olivet prophecy that Jesus Christ himself gave to his disciples as recorded in the book of Matthew the 24th chapter in what is called the Olivet prophecy of scripture. There the disciples came and they asked Christ, what will be the signs of your coming and of the end of the age? Christ began to unfold to them specific details about what would be taking place at the end of the age that would herald His appearance, His second coming and this parallels what we read in Revelation chapter 6.\n\nSo again it is fitting that it is the Lamb or Jesus Christ who is the one who is able to unroll the scroll and the seals and reveal what these horsemen all represent. So let\u2019s look at the book of Revelation and what we are told from Christ who is the Revelation and what He says. Let\u2019s look at that 1st seal and that 1st horseman.\n\nIn chapter 6 of Revelation we read this. John writes \u201cNow I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder saying, \u2018Come and see.\u2019 And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to Him, and He went out conquering and to conquer.\u201d So here\u2019s the first rider on a white horse. Now some commentators will look at this and they will think that this is Jesus Christ, a picture of Jesus Christ, but this is not Jesus Christ. In fact Revelation 19 a few chapters further into the story shows the actual appearance of Jesus Christ indeed on a white horse but with a sword, not with a bow. That sword will come out of the mouth of Christ and He will be wielding that and that represents the Word of God a two edged sword.\n\nSome also say that this rider, this first rider, is an angel that appears. It\u2019s not an angel. What is it? It\u2019s a false christ. It is one who does appear like Christ and the very deception we find that people will have regarding this first rider tells us exactly why and how there is this misunderstanding about who Jesus Christ was and is and what his purpose is all about.\n\nIn fact Jesus Christ gave that very warning back in Matthew 24 when He said to His disciples beware. At the first sign of His coming He said many will come in my name saying they are the Christ and will deceive many. And that has happened throughout history beginning almost in the very beginning of the church in message of the gospel that did go to the world there was deception, there was false teaching, there were those who bore the name of Christ who said they represented Him but for a different teaching, a different gospel. In fact they came with a different spirit.\n\nGiven the history of experience from that time until present day of the 21st century tell us exactly what has happened in regards to so many different brands of religion.\n\nSpirituality. Seeking to help people understand who God is and what God\u2019s purpose is but also preaching a false version of the gospel and really in essence a false Christ. This is what is being described here. False religion sets up the scene for the 2nd seal that is unfurled or the 2nd horseman because that 2nd horseman brings something upon the earth that so often we find as we study history comes because of religious strife and religious confusion.\n\nLet\u2019s read what the 2nd seal or the 2nd horseman has to tell us as we look at this in Revelation 6 beginning in verse 3. John records this as he looks and he said \u201cWhen He [meaning the Lamb again] opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, \u2018Come and see.\u2019 another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the One who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.\u201d\n\nThis red horse with this rider brings war. To take peace from the earth means to leave it in a state of conflict. We\u2019ve seen a great deal of that in human experience since Christ uttered these words and since John saw this Revelation. Some will say as they look at this and seek to understand it for modern application, well we\u2019ve always had wars. That\u2019s true. But this is different. This war that is described here again when we go back to Matthew 24 and we look at what Jesus described as a war that would come upon the world at the time of end as one of the signs that would have the ability to take not only take peace from the earth but also all life and a total war we come to a point where we have to understand that in the light of events from 1945 with the explosion of the first atomic bomb and then a few years later with the coming of the hydrogen bomb and the nuclear proliferation that has taken place ever since that has created the potential to kill all life on this planet with nuclear war.\n\nWe have been living under that mushroom cloud of uncertainty ever since 1945 and still do to this day. As I look at this and you consider war and consider the scriptures and what we are actually being told in Matthew\u2019s account and by this rider of war, we have to come to the point where we realize that it is only in today\u2019s setting that we have this ability.\n\nI have lived all my life under the threat of nuclear war. I remember as a young man going into my physical education class in my junior high school and walking by a civil defense sign which was kind of a yellow and black warning sign indicating this was a safe place in the event of a nuclear war for you to gain shelter. It made us feel good at the time but the reality was we probably never would have made it into that shelter should our area have come under such an attack.\n\nWe\u2019ve lived in a very dangerous time all of our lives. For all the treaties, for all the negotiations that have been made in recent decades, well-meaning and well-intended, the world is still very dangerous. Today we see nations like Iran and North Korea developing nuclear weapons with overt threats as to how they would use them upon what nations and still creating a very tense and dangerous situation in the Middle East, in Asia and frankly for all of the world. It hasn\u2019t changed. That ability to bring upon mankind events that these verses describe, a total war, is at the biggest peak that has been at any time in human history.\n\nSo when this horse rides we are seeing a time of not only more war but almost total war. But we have to remember that god controls history god controls these events and in fact it is the Lamb who is even controlling the breaking of these seals.\n\nMatthew 24:22 Christ says that were it not for a group of people called the elect, all human life would be dissolved. But He says I will intervene for that. Understanding that gives us hope and hope is ultimately the message that we take away from the book of Revelation and must always remember.\n\nThis topic that we are going through in a very short time here in this program has a lot more detail to it.

So be sure and get your free copy of that. Call the number that is on your screen and look at that.\n\nNow let\u2019s go back into the book of Revelation. Let\u2019s go back to the 3rd seal. Let\u2019s talk about what we are seeing. We talked about religious strife and we\u2019ve seen war and now let\u2019s look at this 3rd seal beginning in verse 5 of Revelation 6. It says \u201cWhen He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, \u2018Come and see.\u2019 So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, \u2018a quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.\u2019\u201d These are symbols of the basic substance of food to nourish people. Oil and wine and grain and it indicates scarcity. It indicates a famine. What we are seeing with this third horse is that of famine. Now when you trace the progression that happens with religious confusion so often creating conflict historically and even to this day between nations and people the result is war and war always brings with it impoverishment and famine upon people.\n\nAgain, people will say well there\u2019s always been famine. But what is described here is something even bigger and it almost seems like it is a contradiction of terms in our modern setting with so much food and the abundance that we have but if you look back at just even recent history and the 20th century we had famines in multiple part of the world that led to the deaths of upwards of 70 million people history tells us as a result of famine usually caused by politics in the 20th century.\n\nIn the 1930\u2019s in Ukraine during the time of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin the dictator of the Soviet Union at that time engineered a famine among the Ukrainians and upwards of 4 million people died because he wanted to take out that group of people within the Soviet Union.\n\nIn china in 1958 20-55 million people are estimated to have died again by another politically socially engineered famine under Mao Tse Tung.\n\nIn Ethiopia more recently in 1984 100\u2019s of thousands of people died as well because of political strife, war, and the famine that resulted from that. And even as I speak here at this time in Yemen millions of people are at the brink of starvation as well again because of war and political mismanagement. Human cruelty sometimes upon its own people is unimaginable but we look at what is taking place here on a global scale and just multiply it out many many times.\n\nAgain people, the skeptic, will say there is food there is abundance, there is genetic engineering that has modified food created a Green Revolution and all of that is true. Remember again in the 1970\u2019s the book called the Population Bomb that predicted millions of people in the world would die of starvation because there was not enough food to feed them. You know what happened? A man, a scientist, genetically modified the wheat corn grain and he multiplied the harvest and the millions of people in the developing world were saved and live today because of genetically modified food, what is called the Green Revolution. Yet today there is still the potential for even millions of people to die by famine all because of the events that are described here in religious spiritual strife and war, political confusion. It is still with us today almost as a warning for us to look at and realize that these dangers are still out there. For all of our science for all that has been done to seek negotiations of arms to create peace among even various religions there is still conflicts and there is still the resulting fruit from that of war and famine to warn us almost that it can come upon an even bigger scale as told here in the prophecies of Revelation and the book of Matthew in the hands of Jesus Christ who is the Revelator.\n\nWe\u2019ve covered 3 horses. There is one more. A 4th. Let\u2019s read about that in Revelation chapter 6 beginning in verse 7 this time. \u201cWhen He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, \u2018come and see.\u2019 So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was death, and hades followed with him [from death comes the grave] and power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.\u201d\n\nThis 4th horse is a pale horse. It\u2019s green, some translations put it and that is the color of sickness. And what is being described here again is the natural flow from religious strife, war, and famine and that is disease, pestilence. Today we use the term called pandemic meaning a disease that can reach virtually around the globe and affect millions and millions \u2013 hundreds of millions \u2013 of people.\n\nAgain this might seem like something that might not be possible in our world today because we\u2019re living longer. Science has done a great deal to extend life to alleviate pain or other diseases and extend our lives by years and even decades in some cases by comparison with previous generations. We get our flu shots, we take our vitamins, we take our drugs and our medicines and we live in one sense in a very health world and something like this might again seem to be unlikely except when you look at history, even recent history, you look at what is available and possible today we see that there is still something that could be done to bring about what we are reading of here with this ride of the 4th horseman.\n\nLet me take you back to 1918. An event called the Spanish flu took place. 1918 brought the end of what is called World War I and in the last months of that war an epidemic broke out they think it began in Kansas among troops that were being mustered and then sent to Europe in the final months of WWI and people began to die and they began to die very quickly and multiply. What was happening was that a flu virus was beginning to spread among soldiers and then to the general population and in a few months, actually about two years as it ran its course around the world, what is called the Spanish flu killed an estimated 50-100 million people in the world at that time a hundred years ago at the end of WWI.\n\nCould that happen today? Well, you don\u2019t have to google too far to find the answer to that question. Today scientists worry that a flu virus could begin in Asia, mutate very quickly, pass from fowl to the humans, from pigs to humans, and before a vaccine is created people could begin to die in parts of the world and because of the global travel that is available today what begins in Asia or in India or some other remote part of the world can be taken virtually to any part of the world in a matter of hours, a few very short days.\n\nAnd it could happen again today under the best conditions and 200-400 million some experts say could die from even a flu virus that could erupt upon mankind before steps could be taken hopefully to create a vaccine to stem that problem. So it could happen today. Think about the world that is described in these verses that we\u2019ve been reading about. This is a time of total war. This is a time of conflict that is unimaginable and unheard of in human history when these four horsemen begin to ride.\n\nRevelation is describing human civilization that is coming apart. Spiritual deception, war, famine, and plague. That\u2019s what\u2019s being described here. Events that have always been with us and are still with us to this day, we can\u2018t ignore that. It is reality.\n\nBut as it is put within the context of the book of Revelation it is at a time when God\u2019s judgment is coming upon a world that essentially has run out of time. God\u2019s purpose and plan and it is a time of world trial.\n\nNow we want all of us to have a very thorough understanding of what we are talking about in this and I\u2019m only reading today a few verses out of the book of Revelation to describe this. The booklet that we are offering, the study guide, is something that we put together over the years and over a great deal of research that for those of us who are here today and those who are watching this later online or on television will want to go deeper into it. The guide that we have here called \u201cThe Horseman of Revelation\u201d goes into more scriptural detail and more understanding from today\u2019s events and history in the world seen today to describe exactly what is behind the ride of these four horsemen. We want all of us to have that understanding so that it is not lost upon us as to what we have, what is potentially there, but most importantly to have something beyond what is normally there when people talk about the horsemen of Revelation and it\u2019s described in one word, hope. I want you to remember that word. Hope. Because as we\u2019ve been talking about four horsemen, a white horse, a black horse, a red horse, and a pale horse, there is actually in the book of Revelation described a fifth horsemen. That fifth horseman has upon its back the one who is opening the scroll and unleashing the seals. It is Jesus Christ. He appears. Let\u2019s read about that appearance in chapter 19 of the book of Revelation.\n\nIt is one of the great scenes too of the Bible but it is a scene of hope for it says in verse 11. \u201cNow I saw heaven opened [again it\u2019s almost like, you can imagine, a scroll being rolled back, the skies rolling back in that sense like a scroll but here is a different scene], and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. [You can see the similarity here and why people would get that confused with Revelation 6 again on a white horse but there is a difference here.] It says \u201cHe was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called the Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.\u201d So there is a multitude here and what is critical is in verse 15 because \u201cNow out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\u201d\n\nThis is a different horse, this is a different rider. This is the true Christ that appears at a critical moment in human history to stop what is taking place. The God of heaven will intervene to save mankind from killing himself at this particular point. This is what is going to happen. Now it describes in a sense another general time of warfare but I want you to stop and consider this. Sometimes people look at this and they see more carnage and more problems that take place but it\u2019s more than that. This is a time when God intervenes upon the human scene and yes there is a time of intervention to save human life and it is one final war that takes place but in the context of all the other seals of Revelation it is a war that takes place almost like the explosion that takes place when they have to cap a burning oil well that is raging out of control and is an explosion of dynamite that stops the fire. When Christ intervenes it will be like that explosion that stops that fire in an out of control oil well that stops the carnage that stops the problems of human existence and actually spares mankind. That\u2019s what happens when Jesus Christ intervenes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s different. That\u2019s why the rider of the 5th horseman gives us a message of hope that is far different from any other message that we have.\n\nLook, people read the book of Revelation. Sometimes they cannot understand what that book is saying because of the symbols and signs and all the images that are there and that is understandable, again, if you don\u2019t have the proper understanding. But that can be put aside. There is also sometimes a bleak message that people only take away from the book of Revelation but when you go all the way to the message of the fifth horseman and beyond you have a message of hope and that gives us something far more than anything else we have in the world today by any other apocalyptic message that is available from culture, from media, from religion, from any other source that you look at. Look at the post-apocalyptic movies that are made about a world post nuclear war. They\u2019re gray, they\u2019re dark, they\u2019re bleak, they\u2019re hopeless. The book of Revelation gives us hope. It gives us something that no other human writer, no other human source no other media, no other part of culture can give us. It is the hope of god\u2019s intervention upon the world and that\u2019s unique. That\u2019s why the book of Revelation is important and that\u2019s why a proper understanding of where these four horsemen fit in human experience help us to that point along with what is there with the fifth horse.\n\nSo we want you to be sure to get that booklet that is available, a study guide that will go into more detail and show exactly what is here and what is behind that hope that we all have.\n\nThe four horsemen of Revelation, they\u2019re going to ride in the last days. But it\u2019s the ride of the fifth horseman Jesus Christ that will end spiritual deception, war and suffering. When Christ rides to end human history then \u201cthe kingdoms of this world will become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ and He shall reign for and ever.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s all pray for the coming of God\u2019s Kingdom to this earth.\n\n[Narrator] Please call for the free literature on today\u2019s program \u201cThe Horsemen of Revelation.\u201d When you do we\u2019ll also send you a free one year subscription to our Beyond Today magazine.

Cookies are the lion\u2019s share ubiquitous methodology for monitoring purchaser conduct also gathering knowledge, also they\u2019re utilized by almost all adtech also martech platforms. Good cookie-blocking expertise direct by Apple\u2019s Clever Monitoring Prevention (ITP) also Firefox\u2019s Enhanced Monitoring Safety (ETP) now block third-party cookies by default, also even Google\u2019s Chrome will quickly succeed to controls that permit customers block cookies. Browser-level blocking, third-party ad-blocking apps, also new rules like GDPR also the California Shopper Privateness Act (CCPA) are shortly relegating the outdated cookie directed toward the web dustbin.\n\nAdweek has known as this a \u201cbasic change\u201d in internet advertising. What does the loss of life of the cookie imply directed toward entrepreneurs also advertisers such as you? On this two-part collection, we\u2019ll take a look at what cookies are also why they died, also in half two, wherewith entrepreneurs will adapt with out monitoring cookies. Seize a glass of milk also let\u2019s dip in!\n\nWhat Are Monitoring Cookies?\n\nAlso referred to as \u201cbrowser cookies\u201d or simply \u201ccookies\u201d, they\u2019re knowledge that\u2019s set by an internet site or third social gathering that\u2019s saved within the type of a textual content file in internet browsers. Utilizing the person\u2019s IP handle as a novel ID, cookies comprise info like searching historical past, person ID, huddle ID, also in addition. Cookies are created as soon as any web site is accessed that makes use of cookies. When returning directed toward the equivalent web site, the browser sends the cookie file directed toward the server also in flip, customers succeed to a personalised searching expertise.\n\nThe Distinction Between First-Celebration Cookies also Third-Celebration Cookies\n\nFirst-party cookies are set by the web site a person is searching also are used directed toward hold monitor of exercise as they transfer from web page directed toward web page. They permit important web site performance like authentication, sustaining procuring carts, web site preferences, also login info. With out first-party cookies, customers would pick up directed toward log in on each web page also wouldn\u2019t, for instance, give you the chance directed toward fasten an merchandise within the cart also hold procuring, also no info (like delivery also billing addresses) could be saved, since perfect few web sites retailer this knowledge on their very own servers. In brief, with out first-party cookies, the web site expertise could be terrible directed toward not possible. Since they solely monitor exercise on the location which somebody is deliberately visiting, they don\u2019t seem to be usually topic directed toward the ire (also blocking) that third-party cookies obtain.\n\nCookie-blocking expertise also authorities rules are centered totally on third-party cookies as a result of they\u2019re those that monitor person exercise throughout the net. They\u2019re positioned within the browser through monitoring pixels or Javascript code. What riles on-line privateness advocates is that third-party cookies operate not originate from an internet site {that a} person has proactively interacted with. Promoting networks like Google Adsense, Propeller, also others are normally the supply of third-party cookies, that are used directed toward monitor customers throughout a number of web sites also use that info directed toward in addition exactly goal them with advertisements. Accounted for is not any implicit or specific permission directed toward operate this, so it will possibly simply be seen as an invasion of privateness.\n\nFirefox also Safari Burn Third-Celebration Cookies\n\nSimilar to Apple shortly scuttled Adobe Flash from the digital panorama (which, actually, no one however Homestar Runner misses) it additionally fasten the primary knife within the cookie. Whereas each Mozilla also Apple pick up had third-party cookie blocking on by default for some time, advert networks shortly discovered loopholes in these protections.\n\nWith slight monetary curiosity in digital promoting also its fundamental Google differentiator now being privateness safety, Apple made the transfer directed toward Clever Monitoring Prevention 2.2 (ITP) directed toward seal up the digital loopholes also a lot in addition successfully block third-party cookies. Mozilla\u2019s privacy-focused Firefox browser will supplant go well with with analogous enhancements directed toward its Enhanced Monitoring Safety (ETP).\n\nEach ITP also ETP are in a position directed toward block third-party cookies by stopping them from being saved within the browser, also directed toward shut the loophole exploited by advertisers, they\u2019ll additionally stop third-party cookies from being recorded as first-party cookies. Apple\u2019s ITP 2.2 in Safari takes it a step additional by reducing the first-party cookie lifespan from seven days directed toward in the future. They blockers are energetic by default in each Safari also Firefox.\n\nWhy Chrome\u2019s Cookie Blocking May Carry a Larger Impression\n\nGoogle\u2019s enterprise mannequin depends on amassing knowledge about customers\u2014what they\u2019re looking for, what movies they watch, also what they learn, also surf for on the web. Given the search big\u2019s dominance in promoting also that Chrome browser accounts for over 60% of the browser market share, Google\u2019s opt-in model of ITP would be the final swan tune for cookies\u2014also why the corporate could run afoul of antitrust legislation.\n\nSince cookies aren\u2019t suitable with cellular apps, options like Promoting IDs also location knowledge are already getting used as a \u201creal-world conduct\u201d cookie different. The place Google may run toward bother is when also if it additional develops its personal browser ID-based cookie different. Since Google controls a majority of the browser market, 30% of the e-mail consumer market, also over 40% of the show promoting market, it\u2019s ripe for monopolizing the digital promoting also knowledge markets. Once you couple the info that solely Google can monetize from Google logins with a doubtlessly custody browser ID system, the domination seems to be even in addition full.\n\nGoogle, after all, is keenly on to of the implications, which is why it\u2019s fastidiously buying all of its new privateness controls as a profit directed toward customers. \u201cOur expertise exhibits that individuals desire advertisements which might be personalised directed toward their wants also pursuits,\u201d Google engineering VP Prabhakar Raghavan stated in a weblog put up explaining the shift, \u201chowever provided that these advertisements supply transparency, alternative, also management.\u201d\n\nIt has additionally saved pretty mum on what it is going to operate within the absence of third-party cookies. The massive query is whether or not or not Google will make a market-dominating transfer with a alternative. That is potential below a business-friendly (although solely unpredictable) administration within the U.S., although unlikely when you think about the GDPR-governed implications within the E.U. also potential future motion below a home administration that\u2019s much less eager directed toward digital monopolies. Google lion\u2019s share actually has a plan, however all we pick up for now could be hypothesis. It doesn\u2019t matter what Google does, its digital dominance assures that it\u2019ll information the way forward for all the adtech market.\n\nDoes the California Shopper Privateness Act (CCPA) Regulate Cookies?\n\nCalifornia\u2019s upcoming CCPA enforcement in 2020 doesn\u2019t straight regulate using monitoring cookies. Nevertheless, CCPA defines the phrase \u201cprivate info\u201d directed toward embody any info that \u201cidentifies, relates directed toward, describes, is able to being related to, or may fairly be linked, straight or not directly, with a specific purchaser or family.\u201d It particularly identifies cookies as a kind of knowledge that qualifies as containing or being \u201cprivate info.\u201d Since CCPA seems directed toward deal with persistent monitoring cookies\u2014equivalent to these utilized by behavioral promoting networks\u2014as private info, it might trigger corporations that use them directed toward fall below the purview of CCPA also require web sites that use them directed toward show an EU-style \u201cwe use cookies\u201d banner also opt-in CTA. Past the disclosure necessities, it doesn\u2019t seem that CCPA regulates or bans using cookies per se.\n\nThe Penalties of Cookie Blocking\n\nWhereas the loss of life of cookies will pick up far-reaching penalties throughout the buying also promoting panorama, you don\u2019t pick up directed toward utterly freak out but, as a result of at the least we\u2019re all within the equivalent boat.\n\nThe most important impression will seemingly be clasp in programmatic promoting as a result of programmatic depends nearly solely on third-party cookies as the inspiration for user-level focusing on also measurement. With out cookies, entrepreneurs can\u2019t goal customers with extremely related advertisements or decide whether or not these advertisements lead directed toward gross sales. As a consequence provided that digital advert spending within the U.S. alone is predicted directed toward exceed $129.34 billion this 12 months also that programmatic promoting is basically seen because the monetary basis of the web, it is a actually huge deal. In fact, the subsequent technology of advert focusing on is already within the works thanks directed toward contextual focusing on that was as soon as the area of cellular, so I might not count on this directed toward trigger the advert world directed toward crumble. Nevertheless, it might be an enormous shock directed toward an already struggling media trade if their fundamental supply of earnings (digital advertisements) is in any means disturbed, which here\u2019s a distinct risk.\n\nOne unintended consequence of shortening the lifespan of first-party cookies may impression wherewith entrepreneurs monitor web site guests. Beforehand, an undeleted Google Analytics cookie may stay on a browser for 2 years. With that lifespan shortened directed toward as slight as in the future in Safari, it is going to trigger a duplication of distinctive customers also huge inflation of their numbers in GA.\n\nWhereas which may make you look good for a second, what it\u2019s actually carrying out is blowing up years of benchmarking person counts. Whether or not you\u2019re a writer taking a look at distinctive pageviews or an e-comm marketer taking a look at web site visits, this may find yourself making a multitude of your historic knowledge. \u201cThe elemental problem going through entrepreneurs with this last launch is visibility toward wherewith their digital buying is performing,\u201d stated Ryan Storrar, SVP also head of media activation for Europe, Center East also Africa at Essence in an oral with Digiday. \u201cITP 2.1 is the last chapter on this story. Accounted for are steps that may be taken directed toward restrict the impression within the short-term, however, in addition broadly, a post-cookie world is clearly on the horizon also entrepreneurs want directed toward succeed to prepared.\u201d\n\nSubsequent Week: What Will the Put up-Cookies World Look Like for Entrepreneurs?\n\nTalking of preparing, in half two coming subsequent week, we\u2019ll take a look at what is going to substitute cookies, wherewith entrepreneurs are adapting, also if cookies will pick up an impression on name monitoring platforms like Invoca.

We causally estimate the effect of Salah joining Liverpool F.C. on Islamophobic attitudes and behaviors using 936 county-month hate crime observations, 15 million tweets from U.K. soccer fans, and an original survey experiment of 8,060 Liverpool F.C. fans. We find that Merseyside county (home to Liverpool F.C.) experienced a 18.9% drop in hate crimes relative to a synthetic control, while no similar effect was found for other types of crime. We also find that Liverpool F.C. fans halved their rates of posting anti-Muslim tweets (a drop from 7.3% to 3.8% of tweets about Muslims) relative to fans of other top-flight English soccer clubs.

Wearing an open-collar white dress shirt and dark grey suit, Obama sat answering questions for about an hour from Tobias Lutke, the founder and CEO of the Ottawa-based commerce company Shopify.\n\nIt wasn't a real journalistic interview, but when asked how optimistic he felt as he left the presidency, Obama answered like he often did in that setting: with a long, grim essayistic sweep punctuated with hope.\n\n\"I believe the long-term trajectory of humanity is in a positive direction,\" he said. \"But you get dark ages before the Renaissance.\"\n\n\"You get World War Two and 60 million dead before there's a post-World War Two order that stabilizes societies.\"\n\nThe world, he argued, has never been healthier, wealthier, better educated, more tolerant and less violent than right now.\n\nBut it's an age of political and social disruption where technology is gorging us with information and no one can agree on what constitutes the truth so a coherent debate can ensue, he said.\n\n\"It's indisputable that things have gotten better. But in that march of progress we had the Holocaust, and we had Jim Crow and we had the Killing Fields. So we cannot be complacent.\"\n\nHe said an \"ancient story\" that has appeared time and again throughout history is back and it is very \"primal.\"\n\n\"It focuses on us and not us \u2014 it's tribal. It's a zero-sum contest between people. And a strong man appears who is going to protect all of us from them,\" Obama said.\n\n\"That kind of politics has gotten traction, that story has gotten a lot of traction around the world . . . it's not unique to any particular country.\"\n\nThen came his prescription: \"That, I think, has to be combated with better stories because I think there's a better story to be told about human progress \u2014 it's inclusive and it's hopeful and it is generous and it is kind and is based on science and facts and not fear.\n\n\"We have that in our capacity, but I think we get complacent.\"\n\nObama spoke to Parliament during his last official visit in 2016. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press)\n\n'Love affair with Canada'\n\nWith that, Obama capped an hour in front of an audience that welcomed him like a rock-star with a standing ovation.\n\n\"I do have a little bit of a love affair with Canada,\" he said as he took the stage at an event where tickets cost from $75 to well into the hundreds of dollars.\n\nSince Obama's presidency ended in January 2017, he's become a big name on the paid speaking circuit, and appeared at a similar event in Calgary in March.\n\nObama offered a rambling and reflective view of the world since leaving the presidency, and high praise of the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drives economies.\n\nHe fondly recalled his first trip to Canada in 2009 and his initial discussions with then Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper to combat the Great Recession. Obama called it a \"a fairly intense conversation about how we were going to avoid Armageddon.\"\n\nThere were fond reflections of raising his two daughters, Malia and Sasha, and unabashed praise for his wife, Michelle.\n\nAs social media and the technology behind it evolves and becomes more powerful, society needs to have an important conversation about what constitutes \"baseline truth,\" he said.\n\n\"The Fox News viewer has a completely different reality than the New York Times reader,\" he said.\n\nFollowing Pence\n\nObama garnered applause when he called for a re-think in how young people are educated, to teach them critical thinking, and \"experiential learning.\" An education system with a blackboard and boring teacher may have been good to teach kids to work in a factory or an office in the past but that is no longer adequate.\n\nThe visit came one day after U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence was in town on behalf of Trump, who is decidedly less popular in Canada than the 44th occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nTrump has yet to pay a solo visit to Ottawa but his appearance as part of the larger G7 leaders' summit in Quebec last year plunged Canada-U.S. relations to a new low. Tweeting from Air Force One after departing Canada last year, Trump called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \"very dishonest and weak.\"\n\nFormer Newfoundland premier Brian Tobin, who was also a federal Liberal cabinet minister, said Friday's talk contained a warning not to take for granted \"all of the privileges we enjoy as citizens in this global community.\"\n\n\"It's a wake-up call from Obama,\" Tobin said, \"done gently, but done very effectively.\"", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "All Coastal Antarctic Stations Show Zero Warming Over Past Decades.", "score": 0, "url": "https://notrickszone.com/2019/05/31/10-of-10-coastal-antarctic-stations-show-no-warming-over-past-decades-failed-scientists-need-to-resign/", "comments": 4, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "Share this...\n\n\n\nBy Kirye\n\nand Pierre Gosselin\n\nUpdate: Another coastal station has been added: Novolazarevsk, so it\u2019s 11 stations.\n\n==============================================\n\nOver the past few years, climate alarmists have increasingly been resorting to weather-ambulance chasing, which has necessitated the trotting of the globe in the search of weather anomalies to behold as proof of man-made climate change.\n\nBut one place they have been avoiding like the plague is Antarctica as a number of studies have been showing the opposite of what what predicted earlier has been happening down at the South Pole, except for volcanic activity beneath parts of the Antarctic ice shelf.\n\nAnalysis of Antarctic stations show cooling\n\nToday we look at 10 Antarctic station under operation in Antarctica, scattered along the Antarctic coastline and operated by various countries. These are not impacted by volcanic activity: With the 2018 data in, now is a good time to look at the long-term temperature trends of these stations. We do know that Antarctic sea ice extent has seen an impressive upward trend over the past 40 years, and so tells us cooling may be at play:\n\nAntarctic sea ice has gained steadily over the past 40 years. Chart: Comiso et al, 2017\n\nWhat follows are annual mean temperature charts of each of the 10 Antarctic stations unimpacted by volcanic activity.\n\nButler Island and Neumayer\n\nBoth show a clear downward trend:\n\nHalley\n\nHalley as well shows a downward station since 1956:\n\nSyowa and Casey\n\nData from the Japan operated Syowa station and the Australia Casey stations both show no trend since 1961. Here we see no signs of any warming:\n\nSo far not a single station remote of volcanic activity has shown any warming.\n\nDavis\n\nThe Davis station data go back 35 years and show a flat trend (very slight cooling in fact). No warming has been detected there since the great global warming scare began in the 1980s. So far 6 of the 6 stations plotted show no warming over the last several decades.\n\nZhongshan\n\nThis Antarctic station shows a definite cooling trend over the past 30 years:\n\nMirnyl\n\nThe Mirnyl station has been recording temperature data since 1967, i.e. more than half a century. It too is statistically flat, even showing a very slight cooling trend:\n\nDumont D\u2019Urvi and Mawson\n\nBoth D\u2019Urvi and Mawson Antarctic stations have recorded data going back to the 1950s. As the following chart tells us, there\u2019s been no warming at these two long term stations as well.\n\nNovolazarevsk\n\nThis station has not seen any warming in 40 years. Instead the trend has been cooling.\n\nNone show warming\n\nIn summary, not single Antarctic coastal station shows warming, with most showing cooling. Now you know why the climate change ambulance chasers have been silent about this remote, vastly undisturbed continent.\n\nSouth Shetland Islands\n\nNext we look at the annual temperatures of the 5 stations of the South Shetland Islands (located in the Antarctic Ocean).\n\nThey too show no warming since 1993. Centro http://Met.An , Marsh has had no warming trend since 1977. Where\u2019s the warming?

Just when they predicted the South Pole would warm and start a dramatic melting, the opposite has in fact happened.\n\nGrand failure as grounds for dismissal\n\nIt\u2019s time to dismiss these alarmists as complete failures.

I shared with this first class that as our trailblazers they would experience moments of great joy, as well as seemingly insurmountable challenges in high school. ...Class of 2019, I'm so proud to see you in your caps and gowns today.\"\n\nAfter receiving their diplomas, Cristo Rey Jesuit High School\u2019s first graduates turn around to the audience and are instructed to move their tassels to the other side of their cap, marking their official status as graduates. (Photo: Hannah Schroeder / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nEstablished in 2015, the school is part of a nationwide network of 35 Cristo Rey Jesuit schools that predominantly reach students from low-income families. Students spend four days a week at the school, then one day a week at businesses across greater Milwaukee as part of the work-study program. The students are not paid; instead, their \"pay\" goes to the school to pay down the cost of tuition.\n\nAlmost all the students are Hispanic, and almost all attend the school on taxpayer-funded vouchers through the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The school continues to grow. Now at 1215 S. 45th St., it soon will double its space as it moves into a vacated Pick 'n Save store at 1818 W. National Ave.\n\nA few hundred parents, family members and friends gathered in Marquette University's Church of the Gesu for Friday's ceremony.\n\nSalutatorian Wendy Gutierrez-Perez waits in the foyer of the Church of the Gesu at Marquette University with the 84 other members of Cristo Rey Jesuit High School\u2019s first graduating class in Milwaukee on Friday.

John P. Foley, chairman emeritus of Cristo Rey's board, Vera took to the podium to give her valedictorian address.\n\n\"We are not meant to be hidden,\" Vera said in her address. \" We are meant to be in the heart of this country, and our stories are meant to be told.\"\n\nIn the fall, the two-time student council president will continue her education at Marquette University. The school selected Vera as a four-year, full-tuition Burke Scholar for demonstrating a commitment to social justice. It also named her a Les Aspin Scholar, with a semester-long internship in Washington, D.C., her junior year.\n\nShe also received full-ride offers from Georgetown University and College of the Holy Cross.\n\nMaria Torres, 17, embraces her younger sister Brianna Torres, 11, telling her not to cry just after graduating from Cristo Rey Jesuit High School at the Church of the Gesu at Marquette University on Friday.

(Photo: Hannah Schroeder / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nVera came to the United States from Mexico in eighth grade. She left behind her parents and grandparents, living with an aunt and aunt's daughter in Milwaukee. She could neither read nor write English and remembers enduring that first academic year at Prince of Peace School in \"survival mode\" as she adjusted to a new country.\n\n\"I wanted to do more than just become a housewife and marry a fisherman,\" she said in an interview. \"I felt like there were so many things that I still didn't know about the world and so many things that I wanted to do.\" She knew that \"if I stayed there in that environment,\" her dreams would remain just that.\n\nShe enrolled at Cristo Rey in 2015, a time when, Vera remembers, she was shy and reluctant to step outside her comfort zone. Cristo Rey offered her transformative experiences.\n\nThrough the work-study program, Vera spent her junior and senior years working with the law firm Godfrey & Kahn. Attorneys at the firm, she said, boosted her self-confidence as she began to navigate a corporate environment.\n\n\"They wanted me to be there, and they wanted me to continue to build up and one day become an attorney and accomplish the most I could,\" Vera said. \"I'm very thankful to them for my time there and everything they taught me.\"\n\nShe combined that with more than 200 hours of service with immigrant rights organization Voces de la Frontera, which helps with legal services, among other things.\n\nVera plans to pursue law and business after college.\n\n\"When I would go down to Voces and sit down with people,\" she said, \"through my minimal grasp of immigration and immigration policy, I could explain something to them or help them find some type of legal pathway for whatever problem they were having. It would be like this is why I wanted to do law.\"\n\nThe aunt who took Vera in joined her at Friday's ceremony. Also in attendance were Vera's grandparents and 13-year-old sister Yartiza. The trio traveled from Mexico to attend.\n\nTo other Cristo Rey students, graduation felt surreal.\n\nFor one of those students, Rocky Lopez, who will attend Cardinal Stritch University, seeing his peers in their caps and gowns brought feelings of excitement and disbelief.\n\nHe called his time at Cristo Rey \"amazing\" and said the school helped him put his dreams in action.\n\n\"I don't feel like this is actually happening,\" Lopez said as the class gathered before the ceremony began. \"I feel like I'm going to wake up from a dream.\"\n\nOur subscribers make this reporting possible.

The once formerly-homeless man now owns a Louisiana-based company that builds beaches in people\u2019s backyards, and he\u2019s making millions doing it.\n\nWhen White was 15-years-old, he was homeless for about eight months. \u201cGrowing up, things weren\u2019t easy for me,\u201d he told USA Today. White dropped out of school in the ninth grade and only had a second-grade reading skill. \u201cI could hardly even spell my name,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite his lacking education, he always felt as if he understood construction. \u201cI knew if I worked at it,\u201d said White, \u201cI could really do something with it.\u201d He got his start working for a local construction company just to pay the bills. But later, he learned of a job opening with a Baton Rouge-based company that paid $12 hour. \u201cThe guy that I worked for there took me under his wing and taught me about the company. Within the first six months, I was managing the team,\u201d said White.\n\nThe ambitious individual continued to work his way up with various construction companies. Eventually, he started his own company, a pool business called Cool Pools. \u201cThat business did very well, and last year, I sold it for over a million (dollars),\u201d he said.\n\nZydeco Construction was the next venture. The company builds beach-like \u201cswimming ponds\u201d that are crystal blue and have 360 degrees of sand surrounding them. Each pond is completely customizable and is outfitted with accessories, including outdoor kitchens, gazebos, umbrellas, and volleyball nets.\n\nThe 33-year-old says the sky is the limit when it comes to creating your \u201cdream beach.\u201d\n\nWhite has tackled his vision from every angle. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s something that for years I would think to myself, \u2018What if someone could figure out a way to turn a pond into a paradise?\u2019 I did as much research as I could and applied it to building these ponds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has always been a dream of mine to do these different things,\u201d White said. \u201cI am all about figuring out a way to make things happen. I can look at any situation and come up with a way to fix it. I like to stay in the market for things that most companies don\u2019t offer, especially custom requests,\u201d White added.\n\nWithout a doubt, the ponds are dazzling. But, how much does one cost to construct? The average costs around $20,000. \u201cEach pond that we do is customized for that area and for the customer. It isn\u2019t something that can be done in a day. They are a true labor of love,\u201d said White.\u201cWe will do something different on every pond we create.\u201d\n\nWhite\u2019s company also offers in-ground trampolines and outdoor kitchens. He also is in the business of drainage solutions and can build levees for homes that experience flooded backyards.\n\nAmanda Froelich/Truth Theory/Creative Commons\n\nImage Credit: Zydeco Construction", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Supplying the Hebron Charitable Clinic with Medicine", "score": 5, "url": "https://www.directrelief.org/2019/03/supplying-the-hebron-charitable-clinic-with-medicine/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "Editor\u2019s note: The post below was originally published by American Near East Refugee Aid.

She needs to control her daily sugar intake and get regular exercise in addition to the medicine,\u201d El-Rajabi explains.

Qafisheh removes the problem tooth and prescribes an antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, after surgery, to reduce the risk of infection and pain following the procedure.\n\nNearly half of the Palestinian population has no access to health insurance, so medicines that are available free-of-charge with a prescription are always in high demand. \u201cWhen medication is available to patients for free,\u201d Qafisheh says, \u201cit\u2019s a big help for families struggling with health issues.

US was not totally new\u2014youth in Uganda and the Netherlands had filed somewhat similar environmental suits\u2014but it seemed a little strange. Shouldn\u2019t these kids be playing video games or something, doing pretty much anything but litigating to save the planet?\n\nNow, the plaintiffs in Juliana v. US are part of an increasingly vocal global movement of young environmental activists leading the fight against climate catastrophe, most visible among them Swedish teen Greta Thunberg, who has chided world leaders for failing to take action. And they are banding together. In March, Thunberg inspired a worldwide protest, with kids skipping school to make the point that their future is on the line because of climate change. On June 1, youth activists will host nearly 100 coordinated press conferences across the US and worldwide announcing new local actions to fight the climate crisis in a show of solidarity with the American plaintiffs who have a hearing before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on June 4.\n\nThe young Americans, some of whom are now adults, argue that they have a constitutional right to a stable climate that sustains life on Earth. While this right is obviously not enumerated in the US Constitution, they say that it is implied by the document. By adopting policies that promote fossil fuel use, leading to the emission of carbon dioxide at rates that change the climate, despite knowing these energy sources are warming the planet, the federal government violates \u201cthe youngest generation\u2019s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property,\u201d they wrote in their 2015 complaint (pdf). The plaintiffs also contend that the government is failing to protect essential resources held in trust for the public.\n\nTheir case\u2014which originated in Oregon district court\u2014has been surprisingly successful so far, though the government has fought the kids hard. The matter has survived efforts to dismiss it by two presidential administrations, that of Barack Obama and now of Donald Trump. The fossil fuel industry briefly intervened in the case, joining the government as defendants before asking the courts to release them from the matter, a motion which was granted in 2017. The case was set for trial twice in 2018, but the Trump administration repeatedly moved for delay and dismissal.\n\nThe kids have used social media to get out their message, naturally. When their trial was delayed in February 2017, for example, they posted using the hashtag #RatherBeInCourt.\n\nLast July, the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, denying the administration\u2019s application for a stay and calling a request to review the case before the district court hears all of the facts at trial \u201cpremature.\u201d The high court again denied a Trump administration request for a stay in November. But the feds fought on and the Department of Justice immediately filed more motions to quash the case at the district and circuit court level. The government has gone to great lengths to avoid a trial that will no doubt highlight the science behind climate change and reveal the extent to which representatives failed to act on information about environmental dangers.\n\nThe hearing next week before the appeals court will determine whether the plaintiffs can finally take the case to trial and, if so, whether various federal agencies will be subject to an injunction while the trial takes place, halting the production of new fossil fuel extractions while the matter is heard. If they succeed, these young plaintiffs will be setting a dramatic precedent in the US. As they say on their website, \u201dLike Brown v. Board of Education did for civil rights, Juliana v. United States has the potential to become the landmark climate change case of our country\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThis bold claim has merit. If the kids succeed in the US, they create a basis for other cases like theirs in municipalities and states across the nation. Though the litigation is complicated, Juliana v. US has already gone much further than the US government would have liked. A win would mean that American states and municipalities would have to rethink their obligations as trustees of public resources or risk facing similarly complex litigation, and it could change the way business is done.\n\nCertainly, the plaintiffs have convinced many that their case matters. Ahead of the June 4 hearing, environmental groups, businesses, members of Congress, the League of Women Voters, public health experts, history professors, and of course lawyers all argued the validity of their claims in amicus briefs (32,340 young people (pdf) were also represented in such a brief). A filing on behalf of law professors (pdf) supporting the plaintiffs argues that the constitutional claim in the case is indeed valid. They write, \u201cThe District Court was correct to find that a stable climate is essential to ordered liberty\u2026Indeed, as the District Court found, a stable climate system is quite literally the foundation of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zYl3q-qO-pb6_jGjaftgRvRelmOY0Hsrg5e8O_XOA6g.jpg"}, {"title": "Please help this dude", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/bvq8kt/we_must/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "Memes!

Between 2002 and 2004, the non-native rats were eradicated \u2013 a project opposed by some animal rights groups, who argued that conservationists were favouring tourist-friendly birds over the rats.\n\nSince Lundy was declared rat-free in 2006, its seabird populations have bounced back, as they have on other small islands when invasive predators introduced by humans have been removed.\n\nThere were more than 3,500 pairs of puffins in 1939 but fewer than 10 pairs in 2000, with fewer sand eels in the surrounding seas as well as the rats contributing to their decline. While 75% of the global population of Manx shearwaters breed on British islands, Lundy\u2019s population by the turn of the century was far lower than its potential, and much less than on nearby islands such as Skokholm, where 350,000 pairs nest.\n\nDean Jones, the warden on Lundy, which is managed by the Landmark Trust, said: \u201cIt is exciting to see this level of recovery in Manx shearwaters, one of our most important seabirds. In spring the island comes alive at night with the sound of these amazing birds. The increases in puffins, guillemots and razorbills is also very encouraging for the future of seabirds on Lundy and we are maintaining our vigilance to ensure rats cannot return to the island.\u201d\n\nHelen Booker, senior conservation officer for RSPB in south-west England said: \u201cThis study clearly shows how quickly and positively seabirds respond to the removal of non-native predators. Of course, we had anticipated major population increases when the project was launched, but the scale of this recovery has far exceeded our expectations.\u201d\n\nA recent study found that nearly 10% of the world\u2019s bird, mammal, amphibian and reptile species currently on the brink of extinction could be saved by culling invasive mammals such as cats and rats on 169 islands.\n\nOn British islands, rat eradication programmes have been successfully completed on the Shiants in the Hebrides and on St Agnes and Gugh in the Isles of Scilly, with seabird populations subsequently bouncing back.\n\nBut rat eradication programmes have been controversial with some animal rights activists, who have argued that the black rat, although not native to Britain, is one of the country\u2019s most endangered mammals.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Happy pride month!

Early in life, Damien was diagnosed with kidney disease. He has been on daily dialysis for many years, awaiting a transplant. Due to his additional medical needs, finding a lasting home for Damien has been a significant challenge. He has spent much of his life living alone in the hospital for many months at a time (during these times, he is unable to leave the hospital to attend school due to hospital liability issues). If he had a consistent home during his life, he almost certainly would have received a transplant long ago. Unfortunately, lack of stable housing has kept him from being eligible when matching kidneys became available. This past summer, Damien was able to move in with a relative and began attending the school where I teach. Although he has significant health challenges, he is an excellent student and a kind, generous, and motivated human being. He excelled at school, and his mental and physical health improved. These improvements allowed him to be approved by his medical team to be placed back on the transplant list - a move that meant he was likely only a few weeks or months from receiving a kidney that would make so much more possible for his life. A few weeks before the winter holiday, the relative he was staying with had to make the difficult decision to return him to county custody. Having a typical 13 year old in your home can be a significant challenge for anyone, and Damien's additional needs proved too much for his caregiver. He spent the next several months, including the winter holidays, living in the hospital. Once again, he was removed from the transplant list due to lack of stable housing. Damien has learned to be very independent and tends to keep his difficulties to himself, but he told me about his circumstances a few days before returning to the hospital. Unable to keep his challenges off my heart and mind, I began the personal journey of considering taking on his care.A couple months later, Damien is now living with me, going back to school, and was just recently relisted on the kidney transplant list. Over the last several months, I have taken much time off of work to be trained to care for his special medical and dietary needs, as much of this care occurs in the home. Until I am able to complete foster care certification (a 6 to 8 month process), his placement has been without financial support. The initial expense of creating space for a special needs child in my home has been considerable. I am anticipating additional expenses (clothing, special dietary needs, increase in transportation costs for appointments, increased time off work, etc.) over the next several months until I am able to begin receiving financial assistance for his care. I am committed to not being another adult that lets Damien down in his life. Although I have no doubt this will be very challenging, my experience working with this age group makes me uniquely equipped to deal with some of the typical challenges of caring for a pre-teen. I am asking for support to help alleviate the financial stress that will be a part of this transition over the next several months to make sure I am able to provide Damien with a home that will allow him to get healthy and become the incredible world-changing individual he has the potential to be. Damien and I thank you for your support!Hear more about Damien's story here and here and here Funds raised beyond providing for Damien's immediate needs will be established in a trust to help secure Damien's education and any future medical expenses.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sSaL_Ypj46ExHFmi3t8FOfgJYa-I86xl9w7dvRCeeaY.jpg"}, {"title": "Heavy metal surprise: Young Iron Maiden fan gets tickets for birthday (9yo)", "score": 24, "url": "https://www.today.com/video/heavy-metal-surprise-young-iron-maiden-fan-gets-tickets-for-birthday-60630085635", "comments": 2, "date": "2019-6-1", "transcript": "A 9-year-old in Oregon received the birthday present he\u2019ll never forget: Iron Maiden tickets!

But it is now one of the major drivers behind the transition to greener, more sustainable energy.\n\nAround the globe, prices are falling and India is now producing the world\u2019s cheapest solar power, according to an International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) survey.\n\nThe costs of building large-scale solar installations in India fell by 27% in 2018, year-on-year, thanks to a combination of low-priced panel imports from China, abundant land and cheap labour.\n\nAverage solar prices from large-scale installations in India were less than a third of Canada\u2019s, where costs were highest of the countries surveyed.\n\nMore than half of the total costs of building a solar installation in India relate to hardware, like racking and mounting, while the remainder involves soft costs such as system design and financing.\n\nAlso read: India issues new tender for 2GW solar power equipment factories after two failed efforts\n\nLower service and labour outlay have contributed to a dramatic fall in the investment needed to set up large-scale solar power-generating projects.

The expanding global solar sector now accounts for 55% of all new renewable power-generating capacity. Last year, 94 gigawatts of new capacity came online, largely added by Asian countries.\n\nChina was responsible for 44 gigawatts of all new solar capacity, almost five-times more than India, which followed directly behind.

President Joko Widodo of Indonesia -- the only Southeast Asian G-20 member -- had said he wanted to bring up the mounting plastic problem at the meet.\n\nPlastic pollution, especially the marine variety, has become a serious issue in the region, crippling fisheries, tourism and other sectors.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region accounts for 60% of improperly disposed of plastic waste, or mismanaged waste, according to data from nonprofit research organization Our World in Data. This type of waste has a high possibility of entering the ocean through rivers or other waterways.\n\nTo tackle plastic pollution, Thailand approved a road map in April for reducing scrap plastic that runs through 2030. As part of the initiative, the government wants to ban by 2020 plastic straws and cups as well as plastic shopping bags thinner than 35 microns, which includes most bags used by supermarkets, vendors and other retailers.\n\nThe bans will be introduced in stages, with the country aiming for complete plastic recycling by 2027. A government spokesperson said the measures will help reduce the 780,000 tons of scrap plastic it produces annually and also decrease money spent on waste disposal.\n\nIndonesia will implement a trial ban on plastic bags in Bali from July prior to full-scale implementation in other parts of the country later this year. In Vietnam, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has requested businesses to reduce plastic waste, while the Philippine Congress has started discussing bills to ban plastic straws and shopping bags.\n\nThe region's private sector is also gradually joining the global drive toward stronger environmental protections, including recognition of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nIndonesia's Asia Pulp and Paper has developed paper for use in making specially coated biodegradable containers such as cups. The company plans to make the material commercially available in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia's Top Glove, the world's largest glove maker, plans to release another type of biodegradable rubber gloves later this year. Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said the company wants to include a biodegradable variant for its existing synthetic nitrile exam gloves over the next 10 years.\n\nPlastic is widely used for making food containers because it is easy to process and hygienic. Since 1950, 8.3 billion tons of these containers have been produced, 60% of which has ended up in landfills or the sea, according to data from the United Nations.\n\nChina, a major emitter of plastic waste, is asking industries to come up with solutions. The government banned the practice of giving customers plastic shopping bags for free in 2008,but use of plastic has been growing in recent years due to the expansion of online shopping.\n\nThe problem of scrap plastic is growing more acute in the region after China banned its import in 2017 as the country grapples with its own mountains of garbage.\n\nAsia's emerging economies have prioritized economic growth ahead of sound environmental policy. But they are beginning to reverse course as they realize the negative impact this direction has on people and the economy.\n\nThere is also concern that failure to address pollution -- plastic or otherwise -- could discourage foreign investors, who increasingly examine environment, social and governance criteria, known as ESG, before investing money.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "TIL that the Ozone layer is healing and is likely to heal fully by 2060.", "score": 27, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/05/ozone-layer-healing-after-aerosols-un-northern-hemisphere", "comments": 4, "date": "2019-7-1", "transcript": "The ozone layer is showing signs of continuing recovery from man-made damage and is likely to heal fully by 2060, new evidence shows.\n\nThe measures taken to repair the damage will also have an important beneficial effect on climate change, as some of the gases that caused the ozone layer to thin and in places disappear also contribute to warming the atmosphere.

Without it, skin and eye damage can occur, and evidence suggests a rise in skin cancers associated with the thinning of the ozone layer.\n\n\u201cThe Montreal protocol is one of the most successful multilateral agreements in history for a reason,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. \u201cThe careful mix of authoritative science and collaborative action that has defined the protocol for more than 30 years and was set to heal our ozone layer is precisely why the Kigali amendment holds such promise for climate action in future.\u201d\n\nThe Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol, coming into effect at the start of next year, will help reduce future climate change, by targeting HFC gases, mostly used in refrigeration, which have a warming effect tens of thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide.\n\nDurwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: \u201cOver the last three decades, the Montreal protocol has fulfilled its original objective to heal the ozone layer. But it didn\u2019t stop there. Because CFCs and related gases are also super climate pollutants, phasing them out has reduced the climate problem by an amount that would have equalled the contribution of carbon dioxide today \u2013 more than half of all warming \u2013 with the Kigali amendment adding even more climate protection.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, most major sources of ozone-harming gases were thought to have been closed down, until studies showed sites in China where gases were still emerging. The Chinese government has pledged to find and close down these sites.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/SRthab155iwbbuBLy_oS9L_VfhfyEx_JXRk8Mxmc11U.jpg"}, {"title": "India is now producing the world\u2019s cheapest solar power; Costs of building large-scale solar installations in India fell by 27 per cent in 2018", "score": 146, "url": "https://theprint.in/india/governance/india-is-now-producing-the-worlds-cheapest-solar-power/256353/", "comments": 2, "date": "2019-7-1", "transcript": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nA short time ago, solar power was considered a marginal power source. But it is now one of the major drivers behind the transition to greener, more sustainable energy.\n\nAround the globe, prices are falling and India is now producing the world\u2019s cheapest solar power, according to an International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) survey.\n\nThe costs of building large-scale solar installations in India fell by 27% in 2018, year-on-year, thanks to a combination of low-priced panel imports from China, abundant land and cheap labour.\n\nAverage solar prices from large-scale installations in India were less than a third of Canada\u2019s, where costs were highest of the countries surveyed.\n\nMore than half of the total costs of building a solar installation in India relate to hardware, like racking and mounting, while the remainder involves soft costs such as system design and financing.\n\nAlso read: India issues new tender for 2GW solar power equipment factories after two failed efforts\n\nLower service and labour outlay have contributed to a dramatic fall in the investment needed to set up large-scale solar power-generating projects. Between 2010 and 2018, setup costs in India fell by 80%, the most precipitous decline of any country.\n\nBack to nature\n\nAs prices come down, demand goes up. The expanding global solar sector now accounts for 55% of all new renewable power-generating capacity. Last year, 94 gigawatts of new capacity came online, largely added by Asian countries.\n\nChina was responsible for 44 gigawatts of all new solar capacity, almost five-times more than India, which followed directly behind. Other rapidly expanding markets include the US, Japan, Australia and Germany.\n\nAlongside the rise of solar, other clean energy sources like wind farms and hydropower are also growing. Renewable energy now generates a third of global power capacity.\n\n\u201cThrough its compelling business case, renewable energy has established itself as the technology of choice for new power generation capacity,\u201d said Adnan Z.

The latest research speculated that there would be more plastic in the ocean than fishes by the end of 2050.\n\nWhile a guy from Arizona has started Trashtag Challenge to make the environment clean, two students have discovered a method to convert plastic into useful compounds and water.\n\nHow They Developed Bacterium That Transforms Plastic into Useful Compounds\n\nMiranda Wang and Jeanny Yao who have been working on their project for years said they developed a bacterium that could chemically breakdown plastic polymers. Finally, their product is reaping benefits. They have a way of recycling plastic pollution into useful compounds.\n\nDo you want to know how they did this? They used genetically engineered bacteria to break polymers such as polyethylene film to turn plastic into more valuable products.\n\nWhat\u2019s amazing is the duo has received all the rights for the product and even secured funding of four hundred thousand dollars to create a product at the age of twenty years.\n\nThey\u2019re the Youngest Ever to Win Perlman Science Prize\n\nSource = Wonderfulengineering\n\nThe duo has won five prizes for their innovation and became the youngest ever to win the Perlman science prize. They became famous overnight because of this bacterium that can convert plastic into the water. Moreover, this technology can also be used for creating raw materials for clothing and cleaning the beaches.\n\nWhat do you think- is it possible to stop people from using plastic? The same question came in their mind. Miranda said \u2013\n\n\u201cIt is practically impossible to make people stop using plastic, we need technology to break the material, and everything becomes biodegradable.\u201d\n\nThe bacterium is developed into two parts where the plastics are dissolved, and enzymes are catalyzed. These elements are then covered in a biodigester station, where they function as if they are the leftovers of any food. You will be surprised to know that this process runs only for 24 hours and converts plastic into the water.\n\nThe modified bacteria dissolve plastic into water and CO2. They believe that they can turn the plastic crisis into a great opportunity and disrupt the textile industry.\n\nYou can check more details about their project BioCellection here. (15.1)\n\nThe Story Behind this BioCellection Project\n\nSource = Cnn\n\nUnlike most of the people who have concerns about global warming but does not take any action to stop it, these girls took the matter seriously and developed the solution.\n\nEach year, we produce over 400 MM tons of plastic, and approximately 80-90% ends up in landfills. The conversion of plastic into usable material is challenging because currently, it is not feasible and economical.\n\nToday, we do not have great conversion technologies to enhance product value. Ultimately, global warming and plastic pollution is threatening the safety of wildlife and food exchange of over 4 billion people.\n\nAccording to a study, plastic accumulation is harmful to marine life. The plastic leftovers have been found in the stomachs of whales and turtles. The type of plastic used in bottles is lightweight and durable, but it is resistant to biodegradation.\n\nThis is not the first time scientists worked on the conversion of plastics into usable materials. In 2016, the Japanese team from Keio University and Kyoto Institute of Technology run by Shosuke Yoshida collected over 200 PET contaminated samples, which include wastewater from plastic bottle recycling site.\n\nThen they tested the microbes to see if they were eating the PET (polyethylene terephthalate). It was discovered that there are bacteria responsible for degrading PET. The species was named as Ideonella Sakaiensis. The test proved that the species uses two enzymes to break the PET.\n\nEven after doing research, and finding that particular bacteria is responsible for eating plastics, it was not clear how and whether it will stop the plastic accumulation in the region.\n\nNow, Miranda Wang and Jeanny Yao have developed a bacterium to stop plastic use. I think it is a great innovation! Let us know more about their vision and how can you buy this product.\n\nTheir Vision and Idea Behind the Project\n\nSource = Theconversation\n\nThe project tackles plastic pollution one step at a time. They started this with polyethylene and polystyrene films, which are the major cause of pollution.\n\nThe goal is, to recycle the mixed & contaminated plastics that at present cannot be recycled into usable products. By coupling synthetic biology and chemistry, the plastic would break down into building blocks, and then converted into other materials.\n\nHow Can You Buy This Product?\n\nNo doubt, their innovation is amazing, and people would love to buy this product. Sadly, their product is not available in the market currently, but it would be commercially available in the coming two years.\n\nWatch How Jeanny & Miranda are Helping Restore our Oceans with Biotechnology:\n\nFinal Words\n\nWhat do you think of this innovation? Isn\u2019t it a great step by these students to protect our environment?\n\nDo you have any other idea about how you can stop the use of plastics?

Gee gave a July 12 deadline for the Trump administration to report on what has been done \u201cpost haste\u201d to fix the conditions.\n\nThe order forces the government to allow the facilities to be inspected by public health professionals and staffed by medical professionals. It involves all of U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s facilities in Texas\u2019 El Paso and Rio Grande Valley sectors, which are the subjects of a lawsuit reacting to reports of unsanitary conditions at the detention centers.\n\nA group of lawyers filed a June 26 temporary restraining order with Gee to hold the Trump administration in contempt. The filing is related to the Flores settlement, a 1997 agreement that details child welfare standards in detention.\n\n\u201cChildren are held for weeks in deplorable conditions, without access to soap, clean water, showers, clean clothing, toilets, toothbrushes, adequate nutrition or adequate sleep,\u201d the court filing stated. \u201cThe children, including infants and expectant mothers, are dirty, cold, hungry and sleep-deprived.\u201d\n\nA CBP official declined to comment to HuffPost after the Friday ruling, citing pending litigation.\n\nGee\u2019s emergency order comes in the midst of nationwide concern about the inhumane conditions in Border Patrol facilities, which some experts have said qualify as concentration camps. Government officials have previously argued that they\u2019re responding as best they can given the surge in new arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border. A record number of children and families are crossing the border, and some facilities have temporarily shut down or quarantined children because of sickness.\n\nFive migrant children have died in Border Patrol custody since December, and a sixth was recently discovered to have died in September.\n\nThe lawyers who filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration did so after interviewing dozens of minors at the facilities mentioned in the court filing. The children described being hungry, cold, sick, having to take care of detained infants, and not being allowed to bathe or brush their teeth.\n\n\u201cThe declarations paint a picture of wanton disregard for the safety and welfare of children in their care,\u201d said Hope Frye, an immigration lawyer who spoke with the children. \u201cThere is complicity across Customs and Border Protection in the systematic persecution of children and the cruel and inhuman circumstances in which they are kept.\u201d\n\nIn her order, Gee said the court has dealt with previous Flores settlement violations by the government, the Times reported. The \u201cemergent\u201d nature of the lawyers\u2019 reports \u201cdemands immediate action,\u201d she reportedly said.\n\n\u201cThe Court has already issued several orders that have set forth in detail what it considers to be violations of the Flores Agreement,\u201d Gee wrote, according to CNN. \u201cThus, the parties need not use divining tools to extrapolate from those orders what does or does not constitute non-compliance.

Then the two men went to the Rochester community and asked: Want to paint with us on Sunday? No experience required.\n\nThat is why about 75 people, most of them strangers, showed up at the corner of Main and Gibbs streets \u2014 right in front of the University of Rochester\u2019s Eastman School of Music \u2014 to paint four enormous keyboards on the morning of June 23. Before the paint was dry, the community and social media were celebrating the work.\n\nWhen volunteer painter Barbara Hoffman, 80, showed up, Dunwoody put her to work right away with a can of white spray paint.\n\n\u201cIt was beyond amazing,\u201d Hoffman said of the experience. \u201cIt was very unique.

Phasing them out could avoid as much as 0.5C (0.9F) of warming this century.\n\nRecovery from the holes and thinning caused by aerosol chemicals has progressed at a rate of about 1% to 3% a decade since 2000, meaning the ozone layer over the northern hemisphere and mid-latitudes should heal completely by the 2030s, if current rates are sustained.\n\nMysterious source of illegal ozone-killing emissions revealed, say investigators Read more\n\nOver the southern hemisphere and in the more problematic polar regions, recovery will take longer, until the middle of this century in the former and about 2060 in the latter case.\n\nThe results, presented on Monday in a four-year assessment of the health of the ozone layer, represent a rare instance of global environmental damage being repaired, and a victory for concerted global action by governments. Scientific evidence of the depletion of the ozone layer over the Antarctic was first presented in 1985, and in 1987 the Montreal protocol was signed, binding world governments to reduce and phase out the harmful chemicals identified as causing the problem.\n\nOzone in the upper layers of the atmosphere protects the earth\u2019s surface from most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. Without it, skin and eye damage can occur, and evidence suggests a rise in skin cancers associated with the thinning of the ozone layer.\n\n\u201cThe Montreal protocol is one of the most successful multilateral agreements in history for a reason,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. \u201cThe careful mix of authoritative science and collaborative action that has defined the protocol for more than 30 years and was set to heal our ozone layer is precisely why the Kigali amendment holds such promise for climate action in future.\u201d\n\nThe Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol, coming into effect at the start of next year, will help reduce future climate change, by targeting HFC gases, mostly used in refrigeration, which have a warming effect tens of thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide.\n\nDurwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: \u201cOver the last three decades, the Montreal protocol has fulfilled its original objective to heal the ozone layer. But it didn\u2019t stop there. Because CFCs and related gases are also super climate pollutants, phasing them out has reduced the climate problem by an amount that would have equalled the contribution of carbon dioxide today \u2013 more than half of all warming \u2013 with the Kigali amendment adding even more climate protection.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, most major sources of ozone-harming gases were thought to have been closed down, until studies showed sites in China where gases were still emerging. The Chinese government has pledged to find and close down these sites.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/SRthab155iwbbuBLy_oS9L_VfhfyEx_JXRk8Mxmc11U.jpg"}, {"title": "Firefighters Roll Dying Forest Ranger Through the Woods One Last Time", "score": 45, "url": "https://returntonow.net/2019/06/29/firefighters-roll-dying-forest-ranger-through-the-woods-one-last-time/", "comments": 2, "date": "2019-7-1", "transcript": "June 29, 2019 at 4:27 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen hospice workers asked firefighters to help fulfill the dying wish of a former forest ranger with multiple sclerosis, they took him on a 3-hour tour of the woods on his gurney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer forest ranger Edward Reis, 62, had been in hospice care for multiple sclerosis for years, unable to get outdoors, much less in the woods.\n\nJust a couple of weeks before his death, he confessed his dying wish to the chaplain \u2014 to get back out into nature, into the forest.\n\nThe chaplain got together with Reis\u2019 nurse, at Evergreen Health Hospice in Washington state, and devised a plan to take him on a \u201cwalk\u201d in the woods near the ocean.\n\nBut they knew they couldn\u2019t get the bed-ridden man there on their own.

His legs and belly were swelling like sponges, his lungs kept filling with fluid so badly that he needed an oxygen tank, and the extreme measures his physicians had tried worked only temporarily.\n\n\u201cHe got worse and worse and worse,\u201d said Dr. Hakon Hakonarson, a pediatric lung specialist and director of the Center for Applied Genomics at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). \u201cHe was going to die.\u201d\n\nBut the boy lived. Born with a rare, complex genetic condition, he owes his life to zebrafish, the nearly transparent creatures that have become the go-to lab animal in countless studies of genetics, development, and disease.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHakonarson and his colleagues identified the mutation causing the boy\u2019s illness, in which lymphatic vessels proliferate out of control and leak fluid into the lungs and other organs; engineered the mutation into zebrafish; waited for the fish to develop a piscine version of the boy\u2019s disease; tested multiple drugs on the fish; found one that stopped the vessels\u2019 kudzu-like growth; and got permission from federal health officials to try it on their young patient.\n\nIt worked, they reported in Nature Medicine on Monday, a success that shows \u201cprecision medicine\u201d can be expanded well beyond cancers, where it has shown the greatest promise. Much like, say, lung cancer, the child\u2019s illness, central conducting lymphatic anomaly, can be caused by any of several mutations. Each leads down a different biological road to the disease. Only a drug that targets the right road can stop the disease, just as blockading only the roads taken by an invading army can stop it from laying siege to a city.\n\nadvertisement\n\nResearchers not involved in the boy\u2019s case said it made a compelling case for applying genetic techniques to lymphatic disorders, which strike about 1 in 4,000 newborns. \u201cI think this approach definitely could be used clinically,\u201d said medical geneticist Dr. V. Reid Sutton of Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, which treats about 50 children with lymphatic anomalies every year. \u201cIt suggests that we should do this sort of genetic testing to identify where in the biological pathway the problem is and try to find a drug that targets it.\u201d\n\nDaniel was 12 when his family took him to CHOP. As a little kid he had played competitive soccer and run a 5K in 25 minutes. But when he was 10 his legs suddenly began swelling, he had trouble breathing, and he couldn\u2019t tolerate exercise. The Virginia hospital near the family\u2019s home diagnosed a buildup of lymphatic fluid around his heart and drained it, but with lymphatic fluid continuing to leak in, it was like bailing out a boat without repairing the leak.\n\nTransferred to CHOP, Daniel received palliative treatment, including the cauterization of lymphatic vessels and sirolimus, an immune-suppressing drug (also called rapamycin) that helps some patients with one type of lymphatic disease but not others. But nothing helped for long, and sirolimus didn\u2019t help at all.\n\nDaniel \u201cwas getting measured for a wheelchair and had to be tutored at home,\u201d his mother said in a statement to CHOP.\n\nHakonarson and his colleagues suspected that getting to the genetic root of the problem was Daniel\u2019s only hope. They sequenced his exome, the part of the genome that produces proteins. A dozen genes that had previously been linked to lymphatic anomaly looked normal.\n\nBut a gene on the X chromosome, called ARAF, didn\u2019t. ARAF makes an enzyme called a kinase that adds dangly molecules to a cell\u2019s proteins. Too much of that can cause a cell to proliferate so wildly it becomes cancerous or, in Daniel\u2019s case, to sprout lymphatic vessels like creepers from a neglected patch of ivy. (Neither of his parents has the mutation. It arose by random bad luck when he was only a days-old embryo.) But the exact mechanism by which the lymphatic vessels proliferated was one that sirolimus doesn\u2019t affect.\n\nARAF mutations had never been linked to lymphatic disorders, however. Maybe it was an innocent bystander unrelated to Daniel\u2019s now-life-threatening illness. To determine that, the scientists genetically engineered zebrafish embryos to carry the mutation.\n\nWithin five days, the fish had developed a lymphatic system. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the nice features of zebrafish,\u201d said CHOP\u2019s Christoph Seiler, who led this part of the study: \u201cThey develop lightning-fast.\u201d With the ARAF mutation, what the quarter-inch-long fish developed were lymphatic vessels that grew and grew, just like Daniel\u2019s.\n\nIt was \u201cproof that this mutation causes overgrowth\u201d of lymphatic vessels, Hakonarson said.\n\nThat was scientifically interesting, but the researchers had a dying patient. They gave groups of fish with the ARAF mutation one of 10 different drugs. \u201cWe just put it in the water and they take up the drug,\u201d Seiler said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to inject it like you do with a mouse.\u201d\n\nAll the drugs are \u201cMEK inhibitors,\u201d which hit exactly the biological pathway that Daniel\u2019s ARAF mutation takes the brakes off. The scientists anxiously examined the fish for evidence that the chaotic lymphatic vessel proliferation had stopped but that nothing else had been harmed.\n\nThey had a winner: trametinib, a melanoma drug that Novartis sells as Mekinist.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nAlthough physicians can prescribe a drug for conditions other than those the Food and Drug Administration approved it for, Hakonarson was reluctant to do that. \u201cWe did not want to take the chance of giving a toxic, adult drug to a child\u201d without outside experts deciding that the potential benefits outweighed the risks, he said.\n\nWith FDA approval, the CHOP team gave Daniel trametinib. Within two months, his breathing improved. At three months, the fluid in his lungs had receded enough that he no longer needed supplemental oxygen. The swelling in his legs disappeared. An MRI showed that his lymphatic vessels reshaped themselves into something close to normal. It was the first time a drug had remodeled an entire organ system.\n\n\u201cYou try a lot of things in research and only a few work,\u201d Seiler said. \u201cIt\u2019s so great to go back into the clinic and treat\u201d on the basis of what the zebrafish revealed.\n\nNow 14, Daniel plays basketball, rides his bicycle, and helps coach soccer.\n\nExperts not involved in the study cautioned that one success is suggestive, but not proof, that exome sequencing and targeted therapy will help patients with rare lymphatic anomalies. Still, \u201cthis is the first paper to implicate ARAF in vascular malformation and to demonstrate MEK inhibition may be effective,\u201d said Dr. Matt Warman, a medical geneticist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cThis is important since several clinicians are currently using MEK inhibitors in other patients whose vascular malformations are due to mutations.\u201d\n\nThe CHOP results would be more persuasive with more patients followed for longer, he said, but the researchers \u201chave performed a service to patients affected by these distressing disorders.\u201d\n\nDaniel\u2019s case argues for clinical trials in which existing drugs, especially for cancer, are matched to the precise genetics of patients with lymphatic anomalies, said Sutton of Texas Children\u2019s. Scientists in France reported last year that the Novartis breast cancer drug alpelisib (Piqray) saved 19 patients with vascular malformations similar to Daniel\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAs we identify additional causes [of lymphatic anomalies], we should be able to do more mutation-specific therapies,\u201d Warman said. Especially if zebrafish point the way.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xsdo84ZCZvZwX584pfdragHFt0F-m_M0ty6JvxN_nFY.jpg"}, {"title": "Pedro the turtle lost his legs \u2014 so US veterinarians gave him Lego wheels", "score": 33, "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-01/pedro-the-turtle-gets-lego-wheel-transplant/11266382", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-7-1", "transcript": "Pedro the turtle lost his legs \u2014 so US veterinarians gave him Lego wheels\n\nPosted\n\nLosing your limbs would be a death knell for most turtles \u2014 but Pedro is learning to roll with the punches (quite literally).\n\nKey points: It's believed Pedro, the three-legged turtle, was attacked by a snake or raccoon, which severed his remaining back leg\n\nVeterinarians attached the Lego wheels via axles secured to Pedro's shell\n\nThe turbo turtle responded well to the operation and regained mobility within minutes\n\nThe adult male box turtle is living life in the fast lane after undergoing a Lego transplant to get him moving once more.\n\nIt's been a rocky road for the turbo turtle, who only had three legs when he was adopted by his owners.\n\nBut after escaping from his outdoor enclosure in the US state of Louisiana, it's believed he was attacked by a raccoon or snake, which severed his remaining back leg.\n\n\"While he had three legs, he was able to move around very well,\" his owner Sandra Traylor said.\n\n\"However, once he lost his second leg it became significantly more difficult for him to get to where he was trying to go.\"\n\nMs Traylor is the first to admit she wasn't sure what \u2014 if anything \u2014 veterinarians could do to solve Pedro's problem.\n\nSuffice to say, a Lego car set probably wasn't at the top of the list.\n\n\"The idea was a collective effort,\" explained Dr Kelly Rockwell, a zoological medicine intern in the Louisiana State University (LSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital.\n\n\"There have been previous reports of exotic veterinarians putting wheels or other prosthetics on turtles [and] tortoises with missing limbs.\n\n\"This was a perfect situation as Pedro had both of his back legs missing.\"\n\n'The wheels have been a blessing'\n\nAccording to Dr Rockwell, aside from Pedro's weakened mobility, he was in otherwise good shape.\n\nThe wound where his leg had been torn off had healed quite well, she explained, and he was still able to \"box up\" inside his shell for protection.\n\n\"We discussed other prosthetics with his family if he was going to remain outdoors,\" Dr Rockwell said.\n\n\"However, they opted to make him an indoor pet and this wheels provided the best mobility for him in that environment.\"\n\nArmed with a tube of animal-safe epoxy and a Lego car kit, veterinarians got to work.\n\nThey attached the wheels via axles that were secured to Pedro's shell and held together by syringe cases.\n\n\"The most challenging part was figuring out a way to make it fit to his size,\" Dr Rockwell said.\n\n\"It took some brainstorming, but once we came up with a design it was fairly easy to implement and attach.\"\n\nThe newfound Speedy Gonzales took to his new wheels with gusto, according to Dr Rockwell, reversing and turning the prosthetics \"within minutes\".\n\n\"The benefit of Lego's is that they are very lightweight, so for Pedro's size it was a perfect fit,\" she explained.\n\n\"At the very least, I hope it inspires veterinarians who don't work with these animals often to be creative.\"\n\nIt is a sentiment echoed by Ms Traylor, who has lauded the veterinarians for going above and beyond the call of duty.\n\n\"We are so glad he feels better.

The community educator, who lives in Bangalore, India, has been on HIV treatment for more than a decade and says antiretroviral medicine has given her back her health and happiness.\n\n\u201cThis medicine is very good. I am very happy,\u201d said Veena. \u201cMy life has changed. I am learning three languages and working.\u201d\n\nThere are 2.1 million people living with HIV in India, which has the third largest HIV epidemic in the world. On 28 April, during an event in New Delhi, Jagat Prakash Nadda, the Minister of Health and Family Welfare, announced a new test-and-treat policy that commits to providing access to HIV treatment for everyone living with HIV in the country. Prior to the change in policy, people living with HIV could only access antiretroviral medicine for free if their CD4 cells had decreased to less than 500 cells/mm3.\n\nMr Nadda also said that the ministry\u2019s 90\u201390\u201390 strategy will identify 90% of people living with HIV, place 90% of people identified as living with HIV on treatment and ensure that 90% of people on treatment have sustained viral load suppression. \u201cThis strategy will offer us an opportunity to work towards our commitment made during the United Nations High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS.\u201d\n\nPeople living with HIV in India often access treatment late. This was the case for Veena when she began taking medicine.\n\n\u201cI had lost a lot of weight and I had a high fever. I was tired and I couldn\u2019t work,\u201d said Veena. Initially she did not respond well to treatment, but slowly her weight started to increase and her immune system became better.\n\nUNAIDS has called on all countries to provide HIV treatment to anyone who tests positive for HIV, because treatment keeps a person living with HIV healthy and has the double benefit of stopping the transmission of the virus to other people.\n\n\u201cThe Government of India is showing bold leadership and commitment to people living with HIV,\u201d said Steve Kraus, Director of the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific. \u201cThis new policy will bring life-saving treatment within reach of more than one million people living with HIV. It will keep individuals, families and communities healthy and productive and ensure that India ends its AIDS epidemic by 2030.\u201d\n\nTo rapidly scale-up treatment, India will rely on its network of facilities spread across the country providing HIV services. Rolling out the new policy will also entail strengthening the procurement and supply chain management system as well as sustained community participation.\n\nAccording to the country\u2019s national AIDS programme, annual AIDS-related deaths declined by 54% between 2007 and 2015, while new HIV infections dropped by 32%. As more people living with HIV follow Veena onto treatment, the double benefits of antiretroviral medicines are expected to lead to a further decline in deaths and new HIV infections.\n\nVeena has managed what she never thought possible: watch her daughter grow into a young adult.\n\n\u201cMy life has a future. I don\u2019t have a proper education, but my daughter has completed her degree. She is working. She is an empowered woman,\u201d said Veena.\n\nUNAIDS is working with countries to ensure that 30 million people living with HIV have access to HIV treatment by 2020.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ELPh9gWhlbCmzFSo49_12DPEJ5LLj0L0jiyXawNQS7g.jpg"}, {"title": "The Amazing Emergence On The World Stage Of North Korea", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=_5aXRBxMA5s&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyiP9Fa03RL0%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-7-1", "transcript": "Published on Jul 1, 2019\n\nThis is more or less like going Around The World in 80 Days From A to Z.\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE FOR DAILY VIDEOS: http://bit.ly/2BnpFfz\n\n\n\n#travel #worldtravel #aroundtheworldin80days\n\n\n\nSubscribe to my channel: http://bit.ly/2BnpFfz T\n\n\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2DU9Fn1\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2GcUlnE\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2BnpFfz\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2DU9Fn1\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2GcUlnE\n\n\n\nTravel the world's many wonders that has little known places of interest to visit and enjoy:\n\n\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2TuConO\n\n\n\nThe Country dialling code of Korea, North is +850, and the TLD (Top-level domain) of Korea, North is .kp\n\n\n\nAirports in Korea, North\n\nOnchon, Kwail, Unchon Up, Ihyon, P'y\u014fngyang-gukchegonghang, Pukch'angni-bihaengjang, and Pyongyang\n\n\n\nThe Country dialling code of Korea, North is +850, and the TLD (Top-level domain) of Korea, North is .kp\n\n\n\nThe capital of Korea, North is Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korea belongs to the Asian continent\n\n\n\nKorea, North\n\nNorth Korea is one of the world's most isolated countries.

And he tells the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a new interview that he plans to give 80% to 90% of that wealth to charity when he dies.\n\nMarcus, 90, said that he has given more than $2 billion to 300-plus organizations across the globe in his lifetime. The Home Depot HD, -1.60% co-founder and his wife, Billi, joined the Giving Pledge launched by Microsoft MSFT, -1.98% founder Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010, a commitment by the world\u2019s wealthiest people to donate at least half of their fortunes. \u201cTo make quarterly profits is one thing, but changing just one life is so much better,\u201d Marcus said when he joined.\n\nBuffett also announced on Monday that he would donate about $3.6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway shares to five foundations as part of that pledge, and Mackenzie Bezos, who became one of the world\u2019s richest women following her divorce from Amazon AMZN, +0.78% founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, also joined the philanthropic promise earlier this year.\n\nRelated:Warren Buffett to donate Berkshire shares worth $3.6 billion to 5 foundations\n\nAnd: Jeff Bezos is \u2018proud\u2019 of ex-wife\u2019s pledge to give away over half of her $35 billion fortune: \u2018Go get \u2019em MacKenzie\u2019\n\nMarcus declined to share his net worth or predict exactly how much he\u2019ll give away. But with his wealth guessed to be in the range of $4.53 and $5.8 billion, combined with the $2 billion he says he\u2019s already given away, the Atlanta newspaper puts his potential total philanthropy in the ballpark of $6 billion.\n\nHe has left instructions with his Marcus Foundation to share the wealth with charitable causes. His priorities include medical discoveries and treatments for kids with autism, and creating 20 to 25 centers across the country to aid veterans suffering from brain injuries and PTSD.\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019ve got all the houses I need. I live very well. My kids are taken care of. Everything I live for now is finding the right things to put my money into and that can give me a rate of return in emotion and doing good things for this world.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Bernie Marcus\n\nHe and his wife have also donated $250 million to build the Georgia Aquarium, and millions more to the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cEvery day of my life, there are new challenges for me that I want to get involved with,\u201d said Marcus.\n\nAnd that includes politics, although not to the extent of his philanthropic giving. He told the paper that he would be donating to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, even though \u201chis communication sucks,\u201d Marcus said of the president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a businessman\u2019s common-sense approach to most things,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cNow, do I agree with every move that he makes? No, I don\u2019t. But the truth is he has produced more than anybody else. He has. If we look at this country, I would say that we are better off today than we were eight years ago or six years ago.\u201d\n\nMarcus retired as Home Depot\u2019s chairman in 2002. And he isn\u2019t worried anymore about competition from Amazon hurting the $231 billion company that he helped start.\n\nRelated:Home Depot sees opportunity in tool rental\n\nHome Depot, which generates about $108 billion in annual sales, \u201cis doing well because they understand the philosophy of reinventing themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point, we had real concern that Amazon was going to put everybody out of business.

Jan. 30th 2019) by WWF Mexico. The butterflies are so dense at their dozen or so mountain-top clustering sites that overwintering butterflies cannot be counted individually. Instead, the area of forest that is densely coated with butterflies (at about 5,000 butterflies per square meter looking up into the canopy) is estimated as a measure of monarch abundance. Butterflies arrive to Mexico around the day of dead in November and stay until March each year as part of their annual migratory cycle. Butterflies have been declining over the past three decades, and the annual announcement is a welcome addition to our understanding of the long-term dynamics of our beloved monarch.\n\nThis winter season (2018-2019), there were approximately 6.05 hectares (nearly 15 acres) of forest occupied with dense monarchs in the Mexican highlands (somewhere in the neighborhood of 300,000 million overwintering butterflies). The monarchs end up congregating in a tiny area, with the bulk of the butterflies concentrated among twelve mountain massifs (clusters of peaks) within three hundred square miles (eight hundred square kilometers), an area smaller than New York City. In other words, most of the monarchs from eastern North America, from Maine to Saskatchewan, and south to Texas, probably covering two million square miles, funnel down and overwinter in a location 0.015 percent the area that they occupy in the summer! Unbelievable. This year\u2019s estimate is well over double compared to last year, great news for monarchs!\n\nWhere does this leave us? The good news is that this year\u2019s population was huge in the summer months throughout the USA and Canada, and the resulting migration and overwintering population in Mexico was the highest in 12 years, higher than predicted by many. The season started with a very early spring and a far reaching northern migration. As I have previously argued, there is often a disconnect between summer breeding populations of monarchs and the overwintering population \u2014 that seems to not be the case this past year.\n\nWith 26 years of data, there are various ways to plot and assess the trends. Below I have plotted four year averages for seven periods working backwards (so the first average on the left is only for 2 years). Any way you slice it, the trend has been negative, and the population is not what it was. Nonetheless, the extreme downward trend seems to have bumped up in the last period of four years. Is this the new norm, a winter population hovering between two and five hectares? How dangerously low are these numbers? And what can be done to continue to reverse the trend and buffer the population? I have recently written more about this issue in a scientific article as a well as my book.\n\nFor now, let\u2019s celebrate. The government is open, and thus the Fish and Wildlife Service will be deciding on the petition to list monarchs as threatened under the Endangered Species Act this summer.

Jonas Thrys\u00f8e is not one of them. At least, not yet. The 36-year-old has agoraphobia, rarely leaves the house and can\u2019t think of anything worse than a group singalong. And yet by the second chorus he is putty in the choirmaster\u2019s hands. \u201cI swore I\u2019d just stand at the back and listen,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the mood was infectious.\u201d\n\nOut of work and in his second year of sick leave because of anxiety and panic attacks, Thrys\u00f8e had become isolated. \u201cI\u2019d avoid situations where I thought I\u2019d get anxious, until I ended up avoiding all situations. It was a vicious circle,\u201d he says.\n\nWith a master\u2019s degree in European studies, Thrys\u00f8e had dreamed of a career in Brussels or the Danish government. \u201cBut things got so bad I couldn\u2019t even leave the house. It was \u2026 a kick in the groin,\u201d he says.\n\nThen the Kulturvitaminer (culture vitamins) programme came along, offering Thrys\u00f8e and other unemployed people in Aalborg with stress, anxiety or depression the chance to go on a crash culture course. Partly funded by the Danish health authority, and administered by the local jobcentre, the municipalities of Aalborg, Silkeborg, Nyborg and Vordingborg set up pilot schemes to encourage cultural participation for those unemployed or on state sick leave.\n\nMikael Odder Nielsen, the Aalborg course leader, says: \u201cWe wanted to see if we could make people\u2019s mental health better, reduce social isolation and help them get back into the labour market via culture.\u201d\n\nParticipants were invited to go on two or three cultural excursions a week for 10 weeks. This appealed to Thrys\u00f8e. \u201cIt was an activity that would get me out of the house, something that wasn\u2019t a medical appointment, where I was treated as \u2018normal\u2019. Because I am not my anxiety, I\u2019m me. And the course helped me feel like \u2018me\u2019 again,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aalborg is one of four areas involved in the Kulturvitaminer project.

Read more\n\nEvy Mortenson, 49, was working in a kindergarten in 2013 when work-related stress resulted in unemployment, followed by periods of ill health and chronic insomnia for the next six years. \u201cBefore I went down with stress, I would often go to concerts and museums,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I stopped. Nothing made me happy or even made sense any more.\u201d\n\nAfter several temporary contracts but no improvement in her health, Mortenson\u2019s caseworker at the jobcentre enrolled her for Kulturvitaminer. \u201cAs soon as I walked into the welcome meeting, I felt a sense of relief. It was a shared experience and there were no expectations, we were just all there together in a judgment-free space,\u201d she says.\n\nThis was key, because many participants have not taken part in cultural activities for years, if ever, says Nielsen. \u201cIf you are depressed, culture is often the first thing you don\u2019t bother with, you\u2019re too preoccupied with getting through the day. My role is to get them used to this world again, or even introduce it for the first time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re you are depressed, culture is often the first thing you don\u2019t bother with -, you\u2019re too preoccupied with getting through the day.\u2019\n\nSo far, 200 people, mostly women in their late 30s or 40s with family commitments, have taken part in the Aalborg programme. \u201cThey tell me, \u2018I used to do this sort of thing a lot before I had kids.\u2019 I tell them, \u2018This sounds depressingly familiar\u2019,\u201d Nielsen says. \u201cBut there are men too, because it\u2019s not a space where you have to talk all the time: you\u2019re there to do and experience things.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Evy Mortenson: \u2018As soon as I walked into the welcome meeting, I felt a sense of relief.\u2019 Photograph: Kristian F\u00e6ste/The Guardian\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

Such as? \u201cJack Johnson.\u201d\n\nThere are also visits to the theatre to watch new productions, and coaching sessions in which actors teach participants about body language to help with confidence in job interviews. The programme has an agreement with the Aalborg Symphony Orchestra in which participants are taken to watch rehearsals and performances, something that often leads to tears, says Nielsen. Researchers have found that watching music performed live reduces stress. Participants also visit the local art museum and take part in creative workshops, an activity proven to develop resilience. Participants are also encouraged to snuggle up under blankets in a dimly lit room in an Aalborg library while a librarian reads to them for two hours.\n\nMost of the participants will not have had books read to them since childhood, so this can prove an emotional experience. Mortenson says: \u201cI spent so much of my life reading to others, but this time I needed help and I felt taken care of. It was very powerful.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jutland, near Aalborg: Nielsen said of the nature walks: \u2018These are also valuable in terms of seeing how slowly things grow, in contrast to our busy modern lives.\u2019 Photograph: visitdjursland.com\n\nBrain scans show that when people are immersed in a book, they mentally rehearse the activities, sights and sounds of a story, stimulating neural pathways, increasing empathy and improving wellbeing.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to talk about the books, \u201cbut not in a school-type way\u201d, says Thrys\u00f8e. Finally, there are guided nature walks, because numerous studies have shown that spending time in nature is good for mental health. Nielsen says: \u201cThese are also valuable in terms of seeing how slowly things grow, in contrast to our busy modern lives.\u201d\n\nCulture as a cure is not a new idea. In 2008, the then UK health secretary, Alan Johnson, called for the arts to be part of mainstream healthcare, and in 2009, the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommended participation in the arts and developing creativity for the protection of mental health. A decade on, evidence for the impact of the arts on wellbeing is growing. Research shows that \u201cart on prescription\u201d is valued by referrers and participants alike, and is also cost-effective, with a reduction in the number of visits to the doctor and participants gaining transferable skills.\n\nBut provision in the UK remains patchy. In contrast, Australia has had a national arts and health framework to promote integration of the two since 2013, while Sweden leads the way in Scandinavia in terms of art on prescription. But Denmark is catching up, and the relationship between culture and health is increasingly being identified as an important factor in a sustainable Nordic welfare model. Anita Jensen, a postdoctoral researcher at Aalborg University, says: \u201cWe can see that it works for many people. It\u2019s relatively inexpensive, with no known negative side-effects.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonas Thrys\u00f8e: \u2018I swore I\u2019d just stand at the back and listen. But the mood was infectious.\u2019 Photograph: Kristian F\u00e6ste/The Guardian\n\nThe 10-week course costs 12,000 Danish krone (\u00a31,440) per person, while a single session with a psychologist is about 1,000 krone and a week on sick leave costs about 4,000 krone, including benefits and cost to employers. \u201cBecause Denmark is a small country, we have a unique opportunity to make a difference by offering arts on prescription as a public health initiative,\u201d says Jensen. Nielsen agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re largely funded by the state, but the council can also decide that this is worthwhile and fund it independently from their own budgets when the pilot programme ends in November,\u201d he says.\n\nMortenson says: \u201cI\u2019d like to see the whole world taking their culture vitamins. I\u2019m not the same person as I was when I started this process. I listen to classical music every day now, I meet my culture group for outings, even though our 10-week programme has finished, and I have a support network with new interests. I\u2019ve even applied for a job in an art museum.\u201d\n\nThrys\u00f8e has also noticed a shift. He says: \u201cThe course altered my outlook \u2013 I\u2019ve redefined what success looks like. I went from being very isolated to being ready for the job market and happier, too. It changed my life.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The wind farm will produce more than 1.5 million MWhs of generation annually, enough power to supply around 264,000 homes.\n\nAGL CEO Brett Redman welcomed the milestone, saying that it is a crucial moment in the Australian energy market to have a project of Coopers Gap\u2019s scale nearing completion.\n\n\u201cThe size and scale of a project like this is extraordinary, and today\u2019s milestone is thanks to the hard work of so many people,\u201d Redman said.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant project for AGL and the timing of bringing new generation into the grid is crucial for all energy users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another great example of our commitment to investing in new generation to deliver affordable and reliable power for customers.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the support we have received from Government agencies in Queensland to navigate the logistic issues experienced during construction.\u201d\n\nAGL was keen to highlight the level of local investment that the project has generated for Queensland townships around the wind farm, estimating that as much as $56 million has been spent purchasing products and services from local businesses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d also like to recognise the efforts of the Australian Energy Market Operator and Powerlink as project partners who helped us get here, along with the support of the local community and local councils,\u201d AGL General Manager of Gas and Renewables Operations, Colin Mills, said.\n\nThe wind turbines used at the Coopers Gap wind farm will use blades that measure 67 metres in length, the largest used in Australia, and so requiring specialised logistics to transport the blades to the site.\n\nGE has supplied the project with 91 of its 3.6MW turbines with 137m rotors, and 32 of its 3.8 MW turbines with 130m rotors.\n\nThe project was developed by AGL and will be owned by the company\u2019s Powering Australia Renewables Fund (PARF), which was co-created with QIC. The fund has set an investment target of 1,000MW of large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia.\n\nThe PARF has also received investment from the Federal Government\u2019s Future Fund.\n\nAGL has sought to expand its investments in long-term assets, including diversifying its business interests beyond the energy sector.\n\nEarlier in the month, AGL abandoned a take-over bid for telecommunications company Vocus Group, as the energy giant see opportunities to align data and energy services as a way of improving offerings to customers and improving customer loyalty.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Cable Matters Introduces Active USB-C\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Cables With 4K Video, Up to 10 Gbps Data, and Power Delivery", "score": 1, "url": "https://eprnews.com/cable-matters-introduces-active-usb-c-cables-with-4k-video-up-to-10-gbps-data-and-power-delivery-416928/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "Unihertz Announces the Kickstarter Launch of Atom XL: The Smallest DMR Walkie-Talkie Rugged Smartphone", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Man who got laid off gets hundreds of job offers after handing out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on the side of the road", "score": 440, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/31/us/phoenix-resume-road-trnd/index.html", "comments": 53, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "(CNN) Patrick Hoagland of Phoenix was down on his luck after getting laid off from his job as a forklift operator at a metal recycling company.

They fan the flames of climate change by burning coal, gas and lignite, even though it\u2019s possible \u2013 and often cheaper \u2013 to generate clean electricity from renewable sources, such as solar or wind.\n\n\n\nAt Ecosia, we believe that the climate emergency is the wrong time to pursue business as usual. That\u2019s why we started building our own solar plants in 2018. Since then, we\u2019ve added enough clean energy to the grid to power all Ecosia searches with 100% renewable energy.\n\n\n\nWhat's the CO2 impact of an Ecosia search?\n\n\n\nSince we produce our own solar electricity, and because we use our profits to plant CO2-sequestering trees, Ecosia is not just \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d: your searches actively remove CO2 from the air. If Ecosia were as big as Google, we could absorb 15% of all CO2 emissions.\n\n\n\nBeing CO2 neutral is good; being CO2 negative is better. But it\u2019s still not good enough for us. That\u2019s why, in 2019, we\u2019re becoming the first company to produce twice as much solar power as we need to power all Ecosia searches. This way, we\u2019re actively crowding out dirty energy from the grid.\n\n\n\nIn summary, your searches on Ecosia are powered by 100% renewable energy; they plant trees that fight climate change by removing CO2 from the atmosphere, and they accelerate the energy transition away from fossil fuels by adding solar energy to the electricity grid.\n\n\n\nServers use a lot of power. If the internet were a country, it would rank #3 in the world in terms of electricity consumption. Internet companies bear a responsibility to mind their ecological footprint by switching to alternative, renewable energy.

Joining forces with AOC, the two Congresswomen have unveiled new legislation designed to protect low-income communities from the dangers of climate change. This \u2018Climate Equity Act\u2019 would support the Green New Deal while limiting threats to low-income communities.\n\nWhat Would the Climate Equity Act Entail?\n\nThe bill would urge any environmental regulation to consider the potential impact on low-income communities. These communities usually bear the brunt of climate-related consequences \u2014 they\u2019re typically closer to flood zones, energy refineries, power plants, highways, and polluted areas. Using a rating system similar to the Congressional Budget Office score, the bill will quantify threats to these \u201cfront-line communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to a press release, Senator Harris defines these front-line communities as \u201cthose that have experienced systemic socioeconomic disparities, environmental racism, and other forms of injustice, including low-income communities, indigenous peoples, and communities of color.\u201d\n\nThe Climate Equity Act would hopefully reduce the dangers faced by these communities. \u201cWe must ensure that communities already contending with unsafe drinking water, toxic air, and lack of economic opportunity are not left behind. We need a Green New Deal based on climate and environmental justice,\u201d the California Democrat promised.\n\nBy requiring all environmental legislation to be ranked by an Equity Score, the bill would ensure low-income communities benefit rather than suffer. Both experts and representatives from front-line communities would develop the scores.\n\nBeyond Climate Equity Scores: Holding Congress and the Executive Branch Accountable\n\nIn addition to rating environmental legislation, the bill would create an Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability. This independent office would provide leaders from front-line communities a \u201cseat at the table\u201d during the legislative process. Moreover, the act would establish a Senior Advisor for Climate and Environmental Justice within all relevant agencies. The position would ensure coordination between its own agency and the new office.\n\nThe act would also require any climate-related regulations with a poor equity score to undergo additional review. This review process would bring in members from the affected communities. Then, they would work with policymakers to define ways to limit consequences and maximize benefits for their communities.\n\nTo hold the executive branch accountable, any federal grant-making or investment programs would face a similar review.\n\nPolitical Implications for Kamala Harris\n\nFor Kamala Harris, unveiling this bill during the Democratic Debates may have been a strategic political move. Unlike most candidates, Harris has yet to introduce her own, in-depth climate action plan. This legislation could, therefore, help make Harris a more competitive candidate.\n\nThough this is one of Harris\u2019 first climate-related promises, other Democratic candidates have already made their moves.\n\nOn Monday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee released a plan to create a new judicial office which would hold corporations responsible for their pollution in low-income communities. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke has pledged to put $1.2 trillion towards front-line communities. And Senator Cory Booker has challenged the EPA\u2019s practices that dismiss pollution levels in vulnerable communities. Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled an extensive climate reform plan too.\n\nDespite The New Bill, AOC Holds Off On Endorsements\n\nDespite her partnership with Senator Harris for the Climate Equity Act, AOC has not endorsed her or any other candidate in the 2020 Presidential race. She instead has worked across the board with several candidates on environmental protections for front-line communities.\n\n\u201cThe Climate Equity Act ensures that as we go forward to solve our climate crisis, we are focusing on communities most impacted by the crisis and the transition to renewable energy,\u201d she said.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0lH77VLKmrhcNNPADdXHuXZCfke6984icCOfglIumSM.jpg"}, {"title": "JIM ROHN | THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WEALTH", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=dnq0QdBRNro&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN5mo8jLfMb4%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "Published on Aug 1, 2019\n\nAM's Marketing Guru today shows you how you can take risks in business and in life so that you will be able to achieve quick results with this great motivational video! http://bit.ly/2XygJgX\n\n\n\n\n\nCHECK OUT THIS SITE FOR AMAZING SAVINGS: https://ebay.to/2XcXjNZ\n\n\n\nTHE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON: https://ebay.to/2I0Nei2\n\n\n\nWHITEN YOUR TEETH AT HOME WITH Sparkle White Professional Teeth Whitening kit for only $28.00, almost 90% off their kit at - https://ebay.to/2MEio3a\n\n\n\nCAMERA AND EDITING SOFTWARE \u21e3\n\n\n\n\u279c Canon G7X Mark II - https://ebay.to/2EYhND2\n\n\n\n\u279c Final Cut Pro - https://ebay.to/2I8RM6c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO JOIN THE FIVERR PROGRAM YOU CAN SIGN UP HERE: http://bit.ly/2VyEYcE\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED READING * Rich Habits: The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals @ https://ebay.to/2WKpMd3\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom New Day Focus: \"#JimRohn # Wealth #Life #Success Learn more about Jim Rohn by going here http://jimrohn.newdayfocus.net https://www.facebook.com/NewDayFocus https://www.instagram.com/NewDayFocus https://twitter.com/NewDayFocus http://newdayfocus.net/self-improvement freedom, money and fulfillment.

Hats off to our neighbors to the south.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s village is planned for the north side of the city. The seven-acre space will have room for 48 tiny homes, more than three times as many as there are in Racine. The new homes would measure 240 square feet each.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5RMtN8RpfdWe1O9SEVhI_8-ssjstla1CHARPuXwuUG4.jpg"}, {"title": "Remembering Joao Gilberto | CORCOVADO | Rosa Emilia Dias", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=x8WxSKKPA6s&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFgTlDybmb9o%26feature%3Dshare", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "Published on Aug 1, 2019\n\nClick Below to Subscribe.

No Need to Have a Mental Breakdown Over 'Climate Collapse'", "score": 0, "url": "https://reason.com/2019/03/29/good-news-no-need-to-have-a-mental-break/", "comments": 13, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "\"What if I told you there was a paper on climate change that was so uniquely catastrophic, so perspective-altering, and so absolutely depressing that it's sent people to support groups and encouraged them to quit their jobs and move to the countryside?\" asks reporter Zing Tsjeng over at Vice. She is citing Cumbria University Professor of Sustainability Leadership Jem Bendell's \"Deep Adaptation\" paper, which asserts that man-made climate change will result in \"a near-term collapse in society with serious ramifications for the lives of readers.\" How near-term? In about 10 years or so.\n\nBendell says that he came to his dire prediction while on a recent unpaid sabbatical during which he \"reviewed the scientific literature from the past few years.\" He asserts that \"the summary of science is the core of the paper as everything then flows from the conclusion of that analysis.\" As a consequence, he claims to have discerned from his reading of recent climate science the initiation of drastic non-linear effects that are quickly leading to \"runaway climate change.\" Therefore, his review forced him to \"establish the premise that it is time we consider the implications of it being too late to avert a global environmental catastrophe in the lifetimes of people alive today.\" Bendell seems now to be grappling with a kind of spiritual crisis as a result of his melancholy study.\n\nHow catastrophic? \"When I say starvation, destruction, migration, disease and war, I mean in your own life,\" he writes. \"With the power down, soon you wouldn't have water coming out of your tap. You will depend on your neighbours for food and some warmth. You will become malnourished. You won't know whether to stay or go. You will fear being violently killed before starving to death.\"\n\nBendell decries \"professional environmentalists [for] their denial that our societies will collapse in the near-term\" and invites readers \"to consider the value of leaving mainstream views behind.\" But is Bendell's reading of the recent climate science accurate? My own review of the literature suggests that he has essentially constructed a \"parade of horribles\" argument that falls apart under a more dispassionate analysis. Bendell anticipates that some critics will reject his grim conclusions by resorting to what he calls unwarranted and psychologically protective \"collapse-denial.\"\n\nWhile trying to avoid the \"collapse-denial\" pitfall, a review of the most recent scientific literature suggests that while climate change will pose significant problems for humanity over the remainder of this century, near-term social collapse due to runaway climate change is unlikely.\n\nBendell does report the relatively uncontroversial data that average global surface temperatures have increased by 0.9\u00b0C since 1880 and that 17 of the 18 warmest years in that record have all occurred since 2001. The State of the Climate in 2017 report issued last year by the American Meteorological Society cites weather balloon and satellite datasets indicating that, since 1979, the increase of global average temperature in the lower troposphere is proceeding at the rate of between 0.13\u00b0C and 0.19\u00b0C per decade. According to NASA's Earth Observatory, the rate of temperature increase since 1975 as measured by thermometers at the surface is roughly 0.15-0.20\u00b0C per decade. The State of the Climate in 2017 report also notes that climate models assessed by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) projected that the lower troposphere should be warming at the rate of 0.27\u00b0C per decade.\n\nReconciling the discrepancy between the rates of empirical and modeled temperature increase will depend on what equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) turns out to be. ECS is conventionally defined as how much warming can be expected to result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. There is still considerable debate among climate researchers about the magnitude of this figure.\n\nA 2018 article in Climate Dynamics calculated a relatively low climate sensitivity of range of between 1.1\u00b0C and 4.05\u00b0C (median 1.87\u00b0C). Another 2018 study in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres estimated a higher ECS that is likely between 2.4\u00b0C and 4.6\u00b0C (median 3.3\u00b0C). The study noted that its analysis \"provides no support for low values of ECS (below 2\u00b0C)\" suggested by other analyses such as the one in Climate Dynamics. The higher that ECS is, the more likely the models' rate of increase is right and the worse the effects of climate change are liable to be.\n\nIce\n\nBendell is particularly concerned about the rate of warming in the Arctic. He correctly observes that the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the global average. Between the 1920s and the 1940s, a large warming event occurred in the Arctic. Researchers have concluded that that increase was most likely the result of natural internal atmospheric variability. While early 20th century Arctic warming was comparable to the recent 30-year warming, the temperature levels during the past five years (2014\u201318) have exceeded all previous records since 1900.\n\nAs a result of warming temperatures, the extent of arctic sea ice has been falling since 1980 at the rate of 12.8 percent per decade. Some recent research suggests that Arctic warming is affecting weather patterns in the northern hemisphere such as polar vortex outbreaks in the mid-latitudes.\n\nBendell chiefly hangs his prognostication of \"our near-term extinction\" on the \"permafrost carbon bomb\" hypothesis. The idea is that lots of carbon is trapped in the Arctic permafrost and in subsea methane hydrates, and that warming will produce a feedback loop in which carbon will be exponentially released into the atmosphere. Adding Arctic carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is bad enough, but rising temperatures will purportedly cause the non-linear release of vast amounts of methane which has a global warming potential that is 28 to 36 times greater than carbon dioxide.\n\nIn support of this dire scenario, Bendell points to a 2013 report in Nature that conjectured that warming could lead to a burp of 50-gigatons of methane over less than 10 years out of the Arctic Ocean. The result would be an immediate increase of global temperatures by about 5\u00b0C at a cost to the global economy of $60 trillion. The size of the global economy was then about $70 trillion. Rather than merely cratering the global economy, such a methane burp might also result in our extinction.\n\nSo how worried should we be? Bendell handwaves aside numerous more current scientific reviews and studies that conclude that a permafrost carbon bomb is implausible. One comprehensive 2017 review of sources and sinks of methane reported that \"atmospheric measurements at long-term monitoring stations show no significant increase of Arctic methane emissions. This suggests that at present, Arctic emission increases are negligible or small in absolute terms.\"\n\nBendell instead speculates that recent increases in atmospheric methane indicate that a nonlinear Arctic methane catastrophe that could result in \"our near-term extinction\" is in the offing. As evidence, he cites a recent experiment in which German researchers monitored chunks of melting permafrost for seven years and found that they did emit more than expected amounts of methane. Based on this experiment, the researchers calculate that \"the permafrost soils of Northern Europe, Northern Asia and North America could produce up to 1 gigaton of methane and 37 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2100.\" That's 1 gigaton of methane over 80 years, not 50 gigatons in 10 years. And as it happens, human activity emitted 37 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2018, which means that Arctic permafrost thawing would add just a bit over 1 percent to annual carbon dioxide emissions between now and 2100.\n\nIn addition, a 2017 Nature Communications study traces the increases in atmospheric levels of methane that Bendell references not to permafrost, but instead to a combination of leaks from fossil fuel production and higher emissions from agriculture and wetlands. A 2019 Scientific Reports modeling study finds that abating man-made methane emissions would \"limit methane-caused climate warming by 2100 even in the case of an uncontrolled natural Arctic methane emission feedback.\" It appears that \"our near-term extinction\" from a detonating permafrost carbon bomb is highly unlikely.\n\nOther than the trends in the Arctic region, Bendell asserts that humanity is already seeing the impacts of global warming on storms, drought, and flood frequencies. Climate change is also set to dramatically reduce harvests resulting in global famines. He further asserts that half of the world's coral reefs have died in the past 30 years and that rising temperature is causing an exponential rise in mosquito and tickborne illnesses.\n\nWeather\n\nLet's take storms first. In a 2018 study, researchers associated with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project reported that global precipitation increased between 1979 and 2017 by 0.33 percent per decade, for an overall increase of about 1 percent. Interestingly another 2018 study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS) reported, \"The take-home message from our study using the new 33+ years of high-resolution global precipitation dataset is that there seems not to be any detectable and significant positive trends in the amount of global precipitation due to the now well-established increasing global temperature. While there are regional trends, there is no evidence of increase in precipitation at the global scale in response to the observed global warming.\"\n\nWhile the global trend toward more precipitation is small, meteorologists have found that there has been a significant increase in the frequency of more intense rainstorms. \"On a global scale, the observational annual-maximum daily precipitation has increased by an average of 5.73 millimeters (0.23 inch) over the last 110 years, or 8.5 percent in relative terms,\" reported a 2015 study.\n\nTropical cyclones are the most damaging type of storms. Most climate models project that as temperatures rise there will be fewer but bigger hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones. The MIT climatologist Kerry Emanuel reports a significant global increase since 1980 in all storms with maximum wind speeds above 175 kilometers per hour (109 miles per hour). Storms of 200 km/h (125 mph) and more have doubled in number, and those of 250 km/h (155 mph) and more have tripled. Climatologist Ryan Maue tracks global tropical cyclone activity and he also finds that while the number of cyclones has been declining since 1980, the trend toward bigger storms has been slightly increasing. While cyclones generate dangerous coastal storm surges, the good news is that global mortality from storm surges has been decreasing since the 1960s.\n\nStorm surges from cyclones will likely become more damaging as water from melting glaciers and ice caps on land drains into the oceans and increase average sea level. A 2018 BAMS article notes that sea level rise is accelerating at 0.084 millimeters per year. On top of the current rate of 3 millimeters per year, this implies an average rise of about 20 inches by 2100. Between 1880 and 2015, sea level rose by almost 9 inches.\n\nUsing a worst-case climate scenario in which no efforts were made to reduce future warming, a 2018 study in Earth's Future projected that sea level would rise by 2 and half feet by 2100. The researchers estimated that that increase would globally expand the area of land located in the 1-in-100 year coastal flood plain from its current area of about 210,000 square miles, to 290,000 square miles in 2100. The percent of the global population threatened by coastal flooding would rise (in the worst case scenario) from 3.6 percent now to about 5.4 percent by 2100.\n\nA 2018 study in Global Environmental Change, this one also evaluating the economic effects of projected sea level increases ranging from 1 to 6 feet by 2100, concluded that it would be cost effective to invest in the protection of just 13 percent of the global coastline, thus safeguarding 90 percent of the global coastal floodplain population and 96 percent of assets in the global coastal floodplain. If these projections are approximately correct, addressing sea level rise will be costly, but it does not portend near-term societal collapse.\n\nOne might expect that more intense rainstorms should result in more flooding, but a 2017 study investigating maximum streamflow trends around the globe in the Journal of Hydrology found that there were more streamflow measuring \"stations with significant decreasing trends than significant increasing trends across all the datasets analysed, indicating that limited evidence exists for the hypothesis that flood hazard is increasing.\"\n\nAnother 2018 study in Water Resource Research reported that \"flood magnitudes are decreasing despite widespread claims by the climate community that if precipitation extremes increase, floods must also.\" The explanations for declining flood magnitudes include the possibility that soils now tend to be drier and so absorb more water, and that intense rainstorms\u2013while more frequent\u2013are geographically smaller, thus inundating less area. On the other hand, the Dartmouth Flood Observatory reports that the annual number of large floods increased from about 50 in the mid-1980s to around 200 in the early 2000s, and have fallen a bit since.\n\nThe opposite of flooding is drought. Is man-made global warming having an effect on the global prevalence of drought? A 2012 study in Nature concluded that \"there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.\" A 2014 study in Nature Climate Change, however, suggested that \"increased heating from global warming may not cause droughts but it is expected that when droughts occur they are likely to set in quicker and be more intense.\" A 2015 study in Earth and Space Science found that the percent of global land area subject to drought has not changed since 1901, even though global evaporation rates and temperatures have increased. The authors suggest that increased precipitation may have counteracted a global trend toward more drought.\n\nWhatever the trend in floods, droughts, and storms, the fact is that the global death rate due to natural disasters has fallen steeply over the past century, from about 24 per 100,000 annually in the 1920s to below 1 per year in the 2010s. This is remarkable considering that world population has quadrupled over that period, and it obviously cuts against Bendell's dismal prognostications that humanity will be unable to successfully adapt to climate change.\n\nFamine\n\nBendell asserts that \"we are already in the midst of dramatic changes that will impact massively and negatively on agriculture within the next twenty years.\" These impacts are supposedly already inducing the \"sense of near-term disruption to our ability to feed ourselves and our families.\" When contemplating Bendell's prophecies of imminent agricultural collapse, everyone should keep in mind that cereal and livestock production have both nearly quadrupled since 1961 even as average global temperatures have risen.\n\nIn support of his claims that global famine triggered by climate change looms, Bendell references a couple of modeling studies that condescendingly suggest that farmers will essentially do nothing to adapt to climate change. But that's not correct. For example, farmers in the U.S. and Canada are now taking advantage of the fact that the cornbelt is shifting northward due to warming temperatures.\n\nOddly, as evidence of impending famine, Bendell cites a 2015 Environmental Research Letter socioeconomic modeling study that actually finds that without climate change grain yields in 2050 would be between 65 and 55 percent higher than they were in 2005. With climate change, depending on the scenario, yields would be only be 45 to 60 percent greater. This is well within a 2017 BioScience study's projection of a global food demand increase by 2050 that ranges between 25 to 70 percent above current global production.\n\nIn any case, many researchers find that agriculture can continue to produce more food while simultaneously adapting to future climate change. For example, a 2017 policy report for the European Commission found that \"the impact of climate change on agricultural production in 2050 is negative but relatively small at the aggregated global level.\" Remarkably, that study reported that efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector by, for example, increasing the prices of fuel and fertilizer, would have a bigger negative impact on agricultural production than would climate change.\n\nOceans\n\nCoral reefs occupy less than one quarter of one percent of our oceans, but they're home to an estimated 25 percent of all marine species. Bendell correctly observes that coral bleaching due to rising average temperatures in the tropical oceans is increasing. When water temperatures get too hot, corals expel their symbiotic algae and that deprives them of nourishment. The BAMS State of the Climate 2017 report noted that mass coral bleaching has historically occurred when ocean temperatures rose during El Ni\u00f1o events in 1983, 1998, and 2010. However, an unprecedented 36-month ocean heatwave in 2014 to 2017 affected 75 percent of Earth's tropical reefs, and at nearly 30 percent of reefs, it reached mortality level. Mass bleaching used to occur once every 25\u201330 years in the 1980s, but now mass bleaching returns about every six years and is expected to further accelerate.\n\nClearly reefs are suffering from the heat, but some recent research hints that they are adapting to cope with rising temperatures. A 2019 global analysis of coral bleaching over the past two decades in Nature Communications reports that \"in the last decade, the onset of coral bleaching has occurred at significantly higher sea surface temperatures (?0.5?\u00b0C) than in the previous decade.\" The researchers suggest that individuals of various coral species that are especially liable to bleach when temperatures warm \"may have declined and/or adapted such that the remaining coral populations now have a higher thermal threshold for bleaching.\" In other words, corals appear to be evolving to withstand higher temperatures.\n\nDisease\n\n\"In some regions we are witnessing an exponential rise in the spread of mosquito and tick-borne viruses as temperatures become more conducive to them,\" writes Bendell. He cites a 2018 European Commission report evaluating the impact of climate change on the rates of viral disease chiefly spread by mosquitoes. All things being equal, the report notes that the range of two disease carrying mosquito species\u2014Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus\u2014are likely to expand as the global temperatures rise. These two especially vexatious species transmit Zika, dengue, and Chikungunya viruses. Climate change will eventually enable these species to expand their ranges, concurred a 2019 modeling study in Nature Microbiology, but \"in the next 5 to 15 years, the models predict that spread of both species will be driven by human movement, rather than environmental changes.\"\n\nWhile certainly burdensome, the mortality rates for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya are low. So even implausibly assuming that no progress at all is made in controlling these pests and the diseases they transmit, their spread does not threaten near-term human extinction.\n\nFortunately, progress is being made on vaccines for each of these (and many other) vector-borne illnesses. In addition, biotechnologists are developing techniques that can either prevent mosquitoes from carrying pathogens or eliminate the pests from the landscape altogether. Similar biotech interventions are being developed to control diseases spread by other vectors as well. As a result, the role of climate change will decreasingly figure as a factor in determining human exposure to vector-borne illnesses.\n\nApocalypse\n\nBendell acknowledges that some researchers have suggested developing geoengineering as an emergency backup plan for cooling down the planet in case global warming runs faster than current projections suggest. But he dismisses it as a potential way to ameliorate climate change because he thinks that its unpredictability will prevent its deployment. This objection will not hold if most people think that rapidly rising temperatures is about to cause global social collapse. As it happens, a 2019 Nature Climate Change study, \"Halving warming with idealized solar geoengineering moderates key climate hazards,\" by Harvard engineer Peter Irvine and colleagues, finds that spreading sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to reduce average temperatures by about half the amount temperatures would increase if atmospheric carbon doubled would not likely destabilize current weather patterns.\n\n\"It would not be unusual to feel a bit affronted, disturbed, or saddened by the information and arguments I have just shared,\" observes Bendell in his discussion of \"systems of denial.\" Such climate collapse denialism, he argues, is rooted in mixture of wishful thinking, paternalistic efforts to protect the public from despairing, and the refusal to accept our powerlessness to stop climate doom. Collapse denialism is further buttressed by the norms of scientific understatement, the natural psychological resistance to thinking about death, and the institutional positive problem-solving emphases of non-profit, private, and governmental organizations.\n\nBendell suggests that many people accept much of the data about climate change that he reports, but choose to interpret them in a way that makes them 'safer' to their personal psychologies. This, he asserts, amounts to a form of \"interpretative denial.\" On the other hand, Bendell admits he has \"chosen to interpret the information as indicating inevitable collapse, probable catastrophe and possible extinction.\" Thus it would seem that his predictions of imminent civilizational collapse are the consequence of a form of \"interpretative confirmation.\"\n\nRecall that Bendell asserts that \"the summary of science is the core of the paper as everything then flows from the conclusion of that analysis.\" If his reading of current climate science is faulty or biased, then, so too, are his arguments. My reading of the recent scientific literature finds that while man-made climate change is a significant and growing problem, it does not portend, as argued by Bendell, imminent massive social collapse and the possibility of near-term human extinction.\n\nThat being the case, I must conclude, that as well-meaning as he may be, Bendell is engaging in \"apocalypse abuse.\" Like earlier practitioners of that suspect craft, Bendell operates chiefly by extrapolating only the most horrendous trends, while systematically ignoring any ameliorating or optimistic ones, offering worst-case scenarios in the guise of balanced presentations.\n\nBendell writes that the impending end of the world has caused him to reevaluate his work choices. He muses that \"in order to let oneself evolve in response to the climate tragedy one may have to quit a job\u2014and even a career.\" Way back in 1971, overpopulation doomster Paul Ehrlich similarly told Look magazine, \"When you reach a point where you realize further efforts will be futile, you may as well look after yourself and your friends and enjoy what little time you have left. That point for me is 1972.\" Forty-eight years later, Ehrlich is still predicting an imminent ecological apocalypse and I suspect that Bendell will be doing the same thing in the year 2065.\n\nIn his paper Bendell does lamely observe, \"We do not know if the power of human ingenuity will help sufficiently to change the environmental trajectory we are on.\" Maybe not, but it's a far better bet than is his concocted case for collapse fatalism.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yJV_cM7oSqEdVQ_TaiKjQKXGmJJWly4ZDRtWa4zJ-Qc.jpg"}, {"title": "Sex trafficking victim Cyntoia Brown, sentenced to life at 16, set to be freed next week", "score": 1, "url": "https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/455785-sex-trafficking-victim-cyntoia-brown-who-was-sentenced-to-life", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "Cyntoia Brown, a 31-year-old woman who was sentenced to life in prison at 16 years old for killing a man who she said solicited her for sex, will reportedly be released from prison next week.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Brown, who has been behind bars at the Tennessee Prison for Women for the last 15 years, will be freed on Wednesday.

Holtzclaw was accused of preying on black women he encountered while on duty. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, Pool, File)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 A court on Thursday upheld the rape and sexual assault convictions and 263-year prison sentence of a former Oklahoma City police officer whose case has been watched closely by the Black Lives Matter movement and some conservatives.\n\nThe Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously rejected appeals by Daniel Holtzclaw that included a lack of evidence, excessive sentence, prosecutorial misconduct, a \u201ccircus atmosphere\u201d during his trial and a failure by the defense attorney to present an expert to offer an alternative explanation to how DNA of one victim wound up on Holtzclaw\u2019s pants.\n\nHoltzclaw\u2019s family said in a statement that it is devastated by the ruling, but not surprised. Holtzclaw\u2019s father, Eric Holtzclaw, said the family plans to file a new round of appeals in federal court, a process family members said could take more than a decade.\n\n\u201cWe will fight for Daniel until he is free,\u201d his sister, Jenny Holtzclaw, told reporters. She said her brother was convicted because of \u201cbiased claims\u201d by prosecutors and fabricated accusations by \u201cunreliable accusers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe deserves freedom. He is innocent of all charges that were brought against him,\u201d Jenny Holtzclaw said.\n\nProsecutors alleged Holtzclaw, 32, targeted black women and girls while on duty. He was convicted in 2015 on 18 charges involving seven women and one girl that occurred in 2013 and 2014. He was acquitted on similar charges involving five other women.\n\nThe DNA of one of the accusers was found on Holtzclaw\u2019s pants, but his appeals attorneys argued that could have gotten there through \u201csecondary transfer\u201d when he searched the 17-year-old\u2019s purse. Holtzclaw argued that because his DNA was not found on his own pants, the pants were not properly tested and that the presence of his DNA mixed with that of the girl would support his claim of a secondary transfer.\n\nBut the court found that Holtzclaw failed to show how such evidence would support any theory of how the girl\u2019s DNA got onto his pants.\n\nQuestions about DNA evidence were kept under seal by the court for 17 months because of personnel records that are confidential under Oklahoma law.\n\n\u201cThis case involved a sexual predator who happened to be employed, most unfortunately, as an Oklahoma City police officer,\u201d Presiding Judge David B. Lewis wrote in a specially concurring opinion to the 5-0 ruling.\n\n\u201cHe used his position of authority to intimidate and prey on vulnerable victims,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cHis arguments attacking the convictions are ... unavailing.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Jenny Holtzclaw took particular issue with Lewis\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cWe vehemently disagree with the vicious and false assertion in Judge David Lewis\u2019s concurrence that Daniel was a \u2018sexual predator\u2019 who abused his authority. It was detectives and prosecutors who abused their authority to manufacture false allegations against Daniel,\u201d she said.\n\nEric Holtzclaw became emotional while describing the impact the case has had on his son and other family members.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s innocent, that\u2019s the big thing. He is 100% adamant about it. Our family is...it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said, fighting back tears. \u201cWe\u2019re devastated, it\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nOklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, whose office prosecuted the case, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Alex Gerszewski, spokesman for state Attorney General Mike Hunter, whose office handled the appeal, declined comment, noting that the case is ongoing because Holtzclaw could appeal Thursday\u2019s decision.\n\nThe executive director of Black Lives Matter Oklahoma City, the Rev. T Sheri Dickerson, said Holtzclaw was convicted because he is guilty.\n\n\u201cI celebrated in the fact that justice continues to be served,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cThe wheels of justice turned correctly.\u201d\n\nA 2015 Associated Press investigation highlighting the case found about 1,000 officers in the U.S. lost their licenses for sexual misconduct over a six-year period \u2014 considered an undercount because some states don\u2019t have a method for banning problem officers.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/llxKxKezFyyzOiTwZs1yVMIFPovOt7XDS0jRyQ-Bbh4.jpg"}, {"title": "Former neo-Nazi removes swastika tattoos after unlikely friendship", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njXZUH5hv0w", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "Published on Sep 26, 2017\n\nColorado resident Michael Kent recently sat down at a tattoo parlor in Colorado Springs to have his swastikas covered up.

The ocean offers an abundant source of water if the salt-removal process can be made energy- and cost-efficient.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nPeople have been trying to turn seawater into drinking water for thousands of years, but the process is not usually energy-efficient or affordable.\n\nAt a newly constructed facility in Kenya, however, a nonprofit called GivePower is tackling that challenge using solar power.\n\nThe desalination system, which started operating in the coastal area of Kiunga in July 2018, can create 19,800 gallons (75,000 liters) of fresh drinking water each day \u2014 enough for 25,000 people.\n\n\"You have to find a way to pull water out of the ocean in a scalable way, in a sustainable way,\" Hayes Barnard, the president of GivePower, told Business Insider.\n\nGivePower's solar-powered water farm in Kiunga, Kenya. GivePower\n\nBarnard hopes to scale the system up and open similar facilities around the globe to provide clean, fresh water for those who struggle to get it. Worldwide, one third of people don't have access to safe drinking water, according to UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). By 2025, half the world's population is expected to live in water-stressed areas. Cities like Cape Town, South Africa; Chennai, India; and Beijing, China already face dwindling water supplies.\n\nLimited water access keeps girls out of school\n\nIn 2013, Barnard started GivePower as a nonprofit branch of SolarCity, a solar-panel company that Elon Musk helped found in 2006. SolarCity merged with Tesla in 2016, but Barnard spun GivePower off as its own organization shortly before that.\n\nThe nonprofit mostly focuses on building solar-energy systems to provide electricity across the developing world. GivePower has installed solar grids in over 2,650 locations \u2014 primarily schools, medical clinics, and villages \u2014 across 17 countries, according to its website.\n\nSchoolchildren in Kiunga, Kenya enjoy the new solar desalination device. GivePower\n\nBut regardless of whether or not a school has reliable electricity, limited access to fresh water keeps many girls out of the classroom. Women and children across Africa and Asia walk an average of 3.7 miles per day to fetch water, according to the UN Commission for Human Rights, and those treks take time and energy away from learning.\n\n\"So we thought the next thing would be to bring the water to them,\" Barnard said. \"That's where this idea came from. Could we provide the most affordable, healthy, sustainable water? And at scale?\"\n\nDesalination technology is not new, but it uses high-power pumps and is notoriously energy-intensive (and therefore expensive). The solar-microgrid system that GivePower has created, however, can produce almost 20,000 gallons of fresh drinking water each day. It relies on Tesla batteries for energy storage, and it uses two parallel pumps so that the system can run at all times, even if one pump requires maintenance.\n\nLocals pay about a quarter of one cent for every four cups (one liter) of water.\n\nThe world's looming water crisis\n\nA saltwater well in Kiunga, Kenya. GivePower\n\nAs sea levels rise, scientists expect salt water to infiltrate more fresh water sources in coastal areas. That situation isn't hypothetical in Kiunga: An ongoing drought that began in 2014 has forced residents to drink from salt water wells, even though doing so can cause kidney failure, according to GivePower.\n\nKiunga resident Mohammed Atik said in a promotional video about the GivePower project that the \"salt water from the wells are not treated,\" which is why using it can lead to health issues.\n\n\"It was a really dire situation for this community,\" Barnard said. \"Children walking around the community with wounds \u2014 lesions on their body from washing clothes in salt water.\"\n\nA woman in Kiunga washes clothes with salt water. GivePower\n\nSolar desalination around the globe\n\nAs GivePower's first project, the Kiunga facility cost $500,000 to build and took a month to construct. The organization hopes to generate $100,000 per year from the system, and use that to fund facilities in other places. Barnard's goal is to cut the construction cost down to $100,000 per plant in the future.\n\n\"We hope that one of these systems funds another additional sister system every five years,\" he said.\n\nFor now, the funding has come from corporate and private donations, along with a few corporate grants, including a $250,000 grant from Bank of America last year.\n\nGivePower's solar desalination project in Kiunga, Kenya cost about $500,000 to construct. GivePower\n\nIn the future, Barnard envisions smaller, modular-style solar desalination units that would use a single pump and a 15-kilowatt solar grid with three Tesla batteries. GivePower could combine the systems \"like Legos\" to scale up, Barnard said.\n\nHis team is already working on its next projects, in Haiti's Isle de la Gon\u00e2ve and Mombasa, Kenya. Barnard wants those facilities to be up and running by the end of the year. GivePower is also scouting a site in Colombia for a similar future project.\n\nTahmir, a child in Kiunga who developed sores from clothes washed in salt water, drinks fresh water. GivePower\n\nIn all of these places, one of GivePower's major challenges is establishing systems for distributing the fresh water that the plants create. Barnard hopes local people and organizations at each site will volunteer to distribute water, and nearby hospitals, schools, or hotels will pay to take several thousand liters each day. He also hopes some business-minded locals will buy the water and resell it in other towns.\n\n\"I want to create a system of water women, like there were milkmen in the 1960s,\" Barnard said. \"It sounds funny, but water is a women's issue.\"\n\nHe added that the desalination plant has already spurred new economic activity in Kiunga. A group of women there started a freshwater clothes-washing business, Barnard said, and one man fills a tank with the water and drives it to nearby communities to sell.\n\n\"How awesome would it be if the women could make money off this water and their daughters are sitting in the classroom?\" Barnard said.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BdPLHCNUbHhQfH3FRr9KmETzISYkYek7zrQCpguWydY.jpg"}, {"title": "Ethiopia breaks tree-planting record, planting 350 million in less than a day to tackle climate change", "score": 498, "url": "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/ethiopia-has-planted-350-million-trees-in-a-day-to-tackle-deforestation-and-its-not-stopping-there/", "comments": 43, "date": "2019-8-1", "transcript": "Ethiopia has planted more than 350 million trees in 12 hours, its government announced, claiming a world record.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, volunteers took part in the mass planting as part of the \u201cGreen Legacy\u201d initiative, a programme that aims to reforest large swathes of the land.\n\n\n\nThe efforts far surpassed an original target of planting 200 million seedlings in a day.

Climate change poses an urgent threat demanding decisive action. Communities around the world are already experiencing increased climate impacts, from droughts to floods to rising seas. The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report continues to rank these environmental threats at the top of the list. To limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C and as close as possible to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, it is essential that businesses, policy-makers, and civil society advance comprehensive near- and long-term climate actions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Global warming can be beaten thanks to this simple plan The World Economic Forum's Climate Initiative supports the scaling and acceleration of global climate action through public and private-sector collaboration. The Initiative works across several workstreams to develop and implement inclusive and ambitious solutions. This includes the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, a global network of business leaders from various industries developing cost-effective solutions to transitioning to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. CEOs use their position and influence with policy-makers and corporate partners to accelerate the transition and realize the economic benefits of delivering a safer climate.

Morgan Meyer of Dallas collaborated with the Austin-based social and dating application company to shepherd a bill earlier this year.\n\n\"They had a number of people who were using the app complaining about the sending of these images and they quickly realized there was no recourse,\" Meyer said, recalling how Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd approached him about crafting a measure. \"There was nothing that could be done. It wasn't a criminal offense - although it was definitely digital sexual harassment.\"\n\nThe law set to take effect Saturday forbids what is often characterized as technology-enabled sexual harassment. It makes electronic transmission of sexually explicit material a Class C misdemeanor with a fine of up to $500 if the person who received it hasn't given consent.\n\nMeyer said the law targeting unwanted images will apply to text messages, email, dating apps and social media.\n\nA 2017 survey by Pew Research Center found women encounter sexual harassment online at much higher rates than men. The study found 21% of women ages 18 to 29 report being sexually harassed online compared to 9% of men in the same age group. Roughly 53% of those women said someone has sent them explicit images they didn't ask for.\n\nCaroline Ellis Roche, Bumble's chief of staff, said the company plans to take the legislation to the federal level and other states in hopes of enacting it more broadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cyber Civil Rights Initiative reports that 46 states have laws tackling so-called revenge porn, but almost none combat unsolicited sexually explicit images.\n\nA handful of other states have laws criminalizing the electronic messaging of lewd content, but most of them are linked to the sender's intentions.\n\nWashington, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have laws against cyberstalking, which is defined by intent to harass, said Pam Greenberg, a senior fellow for the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The bird was photographed on Tuesday by Keith Jennings, a birdwatcher and electrician who travelled from Gloucestershire to find it.\n\nThe brown booby surprised birders by loitering around the beaches of north Cornwall for five days, fishing close to the surf at Hayle on Thursday.\n\nMark Grantham, the chair of the Cornwall Bird Watching and Preservation Society, said: \u201cThese really rare seabirds do turn up but they are quite tantalising \u2013 so often they drift by and are seen for a couple of minutes and then they are gone. The fact that this bird has hung around is going to draw a lot of people.\u201d\n\nDid this red-footed booby really fly all the way from the Galapagos to the UK? Read more\n\nHundreds of birders gathered around St Ives Bay to catch a glimpse of \u2013 and photograph \u2013 the bird, which has been attracted to bait fish found in the bay at this time of year.\n\nBut the brown booby was proving elusive on Friday, leaving many newly arrived birders disconsolate.\n\nJames Lowen, a nature writer and wildlife guide, drove 425 miles overnight with two friends to try to catch a glimpse of the bird, gathering on the dunes before dawn to train their telescopes on the sea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been seen in Britain before and rarity is always exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in the Caribbean 20 years ago but seeing it over this side of the Atlantic would be a real red-letter day.

Perhaps we\u2019ll be lucky at some point.\u201d\n\nWhile rare North American warblers blown to Britain are likely to die without ever returning home, the brown booby stands a fair chance of finding its way back across the Atlantic, according to Grantham.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is lost but it is completely in its element \u2013 it\u2019s a seabird and it\u2019s at sea. Seabirds can fish as they travel and east-west journeys are easier to manage than north-south. It is still in the right ocean and the right hemisphere so it could potentially make it back.\u201d\n\nA brown booby was spotted in Brittany, France later on Friday, with the birders in Cornwall believing it to be the same bird. \u201cTime to pack up,\u201d said Lowen on the Cornish coast.\n\nThe Cornish brown booby\u2019s status as potentially the first ever sighting in the UK may be disputed, however, because since the sighting other birdwatchers have revealed what they suspect may have been another brown booby, flying off the coast of Kent earlier in August.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/R5-af8AdHJWeJFn4mca4fjAqF8P176Za8swZICe5GsA.jpg"}, {"title": "Climate Emergency: India offers financial and technical support to developing nations", "score": 126, "url": "https://www.thestatesman.com/india/climate-emergency-india-offers-financial-and-technical-support-to-developing-nations-1502794652.html", "comments": 21, "date": "2019-9-1", "transcript": "In the run up to two key United Nation\u2019s summits on Climate Change this month, India has raised the pitch for finance and technology support to developing nations to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of keeping a global average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nUnion Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar said India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was taking decisive steps in achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which is the heart of the 2015 Paris pact.\n\n\u201cIn Chile, when we meet in the next COP (Conference of the Parties), we will be taking a stance that every country needs to follow their own commitments to reduce national emissions and advanced countries need to provide finance and technology support, that is most important to developing world, he told PTI here during his visit for a function on Friday.\n\nThe members of United Nations negotiated and adopted the Paris Agreement in which India made four commitments, including reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, under its NDC.\n\nNDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Referring to government\u2019s ambitious Clean India mission, its efforts towards eliminating single use plastic, harnessing solar and wind energy and, creating more tree cover for protection of environment, Javadekar said these will be highlighted in various UN Climate forums.\n\nA climate action summit being hosted by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will be held this month. The United Nations summit hosted by Chile will be held in December.\n\nJavadekar also declared Prime Minister\u2019s ambitious renewable energy programme to create 175 GW by 2022 \u201ca huge success and India has already reduced energy intensity by 22 per cent.\u201d His remarks are in line with the statement by the BASIC group of nations, Brazil, South Africa, India and China in which they urged developed countries to undertake ambitious actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and meet their finance commitments, including by mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020.\n\nReplying to a Calling Attention Notice on Climate Change in Parliament in June this year, Javadekar had blamed the developed countries for not keeping up to their commitment of providing $100 billion and technology transfer collectively to developing countries like India for dealing with climate change.\n\n\u201cIt is true that developed world is responsible for most of the the climate change situation today. Over 70 per cent of the green house gases emission was due to the developed countries while India\u2019s contribution is just three per cent.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will now have to set standards that actually protect forests, as the Clean Air Act requires.\n\n\u201cThe Clean Air Act requires EPA to set standards that protect forests against damage from smog. EPA didn\u2019t do that here. It must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,\u201d said Seth Johnson, the Earthjustice attorney who argued the case. \u201cUnfortunately, the Court also said the ozone rules we have are enough to protect public health, even though these standards allow levels of smog EPA agrees are harmful. But this isn\u2019t the end of the road. We\u2019ll keep fighting for this vital health protection to be as effective as it needs to be.\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s opinion is nuanced and especially important now. The ruling requires EPA to follow the science and to make the tough decisions necessary to protect forests and natural landscapes from ozone damage to plant leaves and to growing trees. The court also entirely rejected polluters\u2019 arguments that the standards provide too much protection. Agreeing with health and environmental advocates, the court ruled that \u201cthe Clean Air Act prohibits EPA\u201d from weakening public health and welfare protections based on other considerations, as polluters and their allies have been urging EPA to do.\n\nUnfortunately, the court also ruled that the health standards as they are meet the legal requirements to protect public health. Based on the most recent science, advocates believe the ozone standards are not stringent enough.\n\nMeanwhile, the American Lung Association\u2019s State of the Air 2019 report finds that ozone pollution worsened over past years, as EPA has begun its review of the smog standards. A recent study found that exposure to ambient air pollutants, including ozone, was correlated with increased risk and progression of emphysema, even among non-smokers. The Trump/Wheeler EPA is known for dismissing science to weaken public health and environmental protections, but this decision confirms that the administration cannot legally do that in its forthcoming review.\n\nWhile ozone is good as a protective layer in the stratosphere, ground-level ozone causes asthma attacks and other respiratory problems that can keep kids from school and adults from work. It can send kids and adults to the hospital, too, and is linked to premature death. It also damages plants and forests, stunting tree and crop growth. Formed by emissions from cars, trucks and factories, ozone is also a corrosive greenhouse gas. According to a recent report by the American Lung Association, more than 134.0 million people live in 197 counties that earned an F for ozone.\n\nEPA estimates that, by 2025, the current 2015 standard will save hundreds of lives, prevent 230,000 asthma attacks in children, and prevent 160,000 missed school days for kids each year. However, leading medical societies have found that an even more protective standard is needed to safeguard families, particularly children and seniors, from preventable illness.\n\nIn October 2015, following litigation by health and environmental groups for missing the legally required deadline to review the ozone standard, EPA established a slightly more protective standard further limiting the amount of smog allowed in the air people breathe. The standard was strengthened from 75 parts per billion (ppb), established by the Bush administration, to 70 ppb.\n\nQuotes from our clients:\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone\u2019s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,\u201d said Harold P. Wimmer, National President and CEO of the American Lung Association. \u201cSuch evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s court decision is a win for the future of our national parks and the millions of people who visit these treasured places every year,\u201d said Stephanie Kodish, Clean Air Program Director for the National Parks Conservation Association. \u201cNow, EPA must revisit the welfare standard to better protect our parks and their plants from air pollution like the 37 ozone-sensitive species of trees and plants at Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the iconic Quaking Aspen tree at Rocky Mountain National Park. We commend the court for holding EPA accountable to its mission to protect the environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision for EPA to revisit the secondary ozone standard is welcome. Secondary standards require the EPA to protect the public welfare, which includes maintaining healthy forests and the ecosystem services they provide,\u201d said Georgia Murray, staff scientist for the Appalachian Mountain Club. \u201cOzone pollution can cause substantial damage to trees and plants, stunting their growth, making them much more susceptible to disease and drought, and causing yellowing or mottled leaves. We need to address the specific impacts of ozone pollution on trees and plants to truly protect the outdoor environments where we go to hike and seek refuge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Clean Air Act requires EPA to protect the public from dirty, dangerous air pollution, and today\u2019s decision unfortunately gave the Agency a pass,\u201d said Josh Berman, Senior Attorney at the Sierra Club. \u201cMillions of Americans will have to wait for cleaner air as a result. We are pleased that the court at least has finally required EPA to give effect to the public welfare standard, which requires the Agency to afford protection for the trees and plants we depend on. We now urge the EPA to head back to the drawing board and create a smog pollution standard that is truly protective of public health and that lives up to the letter and spirit of the Clean Air Act.\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s decision results from a suit brought by Earthjustice on behalf of the Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, National Parks Conservation Association, Appalachian Mountain Club, and WE ACT for Environmental Justice. In the case decided today, Earthjustice also represented the American Lung Association and the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jzJlSPlFGf_0uOqaVWoHPti2xZDe6i2XhKpmhk-_KYk.jpg"}, {"title": "An indigenous farming technique that\u2019s been around for thousands of years provides the basis for restoring rain forests stripped clear of trees by gold mining and other threats, using biochar, a cheap and effective way to support tree seedling survival during reforestation efforts in the Amazon.", "score": 108, "url": "https://news.wfu.edu/2019/08/29/biochar-a-better-start-to-rain-forest-restoration/", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-9-1", "transcript": "An indigenous farming technique that\u2019s been around for thousands of years provides the basis for restoring rain forests stripped clear of trees by gold mining and other threats.\n\nA carbon-based soil amendment called biochar is a cheap and effective way to support tree seedling survival during reforestation efforts in the Amazon rain forest, according to new research from Wake Forest University\u2019s Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (CINCIA).\n\nAbout Cincia Wake Forest founded CINCIA in 2016 through its Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainability (CEES) with an initial award by USAID and an international consortium of donors and partners that included the World Wildlife Fund-Peru, ESRI, the Amazon Aid Foundation, and the Peruvian Amazon Research Institute (IIAP), the research arm of the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment. Using scientific collaborations and educational programs, CINCIA aims to build the ability to understand and address the environmental threats to the region and the people who live there, and to help develop a new generation of Peruvian scientists who will carry on the research needed to understand opportunities and threats and implement sustainable solutions. CINCIA\u2019s science also offers a long-term pathway to restoring the global benefits of one of the world\u2019s most biodiverse ecosystems currently in peril as a result of climate change and deforestation.\n\nRestoring and recovering rain forests has become increasingly important for combatting climate change, since these wide swaths of trees can absorb billions of tons of carbon dioxide each year. The problem is particularly acute in areas mined for alluvial gold deposits, which devastate not only rain forest trees but also soils. High costs can be a huge barrier to replanting, fertilizing and nurturing trees to replace those lost in the rain forest.\n\nThe scientists found that using biochar combined with fertilizer significantly improved height and diameter growth of tree seedlings while also increasing the number of leaves the seedlings developed. The experiment, based in a Peruvian Amazon region called Madre de Dios, the heart of illegal gold mining trade in that country, used two tropical tree species: the fast-growing Guazuma crinita and Terminalia amazonia, a late successional tree often used as timber.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult period in a tree seedling\u2019s life is the first few months after transplanting,\u201d said Miles Silman, CINCIA associate director of science and Wake Forest\u2019s Andrew Sabin Presidential Chair of Conservation Biology.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/V6WjIuwKNhBXzWspd6Od6ht-wcU1vRBYOC62Cveq7vo.jpg"}, {"title": "Kindness is needed and appreciated even when you are not looking.", "score": 27, "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/gma/missouri-officer-searching-teen-witnessing-incredible-act-kindness-083318630--abc-news-topstories.html", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-9-1", "transcript": "Missouri officer searching for teen after witnessing his incredible act of kindness originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n\nPolice in Missouri are searching for a teenage boy who was seen by an officer performing an incredible act of kindness -- helping shield an elderly woman from the driving rain.\n\nOfficer Joe Holt of the Independence Police Department took to social media last week in hopes of finding the teen in question so he can reward him for his generosity.\n\nHolt was sitting in his vehicle during a rainstorm when he saw the boy leave the back seat of a vehicle in and approach an elderly white female who was making her way back to her car.\n\nThe boy removed his coat and held it over the woman to protect her as she made her way through the parking lot.\n\n(MORE: Good Samaritans flip overturned truck on busy Illinois highway to rescue driver, video shows)\n\n\"This young black male (teen) exited the backseat of a van he was in while it was pouring rain took his coat off and protected this elderly white female from the environment the best he could all the way to her car.

And they see it coming sooner rather than later.\n\nThe husband-and-wife team operates a company called Morphogenesis, which focuses on gene and cell therapy research and development. Together they developed a \"cancer vaccine,\" which is undergoing clinical trials at Tampa's Moffitt Cancer Center and soon at other locations across the country.\n\nThe vaccine, called ImmuneFx, helps train the immune system to identify and destroy cancerous tumor cells. To do that, it forces those cells to come out of hiding.\n\nCancer cells mutate and change so fast, it can be difficult for the immune system to spot them, Patricia Lawman, 65, said. So the vaccine uses cell and gene therapy to force those cells to express a specific bacterial antigen on their surface, making them easy for the immune system to identify.\n\nRELATED STORY: At Tampa General Hospital, 3-D printers are removing guesswork for doctors and patients\n\nThis way, a patient's immune system can fight off cancer cells on its own, without the help of radiation, chemotherapy or other treatments \u2014 and without the harmful side effects that come with them.\n\n\"When we think of vaccines, we think of the preventative ones we get, like the flu shot, which works in a way to prevent us from getting sick,\" Lawman said. \"What we've developed is a therapeutic vaccine.\"\n\nImmunotherapy is a broad term to describe a growing and game-changing cancer treatment that uses the immune system to fight infections and diseases. Moffitt and Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital administer a version of it called Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapy to patients suffering from leukemia, lymphoma and certain other blood or bone cancers. Known as CAR-T cell therapy, it uses white blood cells from the patient's immune system and re-engineers them in a lab to target and wipe out cancer cells.\n\n\"CAR-T requires work in a lab, and doesn't necessary catch every cancer cell,\" Lawman said. \"They target as many as possible, but they program which cells to go after.\"\n\nIn contrast, she said, \"the vaccine forces every tumor cell to present the same protein, which is visible to the immune system.\"\n\nAfter years of lab work, Morphogenesis began testing the vaccine on companion animals with veterinary partners. About 430 cats, dogs and horses diagnosed with naturally occurring cancers were given the vaccine and tracked over time.\n\nThe results showed it was safe. And during a study performed on horses, 77 percent of them showed a significant reduction in tumors.\n\nImmuneFx now is being tested in clinical trials on humans with cutaneous melanoma, one of the most common types of skin cancer. But Lawman said she's confident the vaccine could be used in the future to treat a variety of cancers that present tumors, if not all of them.\n\n\"We think the body can do everything better than we can come up with,\" Lawman said. \"So we try not to mess with it.\"\n\nMorphogenesis began in 1995 after the Lawmans left the Walt Disney Memorial Cancer Institute to launch their start-up in a business incubator program at the University of Florida.

And they see it coming sooner rather than later.\n\nThe husband-and-wife team operates a company called Morphogenesis, which focuses on gene and cell therapy research and development. Together they developed a \"cancer vaccine,\" which is undergoing clinical trials at Tampa's Moffitt Cancer Center and soon at other locations across the country.\n\nThe vaccine, called ImmuneFx, helps train the immune system to identify and destroy cancerous tumor cells. To do that, it forces those cells to come out of hiding.\n\nCancer cells mutate and change so fast, it can be difficult for the immune system to spot them, Patricia Lawman, 65, said. So the vaccine uses cell and gene therapy to force those cells to express a specific bacterial antigen on their surface, making them easy for the immune system to identify.\n\nRELATED STORY: At Tampa General Hospital, 3-D printers are removing guesswork for doctors and patients\n\nThis way, a patient's immune system can fight off cancer cells on its own, without the help of radiation, chemotherapy or other treatments \u2014 and without the harmful side effects that come with them.\n\n\"When we think of vaccines, we think of the preventative ones we get, like the flu shot, which works in a way to prevent us from getting sick,\" Lawman said. \"What we've developed is a therapeutic vaccine.\"\n\nImmunotherapy is a broad term to describe a growing and game-changing cancer treatment that uses the immune system to fight infections and diseases. Moffitt and Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital administer a version of it called Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapy to patients suffering from leukemia, lymphoma and certain other blood or bone cancers. Known as CAR-T cell therapy, it uses white blood cells from the patient's immune system and re-engineers them in a lab to target and wipe out cancer cells.\n\n\"CAR-T requires work in a lab, and doesn't necessary catch every cancer cell,\" Lawman said. \"They target as many as possible, but they program which cells to go after.\"\n\nIn contrast, she said, \"the vaccine forces every tumor cell to present the same protein, which is visible to the immune system.\"\n\nAfter years of lab work, Morphogenesis began testing the vaccine on companion animals with veterinary partners. About 430 cats, dogs and horses diagnosed with naturally occurring cancers were given the vaccine and tracked over time.\n\nThe results showed it was safe. And during a study performed on horses, 77 percent of them showed a significant reduction in tumors.\n\nImmuneFx now is being tested in clinical trials on humans with cutaneous melanoma, one of the most common types of skin cancer. But Lawman said she's confident the vaccine could be used in the future to treat a variety of cancers that present tumors, if not all of them.\n\n\"We think the body can do everything better than we can come up with,\" Lawman said. \"So we try not to mess with it.\"\n\nMorphogenesis began in 1995 after the Lawmans left the Walt Disney Memorial Cancer Institute to launch their start-up in a business incubator program at the University of Florida.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) This Labor Day weekend, thousands of Muslim Americans descended on Houston, Texas, for the annual three-day Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) convention. This year's ISNACON featured many well-known figures, such as Trevor Noah, who shared his story of growing up in South Africa and joked about the ups and downs of \"The Daily Show.\"\n\nNoah wasn't the only draw. Well-known Muslim Americans, including Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Women's March organizer Linda Sarsour, spoke to large crowds. The most popular person, however, was a 77-year-old Jewish man born and bred in Brooklyn. I'm speaking of 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, of course. While Noah, Tlaib and Sarsour attracted the attention of many, Sanders packed the venue that held nearly 7,000 -- receiving several standing ovations.\n\nDean Obeidallah\n\nFellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro also spoke. This was part of ISNA's first ever presidential forum, as the Muslim community strives to engage in politics on all levels. Castro, a Catholic, received a great reception from the audience, especially when he declared , \"Muslim Americans for generations have been part of the fabric of our American family. They have helped make America the great nation it is, and we need to fully embrace it.\"\n\nBut the night truly belonged to Sanders, or \"Uncle Bernie,\" as many Muslims affectionately refer to the junior senator from Vermont. And the reason for that is simple: Sanders has worked hard to earn the support of the Muslim community. It began during the 2016 presidential primary when he was running against Hillary Clinton. Many in the Muslim community were wary of Clinton, given her support of the Iraq War. Sanders opposed the war -- a fact of which he reminded the audience on Saturday, earning him loud applause.\n\nAnd, during the 2016 campaign, Sanders was very passionate in standing up for our community and opposing then-candidate Donald Trump's hateful lies about Muslims. For example, in December 2015, when Trump repeated the debunked tale that Muslims in New Jersey had cheered the 9/11 attack, Sanders slammed Trump as a \"pathological liar.\"\n\nRead More", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ipve4tGcD1lc8RsZaJtKZmz7tm_rx3v-JqVeLEZWU4k.jpg"}, {"title": "World War Two veteran breaks own scuba diving record at 96", "score": 67, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyprus-diving-record/world-war-two-veteran-breaks-own-scuba-diving-record-at-96-idUSKCN1VL0I1", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-9-1", "transcript": "LARNACA, Cyprus (Reuters) - A 96-year-old celebrated his birthday on Saturday by breaking his own record as the world\u2019s oldest active scuba diver for the third year running, plunging to the depths of the equivalent of a 15-storey building to explore a shipwreck off Cyprus.\n\nWorld War Two veteran Ray Woolley, who turned 96 on Aug. 28, plunged to a depth of 42.4 meters for 48 minutes, the event organizers said.

Let\u2019s face it, as we grow older we need them more than ever. Yes, we love our spouses and family, but there\u2019s something about a girlfriend that helps us see life differently. They open us up and change us for the better. Here are 8 kinds of friends I\u2019m blessed to have\u2026\n\nOld friends \u2013 We sat beside each other in college Shakespeare. We went for drinks after work in our twenties. We\u2019ve seen each other through weddings, baby showers, teaching teenagers to drive, and bad hair days. We\u2019ve watched each other grow. We treat each other gently. We know our friendship is precious. We also know we\u2019re in this for the long haul. We look forward to grandchildren and senior discounts. Having them in my life has been a gift.\n\nNew friends \u2013 Just when I think I\u2019ve made all the pals I\u2019m going to make, someone else comes along. Maybe it\u2019s on Facebook or the local coffee house. We discover that we\u2019ve each read Anais Nin\u2019s diaries. We\u2019re both moved by great art and annoyed at certain politicians. There\u2019s something nice about finding a new friend later in life. They make me realize there\u2019s no expiration date on meeting great people.\n\nFunny friends \u2013 I can\u2019t help it. They crack me up. If we were schoolgirls together, we\u2019d always be in the Principal\u2019s office. They swear like sailors and never hesitate to speak their mind. They love theme parties, inventing new vegetable dips, and Seth Rogen movies. They wear bright-colored lipstick and faux fur coats. They\u2019re always sending out crazy videos, usually involving cats. They bring out something young and rebellious and fun. They teach me not to take life, or myself, too seriously.\n\nGlamorous friends \u2013 Females aren\u2019t sexy past a certain age? Sorry, these women didn\u2019t get the memo. They still wear stilettos and perfume and form-fitting dresses. They love to flirt. They purr around handsome men. And yes, they still carry it off. They enjoy being a girl. And men respond to their fun, feminine charm. They inspire me to not hang up my party dress quite so fast. Don\u2019t believe what we\u2019re told by the media. There\u2019s still life past forty\u2026and fifty\u2026and sixty\u2026\n\nSmart friends \u2013 I have friends who know everything. They know the best hotel in Taos. They know who to call for septic issues. They know the newest sushi restaurant in Cleveland. They know how to get an ink stain out of white furniture. They know the fastest subway to take if you need to get to Brooklyn. They\u2019re practical and savvy. I think I know a lot till I\u2019m with them and realize I don\u2019t know anything. I love basking in their encyclopedic smarts.\n\nAdventurous friends \u2013 Ice fishing in Minnesota? Hiking Machu Picchu? Sky diving? Where\u2019s the sign-up sheet? I have friends who will do anything\u2026 and I mean anything. They\u2019re brave and intrepid. They love life and live it fully. They don\u2019t care if they\u2019re older or female or scared. They answer\u2019s yes, what\u2019s the question? They teach me life doesn\u2019t have to have boundaries. We\u2019re only limited by imagination and confidence. They inspire me.\n\nBrave friends \u2013 They\u2019ve had a bad medical scare or terrible loss. They\u2019ve shown what it\u2019s like to pick up the pieces and go on. They still laugh and are kind. They\u2019ve taught me happiness takes courage and is a choice. They\u2019ve taught me that despite crushing challenges, life goes on. Its possible to find not only purpose, but joy. They\u2019ve taught me to live in the moment and cherish what I have. They\u2019ve shown what its like to meet heartache with dignity and grace.\n\nWise friends \u2013 They always have a nose in a book. They\u2019re thoughtful and gentle. They\u2019re quiet and introverted. They speak softly, but see everything. They\u2019re the ones sitting in the corner who observe. Because they\u2019re great seers, they\u2019re full of insight and perception. They can sense things coming and are usually right. If I have something sad or emotional to work out, I go to them.\n\nYes, I\u2019m blessed with wonderful friends. And many fall into several (if not all) of these buckets. Whatever the case, I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019d be without them. You know who you are. Thank you for making my life richer.\n\nHow do you feel about your girlfriends?

The food and other items will be distributed to people in need in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire by the Trussell Trust.\n\nDiana Walton, the head of shows at the Three Counties Showground, said: \u201cThe response to our giant harvest festival collection has been incredible.

But during the last year across our network we\u2019ve seen a 19% increase in food bank use \u2013 that\u2019s 1.6m emergency food supplies to people in crisis. More than a third of these went to children. We\u2019re working towards a future where no one needs a food bank, but until we reach that point, donations from the public are vital.\u201d\n\nMark Harwood-Browne, a project manager in education, was among the visitors who came along with a bag full of toiletries.

In their latest study, the researchers showed for the first time where in the world new trees could grow and how much carbon they would store.\n\nStudy lead author and postdoc at the Crowther Lab Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bastin explains: \u201cOne aspect was of particular importance to us as we did the calculations: we excluded cities or agricultural areas from the total restoration potential as these areas are needed for human life.\u201d\n\nLOOK: Rooftop Panels of Tiny Plants Can Cleanse Polluted Air at 100 Times the Rate of a Single Tree\n\nThe researchers calculated that under the current climate conditions, Earth\u2019s land could support 4.4 billion hectares of continuous tree cover. That is 1.6 billion more than the currently existing 2.8 billion hectares. Of these 1.6 billion hectares, 0.9 billion hectares fulfill the criterion of not being used by humans. This means that there is currently an area of the size of the US available for tree restoration. Once mature, these new forests could store 205 billion tonnes of carbon: about two thirds of the 300 billion tonnes of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nAccording to Prof. Thomas Crowther, co-author of the study and founder of the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich: \u201cWe all knew that restoring forests could play a part in tackling climate change, but we didn\u2019t really know how big the impact would be. Our study shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today. But we must act quickly, as new forests will take decades to mature and achieve their full potential as a source of natural carbon storage.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Tree-Planting Drones Have Successfully Planted Thousands of Saplings \u2013 and They\u2019re About to Plant More\n\nThe study also shows which parts of the world are most suited to forest restoration. The greatest potential can be found in just six countries: Russia (151 million hectares); the US (103 million hectares); Canada (78.4 million hectares); Australia (58 million hectares); Brazil (49.7 million hectares); and China (40.2 million hectares).\n\nMany current climate models are wrong in expecting climate change to increase global tree cover, the study warns. It finds that there is likely to be an increase in the area of northern boreal forests in regions such as Siberia, but tree cover there averages only 30 to 40%. These gains would be outweighed by the losses suffered in dense tropical forests, which typically have 90 to 100% percent tree cover.\n\nCHECK OUT: NASA Happily Reports the Earth is Greener, With More Trees Than 20 Years Ago\u2013and It\u2019s Thanks to China, India\n\nA tool on the Crowther Lab website enables users to look at any point on the globe, and find out how many trees could grow there and how much gamset carbon they would store. It also offers lists of forest restoration organizations. The Crowther Lab will also be present at this year\u2019s Scientifica (website available in German only) to show the new tool to visitors.\n\nThe Crowther Lab uses nature as a solution to: 1) better allocate resources \u2013 identifying those regions which, if restored appropriately, could have the biggest climate impact; 2) set realistic goals \u2013 with measurable targets to maximize the impact of restoration projects; and 3) monitor progress \u2013 to evaluate whether targets are being achieved over time, and take corrective action if necessary.\n\nReprinted from ETH Z\u00fcrich\n\nPlant Some Positivity With Your Friends By Sharing The News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Engineer makes growable ice towers to fight the drought in the himalayans", "score": 1, "url": "https://gfycat.com/realisticmemorableambushbug", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-10-1", "transcript": "No ads, always HD experience with Gfycat Pro.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/reKlC5HnyEWiPEt1DLsa-l6kmdUJnsEvdZrRjfufnLI.jpg"}, {"title": "This man converted an old ambulance into the home of his dreams", "score": 14, "url": "https://www.wouldsayso.com/man-converted-old-ambulance-home-dreams/", "comments": 2, "date": "2019-10-1", "transcript": "The concept of the American Dream is noble, but it feels a little outdated in the 21st Century.

Buying a rickety old van at a knockdown price.\n\n[pn_btn][/pn_btn]\n\nMichael purchased the van with the intention of living within it, traveling around the USA. This lifestyle may not be for everybody, but it suited Michael down to the ground. Any cent he earned through work went straight into his pocket. Living free of a mortgage or rent commitments guaranteed freedom that many would envy.\n\nEverybody enjoys the idea of getting on the property ladder and eventually upsizing. Despite his unconventional living arrangements, Michael was no exception. After living in the van for a while, he started to dream of bigger, better things.\n\nMichael dedicated several months to work on his existing van, getting it up to snuff for sale. He managed to agree on a fair price for these efforts and parted company with his first home. There were no real estate agents involved in Michael\u2019s next move, though. Instead, he simply turned to Craig\u2019s List and purchased a larger vehicle.\n\nA man, a van and a plan\n\nThe van in question was formerly a small-town ambulance, though it had long been retired from paramedic duties. The van had most recently been used to transport astroturf. All the same, the vehicle\u2019s former life as an ambulance came with certain perks. It contained storage cabinets, a sink, a refrigerator, power points and space for a bed. This set Michael\u2019s mind whirring.\n\nAs an illustrator by trade, Michael was a visionary. Where most people look at an aging van and see an asset that is steadily declining in liquid value, he saw an opportunity. Michael was determined to turn this van into his dream tiny home.\n\nOnce again, Michael got to work. There are certain drawbacks to living in a former ambulance \u2013 including the fact that your home is covered with bloodstains. Michael needed to undergo a fevered period of DIY and cleaning. The results, however, were staggering.\n\nApplying wood finishes to the van created a warm and cozy aesthetic.\n\nA coat of paint on the exterior also changed the appearance completely. Calling on the help of a mechanic ensured that the van was roadworthy and safe to drive.\n\nFrom bright idea to a business opportunity\n\nIt took Michael just over a month to turn his van into a genuine home. This was while working full-time, too. He is convinced that, if he dedicates himself to a similar project in the future, he\u2019ll be able to turn it around even sooner. It seems that he also has an apprentice in tow.\n\nIt appears that illustration background dovetails neatly with interior design. Michael is hoping that he can convince others to take the plunge, and purchase old vans for conversion into homes.\n\nIf they do so, Michael is ready, willing, and able to take on the job of these renovations.

That decision is unaffected by whether or not the information stored or accessed on the user\u2019s equipment is personal data. EU law aims to protect the user from any interference with his or her private life, in particular, from the risk that hidden identifiers and other similar devices enter those users\u2019 terminal equipment without their knowledge. The Court notes that consent must be specific so that the fact that a user selects the button to participate in a promotional lottery is not sufficient for it to be concluded that the user validly gave his or her consent to the storage of cookies. Furthermore, according to the Court, the information that the service provider must give to a user includes the duration of the operation of cookies and whether or not third parties may have access to those cookies.\n\nSo, to sum up, pre-checked consent boxes (or cookie banners that tell you a cookie has already been dropped and pointlessly invite you to click \u2018ok\u2019) aren\u2019t valid under EU law.\n\nFurthermore cookie consent can\u2019t be bundled with another purpose (in the Planet49 case the promotional lottery) \u2014 at least if that fuzzy signal is being used to stand for consent.\n\nThere\u2019s also an interesting new requirement which looks set to shrink the ability of service operators to obfuscate how persistently they\u2019re tracking Internet users.\n\nFor consent to cookies to be legally valid the court now says the user must be provided with some specific information on the tracking, namely: How long the cookie will operate, and who their data will be shared with. So, er, awkward\u2026\n\nThe most interesting thing is how the Court justifies that info on cookie duration/those who can access should be provided. ePrivacy refers to data protection law on the information provided, but as ePrivacy is not always about personal data, the info reqs in DP don't always fit \u2014 Michael Veale (@mikarv) October 1, 2019\n\nWhat's more interesting: sites must inform about the duration of cookie validity. This is interesting insight, and was not generally followed. Should be identical to 'Expires' or 'Max-Age' setting when cookies are set. Does it also apply to SameSite configuration? #GDPR #ePrivacy pic.twitter.com/f55AtbqArb \u2014 Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cExtending information requirement to include cookie configuration details is an interesting twist that will provide more information to users,\u201d Dr. Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity advisor and research associate at the Center for Technology and Global Affairs at Oxford University, told us.\n\n\u201cSites will need to be wary to be sure that the user-facing text matches the actually used values of max-age or expires attributes. It is also interesting to wonder if sites will want to provide similar information about other cookie attributes.\u201d\n\nSafe to say, there will be some long faces in the ad industry today.\n\n\u201cThe Court has made clear that consent should always be manifested in an active manner, and may not be presumed. Therefore, online operators should ensure that they do not collect consent by asking users to unclick a pre-formulated declaration of consent,\u201d said Luca Tosoni, a research fellow in computers and law at the University of Oslo, also commenting on the court ruling.\n\nePrivacy reform\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported before very many sites and services in Europe have, at best, been playing lip-service to EU cookie consent requirements \u2014 despite the advent of tighter rules coming into force last year under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which says that consent must be specific, informed and freely given to be a valid legal basis. And despite \u2014 more recently \u2014 further guidance from DPAs clarifying the rules around cookie consent.\n\nSo the CJEU ruling should lift a fair few heads out of the sand.\n\n\u201cBefore the entry into force of the GDPR, the conditions for consent were interpreted differently across Europe. Today\u2019s judgment is important as it brings some clarity on what should be considered valid consent under EU data protection law,\u201d Tosoni also told us, saying he expects the ruling to result in changes to many cookie notifications.\n\n\u201cNational courts and data protection authorities across the EU will need to follow the Court\u2019s interpretation when assessing whether controllers have validly obtained consent. In turn, this should lead to more harmonization in enforcement across Europe, in particular with regard to cookie notices. Thus, I would expect many operators to change their non-compliant consents to conform with the ruling.\u201d\n\nEU law on cookie consent dates back much earlier than the GDPR \u2014 to the prior Data Protection Directive and the still in force ePrivacy Directive \u2014 Article 5(3) of which specifies that for cookies to be used users must give opt-in consent after being provided with clear and comprehensive information (with only a limited exception for \u2018strictly necessary\u2019 cookies).\n\nAlthough European legislators have been trying for years to agree on an update to the ePrivacy Directive.\n\nA draft proposal for an ePrivacy Regulation was introduced by the Commission at the start of 2017. But negotiations have been anything but smooth \u2014 with a blitz of lobbying from the adtech and telecoms industries pushing against a firm requirement for opt-in consent to tracking.\n\nThe CJEU\u2019s clarity that consent is required to store and access cookies pushes in the opposite direction. And that firm legal line protecting individual privacy from background tracking technologies should be harder for legislators to ignore.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is likely to have a significant impact on the ongoing negotiations on the ePrivacy Regulation which is set to regulate cookie usage, an issue on which European legislators are struggling to find an agreement,\u201d Tosoni said, adding: \u201cIn the past, the Court\u2019s rulings have had an important impact on the development of the GDPR.\u201d\n\nIn the meanwhile, the judgement should at least force some of the more cynical and/or stupid cookie banners to be quietly replaced with something that at least asks for consent.\n\nCookie walls\n\nThat said, the ruling does not resolve all the problems around cookie consent.\n\nSpecifically the court has not waded into the contentious forced consent/cookie wall issue. This is where a site requires consent to advertising cookies as the \u2018price\u2019 for accessing the sought for service, with the only other option being to leave.\n\nEarlier this year the Dutch DPA deemed cookie walls to be illegal. But the agency\u2019s interpretation is open to legal challenge. Only the CJEU can have the final word.\n\nIn the Planet49 case the court sidestepped the issue \u2014 saying the referring court did not ask it to rule on the question of \u201cwhether it is compatible with the requirement that consent be \u2018freely given\u2019, within the meaning of Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 and of Article 4(11) and Article 7(4) of Regulation 2016/679, for a user\u2019s consent to the processing of his personal data for advertising purposes to be a prerequisite to that user\u2019s participation in a promotional lottery, as appears to be the case in the main proceedings\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn those circumstances, it is not appropriate for the Court to consider that question,\u201d it wrote.\n\nLikely it\u2019s doing so because another case is already set to consider that question. Tosoni says he expects the Orange Romania case \u2014 which is pending before the court \u2014 to further clarify the requirements of valid consent in the context of it being \u2018freely given\u2019.\n\n\u201cSome uncertainty on the requirements of valid consent remains. Indeed, in today\u2019s judgment, the Court has primarily clarified what constitutes unambiguous and specific consent, but the Court has, for example, not clarified what degree of autonomy a data subject should enjoy when choosing whether or not to give consent for the latter to be considered \u201cfreely given\u201d,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s judgment does not provide an answer on the legality of cookie walls, which require consent to access the underlying service. The Court found that it was unable to address this point, as the referring German court had not asked the ECJ to assess the legality of making participation in a lottery \u2014 the service at issue in the case \u2014 subject to giving advertising cookie consent. Further clarity on this issue may come from the Orange Romania case, which is currently pending before the ECJ.\u201d\n\nIAB Europe response\n\nResponding to the ruling the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe\u2019s CEO Townsend Feehan told us: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the court are taking the view that the ePrivacy Directive provision appear to require users to be told how long a cookie will be functioning. That\u2019s something that\u2019s qualitatively a little bit new.\u201d\n\nShe also agreed the CJEU ruling will likely require some changes to some existing cookie consent notices, saying: \u201cIf now the court is taking the view that users have to have precise information about the persistence of a cookie that would definitely require changes to UIs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that you couldn\u2019t have preticked boxes/don\u2019t constitute active consent is not really a surprise to anyone, and the idea that the ePrivacy Directive requirement applies to non-personal data as well as personal data is also not surprising,\u201d she also said, further claiming the IAB\u2019s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) discourages the use of pre-ticked boxes.\n\nThe TCF was introduced last year by the ad industry standards body, ahead of GDPR, when the IAB made a big push to encourage publishers to use its framework to gather consents for processing visitors\u2019 personal data in Europe.\n\nHowever there are examples of this TCF including pre-ticked consents \u2014 such as in a widely used implementation developed by Quantcast. An adtech veteran whose business is, as it happens, currently under investigation by Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (which is looking into whether its processing and aggregating of personal data to profile Internet users for ad targeting is in compliance with the GDPR).\n\nAsked whether the IAB will be advising its members to make changes to how they gather consents in light of the CJEU ruling, Feehan said: \u201cThe recommendation until now has just been to comply with Article 13; the disclosure requirements in the GDPR. Now that the court has taken a different view from the letter of the law that is something indeed we could make a recommendation. We have a working group that needs to look at whether the policies ought to be amended in light of the ruling \u2014 and so that process will play out in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nShe also said the IAB\u2019s wider position on the ePrivacy Regulation remains unchanged for now \u2014 which is to say it doesn\u2019t believe updated tracking rules are necessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this ruling will affect our general approach or position on the proposed ePrivacy Regulation,\u201d she said. \u201cOur view on ePrivacy Regulation is basically that it\u2019s probably not necessary. That all one needs is the GDPR. If you look at the substantive scope of the ePrivacy Regulation in relation to the cookie provisions\u2026 they\u2019re completely redundant with what was adopted in the GDPR.\u201d\n\nAsked to respond to wider criticism of the adtech industry\u2019s business model being based on consent-less tracking of Internet users Feehan rejected the critique as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d, adding there\u2019s nothing in the CJEU judgement to support such a view.\n\nToday's decision of the EU Court of Justice in the case #Planet49 is a message to the #adtech industry: your business model based on unlawful profiling, forced tracking and unconsented targeted ads is not valid under EU law #ePrivacy https://t.co/BDgRpB0hK2 \u2014 Access Now (@accessnow) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cThe judgement doesn\u2019t tell us anything new about the content of the law. The advertising industry needs to obey the law, the overwhelming majority of players in the digital advertising industry obey the law. And this ruling doesn\u2019t tell us anything new as far as I\u2019m concerned about the law\u2026 It does introduce this perhaps more precise requirement with respect to the obligation to disclose the duration of persistence of cookies. But I don\u2019t understand on what basis anyone would read today\u2019s ruling and decide that based on that reading one discovers that the business model is illegal. I don\u2019t understand the logic of that.\u201d\n\nThis report was updated with comment from the IAB Europe", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Brand new startup book company Creates books to challenge, empower, And Begin important conversations", "score": 0, "url": "https://akidsbookabout.com/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-10-1", "transcript": "Love this book!\n\nI love how this book explain in a very simple, kid appropriate way but also leaves things open for discussions.

Earlier this month, the national regulator for biomedical research recommended fast-tracking investments in technologies that can replace animals. Some Indian scientists have welcomed the plan, but they say that alternatives for drug toxicity and efficacy tests are not yet sufficient to replace animals.\n\nThey also note that a move towards alternative technologies will require a substantial and costly overhaul of the drug-approval process in India, which currently requires medicines to be tested in rodents and primates or dogs before people.\n\nEmerging technologies that model complex human physiology \u2014 such as organoids and organs-on-a-chip, which are laboratory-grown versions of human tissues \u2014 are starting to rival, and in some cases outperform, animals in their ability to model human disease, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\n\nIn a discussion paper published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research1, a team representing the ICMR that includes Soumya Swaminathan, the council\u2019s former director-general and now deputy director-general at the World Health Organization, argue that such technologies, and others including computer models that simulate drug toxicity, are more cost-effective and humane than animal testing. They therefore call for the government to establish centres of excellence for developing such approaches, and to increase funding and international collaborations for alternative technologies.\n\nThe United Kingdom and the United States have national road maps for developing non-animal technologies, and in September the US Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to limit the use of animals in toxicity tests. Denmark, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, China and Korea also have research programmes for developing alternative technologies.\n\nBut only a small number of scientists work on such technologies in India. An ICMR committee formed of independent scientists, ICMR representatives and members of animal-rights groups is now considering a road map for multidisciplinary research into alternative technologies.\n\nAnimal models falter\n\nThe paper notes that after two decades of drug-discovery research using animals, India has not developed a single novel drug that has made it to market. This is probably in part because molecules that were safe and efficacious in animals were later found to be toxic or ineffective in humans, says Swaminathan.\n\nSome researchers think there are alternative technologies that are good enough to switch away from animal testing, at least for researching toxicity. \u201cThe value of animal testing is strongly overestimated,\u201d says Thomas Hartung, director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Hartung has developed an algorithm as an alternative to animal testing that has successfully predicted the toxicity of tens of thousands of chemicals in human tissue \u2014 and in some cases has outperformed animal tests in terms of reliability. \u201cWhenever an animal test has been systematically evaluated, the outcome was astonishingly poor,\u201d he says.\n\nTechnologies aren\u2019t ready\n\nBut Addicam Jagannadha Rao, an emeritus biochemist at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, says that studying disease or toxicity in a dish or using organs on a chip does not show how drugs are metabolized in the whole body. \u201cI am for the judicious use of animals,\u201d says Rao.\n\nAmit Misra, a pharmacokinetics researcher at the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India, acknowledges that animal toxicity studies do not always translate well in humans. But he doesn\u2019t think organs-on-a-chip or disease-in-a-dish models will be any better. Instead, he thinks toxicity studies in a small number of consenting patients should replace animal studies.\n\nBut Hartung says new techniques that combine \u2018organ chips\u2019 with computational models of human metabolism are approaching a level of complexity that will allow researchers to study toxicity across the whole body.\n\nBefore such tests can replace animal models, regulators that currently assess a drug\u2019s toxicity and efficacy based on results in animals will have to validate non-animal models for each drug and disease condition, says Naibedya Chattopadhyay, an endocrinologist at CDRI. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d he says.\n\nSome alternative tests for studying toxicity have been approved by other regulators. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Test Guidelines Programme has already approved a large number of in vitro, human-biology-based assays that member nations use to test drugs for regulatory decision making, says Charu Chandrasekera, executive director of the Canadian Centre for Alternatives to Animal Methods at the University of Windsor in Canada. Although India sets its own drug-testing requirements, they tend to follow international trends.\n\nSwaminathan acknowledges that more evidence is needed for non-animal technologies, but says that progress will come from better investment and guidance from regulators.\n\nThe Indian branch of the animal advocacy group Humane Society International has been pushing the ICMR to promote research into alternatives to animal testing since 2016, says Alokparna Sengupta, deputy director of the society in Hyderabad and a member of the ICMR\u2019s expert committee. In 2017, the ICMR and the society set up a committee headed by Swaminathan to consider the state of animal alternatives for research in India.\n\nBut Swaminathan says that animal-rights groups were not the main driver behind the ICMR\u2019s position on animal testing. \u201cIt was a scientific discussion, they were part of the discussion,\u201d she says.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9GM_uif77I2210kzAGbjkzZTNQfPGlx8suFUBo-pXQQ.jpg"}, {"title": "Florida Bar Pulls Down Dollar Bill Decor to Collect $15,000 for Bahamas Hurricane Dorian Relief", "score": 332, "url": "https://weather.com/news/news/2019-10-01-florida-siesta-key-bar-dollar-bills-decor-15000-for-bahamas-relief", "comments": 11, "date": "2019-10-1", "transcript": "<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/SKOBdollars.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/SKOBdollars.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273 400w, https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/SKOBdollars.jpg?v=ap&w=980&h=551 800w\" > Employees of the Siesta Key Oyster Bay in Siesta Key, Florida, gently remove dollar bills from the bars' walls to donate the money to hurricane relief efforts in the Bahamas.

Conversely, about three-fourths of residents in the U.K. and Canada favor the idea.\n\nThese findings come from a Gallup/Northeastern survey of over 10,000 adults in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. conducted from April to June 2019. By some estimates, up to 50% of jobs are expected to be automated within the next decade. An OECD study across 21 countries suggests that while only 9% of jobs are currently at high risk of automation, low-skilled workers are most vulnerable to job displacement.\n\nThe way that colleges, universities, governments and businesses can respond to this disruption is the topic of a recent report by Gallup and Northeastern University detailing the results of the three-country survey. The probability-based survey was conducted online with 4,394 Americans, 3,049 Canadians and 3,208 U.K. adults.\n\nIn the survey, UBI was defined for respondents as a government-instituted program that would provide every adult with a specific amount of money each year. These funds would serve as income support for people who lose their jobs or occupations because of advances in artificial intelligence. UBI programs have been endorsed by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, as well as high-profile business leaders such as Richard Branson and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nSupport for Universal Basic Income in the U.S., U.K. and Canada Do you support or not support a universal basic income program as a way to help people in [the U.S./the U.K./Canada] who lose their jobs because of advances in artificial intelligence? (% Support) U.S. U.K. Canada % % % Gender Men 40 72 72 Women 46 81 77 Age 18-29 59 84 81 30-49 51 81 78 50-64 34 72 72 65+ 32 66 66 Education Upper secondary education or less 38 80 78 Higher technical education, vocational training, community college education or associate degree 42 71 75 Bachelor's degree 54 74 73 Master's or doctoral degree 51 72 71 Gallup/Northeastern University, April-June 2019\n\nGaps in support for UBI among the three countries surveyed may be due to the tradition of more robust social safety nets in the U.K. and Canada than in the U.S. However, despite the differences in overall support, there are some similarities in age group patterns. In general, younger residents in each country are more supportive of UBI than older residents are, with at least eight in 10 young adults (aged 18 to 29) in the U.K. and Canada -- and nearly six in 10 in the U.S. -- supporting the idea. By contrast, support is about 15 to 30 percentage points lower in each country among those aged 65 and older.\n\nAt the same time, the patterns of support by education level differ across the three countries. In the U.S., support for UBI is higher among those with increased levels of education, ranging from 38% of those with a high school diploma or less to 54% of those with a bachelor's degree and 51% of those with a postgraduate degree. In the U.K. and Canada, support for UBI is highest among those at the lower end of the education spectrum -- 80% of U.K. adults with no more than an upper secondary school education support the program, as do 78% of Canadians with similar levels of education. Support falls to an average of 73% in the U.K. and 72% in Canada among those with a college or postgraduate degree.\n\nAre Supporters Willing to Pay Higher Taxes for UBI?\n\nIn a follow-up question, UBI supporters were asked if they were willing to pay higher taxes to fund such a program. Support for this varies, from 75% in the U.S. to 53% in the U.K. and 49% in Canada.\n\nWillingness to Pay Higher Taxes to Support Universal Basic Income Programs Would you be willing to pay higher taxes to fund a universal basic income program?

In the U.S. and Canada, there is more willingness among young adults (aged 18 to 29) than among those aged 65 and older.\n\nCommon Views That Companies Should Pay\n\nUBI supporters in all three countries were also asked if the companies that benefit most from advancements in AI should pay more taxes to fund UBI programs. Large majorities of adults in all three countries \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" that these companies should pay, including three-fourths in the U.S. and two-thirds in the U.K. and Canada.\n\nSupport for Taxing Tech Companies to Pay for UBI Programs Companies that benefit most from advancements in artificial intelligence should pay more taxes to fund a universal basic income progam. (% Strongly agree/Agree) U.S. U.K. Canada % % % Overall 75 66 67 Gender Men 74 66 67 Women 76 66 66 Age 18-29 78 59 69 30-49 77 65 65 50-64 73 70 71 65+ 70 77 69 Education Upper secondary education or less 75 63 67 Higher technical education, vocational training, community college education or associate degree 74 74 65 Bachelor's degree 78 69 70 Master's or doctoral degree 73 72 64 Among those who support universal basic income programs Gallup/Northeastern University, April-June 2019\n\nBottom Line\n\nUBI programs have garnered substantial attention in recent months, in part because of Yang's endorsement of them. The Democratic presidential candidate has backed such programs to help Americans who experience job loss due to the introduction of new technology. The concept has been piloted on a limited basis in several locations worldwide, with mixed results. However, this hasn't dissuaded UBI supporters from promoting these programs as necessary tools to offset the potential disruption caused by AI adoption and other technological advancements.\n\nThese supporters may find fertile ground for the implementation of UBI programs in the U.K. and Canada. However, in the U.S., attitudes are mixed -- and UBI programs are likely to be a harder sell. Even in the U.K. and Canada, opinions vary among supporters about paying higher taxes to fund such programs. UBI programs would likely be more palatable in these countries if their governments were to endorse taxing tech companies to cover the bill.\n\nIn all three countries, views on UBI programs could change as the effects of AI adoption become increasingly disruptive to workers.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ArWinL5afcMzkrJjQtjhkvMNJtN9pDyPu8CFmYs3C0w.jpg"}, {"title": "Russian alcohol consumption decreased by 43%", "score": 36, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49892339", "comments": 4, "date": "2019-10-1", "transcript": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Customers in a Moscow bar on why Russians are drinking less\n\nRussian alcohol consumption decreased by 43% from 2003 to 2016, a World Health Organization (WHO) report says.\n\nIt attributed the decline to a series of alcohol-control measures implemented by the state, and a push towards healthy lifestyles.\n\nThe WHO said the drop in alcohol consumption was linked to a significant rise in life expectancy.\n\nIt noted that Russia had previously been considered one of the heaviest-drinking countries in the world.\n\n\"Alcohol consumption has long been recognised as one of the main driving factors of mortality in the Russian Federation, especially among men of working age,\" the report said.\n\nBut from 2003 to 2018, alcohol consumption and mortality decreased, with the most significant changes occurring in causes of death linked to alcohol.\n\nIn 2018, life expectancy in Russia reached a historic peak, at 68 years for men and 78 years for women.\n\nAlcohol-control measures introduced under former President Dmitry Medvedev included advertising restrictions, increased taxes on alcohol and a ban on alcohol sales between certain hours.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption In the past, alcohol was commonly sold in street kiosks, as pictured here in Moscow in 1997\n\nThe restrictions on alcohol are one of the most striking changes in Russia in recent years.\n\nIn Moscow, the all-night kiosks crammed full of vodka, beer - and whole, dried fish taped to the glass - are long gone.

It continued to fall throughout the day, growing thicker and thicker.\n\nAt the time of the reception, there was about a foot of snow on the ground. Before the day was over, it would pile close to 2 feet.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.

The cowboy boots worn by the wedding party and long-sleeved dresses on the flower girls were equally suited to the cold weather.\n\nIt was almost as if she\u2019d planned for it.\n\n\u201cA few years back, I told my friends I wanted a winter wedding,\u201d Brittany said. \u201cA lot of times you don\u2019t get snow.

The attached video showed the woman carrying bags and singing Puccini\u2019s \u201cO Mio Babbino Caro\u201d on the train platform.\n\n4 million people call LA home. 4 million stories. 4 million voices...sometimes you just have to stop and listen to one, to hear something beautiful. pic.twitter.com/VzlmA0c6jX \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) September 27, 2019\n\nYahoo News identified the woman as 52-year-old Emily Zamourka and reported that she came to the U.S. from Russia 28 years ago.\n\nZamourka was reportedly a piano and violin teacher and performed on the streets until someone stole her instrument. The theft happened three years ago, and eventually, her piling medical bills forced her into homelessness, according to ABC7.\n\nZamouraka said she\u2019s sleeping on cardboard or wherever she can find a place to sleep. She said there are people in her life who feel sorry for her but she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to be a burden to anybody.\u201d\n\nA large number of people responding to the story on Twitter blamed Democrats for prioritizing illegal immigration over homeless people or suggested the video of the woman was faked. Others were supportive and said they\u2019d heard her sing before.\n\nThis is no fake, I know her, she is a great person, very kind! \u2014 rob (@rooob) September 27, 2019\n\nShe's from Glendale.

The fundraiser aims to help Zamourka buy a violin and set her up with living accomodations.\n\n\u201cEmily could be anyone of us she didn\u2019t become homeless because of her vises [sic], she has none, she was the victim of a crime and an assault that stole her livelihood but not her heart and mind,\u201d wrote David Tweet, the organizer of the fundraiser. \u201cI want to help Emily because unlike so many people out there she doesn\u2019t need a hand out she needs a hand up. She is a brilliant talent that needs to be heard and enjoyed once again in Los Angeles, I for one look forward to that day.\u201d\n\nThe donations mostly ranged from $10 to $100, and one person donated $1,000.\n\n\u201cThis lady is a National treasure, she is deserving of a life of dignity. Solidarity Forever!!\u201d one donor wrote.\n\nZamourka said she\u2019s excited to be going viral.\n\n\u201cI will be so grateful to anyone who is trying to help me to get off the streets, and to have my own place, to have my instrument,\u201d she told ABC7.\n\nUpdate 3:35pm CT, Oct. 2: Emily Zamourka might have landed her big break. TMZ reports that Grammy-nominated producer Joel Diamond offered Zamourka a record contract with his label, Silver Blue Records, after seeing the video of her singing on a subway platform. The album would be \u201ca huge classical/EDM crossover hit record for the subway soprano\u201d titled Paradise, according to TMZ.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nH/T Yahoo News", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/nTzXaifZYtO3AY7Byj1TjfHV6CreQrgFMepGdv1Ybxs.jpg"}, {"title": "It's The PAW Patrol! | The Great Pirate Adventure's Best Moments", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MadPo6cFA30&amp;feature=share", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-10-1", "transcript": "Published on Oct 1, 2019\n\n#shortmovie #animation\n\n\n\nTake a look at this fascinating short movie and maybe it's not so sad after all.\n\n\n\nAnd you can watch these other exciting videos:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2WIFeHU\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2t5nKYA\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2DTgYeK\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2UHpfYB\n\n\n\nEver wondered how to receive your healing through meditation:\n\n\n\nThrough The Three Pillars of Self-Healing, you will gain insight and wisdom; strength, courage, confidence, and certainty that your healing is assured.\n\n\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2D0QEhc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE TAKE SOME TIME OUT TO SUBSCRIBE TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR YOUNG AND UPCOMING ANIMATION ARTISTS AND CLICK ON THAT BLACK NOTIFICATION BUTTON AND NEVER MISS ANOTHER SHORT ANIMATION MOVIE.

Though the outages are meant to avoid catastrophe, they can cause a crisis for those who rely on powered medical devices.\n\nThe fragile, flammable nature of the power grid means that some residents are turning to solar power as a way to keep the lights on.

Credit: Nature Communications 10.1038/s41467-019-12831-0\n\nA new method of extracting hydrogen from water more efficiently could help underpin the capture of renewable energy in the form of sustainable fuel, scientists say.\n\nIn a new paper, published today in the journal Nature Communications, researchers from universities in the UK, Portugal, Germany and Hungary describe how pulsing electric current through a layered catalyst has allowed them to almost double the amount of hydrogen produced per millivolt of electricity used during the process.\n\nElectrolysis, a process which is likely familiar to anyone who studied chemistry at high school, uses electric current to split the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water, releasing hydrogen and oxygen gas. If the electric current for the process of electrolysis is generated through renewable means such as wind or solar power, the entire process releases no additional carbon into the atmosphere, making no contributions to climate change. Hydrogen gas can then be used as a zero-emission fuel source in some forms of transport such as buses and cars or for heating homes.\n\nThe team's research focused on finding a more efficient way to produce hydrogen through the electrocatalytic water splitting reaction. They discovered that electrodes covered with a molybedenum telluride catalyst showed an increase in the amount of hydrogen gas produced during the electrolysis when a specific pattern of high-current pulses was applied. By optimising the pulses of current through the acidic electrolyte, they could reduce the amount of energy needed to make a given amount of hydrogen by nearly 50%.\n\nDr. Alexey Ganin, of the University of Glasgow's School of Chemistry, directed the research team. Dr. Ganin said: \"Currently the UK meets about a third of its energy production needs through renewable sources, and in Scotland that figure is about 80%.\n\n\"Experts predict that we'll soon reach a point where we'll be producing more renewable electricity than our consumption demands. However, as it currently stands the excess of generated energy must be used as it's produced or else it goes to waste. It's vital that we develop a robust suite of methods to store the energy for later use.\n\n\"Batteries are one way to do that, but hydrogen is a very promising alternative. Our research provides an important new insight into producing hydrogen from electrolysis more effectively and more economically, and we're keen to pursue this promising avenue of investigation.\"\n\nSince the level of catalytic enhancement is controlled by electric currents, recent advances in machine learning could be used to fine-tune the right sequence of applied currents to achieve the maximum output. The next stage for the team is the development of an artificial intelligence protocol to replace human input in the search for the most effective electronic structures use in similar catalytic processes.\n\nThe paper, titled \"The rapid electrochemical activation of MoTe2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction,\" is published in Nature Communications.\n\nExplore further New catalyst outshines platinum for producing hydrogen\n\nMore information: The rapid electrochemical activation of MoTe2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction, Nature Communications https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12831-0 , https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12831-0 Journal information: Nature Communications The rapid electrochemical activation of MoTe2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction,", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Jimmy Carter Will Be Back Teaching Sunday School Weeks After Fracturing Pelvis in Fall: 'It Was Important to Him'", "score": 1, "url": "https://people.com/politics/jimmy-carter-teaching-sunday-school-maranatha-plains-pelvis-fracture/", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-11-1", "transcript": "Fourteen stitches couldn\u2019t keep Jimmy Carter from helping build houses for Habitat for Humanity and a fractured pelvis on Oct. 21 wasn\u2019t going to keep him from teaching Sunday school.\n\nThe oldest living former president, 95, will return to Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, to teach this coming Sunday, about two weeks after his injury, the church announced on its website.

Another rejected such a proposal. The moves have prompted a debate over how to make up for pro-slavery legacies.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nHow to compensate for America's original sin - the issue of reparations has made its way into the Democratic primary and into the broader culture. Several of the presidential candidates say they would support a commission to study the matter. And two Protestant seminaries, this fall, announced plans to create reparations funds in recognition of their own ties to slavery. NPR's Tom Gjelten says these schools that train clergy see it as a confession of past sins.\n\nTOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey was founded in part by people who used slave labor or profited from it. The seminary president, Craig Barnes, says, in consideration of that history, the school will spend more than a million dollars a year through a reparations fund.\n\nM CRAIG BARNES: About half of that's going to scholarships, also curricular changes, fully funding a center for black church studies.\n\nGJELTEN: Also this fall, Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria announced its own somewhat smaller reparations initiative. Some of the money would go to descendants of the slaves who actually built the school. The idea of reparations does remain somewhat controversial, however, at least as exemplified in these cases. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville last spring rejected a petition from some Baptist ministers and former faculty calling for a reparations fund. That school's president, Albert Mohler, says if an institution just sets aside scholarships for African American students, it's not really paying reparations.\n\nALBERT MOHLER: You're taking a percentage of your own funds, and then you are designating that for scholarship assistance to be paid to your own institution.\n\nGJELTEN: Mohler says the seminary, in that case, is simply prioritizing black students for scholarship assistance. His seminary last year acknowledged its own extensive connections to slavery. Partly to make up for that legacy, it's now giving financial assistance to African American students in its doctoral program not unlike the assistance other institutions are offering their black students. It just doesn't call it reparations. At Princeton, President Barnes says terminology can be a bit of a hang-up.\n\nBARNES: We're not afraid of the word reparations, but we prefer repair. Like, how do we repair the legacy that we've inherited?\n\nGJELTEN: A broader question is whether the legacy of slavery can be addressed by individual institutions taking steps on their own.\n\nWILLIAM DARITY: The case-by-case approach can't encompass the full range of effects of slavery in producing racial inequality in the United States.\n\nGJELTEN: William Darity is a professor of public policy and African American studies at Duke University. He has written extensively on reparations. A focus on individual perpetrators and individual victims, Darity says, obscures how slavery in the United States was officially authorized.\n\nDARITY: And so I'm convinced that what we have to do is treat the federal government as the culpable party.\n\nGJELTEN: Culpable because laws and court decisions provided a legal framework for slavery, segregation and racial injustice generally.\n\nDARITY: But also because of its implicit approval of these kinds of practices by its failure to intervene.\n\nGJELTEN: At Princeton Seminary, President Barnes says an institution's establishment of a reparations fund is no substitute for a national program. The country needs to have a conversation about this, he says. And he says his school is happy to participate in it.\n\nTom Gjelten, NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ROB LEVIT'S \"THE FORGOTTEN SONG\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Within the first two years, the plan pledges to create more than 1m sq ft of pedestrian space.\n\nThe second, due in 2026, will commit to a full, connected cycle lane network, protected bus lanes on all viable routes and accessible pedestrian signals at 2,500 intersections in five years.\n\nWhile New York has some way to go before it can compete with cycle-friendly leaders such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, the new law marks a significant moment for the city, which has prioritised cars since the 1920s.\n\nMarco te Br\u00f6mmelstroet, professor in urban mobility futures at the University of Amsterdam and academic director of Urban Cycling Institute, said the change in approach represents a \u201cradical shift in the logic that underlies choices in the design of street infrastructure\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhere there is a century-long tradition in the US, and in much of the world that followed examples from the US, that puts the speed and efficient flow of vehicles central, and that made travel times the undisputed central goal of infrastructure planning, this new law seems to make this secondary to choices that put justice central.\u201d\n\nHe said New York has the potential to set an \u201cinspiring example\u201d to other US cities if it can show that the law not only functions but also has a positive impact on other aspects of society.\n\nNearly 800,000 New Yorkers cycle regularly, according to city statistics. It is estimated that more than 490,000 bicycle trips are made every day in the city \u2013 three times more than the number made 15 years ago.\n\nAs of last year, there were a total of 1,240 miles of bike lanes in the city \u2013 480 of which were protected.\n\nMeanwhile, use of Citi Bike, New York\u2019s on-street cycle hire scheme, is on the rise. Close to 2.5m trips were made in September, with an average of 80,475 a day. In comparison, September 2018 saw nearly 1.9m trips and an average of 62,616 trips a day.\n\nBut safety remains an issue for many riders and potential cyclists amid increased congestion on roads \u2013 in part because of services such as Uber and Lyft \u2013 and a crisis on the subway.\n\nJon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said the new measures, especially protected bike lanes, will save lives and encourage more people to cycle.\n\n\u201cThe traffic in the rest of the street is so heavy that if you want to really build cycling into an option for people, other than the small number of courageous souls who are willing to throw elbows with taxis and trucks, you have to give people separation from the vehicles.\u201d\n\nDuring the evening commute on the Williamsburg stretch of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, a popular cycle lane, both cyclists and drivers said they were in favour of more protected cycle lanes.\n\nAlex Price, 24, who works in emergency construction and lives in Brooklyn, said: \u201cIt\u2019s always this game of should I get on the pavement or should I stay on the street?

At first it sounded corny, but the more I read about them, the more I found them intriguing. I saw how my husband Randy and I share most\u2026 but are still working on one\u2026 and don\u2019t share another at all.\n\nHere they are\u2026\n\nTouch \u2013 According to Chapman, different people have varying needs for physical contact. I admit I\u2019m an affectionate person\u2026to an embarrassing degree.\n\nThe other day I saw someone I hadn\u2019t seen in a year. While she held out her hand in a warm handshake, I went in for a full-on hug. (Yes, it was awkward). I have to remind myself almost daily not everyone\u2019s a body squeezer. That includes my neighbor, the mailman, and the barista at the coffee shop. Forget it if I\u2019ve had a few drinks.\n\nThank God, Randy\u2019s also a hugger. In fact, I love his embraces. He\u2019s big and engulfs me and makes me feel warm and safe. We try and schedule several hugs a day and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s a love language we share.\n\nService \u2013 I was lucky. Randy was always a good provider over the decades. Because of him, I never had to worry about putting food on our table. Not once.\n\nBut now that he\u2019s retired, this love language has had to go through revisions. I understood his disorientation, going from running a company to helping with household chores, but to his credit, he\u2019s a quick study. Randy learned that nothing makes me feel more valued than his help \u2013 folding laundry, breaking down the Amazon boxes in the entry hall, or (swoon) loading the dishwasher.\n\nAnd as for my end of the bargain? I like to think I keep his life running smoothly \u2013 paying bills, cleaning, food shopping, multi-tasking twelve things at once, and generally keeping the trains running on time. Service is a love language most women understand well.\n\nTogetherness \u2013 Thank God, we share the same language for this too, but its not what many people think about spending time together. Randy\u2019s retired and home a lot, but during the day he hangs out in his office \u2014 catching up on cable news, working on his computer, or practicing his bass guitar. I\u2019m fine with that. In fact, I like the independence.\n\nMany nights Randy goes out to play gigs with various bands and I stay home. I don\u2019t mind that either. I see how our version of togetherness would be tricky for spouses who need lots of face time and sharing the evening couch, but that\u2019s not us.\n\nThen again, when we go out to dinner and catch up, it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s a treat to share a bottle of wine, solve the world\u2019s problems, and talk about all the things couples talk about who have been together forty years. After all this time, I still need and adore this love language with my husband.\n\nWords \u2013 This is where we\u2019ve both had to learn to be better. In a long marriage, it\u2019s easy to assume your spouse has heard enough tender bon mots. After all, we\u2019re still a couple. Doesn\u2019t that say it all?\n\nBut as I\u2019ve learned the hard way, that\u2019s not always true. And as we get older, we may need the sweet nothings more than ever. \u201cYou look handsome today\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty dress,\u201d goes far. In fact, a well-timed word of love or appreciation can defuse a fight on the razor\u2019s edge of turning from a brush fire to a four-alarmer.\n\nAs we get older, I\u2019ve learned words may be the most important love language of all.\n\nGifts \u2013 This is where Randy and I have each had to carry translation guides. He\u2019s a master gift giver and loves every second of the process \u2013 the shopping (especially this), the presentation, the opening of the box, and the ooh\u2019s and aah\u2019s. Some of my most treasured possessions are pieces of jewelry my husband has given me through the years.\n\nBut this love language is where I fall short. I\u2019m not big on shopping. Malls feel like prison camps. I buy everything online with the enthusiasm of a four-year old at the dentist. I\u2019m not a creative gift giver because my heart\u2019s not into \u201cthe hunt.\u201d\n\nSo, I\u2019ve learned to give experiences to Randy \u2013 concerts, shows, and even fun, unexpected restaurants. In my own humble way, I\u2019ve learned to speak this love language.\n\nWho knows? Maybe love languages change with time. What counts a lot when we\u2019re young doesn\u2019t seem as important when we\u2019re older. Maybe if a couple is fluent in one language \u2014 extra bonus points for more \u2014 that\u2019s what matters.\n\nWhether it all sounds corny, or not.\n\nDo you and your spouse speak the same love languages?

'One day, [a] smile will be for everyone and tears will fall with joy, just for being able to smile.'\n\nThe photo shows the woman in tears of happiness as she sees her new smile for the first time.\n\nOf the transformations, Felipe also said: 'Our actions are worth more than words; building a better world is not done with syllables and verb conjugations. Doing is a transformative act.\n\nReferring to Brazil he added: 'The country with the largest number of dentists in the world also has one of the biggest social inequalities and segregating dentistry.\n\n'Millions don't know what sitting in a dental chair is like.

Growing up, he thought they were extinct. Then he read an article about buffalo returning to Peepeekisis Cree Nation.\n\nThe 24-year-old decided he was going to see one in person. He left his home in Nagano, Japan, and began the trip to the First Nation about an hour northeast of Regina. Ogata decided to fly to Alaska and then hitchhike his way toward Saskatchewan with a tent and sleeping bag.\n\nOgata arrived in Saskatchewan on Sunday and was dropped off at the only school on the Peepeekisis Cree Nation, the Peepeekisis Pesakastew School. Thankfully, people were at the school having a meeting. Ogata knocked and explained who he was, before being led to the meeting room and was told to wait until they were done.\n\n\"We thought somebody had brought him,\" Peepeekisis's Doug McKay said about when he first saw him.\n\nMasaya Ogata, who grew up in Japan, thought bison \u2014 or buffalo, as they are traditionally known by Indigenous people, were extinct. Then he read a story about Peepeekisis Cree Nation welcoming a herd of buffalo onto its land and decided he had to see them in person. 0:57\n\nMcKay said he was shocked when he learned how far Ogata had travelled to be there. McKay laughed and said Ogata picked the wrong time to arrive, as the weather is getting colder, but said it was amazing to see him travel the 8,000-plus kilometres to their home.\n\nOgata and Colin Stonechild make their way towards the buffalo on Peepeekisis Cree Nation. (Heidi Atter/CBC)\n\nThe chief and other band members took Ogata in, setting up a room in the school and bringing him along on any activities they could.\n\nOgata joined a drumming circle, shot a bow and arrow, participated in a sweat with the chief, went with an outdoor education class, and of course got a chance to see buffalo in person.\n\nOgata saw his first buffalo on Tuesday, Oct. 29. (Submitted by Doug McKay)\n\n\"To see his face and the smile. He was so amazing,\" McKay said. \"I said, 'That's probably the way we looked five years ago when they first brought them in.'\"\n\n\"They are bigger than I thought,\" Ogata told CBC News with a laugh. \"They are amazing \u2014 I am so excited.\"\n\nOgata got as close to the buffalo as possible, keeping a safe distance in case they charged at him. (Heidi Atter/CBC)\n\nOgata stayed on the First Nation for four days, spending time with the community members and elders.\n\n\"A lot of the elders were just amazed with him,\" McKay said. \"They couldn't understand much of what he had said, but they sat there and listened to him try to talk to them, give him a few Cree words.\n\n\"Just to see the joy in him, his smile, his eyes and everything. It'll stay with us.\"\n\n\"It's so beautiful. It's so spiritual,\" Ogata said. \"I'm so lucky.\"\n\nPeepeekisis band members took in Masaya Ogata, centre, when he showed up unexpectedly on their First Nation. (Heidi Atter/CBC)\n\nOn his last day at the First Nation Wednesday, as a surprise and a thank you for visiting, the band members presented Ogata with a red blanket from Peepeekisis Cree Nation to keep him warm on his travels.\n\nOgata couldn't stop smiling as he looked around at the buffalo and the friends he made.\n\nWhile in Peepeekisis, the band members spoke about how the buffalo were once their tools, shelter, food, and way of life.\n\n\"The buffalo have a spiritual significance to our people,\" said Colin Stonechild, one of the council members of Peepeekisis Cree Nation. \"Prior to colonization, they were our livelihood.\"\n\nThe herd at Peepeekisis Cree Nation has around 100 buffalo. (Heidi Atter/CBC)\n\nOgata is similar to how they used to be, Stonechild said: nomadic, borderless and following buffalo.\n\n\"Him seeing this story brought him to us, and we feel very special that we have visitors from across the sea to come and visit us and share in the spirit of the buffalo,\" Stonechild said.\n\nPeepeekisis Cree Nation is about 14 minutes from Balcarres, Sask., and just over an hour outside of Regina. (Heidi Atter/CBC)\n\nOpening up their First Nation to someone from a completely different background also helps break stereotypes, Stonechild said.\n\n\"Bringing the buffalo home really cements our legacy to our land,\" Stonechild said. \"And our connection with creator. And it's bringing us visitors, and the sky's the limit for us.\"\n\nOgata decided to head to Winnipeg then Quebec to see more of Canada while he's here.

The resident hadn't heard any [other dingos] calling. So he was just a lonely little soul sitting in a backyard.\n\n\"He was adorable, serious puppy cuteness. No fear of people at all. He was quite calm about the whole process.\"\n\nThe hospital undertook DNA testing on Wandi to determine his breed and then moved to the Australian Dingo Foundation's sanctuary while the results were pending.\n\nThe sanctuary sits at the foothills of the Macedon Ranges in Victoria and breeds pure dingoes.\n\n\"It is just incredible,\" Dr Day said.\n\n\"The DNA testing takes a couple of weeks, so we've just had to tread water. He was introduced to the sanctuary during that time.\n\n\"And now that the results are back he can be used as part of their breeding program.\"\n\nWandi's new home\n\nOne of the sanctuary's main focuses is on preserving and conserving the gene pool of the original dingo.\n\nAnd by all accounts Wandi is fitting right in.\n\n\"Wandi has a little playmate his same age because he has been born at the perfectly right time for dingos in winter,\" said the director of the Australian Dingo Foundation, Lyn Watson.\n\n\"He has tamed quite nicely. Whilst he is wild and always will be, he has become quite happy here and he likes the people that are caring for him.\"\n\nThe team at the sanctuary are keeping detailed records of his development.\n\n\"He is just amazing to watch,\" she said.\n\n\"We are really excited to have him \u2014 not only to observe the way he develops, but also how he behaves right next door to the dingos that are bred here.\"\n\nExtinction fears\n\nMs Watson said there were three types of dingo in Australia \u2014 tropical dingoes from the Kimberley and Pilbara areas, inland dingoes which live in the deserts and central parts of the country, and Wandi's type being the alpine dingo.\n\nIt is this breed the sanctuary is most concerned about.\n\n\"This type, the alpine dingo, unfortunately shares the eastern seaboard areas \u2026 where 80 per cent of the Australian population lives,\" Ms Watson said.\n\n\"So not only is the habitat of the alpine dingo dwindling to nothing, but our persecution of this animal \u2014 because it sadly looks like a dog \u2014 has pushed this beautiful alpine dingo very close to extinction.\"\n\nThe foundation is determined to make sure that does not become a reality.\n\n\"The first step we have made is the zoological recognition of the Australian dingo as a species of its own, Canis dingo,\" she said.\n\nMs Watson said unlike the tropical and inland dingos, the alpine dingo is endangered \u2014 which makes the discovery of Wandi so special.\n\n\"For us he is going to be a very valuable little thing,\" Ms Watson said, \"depending on his eventual development and the way he continues to get along with everybody else in the sanctuary\".\n\n\"At this point he has all of the features we demand before we do breed anything.\"\n\nTopics: animals,

world to source most of its power needs from renewable energy\n\nSantiago\u2019s metro system \u2013 which transports approximately 2.4 million passengers each day \u2013 will become one of the first subways in the world to source most of its power needs from renewable energy.\n\nNext year, Latin America\u2019s second largest subway system, will source 60 per cent of its energy from solar and wind projects.\n\nIn a statement Metro de Santiago said that it had signed two 15-year agreements, one with a solar energy provider, and another with a wind power company.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, California-based SunPower\u2019s will supply 42 per cent of the subway system\u2019s power with a 100-megawatt (MW) solar plant using 254,000 panels covering an area the size of 370 football fields, located in northern Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert.\n\nThe remaining 18 per cent will be provided by a recently developed wind farm located just north of the SunPower solar project, The Wall Street Journal said.\n\nMetro de Santiago is one of the capital\u2019s biggest energy consumers.\n\nThe transition of the majority of the Chilean capital\u2019s metro system power demand to renewable energy therefore marks a significant step towards the country\u2019s climate action targets.\n\nBy 2050, renewables are expected to provide 70 per cent of the Chile\u2019s electricity needs, up from 15 per cent in March 2017.\n\nLast year, a number of renewable energy developers won contracts in Chile\u2019s largest-ever auction to supply power to the country\u2019s northern and central electricity grids.\n\nChile\u2019s President, Michelle Bachelet, applauded the initiative, stating that the transition to renewable energy sources will generate enough power for the equivalent of 100,000 homes and reduce Chile\u2019s CO2 emissions by around 130,000 tonnes each year.\n\nFurthermore, according to experts, the metro system has the capacity to further increase its use of renewable energy in the network\u2019s power mix through the installation of solar panels on the roofs of its stations and alongside its 20 miles of overground track.\n\nJorge Amaya, a Researcher at the University of Chile\u2019s Center for Mathematical Modeling, reportedly said that this would further cut costs and reduce emissions by about 18 per cent.\n\nThe UK is investigating the feasibility of installing solar panels along tracks to power the nation\u2019s electric trains.\n\nAccording to plans laid out in India\u2019s union budget, almost every railway station in the country will soon be powered by solar.\n\nMelbourne\u2019s tram network will become entirely powered by solar energy under a new proposal by the Andrews government to build large-scale solar farms in northern Victoria.\n\nThe news follows the announcement that the world\u2019s first zero-emission hydrogen train has successfully completed its first trial in Germany.\n\nFor the latest news on clean transport

Although the president has rolled back 85 environmental rules in an attempt to help revive business, according to The New York Times, a natural gas boom and the country's increasing use of renewable energy sources have stymied those attempts. Coal provided just 27.5 percent of Americans' electricity last year, according to the Energy Information Administration, down from nearly half just a decade ago.\n\nThe natural gas boom and the increasing capacity of renewable energy have contributed to coal's decline, a trend marked by a string of bankruptcies. Armstrong Energy Inc and Mississippi Minerals filed for bankruptcy in 2017. Mission Coal and Westmoreland Coal filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Trinity Coal filed for bankruptcy in March and was followed by Piney Woods Resources Inc in April, Cloud Peak Energy in May, Cambrian Holding in June, and Blackjewel and Blackhawk Mining in July. Murray, Cloud Peak and Revelation Energy/Blackjewel were among the nation's top 10 producers in 2018, according to the EIA.\n\nMurray Energy, the largest privately-owned coal company that employed almost 5,550 people in 2018 is the latest casualty. The company owned and operated 13 mines across the county and managed five additional mines, but had accumulated about $2.7 billion in debt, the bankruptcy filing said. The company also has more than $8 billion in actual or potential liability.\n\nFor environmental advocates, the filing represented progress toward a cleaner future.\n\n\"Bob Murray and his company are the latest examples of how market forces have sealed the fate of coal and there's nothing the president can do about it,\" Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group, said in a news release.\n\nBut the bankruptcy filing generated concerns from the United Mine Workers of America, which said sounded an alarm about its ripple effects on workers through the country.\n\n\"Now comes the part where workers and their families pay the price for corporate decision-making and governmental actions. Murray will file a motion in bankruptcy court to throw out its collective bargaining agreement with the union. It will seek to be relieved of its obligations to retirees, their dependents and widows. We have seen this sad act too many times before,\" the organization said. \"But that does not mean we will sit idly by and let the company and the court dictate what happens to our members and our retirees. We have high-powered legal, financial and communications teams in place that will fight to protect our members' interests in the bankruptcy court.\"\n\nWest Virginia Senator Joe Manchin also signaled concern and introduced the \"Stop Looting American Pensions (SLAP) Act\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"If Murray Energy refuses to pay their pension obligations, the UMWA pension fund will be insolvent by this time next year. The SLAP Act ensures all workers, union and non-union, are treated fairly when a company files for bankruptcy and ends the inequities of the current system,\" Manchin said in a statement.\n\nUpdate, 10/30, 4:04 p.m.: This article has been updated with more detailed data and the headline has been changed to reflect the alteration. S&P Global Market Intelligence found that 11 companies have filed for bankruptcy since Trump took office. Using information provided by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an initial version of this article said that eight companies had filed for bankruptcy since Trump took office.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "Ontario Police Museum holds car show to raise money after alleged embezzlement", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.dailybulletin.com/2019/10/31/ontario-police-museum-holds-car-show-to-raise-money-after-alleged-embezzlement/", "comments": 1, "date": "2019-11-1", "transcript": "As life-long first responders, the retired law enforcement officers running the Ontario Police Museum are accustomed to giving help, not asking for it.\n\nBut ever since their funds were allegedly stolen in what authorities describe as a clever embezzlement scheme, they\u2019ve had to close for months, cancel school field trips and dig into their own pockets to keep the place afloat.\n\nOn Saturday, Nov. 2, they\u2019ll host their annual car show, the first since they realized that between $10,000 and $13,000 \u2014 all their money \u2014 was gone. And they are asking the public to come, have a good time, and contribute to the museum\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThis is a recovery effort to get some of our money back,\u201d said Bob Kallas, organizer of the event and museum operator.\n\nFrom 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., car enthusiasts will show off their hot rods, street cars, racing cars and vintage models, while DJs entertain and bands play live music. Food trucks plus the In N Out Mobile Kitchen, will be on hand to feed the crowd of an expected 400 people.\n\nThe event is held in the parking lot of the museum, at 2500 S. Archibald Ave., Ontario, which is located within the Ontario Police Department\u2019s Archibald Avenue station. Kallas will be there to personally offer tours of the place, filled with police relics, old photos and a fallen officers\u2019 wall.\n\nAdmission is free. Those who would like to display their cars are charged a $30 fee. The museum also receives a flat fee from vendors.\n\nIn July, Donald Alvin Driftmier, 72, the group\u2019s treasurer, was charged with three felony counts of grand theft by the San Bernardino County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nDriftmier, of West Covina, is accused of draining the funds of the police museum and two other related charities: Law Enforcement Ontario (L.E.O.) and Freedom\u2019s Flame 9/11 Memorial Foundation from June 2016 through February 2019, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nHe was not only the museum treasurer but a CPA who served as president of the California Board of Accountancy and chaired its ethics committee. In 2017, pictures published in this newspaper show Driftmier posing with other guests during a museum fundraiser.\n\n\u201cThat is someone you trust. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t work out,\u201d said Albert Vande Steeg, president of the police museum during an interview Thursday, Oct. 31.\n\nVande Steeg, 78, was a detective with the Ontario Police Department. He said Driftmier was well trusted throughout the community. At past museum car shows, he always handled the cash, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know exactly how much was stolen, since Driftmier handled all the transactions, even directing donors to send checks to his personal address, Vande Steeg said.\n\n\u201cI know we lost $10,000, that we can prove. But I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s $3,000 more missing we can\u2019t prove,\u201d he said.\n\nThe final blow came shortly before Driftmier\u2019s arrest by Ontario PD: When board members noticed funds were missing, he sent the museum a check for $10,000. But when Vande Steeg went to cash it, the bank said the check was worthless, drawn on insufficient funds.\n\nThe museum\u2019s balance had fallen to $42, he said.\n\n\u201cI am just disgusted. He talked a good talk and then rips you off. That is not honorable,\u201d Vande Steeg said.\n\nIn March, April and May of this year, the museum was forced to close. School field trips were also canceled. This was a low point for the little museum, which began as a way to teach children respect for the law and for law enforcement.\n\nVande Steeg said the down times \u201cgot us derailed for months.\u201d Many board members spent their own money to keep the museum running. He paid for a new set of tires for the 1951 Plymouth police cruiser with Ontario PD markings.\n\nHe said the museum has reopened albeit on a shoestring budget. \u201cWe are stretched thin,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Driftmier was arraigned in San Bernardino Superior Court, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. Pre-preliminary hearings have been postponed several times since then. A hearing on Oct. 24 was waived and moved to Dec. 4, court records show.\n\nFor more information, visit the museum\u2019s website at https://ontariopolicemuseum.org.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "FDA, EPA, USDA join with restaurants and grocery stores to halve US food waste by 2030", "score": 53, "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/government-industry-food-waste-reduction-1469032", "comments": 6, "date": "2019-11-1", "transcript": "Three government agencies announced Wednesday that they would be partnering with a coalition of food industry trade groups to drastically reduce the amount of food that goes to waste in the United States by 2030.\n\nAccording to a press release published by the Food and Drug Administration, the partnership involves an agreement between three federal agencies\u2014the FDA, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2014and the Food Waste Reduction Alliance, or FWRA. The alliance is led by three major trade associations within the food industry: the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the Food Marketing Institute and the National Restaurant Association.\n\nThe announcement came out during the 2019 Food Waste Summit in San Francisco and is part of the Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative, a collaboration between the USDA, EPA and FDA.\n\nAccording to the alliance's press release, the goals of the partnership are multifaceted. The participating organizations will focus on educating food providers and consumers about how to make the most of their money and the food they purchase, providing \"strategies to prevent, recover and recycle excess food.\" The partnership will also spur increased communication within the food industry about how best practices for implementing food waste reduction measures, including working with companies to ensure more food is donated rather than thrown away.\n\nFood waste, defined as \"the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food service providers and consumers,\" by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, is a pressing issue in the U.S.\n\nUp to 40 percent of edible food in America goes into the trash uneaten, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, often because consumers store food incorrectly or misunderstand what the \"best before\" dates on food labels really mean.\n\nA family of four wastes about $1,500 a year on food that no one ever eats, according to information on the NRDC website SaveTheFood.com. This amounts to $124 wasted per month, or roughly $4 per day. Newsweek reported last year that every American wastes, on average, a pound of food each day\u2014amounting to a national total of 150,000 tons of waste every day.\n\nYet even with all the food that goes uneaten, some 40 million Americans in 2017 had to deal with not having enough food, according to the non-profit organization DoSomething. Further, around 15 million families that year suffered from food insecurity, meaning that they at times lacked access to enough food to feed each of their members.\n\nRepresentatives from the organizations involved with the partnership said they hoped it would do much to further the goal of cutting food waste in the course of the coming decade.\n\n\"The FDA strongly supports our shared goal of reducing the amount of food that Americans waste through important efforts like today's agreement,\" Dr. Ned Sharpless, acting commissioner of the FDA, said in a press announcement. \"The issues of food waste and food safety go hand in hand and we will continue to work with our federal partners and other stakeholders on enhancing our efforts to reduce food waste and do it safely. We are committed to doing all that we can to support safe and sound food policy decisions that are good for our families, good for our communities, and good for our planet.\"\n\nDawn Sweeney, president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, concurred with the FDA. \"We look forward to working with our partners to share best practices on food waste reduction and, with greater clarity on liability protections for food donation, make it easier for owners and operators to make food donations in their communities,\" she said in the FWRA press release. \"By reducing food waste, we can serve those in need today and set the table for success tomorrow.\"", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ft5rJeDPlUVhFzrErcLzdYRHzlzhBGh_H8YpR1BIZgE.jpg"}, {"title": "'Guardian angel': Glace Bay contractor tricks senior into accepting free roof - Nova Scotia, Canada", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/glace-bay-contractor-senior-free-roof-1.5344397", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-11-1", "transcript": "Jeremy Locke often drove by Jeanette MacDonald's Glace Bay, N.S., home, watching the roof deteriorate.\n\nThe owner of a roofing and construction company, Locke thought the roof had been partially repaired and that a company would return to finish the work.\n\nBut weeks passed, then months.\n\n\"I had it in my mind that if no one steps up to help this lady in our community, I'd be more than happy to,\" said Locke.\n\nBut to his surprise, when he approached MacDonald with an offer to fix her roof for free, she turned him down.

The first is that they love honey. We read enough Winnie the Pooh stories in our childhood to be certain of this. The second is that we absolutely, definitely have no intention of starting a fight with them. Winnie may be lovable. The average brown bear, however, would maul somebody as soon as look at them.\n\nTurkish beekeeper Ibrahim Sedef knows this better than most. Sedef is based in Trabzon and found that hungry bears would regularly visit his beehives after dark. Great for nature enthusiasts, but not so great for a honey supply. Sedef would usually find his property trashed in the morning, and reviewing overnight security tapes confirmed that Yogi and Boo Boo were to blame.\n\nSedef attempted several techniques to spare his beehives from being destroyed. He placed security fences around them, but the bears made light work of these. He tried placating his nocturnal visitors with other food, but they were certain about what they wanted.\n\nUnlike the charming Paddington, these bears had no interest in a marmalade sandwich. Only fresh honey would do. This was costing him over $10,000 in damages and lost honey supplies.\n\nBefore long, Sedef was at his wit\u2019s end. You might say that this situation was unbearable. This when he decided to take a new tack. Deciding that attempting to deter the bears was a fool\u2019s errand, he took a new tack. He decided to turn the sophisticated palates of these animals to his advantage and use the bears as unpaid quality control testers.\n\n[pn_btn][/pn_btn]\n\nBears have expensive taste\n\nSedef set up four bowls of honey on a table within the area that the bears visited. This was step one \u2013 it ensured that his bees were no longer bothered, and his hives were not damaged. The bears tucked into the honey from the bowl instead.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Sedef placed different types of honey into each bowl. He was curious to see if the bears had a preference for one kind of honey over another. It turned out that they did. Bears, it seems, have sophisticated palates.\n\nMuch like the story of Goldilocks, these bears tried a few different varieties of honey before they decided which was just right. Anzer honey becomes a firm favorite of these nocturnal visitors \u2013 which also happens to be the most expensive variety that Sedef sold.\n\nThe bears would make a beeline for this particular honey every time. Sometimes, they\u2019d gorge on this variety alone, completely ignoring the alternatives \u2013 which included such popular types as cherry blossom honey.\n\nMaking the best of a bad situation, Sedef realized that he was onto a winner with his Anzer honey. Bears tend not to be shy about expressing their displeasure. If they were not enjoying their snack, they\u2019d make their feelings known. As they came to expect a nightly treat, however, Sedef and his visitors came to an agreement.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Sedef realized that he could charge substantial prices for Anzer honey. Two pounds of this nectar retails for over $300. If you have that kind of cash to spare, you can rest assured that you\u2019re tucking into the finest produce possible. Just beware \u2013 you may need to share it with a hungry visitor.\n\nWhy is Anzer honey so tasty?\n\nYou may be surprised at the idea of bears having such discerning taste. After all, they scoop live fish straight from a river on other occasions. That suggests that they\u2019re less than fussy.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the location. The Anzer\u2019s plateau is home to up to 90 unique flowers that only grow in this region. This means that over 300 different types of pollen are located in the area. That\u2019s the perfect place to keep a beehive. Anzer honey is considered to have healing properties, as well as tasting sensational.\n\nThis explains why Sedef\u2019s visitors were not content to take the bear essentials. They wanted the good stuff \u2013 and with good reason.\n\nSedef is undoubtedly far from grizzly when he thinks about his visitors. He doesn\u2019t mind the damage that these bears have done to his property. Watching the footage, he now looks upon them with affection. That\u2019s an admirable philosophy.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s a lot more sensible than attempting to take on a pack of hungry bears.

It\u2019s more about maintaining some small amount of faith that humanity can survive through the end of my son\u2019s natural lifetime without a class of scientists culling the herd and moving out to colonize space.\n\nI need some sign that the mass of humanity has a future, and Republicans who respond to surveys just don\u2019t afford that kind of confidence. But I got a glimmer of hope with my morning coffee on Friday morning. The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll (see full results here) provided what I\u2019ve been looking for:\n\nTrump is the first president since the early days of modern polling more than 70 years ago never to have achieved majority approval in office, and his average rating is 21 points below the average for his predecessors dating to Harry Truman at this point in their presidencies. Closest to Trump was Jimmy Carter, at 48 percent average approval. Trump\u2019s falloff from 44 percent approval in July to 38 percent now (it also was 38 percent in September) includes the drop among Republicans, noted above, from 87 to 74 percent. He\u2019s also at just 22 percent approval among 18- to 29-year olds, matching the low\u2026 \u2026Along with Republicans, conservatives are Trump\u2019s obvious mainstay, and another group to watch. From 77 percent job approval among conservatives in July, he\u2019s gone to 67 percent today.\n\nThe precise numbers in this survey don\u2019t interest me all that much. There are other polls that show Trump\u2019s approval numbers still in the low-forties and I have no particular reason to believe one poll of this type over another. What I look for instead is how the numbers move within the same poll over time, because as long as the methodology remains consistent it can be flawed and still accurately detect changes in public opinion. I have more faith that this survey is correct in finding an erosion of support in Trump\u2019s base than that they\u2019ve nailed his absolute level of support.\n\nBacked by similar numbers in their September results, the October ABC News/Washington Post poll indicates that the formal launch of an impeachment inquiry did what nothing else could\u2013it began to chip away at the confidence conservatives and Republicans have in Donald Trump.\n\nThere are some other data points of interest in this survey. A narrow 49 percent-47 percent plurality already supports removing Trump from office even though the House has not yet held a single public hearing. In fact, half the public seems to have accepted the Republicans\u2019 complaint about transparency, with 50 percent disapproving of how the Democrats have handled the inquiry so far. Unfortunately for Trump, that number is unlikely to hold steady as the process becomes completely and painfully transparent in the weeks ahead. As it is, 58 percent of respondents \u201cdisapprove of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThis is not a good starting point for the president. He also has to be concerned that 60 percent think it was inappropriate to deputize Rudy Giuliani to conduct foreign policy and 55 percent believe Trump did \u201csomething wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine and 47 percent characterize it as \u201cseriously wrong.\u201d\n\nNone of this means that your average Republican lawmaker can feel safe expressing any serious doubts or displeasure about Trump\u2019s performance in office. The prerequisite for that is that Trump\u2019s numbers weaken substantially in his strongholds. Dropping from the high-eighties to the mid-seventies in approval among Republicans is not enough to change the attitude of congressional Republicans. But you have to drop into the seventies before you can drop into the sixties, and that is what we\u2019ve seen here. In fact, he\u2019s only getting approval from two out of three self-described \u201cconservatives,\u201d suggesting a bit counterintuitively that his support is currently higher among moderate Republicans.\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to assume that the impeachment hearings will continue to bring Trump\u2019s numbers down even as they spur a burst of energy into his dwindling base of support. As broad popular opinion moves more strongly in favor of removal, the first casualty will be the GOP\u2019s hope of winning back seats that were lost two and four years ago. The next casualty will be the Republican officeholders who narrowly survived those elections. Then we\u2019ll see polls showing even strong Republican seats looking vulnerable.\n\nIf the Republicans acquit in the face of strong public consensus in favor of removal, they\u2019ll next have to rally around and renominate Trump, which will only further infuriate the public. Their only hope in such a situation is that their base sticks with them and limits their losses, but Trump\u2019s base may already be getting emotionally prepared to abandon him.\n\nThere could be some hope for humanity after all.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/p5DBgDyjisLwH6nKBzujPXYBDfbzmkcd7gpF_cQn13A.jpg"}, {"title": "Glasgow Nando's to open on Christmas Day to feed city's homeless", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/18009595.glasgow-nandos-open-christmas-day-feed-citys-homeless/?ref=rss", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-11-1", "transcript": "Staff at one of Glasgow's branches of Nando's will open their doors on Christmas Day to help feed the city's homelessness.\n\nThe Waterloo Street restaurant, which only opened this year, made the announcement on social media this afternoon.\n\nThey are also urging any customers to donate gifts to those in need, to provide \"a bit of cheer\" on Christmas Day.\n\nA post on their Faceook read: \"We are planning on opening on Christmas Day to feed some of Glasgow\u2019s many homeless.\n\n\"We\u2019d love to be able to give them some gifts to help them keep warm and clean and we need your help!\n\nREAD MORE: How to help Glasgow's homeless ahead of coldest winter 'in decades'\n\n\"We have place a bin at our entrance and would love if you could help us fill it with hats, gloves, blankets, toiletries, jackets, sleeping bags etc.\n\n\"Anything you can give would help so we can give these people at little bit of cheer on Christmas Day.\n\n\"#spreadtheword #givesomethingback\".\n\nSo far more than 2000 people have shared the post, impressed with the generosity of the staff at the restaurant chain.\n\nOne customer, Ann Butcher, commented: \"What an awesome plan.

Within the first two years, the plan pledges to create more than 1m sq ft of pedestrian space.\n\nThe second, due in 2026, will commit to a full, connected cycle lane network, protected bus lanes on all viable routes and accessible pedestrian signals at 2,500 intersections in five years.\n\nWhile New York has some way to go before it can compete with cycle-friendly leaders such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, the new law marks a significant moment for the city, which has prioritised cars since the 1920s.\n\nMarco te Br\u00f6mmelstroet, professor in urban mobility futures at the University of Amsterdam and academic director of Urban Cycling Institute, said the change in approach represents a \u201cradical shift in the logic that underlies choices in the design of street infrastructure\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhere there is a century-long tradition in the US, and in much of the world that followed examples from the US, that puts the speed and efficient flow of vehicles central, and that made travel times the undisputed central goal of infrastructure planning, this new law seems to make this secondary to choices that put justice central.\u201d\n\nHe said New York has the potential to set an \u201cinspiring example\u201d to other US cities if it can show that the law not only functions but also has a positive impact on other aspects of society.\n\nNearly 800,000 New Yorkers cycle regularly, according to city statistics. It is estimated that more than 490,000 bicycle trips are made every day in the city \u2013 three times more than the number made 15 years ago.\n\nAs of last year, there were a total of 1,240 miles of bike lanes in the city \u2013 480 of which were protected.\n\nMeanwhile, use of Citi Bike, New York\u2019s on-street cycle hire scheme, is on the rise. Close to 2.5m trips were made in September, with an average of 80,475 a day. In comparison, September 2018 saw nearly 1.9m trips and an average of 62,616 trips a day.\n\nBut safety remains an issue for many riders and potential cyclists amid increased congestion on roads \u2013 in part because of services such as Uber and Lyft \u2013 and a crisis on the subway.\n\nJon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said the new measures, especially protected bike lanes, will save lives and encourage more people to cycle.\n\n\u201cThe traffic in the rest of the street is so heavy that if you want to really build cycling into an option for people, other than the small number of courageous souls who are willing to throw elbows with taxis and trucks, you have to give people separation from the vehicles.\u201d\n\nDuring the evening commute on the Williamsburg stretch of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, a popular cycle lane, both cyclists and drivers said they were in favour of more protected cycle lanes.\n\nAlex Price, 24, who works in emergency construction and lives in Brooklyn, said: \u201cIt\u2019s always this game of should I get on the pavement or should I stay on the street?

That might sound like the fever-dream of a former scientist-turned-car writer, but it's actually one of the results of a new study from the University of Richmond. The aim of the research was to see what effect the environment a rat was raised in had on its ability to learn new tasks. Although that kind of thing has been studied in the past, the tests haven't been particularly complicated. Anyone who has spent time around rats will know they're actually quite resourceful. So the team, led by Professor Kelly Lambert, came up this time with something a little more involved than navigating a maze: driving.\n\nIf you're going to teach rats to drive, first you need to build them a car (or Rat Operated Vehicle). The chassis and powertrain came from a robot car kit, and a transparent plastic food container provided the body. Explaining the idea of a steering wheel and pedals to rats was probably too difficult, so the controls were three copper wires stretched across an opening cut out of the front of the bodywork and an aluminum plate on the floor. When a rat stood on the plate and gripped a copper bar, a circuit was completed and the motors engaged; one bar made the car turn to the left, one made it turn to the right, and the third made it go straight ahead.\n\nIf proof were needed that many existing psychology tests are too simple, rats did not take long to learn how to drive. The driving was conducted in a closed-off arena (1.5m x 0.6m x 0.5m) where the goal was to drive over to a food treat. Three five-minute sessions a week, for eight weeks, was sufficient for the rats to learn how to do it. The placement of the treat and the starting position and orientation of the car varied throughout, so the rats had more of a challenge each time. At the end of the experiment, each rat went through a series of trials, conducted a day or two apart, where they were allowed to drive around the arena but without any food treats to see if they were only doing it for the food.\n\nThe subjects were 11 male rats, five of whom lived together in a large cage with multiple surface levels and objects to play with, and six who lived together in pairs in standard laboratory rat cages. Although both groups of rats learned to drive the car, the ones that lived in the enriched environment were quicker to start driving, and they continued to be more interested in driving even when there was no reward on offer beyond the thrill of the wind in one's fur.\n\nThe researchers also collected each rat's droppings at various points during the study to analyze them for metabolites of corticosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone, a pair of hormones. The ratio of these two hormones can show how stressed an animal is, and it changed in a pattern consistent with emotional resilience in all the rats over the course of the study. However, there was no significant difference between the enriched environment and the control group in this regard, which may well mean that the four-month process of teaching the rats to drive was itself a positive enriching environment.\n\nSerious scientists usually refrain from imputing any further emotion onto research animals, but I'm no longer a serious scientist, so I'm happy saying that learning to drive made the rats more well-adjusted. And the study has further value; these complex activities may be more useful tests in rat models of neuropsychiatry than those in current use.\n\nListing image by Getty Images", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kmVI6Hnqn-uyw2wUF7jMmSPNl4WTZ-wUKpvm734zH9o.jpg"}, {"title": "A 70-year-old biking grandmother conquers Bolivia's 'Death Road'", "score": 19, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-skyrace-elderly/a-70-year-old-biking-grandmother-conquers-bolivias-death-road-idUSKCN1WL00J", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-11-1", "transcript": "LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia\u00b4s \u201cDeath Road\u201d might seem an odd place for a septuagenarian grandmother on two wheels.\n\nThe world\u00b4s most dangerous road spirals skyward nearly 11,000 feet, from the country\u00b4s lowland jungles to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes.

One girl mentioned her dog. Another student joked about not having to go to school over the holiday.\n\nThe boy\u2019s response was a bit more serious. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m finally going to be adopted by my two dads,\u201d he answered.\n\nStudents later said that the substitute snapped, \u201cWhy on earth would you be happy about that?\u201d\n\nFor the next 10 minutes she lectured the 30 kids in the class about her own views, how \u201chomosexuality is wrong\u201d and \u201ctwo men living together is a sin.\u201d She looked at the boy, too, and told him: \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to be thankful for.\u201d\n\nThree girls asked her to stop multiple times.

Van Amstel and his husband, Josh, said administrators called them immediately after it happened. At first, their son, who\u2019s 11 years old, didn\u2019t want to talk about it and didn\u2019t want to get the substitute teacher in trouble. The school pieced the story together from multiple student accounts. And the incident is now under investigation.\n\nAlpine School District spokesman David Stephenson said he cannot speak about personnel issues but noted that \u201cappropriate action has been taken.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe district contracts with the staffing company Kelly Services to hire substitutes.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about any reports of inappropriate behavior and take these matters very seriously,\u201d Kelly Services said in a statement. \u201cWe conduct business based on the highest standards of integrity, quality, and professional excellence. We\u2019re looking into this situation.\u201d\n\nVan Amstel said he appreciates the three girls stepping up and the school\u2019s quick response. But he wonders how the substitute got in a classroom in the first place and wants to make sure she never comes back again \u2014 at Deerfield Elementary or anywhere in Utah.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous and horrible what she did,\u201d van Amstel added. \u201cWe were livid. It\u2019s 2019 and this is a public school.\u201d\n\nThe van Amstels\u2019 son, whom they asked to identify only as D.M. because his adoption process is not final, told his dads that he understood what the substitute was saying. D.M. said he didn\u2019t speak up, though, because he\u2019s had two failed adoptions before and didn\u2019t want his dads to rethink their decision, with his final court hearing coming up on Dec. 19.\n\n\u201cHe was so fearful that this could make us think that we don\u2019t want to adopt him,\u201d van Amstel said, trying not to cry. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely not going to happen. But this situation really hurt him. This person really hurt us.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little in state code, though, regulating substitute teaching, and there\u2019s no mandatory training required for those pinch-hitting in the classroom.\n\nBen Rasmussen, director of law and professional practices at the Utah State Board of Education, said individual school districts are \u201cencouraged to have their own policies.\u201d The only statewide mandates are that schools can\u2019t hire teachers as substitutes if they have had their teaching license suspended or revoked. In fact, a substitute doesn\u2019t have to have a license at all, though preference should be given to those who do.\n\nThe other requirement is that the applicant must pass a background check before being hired. \u201cOther than that,\u201d Rasmussen said, \u201cit\u2019s pretty flexible for schools.\u201d\n\nAt Alpine School District, Stephenson, the spokesman, said substitutes go through \u201cextensive training\u201d with Kelly Services before they enter the classroom.\n\nThe company \u2014 which works with all school districts in Utah County, many throughout the state and thousands nationwide \u2014 notes on its website that those lessons include \u201ccomprehensive classroom management techniques, information on legal and health issues, teaching strategies, how to be prepared and professional, plus appropriate fill-in activities.\u201d Other \u201cminimum requirements\u201d listed are being able to successfully complete what the company calls \u201ca behavioral interview.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if any of that directly deals with diversity or sensitivity.\n\nStephenson said he doesn\u2019t know if the substitute from Deerfield will continue to work in the district, referring questions to Kelly Services. But, he added, Alpine has a stringent nondiscrimination policy and is taking this case seriously.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re] committed to having the best employees who care about all children in our schools, whether it be the teacher, the custodian, the secretary or a substitute teacher,\u201d he noted. \u201cObviously, when situations come up like this, we quickly investigate and take appropriate action. That was done in this situation.\u201d\n\nHe, too, like the van Amstels, also applauded the three girls who came forward and reported the substitute\u2019s behavior to the principal. He believes their actions are the remarkable part of the otherwise troubling story.\n\n\u201cFellow students saw a need, and they were able to offer support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome what happened as far as those girls coming forward.\u201d\n\nVan Amstel posted a video after the incident, calling out the substitute for bullying his son. Within hours, van Amstel, who was previously a dancer on \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d had hundreds of shares and comments on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram asking for the woman to be fired and blocked from teaching again.\n\nOur child was bullied. pic.twitter.com/gZ5yI0Z2F0 \u2014 Louis van Amstel (@LouisVanAmstel) November 22, 2019\n\nKelly Services has contracted with Alpine School District since 2011. How much the district pays the company depends on how often a substitute is needed. According to financial statements online from March, for instance, the district spent nearly $850,000 for the month. For April, it was $450,000.\n\nA 2018 article from the Daily Herald notes that teachers in the district request substitutes about 47,000 times per year. Alpine has more than 70 schools and 80,000 students, making it the largest in the state.\n\nThose who substitute make $70 a day if they\u2019re unlicensed and $80 if they are. The district recently raised the compensation for each by $10.\n\nSome have cited that low pay as the reason many do not become substitutes and why sometimes the best candidates aren\u2019t driven to the profession. Van Amstel wants the checks and requirements to be more intensive, though he also believes it should be obvious that teachers not talk about their personal beliefs in front of a room full of 10- and 11-year-olds.\n\nDeerfield Elementary, which has about 700 students, picks a trait each month to focus on. In November, it was communication, said Principal Caroline Knadler, and the school focused on understanding that people have different beliefs, but it\u2019s not OK to bully anyone based on those.\n\nShe said the girls who came to her office exemplified what she had been trying to tell students.\n\n\u201cI just have an amazing set of kids here,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they showed some pretty amazing citizenship. It makes me feel warm inside.\u201d\n\nVan Amstel also said he talked to the mother of one of the girls after the incident. He remembers her telling him, \u201cI am so glad that I raised my daughter in a way where she would stand up for what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nA few days later, the family\u2019s neighbors also decorated their house with paper hearts that said \u201cWe love you\u201d and \u201cWe support you.\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6IkyqV2iS7huxu7SRu85HVcMhwpa1v5fCLcAcCm03tM.jpg"}, {"title": "In Iraq we have a peacefully protests and the Iraqi government kill the protesters .

This is to ensure that when the leather is heated, it does not shrink. The Ministry of Defence buys beeswax in bulk for personnel to use in this next part of the process.

The need is no secret to owner George Markos, who has opened his doors on Thanksgiving morning for the past 26 years to serve free turkey dinners to anyone who comes by.\n\n\u201cGeorge makes it possible,\u201d said Cathi Campbell, a Somerville District Court judge who served as a volunteer. \u201cHe is just a living saint in the community. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThroughout the years, Markos said he has served nearly 50,000 meals, which included another 1,050 on Thursday. In addition, Markos distributed several hundred turkey dinners to elderly people and local groups last week, which bumped this year\u2019s total to about 1,500 meals served.\n\nAlthough the event\u2019s operation appeared seamless, Markos said it was because meal preparation started early Wednesday morning. Between the two days, dozens of volunteers cooked and served 2,700 pounds of turkey, and 1,000 pounds each of carrots, potatoes and sweet potatoes.\n\nMarkos had always wanted to provide free meals for people who may not have somewhere to go on Thanksgiving, but it wasn\u2019t until his father died that he was inspired to start the tradition.\n\nOn Thursday, it was impossible to have a conversation with Markos without being interrupted by patrons who would stop by to thank him for giving them a chance to enjoy their Thanksgiving, but he said the event was a way for him to express his gratitude to them as well.\n\n\u201cI promised the people I would be there for them and if it wasn\u2019t for the people, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything,\u201d said Markos. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to start a business. They gave me everything and I give back every year.\u201d\n\nTwo of those people who stopped to thank Markos were Peter Francesi and Elodie Kayulu. The married couple has lived in the Lynn Emergency Shelter for the past three months and a peaceful meal is hard to come by these days, Kayulu said.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to thank him,\u201d said Kayulu, 44. \u201cNot many people (will) do this for other people. He really put his heart out for feeding the homeless. We don\u2019t have a family. This is like family right now.\u201d\n\nAll of the food was \u201con point\u201d and thoroughly cooked, said Francesi, 31.\n\n\u201cI appreciate them for opening their doors to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\n\nAnn Marie Murray, 49, became homeless after domestic violence was committed against her. She has been living in the emergency shelter since August.

Subscribe today.\n\nRichard Grace, inventor of one of the greatest tools the kitchen has ever seen, neither knows how to cook nor cares to learn. In the mid-\u201990s, he set out to make a wood-carving rasper and ended up with a culinary masterpiece called the Microplane: a cheese-grating, citrus-zesting, nutmeg-dusting revelation that today costs as little as $11 on Amazon. He\u2019s an inventor in the truest spirit of the word, someone who treats ideation as a profession, not a calling. He doesn\u2019t speak in buzzwords and has never hosted a TED Talk. He simply makes things and finds uses for them later.\n\n\u201cMy father gets bored very quickly and he\u2019s always thinking of different ways to solve a problem,\u201d said Chris Grace, Richard\u2019s son and the CEO of Grace Manufacturing, the family business that oversees Microplane. \u201cAsk most people how many uses they could think of for a paper clip, they\u2019d give you maybe half a page. My father might give you 10 pages. He\u2019s still coming up with uses for that etched tooth.\u201d He was referring to the dozens of razor-sharp, jagged teeth found on every Microplane.\n\nWhen I asked Richard, at Microplane\u2019s Arkansas factory, about potential uses for the tool, he leaned back in his chair, cracked a small grin and let loose: wall-hanging art, fasteners, interlocking washers, horseshoes, stints, medical instruments for optical surgery, table-saw blades and stainless steel sandpaper \u2014 which, according to him, would\u2019ve worked if not for a tester using it improperly and hurting themselves. But never once did he expect the photo-etched tooth to make its way into the kitchen.\n\nMicroplane was conceived in a conference room in 1991. Back then, Grace Manufacturing was in the business of making small photo-etched parts for mechanical computer printers. Then the dot-matrix printer arrived, spelling an all-but-certain demise for the family business. The end in plain sight, Richard, his brother and a team of Grace\u2019s brightest sat down in a whiteboard-filled room to brainstorm what they might do to stave off oblivion. \u201cThat was the cool term at the time, \u2018brainstorming,'\u201d Richard said.\n\nThe family was well-trained in the process of chemical photo-etching metals, and, as they had observed many, many times, the finished products were often exceptionally sharp. Richard swore he was buying Band-Aids \u201cby the bushel.\u201d So, as he tells it, \u201cAll those hours spent drawing up whiteboards, and we decided we were going to make something sharp.\u201d\n\nThe practice of chemically photo-etching was paramount to making parts for that bygone era of computer printers. Essentially, a film (not unlike camera film) is placed on top of sheets of metal, and an image (of a blade, for instance) is exposed on the film. The sheets are then sprayed with a chemical compound that dissolves all exposed areas of the image. The only serious thing left to do after that is punch your newly formed blades out.\n\nThis, according to Richard, is not all that difficult. \u201cGive any real engineer half an hour of explaining and they could teach a seminar on it,\u201d he said. Chris and Microplane\u2019s VP of sales and marketing, Joel Arivett, don\u2019t necessarily share this opinion.\n\nRichard and his team set out to make a tall, thin blade with dozens of rounded, razor-sharp, photo-etched edges for the express use of carving and shaping wood. And they did; they just couldn\u2019t sell any. \u201cI mean, we probably didn\u2019t make any money for a few years,\u201d Richard lamented. \u201cNot until that article published.\u201d\n\nIn 1994, just three years after the original Microplanes were thought up, Lorraine and Leonard Lee, proprietors of Lee Valley Tools in Ottawa \u2014 a mail-order catalog that sold tools and gifts for Canada\u2019s woodworking community \u2014 wrote the fate of the Grace family business.\n\nLorraine, a baker with an affinity for Armenian orange cake, wasn\u2019t happy with her old kitchen grater. So she slid her husband\u2019s Microplane over an orange. She was so astounded by the results, she had the description of the product changed in the store catalog to include its effectiveness at this seemingly niche kitchen task. This is how the story, \u201cTest Kitchen; A Gift for the Cook, or Carpenter,\u201d published by The New York Times four years later, began.\n\nBefore the Microplane brass could blink, they had become a kitchenware company \u2014 whether they liked it or not.\n\nPenned by Amanda Hesser, who later cofounded the award-winning food publication Food52, this 516-word story was to become Microplane\u2019s crossing of the Rubicon, from carpentry to culinary.\n\n\u201cAfter the Times article, basically everybody who sells anything contacted us,\u201d Arivett told me. \u201cWilliams Sonoma; Bed, Bath & Beyond; Sur La Table \u2014 everybody. It was almost too much to keep up with.\u201d\n\nBefore the Microplane brass could blink, they had become a kitchenware company \u2014 whether they liked it or not. Within the first month following the article\u2019s publication, the brand saw its kitchen customers eclipse its woodworking customers ten times over. Microplane, the wood rasp, sold between $300,000 and $400,000 a year; by 2002, Microplane, the kitchen gadget, did that in a month. According to Chris, they weren\u2019t able to project or map the company\u2019s growth. \u201cWe\u2019d list the monthly sales goal on the sales floor, and we\u2019d crush it so hard it became worthless,\u201d he said.\n\nThen came an even bigger boom, one fueled by the power of the original kitchen influencers: celebrity chefs. Martha Stewart, Ina Garten, Rachel Ray and virtually anyone that mattered used a Microplane on their shows, calling it out by name for their audience. Julia Child liked the product so much, it earned a permanent spot hanging on the wall of her kitchen, which was later replicated at the Smithsonian. And Oprah\u2019s personal chef, Art Smith, once called it \u201cthe most coveted tool in chefdom.\u201d\n\nBut for all the brilliance of the original invention and the Grace family business savvy, they still weren\u2019t sure what they were selling. \u201cNone of us were cooks,\u201d Chris said when I asked him if the Grace family was culinarily inclined. Richard laughed when I asked him the same question, but he agreed: \u201cI\u2019d say, no, we\u2019re not foodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d go into Sur La Table on business trips and find our packaging all over the floor, but all the Microplanes sold out.\u201d\n\nThe product\u2019s original packaging was a cardboard sleeve with no branding at all. Not that it mattered, because the sleeve would fall right off when hung on racks in stores. \u201cWe\u2019d go into Sur La Table on business trips and find our packaging all over the floor, but all the Microplanes sold out,\u201d Arivett said.\n\nAround this time, Chris \u2014 who had left home for a job at TRW Automotive manufacturing seatbelts for the likes of Ford \u2014 made his return to the family business, bringing with him years of mass-volume manufacturing experience gained from working at factories in Mexico. Chris sped everything up, bought a factory in Mexico to assemble the products (the blades are still made in Arkansas) and also pushed Microplane into the European market, where, he only half-jokingly said, \u201cthey actually know how to cook.\n\n\u201cSometimes, on a plane, I tell people what I do and they\u2019ll just explode with joy, thanking me and everything,\u201d Chris went on. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help but think, \u2018Gosh, it\u2019s only a cheese grater.'\u201d\n\nAnd though Microplane would turn out to be an enormously effective, profitable venture, Richard isn\u2019t quite ready to turn his back on the thing that sparked the fire in the first place: woodworking. \u201cAnybody who manufactures things dreams of making their own product, like a writer wants to write their own book,\u201d he told me. \u201cI set out to make a professional-quality woodworking tool, and it just never really took off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI set out to make a professional-quality woodworking tool, and it just never really took off.\u201d\n\nChris has seen his dad\u2019s frustration many times. Just after he rejoined the company, he and his family piled in around the TV to watch Microplane\u2019s first scheduled time slot on QVC. \u201cWe had our own little eight-minute spot, and you can see how many are being purchased on the screen during the program. It\u2019s a rush to see your work purchased in real time,\u201d he remembered. \u201cWe looked over to my father when it ended, and he asked us, \u2018When are you going to get the woodworking [product] on?'\u201d By the end of the segment, more than 50,000 Microplanes had sold.\n\nToday, Microplane employs more than 150 people and continues to dominate its little corner of the kitchen market with tools that cost little more than $10. Everyone, it seems, either has one or knows what it does. And people are still finding uses for Richard\u2019s hyper-sharp photo-etched blades. Doctors once suggested they could work in surgery, and now bone saws almost identical to their grater counterparts are among Grace\u2019s largest revenue streams.\n\n\u201cWe received a very impassioned email from one lady who told us we had to make a foot file because her Microplane was so great at getting calluses off her hands and feet,\u201d Arivett said. \u201cSo we did. We sell a ton of them now.\u201d\n\nWill Price Will Price is Gear Patrol's home and drinks editor. He's from Atlanta and lives in Brooklyn.

Alaska joins New Hampshire and Maryland as the first states to get rid of sub-minimum wage for employees with disabilities, an act which is entirely legal under federal law, and has been since 1938 when the Fair Labor Standards Act was implemented.\n\nThe minimum wage exception was initially created to help those with disabilities get jobs, but despite its intentions, the legislation still fell short. Disability advocates argue the law is outdated and that many disabled individuals can succeed in jobs earning minimum wage or more, and that no other class of people faces this kind of government-sanctioned wage discrimination. In addition to being paid a sub-minimum wage, employees with disabilities often perform their jobs in what are called \u201csheltered workshops.\u201d This term is generally used to describe facilities that employ people with disabilities exclusively or primarily, but has been interpreted by disability advocates as a form of segregation in the workplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoodwill Industries is arguably one of the biggest offenders when it comes to exploiting this kind of wage discrimination. The company is one of the largest employers for people with disabilities, many of whom are contracted by Goodwill through the government\u2019s AbilityOne program, which ensures contracts are set aside for places that employ workers with disabilities.\n\nGoodwill, however, is a $5.59 billion organization, and many argue they can afford to pay all of their workers a fair wage.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got entities that are doing quite well, that are raking in donations, that get government contracts to make everything from military uniforms to\u2026pens to whatever,\u201d says Chris Danielsen, a spokesperson for the National Federation of the Blind told The Nation. \u201cThey get these contracts, and they\u2019re paying their workers less than the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nGoodwill\u2019s own CEO, Jim Gibbons, is blind. In 2015, he raked in more than $712,000 in salary and additional compensation while his disabled employees were making less than $9 an hour in some states.\n\nIn a comment to NBC News in 2013, Gibbons defended his salary and the million dollar salaries of other Goodwill executives. At the time, Goodwill\u2019s total compensation for all its franchise CEOs was more than $30 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese leaders are having a great impact in terms of new solutions, in terms of innovation, and in terms of job creation,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking of those employees with disabilities working for less than minimum wage, he punted. \u201cIt\u2019s typically not about their livelihood. It\u2019s about their fulfillment. It\u2019s about being a part of something. And it\u2019s probably a small part of their overall program,\u201d he added.\n\nJust last week, disability activists were dealt a blow by the House of Representatives, which voted 225 to 192 in favor of a bill that would significantly weaken the Americans with Disabilities Act, letting businesses off the hook for failing to provide accessibility accommodations.\n\nTwenty-two percent of Americans live with some form of disability and 13 percent of those experience mobility issues, such as walking or climbing stairs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The share of people with disabilities is higher among women and people of color: according to the CDC, one in four women have a disability and three in 10 non-Latinx Black people have a disability.\n\nOne in three adults who are able to work have reported having a disability, and half of those making less than $15,000 a year have reported a disability as well, according to the CDC\u2019s numbers.", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "10 Real Facts About Frank Artus You Probably Didn't Know", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw8QbLzHXKQ&amp;feature=share", "comments": 0, "date": "2019-12-1", "transcript": "Published on Dec 1, 2019\n\nIn this video I will be sharing with you 10 real facts about Ghanaian famous actor Frank Artus that you probably didn\u2019t know.

Engineers at MIT have now created a device to trap carbon dioxide that is much less energy-intensive and costly than today\u2019s technologies.\n\nThe device, reported in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, works a lot like a battery. It absorbs carbon dioxide from air passing over its electrodes. It could be made as small and large as needed, making it easy to use at different carbon dioxide emission sources.\n\nAnd unlike today\u2019s carbon-capture techniques, it works for a wide range of concentrations. So it could be used to scrub carbon dioxide from factory and power plant flue gases or even directly pull it from the atmosphere, where it\u2019s present at much lower levels.\n\nExisting methods to absorb carbon dioxide from flue gases typically use watery solutions of amine or solid sorbent materials. The solution has to be heated to release the carbon dioxide and reuse the amine. This takes a lot of energy. Plus, the technology does not work at the lower concentrations found in air. Companies such as Climeworks have developed commercial plants that use special filters to suck up carbon dioxide directly from air. But the filters also have to be heated for reuse.\n\nThe new MIT system uses only electricity, so it could be powered by renewables. The device contains two thin, flexible electrode sheets coated with two different chemical compounds. During charging, one of the compounds, called polyanthraquinone, reacts with carbon dioxide and integrates the gas into the electrode. Discharging releases the carbon dioxide and frees up the quinone for reuse.\n\nThe idea is to pass a stream of flue gas or air through the device during charging to scrub it of carbon dioxide from. Once the electrode is saturated, the device would be switched to discharge mode and the pure released carbon dioxide could be compressed for storage underground or for use to make fuels and other chemicals. Or two separate units could be operated in opposite modes to remove carbon dioxide continuously.\n\nThe system uses about one gigajoule of energy per ton of carbon dioxide captured. Other existing methods can use up to 10 times that much, according to Sahag Voskian, a chemical engineering postdoctoral researcher who developed the new technology. He added that the electrodes should cost tens of dollars per square meter to produce, and could easily be made in large quantities using roll-to-roll processing techniques.\n\nThis article was written by Prachti Patel and originally published on Anthropocene Magazine.

While most of us take our warm jackets for granted, there are many homeless who lose their jackets during the hot summers, as they have nowhere to keep it until the next winter.\n\nThe struggle to find a new coat each year is real, but now thanks to a compassionate restaurant owner, dozens of lovable homeless men, women and children are going to be able to stay a bit warmer for the winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmilia Flores, a former psychologist who owns The Taco Stop in Dallas, set up a free coat, hat, and scarf exchange outside of her business.\n\nThe sign above the coat rack reads: \u201cAre you cold? Take one. Do you want to help? Leave one.\u201d\n\nMany of us have extra unused or older coats laying around the house, and rather than letting it just sit there, Emilia is giving us a way to help a lovable person in need stay warm for the winter.\n\nFreezing temperatures in Texas inspired the good samaritan to offer winter clothing to those who need it. The rack is easy-to-spot and clear in its message.\n\nEven if people aren\u2019t homeless, Emilia wants to ensure they\u2019re prepared for the cold winter.\n\n\u201cThis is a way of people not being embarrassed about asking. They just come and pick what they need and leave,\u201d Emilia said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taco Shop owner is beautifully persistent in her mission to help others. In one year, the rack was stolen four times, yet she and other loyal customers decided each time that they\u2019ll continue to re-install it and will continue to do so as many times as necessary, in order to keep the poor warm for the winter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another reminder that it takes very little to make life easier for people,\u201d said Emilia.\n\nIf you work somewhere and you think your surrounding community could benefit from a \u2018take one or leave one\u2019 winter clothes rack, consider being the change and talk to a few co-workers about setting one up. You\u2019ll not only help the poor stay warm, but you\u2019ll give others a way to share their love by donating old coats, and you can inspire the world, just as Emilia has.\n\n\u201cThe glow of one warm thought is to me worth more than money.\u201d\n\n~Thomas Jefferson\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments.\n\nPlease share this good news with others: when we share stories and examples of compassion and kindness, we inspire and encourage others to be kind and compassionate in their daily lives, making the world a better place for everyone.\n\nYou are loved.\n\nSee Also: This Man Did 5000 Pounds Of Free Laundry For Homeless Families.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}, {"title": "A tiny Colorado town opened its arms to over 700 stranded travelers this weekend", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2019/12/01/colorado-road-closures-fairplay-shelters/?fbclid=IwAR2lReCV-RK5h18k3nAqXAgUyOdQJ3MLxschyNC2V5mKIhqSjiN1XH04X_Y", "comments": 14, "date": "2019-12-1", "transcript": "When the emergency shelter in Fairplay ran out of blankets Saturday night, volunteers went door-to-door collecting extras from locals.\n\nWhen the hotels ran out of rooms, managers let stranded travelers sleep in the lobbies. When the shelter\u2019s cots were full, volunteers spread out the high school\u2019s wrestling mats to try to keep as many people as possible off the floor.\n\n\u201cWords don\u2019t even describe what this small group of volunteers pulled off here,\u201d said Dave Kintz, chairman of the South Park Salvation Army.\n\nMore than 700 people were stranded in Fairplay on Friday and Saturday after high winds, blowing snow and low visibility made travel impossible at the height of the post-Thanksgiving rush and closed a long stretch of U.S. 285, which remained closed along the Kenosha Pass on Sunday.\n\nA group of volunteers stepped in to help manage the crowd as the sheer quantity of those stranded strained local resources.\n\nThe town of 762 people sheltered 300 people overnight Friday and 446 people on Saturday, said Gene Stanley, director of emergency management for Park County. Authorities also rescued motorists from at least 30 cars that were stranded along U.S. 285 on Saturday, reaching the drivers by using tracked vehicles.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely could not move,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cI think the last rescue vehicle came into my office just before midnight.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s primary shelter, a community center, was designed to hold 50 people \u2014 but 112 people stayed there Friday, until the power went out and the shelter lost heat, forcing everyone to relocate to South Park High School.\n\n\u201cIt grew into a larger event than we had expected,\u201d Stanley said.\n\nFairplay\u2019s few hotels filled up on Friday, said Dee Patel, a manager at A Riverside Inn. After all 50 of her rooms were booked, she let travelers sleep in the hallways and the lobby, passing out hot chocolate, tea and extra blankets and pillows.\n\n\u201cI cannot say no,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people had little babies and kids with them.\u201d\n\nKintz, who is also the Park County coroner, said a core group of about 30 volunteers from the Salvation Army, the coroner\u2019s CARE team, and two local churches were crucial to keeping the shelter running smoothly and ensuring everyone was fed.\n\n\u201cWe brought in food from South Park Community Church, we raided the food supply of the school, we brought in food from volunteers who provided food from their places, we got some from local stores,\u201d Kintz said.\n\nHe said the number of stranded travelers was unprecedented in his 17-year tenure in emergency services.\n\n\u201cEveryone was routed this way due to I-70 problems and other road issues,\u201d he said, adding that he does not think drivers were adequately warned of the \u201cdespicable\u201d road conditions in the area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of my little community,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the horrible situation we found ourselves in, to be able to help all those people is amazing to me.\u201d\n\nAuthorities brought vehicles that had been abandoned on the highways to the shelter Sunday and reconnected drivers to their cars, Stanley said. Most people were able to leave the shelter on Sunday, he said, and the high school shelter was expected to close Sunday evening as the weather cleared.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Stanley said, \u201cwe are cleaning up the mess.\u201d", "source": "reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews", "thumbnail": "default"}]
