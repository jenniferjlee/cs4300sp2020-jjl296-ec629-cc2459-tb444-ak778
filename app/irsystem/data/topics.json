In Italy, one of the key affected countries, people are singing from their balconies to lift the spirits of those around them. People of my hometown #Siena sing a popular song from their houses along an empty street to warm their hearts during the Italian #Covid_19 #lockdown.#coronavirusitalia #COVID19 #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/7EKKMIdXov \u2014 valemercurii \ud83c\udf0d (@valemercurii) March 12, 2020 Of course not everyone has a great singing voice. So musical instruments have been whipped out to form a backing track.  Salerno Secondo giro.Forza Campania, Forza Italia!Direttamente da Salerno,dai balconi.. l'inno di Mameli..\u2764\ufe0f Posted by Meteo Campania on Thursday, March 12, 2020 It\u2019s not dissimilar to Wuhan, back in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, when the locked-down occupants sung and danced to each other via videos on the internet. Alongside uplifting actions are tales of downright human compassion. Gone are the stories of shoppers brawling over diminishing groceries in supermarkets. Instead they\u2019re being replaced with acts of kindness. People with surplus goods are actively seeking out those who haven\u2019t been so fortunate, seeking to share their stock so others won\u2019t go without. In one Melbourne neighbourhood, residents have begun waking to gifts left on their doorsteps. Alice Mitchell, whose work has ordered her to stay home, has begun trying to keep the strength of community spirit alive. As she and her family were staring down the barrel of potential self-isolation, Ms Mitchell was turning away from the anxiety-inducing media saturation and towards more traditional forms of entertainment. \u201cI noticed I was gravitating toward board games and the like, to keep my mind occupied from the media overexposure,\u201d Ms Mitchell told\u00a0The New Daily. \u201cI figured most others could benefit from a similar thing. \u201cSo I bought a bunch of puzzles which were inexpensive but might mean the difference between sanity or not.\u201d Together with her two sons, they\u2019ve begun leaving puzzles on their neighbours\u2019 doorsteps at night \u2013 with a little note about \u201ckeeping sane during lockdown\u201d. \u201cWhen the climate seems to be every man for himself out in public, I just wanted to give a gesture to my immediate neighbourhood so that they know we\u2019ve got their backs if they need it,\u201d Ms Mitchell said. The reaction has been heartwarming. Neighbours have come a-knocking to chat and say thanks, with a renewed sense of optimism. On Wednesday morning, they woke to their own porch surprise: a thank you note, some chocolate and a \u201ccheeky\u201d roll of toilet paper. \u201cHopefully they\u2019ll think to pass things down the line to help strengthen our communities \u2013 because we need each other more than ever now,\u201d she said. \u201cThat human-to-human interaction builds each other up.\u201d Have you seen a kind act during the coronavirus outbreak? Tell us in the comments below. Even better \u2013 do one yourself",

Allworth Veterans' Home in Lebanon, Oregon, this week, per the Oregonian. Lapschies was among the first of 15 residents to test positive for COVID-19 on March 11, almost a week after developing symptoms. He fell \"very very sick,\" daughter Carolee Brown tells KOIN. But while two residents of the home have since died, Lapschies has \"met the guidelines by the CDC and Oregon Health Authority to be considered recovered,\" according to a Veteran Affairs spokesperson. The Oregonian reports he may be the world's oldest coronavirus survivor.                                                                            \"He just made this wonderful recovery,\" says Brown, who attended Wednesday's celebration, complete with balloons and chocolate cake. \"We were like shocked that he was kind of sitting in his wheelchair waving at us through the window.\" Asked how he felt at 104, Lapschies, allowed outside for the first time in weeks, responded, \"Pretty good. I made it.\" He then added, \"Good for a few more.\" Brown believes her father's \"upbeat attitude\" played a role in his recovery. \"He's never down,\" she tells the Oregonian. Granddaughter Jamie Yutzie, meanwhile, credits health care workers at the nursing home. Lapschies was drafted into the US Army in 1943, but now it's these workers who are \"on the front lines and in the trenches,\" she tells the Washington Post. \"They're the heroes now.\"  \u00a0",

    "transcript": "If it seems that your news feed has been flooded with nerve-wracking updates on the COVID-19 outbreaks, have no fear\u2014there are also plenty of positive updates on the pandemic as well.\n\nSo without any further ado, here is a list of 10 hopeful headlines on the coronavirus response from around the world.\n\nScientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle delivered the first rounds of a potential coronavirus vaccine to several dozen optimistic volunteers earlier this week.\n\nOne 43-year-old vaccine recipient is Jennifer Haller, who is a mother to two teenagers.\n\nShe was all smiles afterward, telling AP reporters she was \u201cfeeling great\u201d as she was leaving the clinic.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\u201d she added.\n\n2) Distilleries Across the United States Are Making Their Own Hand Sanitizers to Give Away for Free\n\nAmidst national shortages of hand sanitizers, alcohol distilleries in Atlanta, Portland, rural Georgia, and North Carolina have begun using their facilities to make their own sanitation products.\n\nSince the World Health Organization (WHO) says that cleaning your hands with an alcohol-based rub can help to kill viruses on your hands, many of the distilleries say they hope to continue producing their bootleg sanitizers until the virus has been properly contained.\n\n3) Air Pollution Plummets in Cities With High Rates of Quarantine\n\nSatellite readings of air pollution levels over China and Italy show that the regions hit hardest by the COVID-19 have also caused air pollution levels to decline dramatically.\n\nSome reports estimate that China\u2019s quarantine has saved more than 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere\u2014which is about the equivalent of what Chile produces in a year.\n\nNot only have similar effects been reported across Italy, the canals and waterways of Venice are reportedly cleaner than ever with the waters shining crystal clear in the absence of diesel-powered boats and gondoliers.\n\n4) Johns Hopkins Researcher Says That Antibodies From Recovered COVID Patients Could Help Protect People At Risk\n\nThe vaccine being tested in Seattle isn\u2019t the only potential treatment for the disease\u2014an immunologist from Johns Hopkins University is reviving a century-old blood-derived treatment for use in the United States in hopes of slowing the spread of the disease.\n\nThe technique uses antibodies from the blood plasma or serum of people who have recovered from COVID-19 infection to boost the immunity of newly-infected patients and those at risk of contracting the disease.\n\n5) South Korean Outbreak Finally Abating as Recoveries Outnumber New Infections for Three Days in a Row\n\nAccording to Reuters, South Korea recorded more COVID-19 recovery cases on March 6th than new infections for the first time since the nation experienced the largest Asian outbreak outside of China.\n\nSince the novel coronavirus outbreak was first reported in South Korea back in January, the nation reached a peak of 909 new infections on February 29th. Now, however, Reuters reports that the declining rate of infection has continued to fall with less than 100 new cases reported for several days in a row.\n\n6) China Celebrates Several Milestones of Recovery After Temporary Hospitals Close and Parks Reopen\n\nCrowds of medical staffers and discharged patients were filmed celebrating the closure of all 14 temporary hospitals that opened in Wuhan to treat COVID-19 patients during the worst of the outbreak.\n\nAuthorities told the South China Morning Post this week that the virus had finally passed its peak as the nation\u2019s mainland experienced only 11 new cases on March 13th, most of which were from international travelers.\n\nAs the outbreak is finally brought under control, parks and tourist attractions are slowly beginning to reopen to the public under careful moderation.\n\n7) Australian Researchers Testing Two Drugs as Potential \u2018Cures\u2019 for the Virus\n\nAt the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, scientists have found that two different medications\u2014both of which are registered and available in Australia\u2014have completely wiped out traces of the disease in test tubes.\n\nNot only that, the drugs were given to some of the nation\u2019s first COVID-19 patients, which resulted in \u201cdisappearance of the virus and complete recovery from the infection,\u201d researchers told News.com.au.\n\nThe university is now looking to conduct a nationwide trial with the drugs to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of each drug administered separately and together.\n\n8) Uber Eats is Supporting the North American Restaurant Industry By Waiving Delivery Fees for 100,000 Restaurants\n\nAs restaurants across Canada and the United States are forced to temporarily shut down amidst COVID-19 outbreaks, Uber Eats has announced that they will be waiving delivery fees for independent restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe know the success of every restaurant depends on customer demand,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working urgently to drive orders towards independent restaurants on Eats, to help make up for the significant slowdown of in-restaurant dining.\n\nNEW Podcast: Daily Inspiring Covid-19 Updates from Good News Gurus Under Quarantine\n\n\u201cAs more customers are choosing to stay indoors, we\u2019ve waived the Delivery Fee for the more than 100,000 independent restaurants across US and Canada on Uber Eats. We will also launch daily dedicated, targeted marketing campaigns\u2014both in-app and via email\u2014to promote delivery from local restaurants, especially those that are new to the app.\u201d\n\n9) Dutch and Canadian Researchers Are Reporting Additional Breakthrough Research on Treating the Virus\n\nScientists from Canada and the Netherlands have also made medical breakthroughs of their own. In Toronto, a team of researchers managed to isolate the agent responsible for the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which will help researchers around the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments, and vaccines.\n\n\u201cResearchers from these world-class institutions came together in a grassroots way to successfully isolate the virus in just a few short weeks,\u201d said Dr. Rob Kozak, clinical microbiologist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. \u201cIt demonstrates the amazing things that can happen when we collaborate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Dutch researchers have submitted a scientific paper for publishing on how they have identified an anti-body for the virus\u2014and it could be a world-first.\n\n10) Here Are a Bunch of Other Ways That People and Businesses Are Supporting Each Other Throughout the US Outbreak\n\nDollar General has announced that they will be devoting their opening hour of shopping time to elderly customers. Athletes and sports teams are pledging to pay the wages of arena employees during the shutdown. Utility companies, landlords, automakers, and internet providers are waiving a number of late fees and payments to ease the financial burden of the shutdown. School districts across the country are still opening their doors to serve meals to kids and families.\n\nAll in all, the pandemic situation may seem grim, but these are just a few examples of how businesses and individuals are still looking out for each other during times of trouble.\n\nNEW Podcast: Daily Inspiring Covid-19 Updates from Good News Gurus Under Quarantine\n\nMultiply The Good By Sharing The Positivity With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026",

Andrew Cuomo\u2019s calls to action this week.\n\nRELATED: Another Roundup of Positive Updates on the COVID Outbreaks From Around the World\n\n\u201cMany of those working in New York City have to travel long distances to and from their homes after putting in 18-hour days,\u201d Warner said in a statement. \u201cThey need a place close to work where they can rest and regenerate. I heard Governor Cuomo\u2019s call to action during one of his press conferences, and there was no other option for us but do whatever we could to help.\u201d\n\nAccording to NBC New York, there are a number of prominent hospitals within a 30-block radius of the luxury hotel, including the Bellevue, Weill Cornell Medical Center, NYU Langone, and Mt. Sinai. The news outlet goes on to say that Gov. Cuomo is also working with other city hospitals to provide free rooms for medical personnel fighting the outbreaks.\n\nMeanwhile in Manchester, England, retired soccer stars Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs\u2014both of whom formerly played for Manchester United\u2014are offering up their own hotels as free accommodation for NHS workers.\n\nGiggs and Neville are co-owners of the Hotel Football and The Stock Exchange through their GG Hospitality group. Although the two Manchester-based hotels will be closed to the general public, Neville published a Twitter announcement this week saying that every single one of their rooms would be offered up to nurses, doctors, and medical personnel battling the COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\u201cOur 176 beds will be occupied by National Health Service workers and medical professionals,\u201d said Neville in the Twitter video. \u201cIt\u2019s at this time that I think the whole of our industry needs to show solidarity, not just for our staff in these uncertain times but obviously for those who need the accommodation most in the coming months.\n\nCHECK OUT: Chinese Company Ships Crates of Masks to Italy Covered in Italian Poetry\u2014We Are \u2018Leaves of the Same Tree\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re delighted to have come into agreement with. It will operate free of charge and our staff will operate the hotels as normal,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe health workers will be able to stay there without any cost whatsoever in these next few months when they need isolation away from family members who may be affected by what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nRoman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of the Chelsea soccer team, has also offered to pay for NHS staffers to stay at the club\u2019s Millennium Hotel in London for the next two months.\n\nThis is just one of many positive stories and updates that are coming out of the COVID-19 news coverage this week.

    "transcript": "Health care professionals may be able to dramatically speed up the COVID-19 testing process now that Israeli scientists have successfully demonstrated a technique for simultaneously screening up to 60 patient samples at a time, rather than individually.\n\nCommunities around the world are emphasizing the need for virus testing amidst the coronavirus outbreaks. In Seattle, health care professionals are setting up drive-through test sites that allow patients to submit samples in as little as 3 minutes\u2014all without having to leave their vehicle. Meanwhile, a small town in northern Italy has reported zero new infections since they blanket tested all 3,300 of the town\u2019s residents.\n\nNow, researchers at Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology and Rambam Health Care Campus have tested a method that will dramatically increase the current COVID-19 testing capacity using existing available resources. This method, known as pooling, enables simultaneous testing of dozens of samples.\n\nIts implementation has the potential to greatly accelerate the rate of testing and detection of COVID-19 infected patients in the population. The trial was completed in a matter of days thanks to the support of the Ministry of Health and the close collaboration between Technion and Rambam.\n\nRELATED: 10 Positive Updates on the COVID-19 Outbreaks From Around the World\n\nTesting for COVID-19 is currently being conducted in Israel with the focus on people with specific symptoms. The current rate of testing\u2014about 1,200 a day\u2014does not allow for monitoring of asymptomatic carriers in the population, which is vital to curb the epidemic.\n\nCOVID-19 is diagnosed with PCR testing, which is common for virus monitoring. This test examines the presence of a unique genetic sequence of viruses in a sample taken from the patient. The test takes several hours thus generating a bottleneck in identifying COVID-19 infected people in Israel and around the world.\n\n\u201cToday, we receive approximately 200 COVID-19 test samples a day, and each sample undergoes individual examination,\u201d said Dr. Yuval Gefen, director of the Rambam Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. \u201cAccording to the new pooling approach we have currently tested, molecular testing can be performed on a \u2018combined sample,\u2019 taken from 32 or 64 patients. This way we can significantly accelerate the testing rate. Only in those rare cases, where the joint sample is found to be positive, will we conduct an individual test for each of the specific samples.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Gates Foundation Commits $100 Million to Speeding Up Coronavirus Treatments and Response\n\nAccording to Professor Roy Kishony, head of the research group in the Faculty of Biology\n\nat Technion, \u201cThis is not a scientific breakthrough, but a demonstration of the effectivity of using the existing method and even the existing equipment to significantly increase the volume of samples tested per day. This is done by pooling multiple samples in a single test tube. Even when we conducted a joint examination of 64 samples in which only one was a positive carrier, the system identified that there was a positive sample.\n\n\u201cAlthough there are some logistical challenges in implementing the method, we expect that it will greatly increase the volume of samples tested per day so that we can identify the asymptomatic carriers. This approach should reduce the chance of infection and flatten the infection curve.\u201d\n\nDirector of the Rambam Virology Lab, Dr. Moran Szwarcwort-Cohen estimates that, \u201cimplementing pooling in the final stage of the PCR test will make it easier for us to shorten the entire process and significantly increase the test rate.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: CDC Director Commits to Free Coronavirus Testing for Anyone in the US Regardless of Insurance\n\nThe American Technion Society supports visionary education and world-changing impact through the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology. Based in New York City, the institution represent thousands of US donors, alumni, and stakeholders who invest in the Technion\u2019s growth and innovation to advance critical research and technologies that serve the global good. Now with a presence in three countries, the Technion will prepare the next generation of global innovators.\n\nPresident of the Technion Professor Uri Sivan said: \u201cThis experiment conducted by Technion and Rambam researchers is complex, and under normal circumstances would take months. This is a remarkable example of the mobilization of an outstanding team in a time of crisis. The initial experiment was completed in less than four days. This achievement emphasizes the importance of the close relationship between Technion and Rambam and between medicine and engineering. Technion researchers have been enlisted in the war against the coronavirus and this is one of the many activities currently underway at Technion to combat the spread of the disease.\u201d\n\nMultiply The Good By Sharing The News With Your Friends On Social Media \u2013 Representative photo by U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Stephanie Sauberan",

But the really remarkable thing about Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Quisocala is that he is still a child himself. When many of his peers dreamed of becoming professional footballers, firefighters or cumb\u00eda music stars, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo had his sights set on the world of finance from an early age. By the age of seven, attending a state school in the Peruvian city of Arequipa, he decided he wanted to create a bank for children. He was motivated by seeing his peers skipping lunch because they had spent the little money they had on sweets or football cards. What drove him even more was the poverty he saw among children who were not attending his primary school. \u201cSeeing children living in poverty, seeing many children working in the streets, at the traffic lights selling sweets, begging \u2026 made me think, why can\u2019t these children go to a normal school,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOne of the reasons why those kids were working was because there was no money at home. Why can\u2019t I teach them to save?\u201d The Bartselana student bank he founded then now has more than 2,000 clients between the ages of 10 and 18 and offers loans, microinsurance and other financial services. The children can withdraw money from the cashpoints of several banks and building societies using personal bank cards, which no one else can use, and monitor their balances online. He also set savings goals his clients had to reach in order to withdraw money. Seven years ago, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo managed to convince a handful of teachers and pupils that his idea could work. Then a student prize from his local town hall helped him get the support of a local cooperative to formally register his bank. Since then he has won awards nationally, then internationally and he has not looked back. From winning Unicef\u2019s Child and Youth Finance International Award in 2014 to the Children\u2019s Climate Prize in 2018 and more recent accolades, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo has combined financial and environmental services. The student bank really took off when he came up with an innovative way for the children to earn money by collecting recyclable plastic or paper waste. \u201cThe children would sometimes bring savings of a few cents and I had promised that they could buy a bicycle, a computer or a laptop but with that amount of money it would take a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought there must be a way they can earn money and I thought about rubbish; we all generate rubbish and I decided that was the solution.\u201d The children bring plastic bottles, used school exercise books and old newspapers to a kiosk at their school where it is weighed and their bank accounts are credited with the corresponding amount of money. Jos\u00e9 Adolfo struck deals with local recycling companies to pay his bank\u2019s clients a slightly higher price than normal; for example 0.80 Peruvian Soles (0.19 GBP) a kilogram of plastic or white paper. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be in the street collecting rubbish but at home stopping the rubbish from reaching the street. So in their homes, they put out boxes for cardboard, paper, bottles \u2013 they start collecting and it becomes valuable,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Adolfo explains. His efforts have not gone unnoticed by Peru\u2019s environment ministry, which has made home recycling one of its principal campaigns. The country has introduced a law to tackle its estimated 18,000 tonnes of solid waste a day, half of which is not disposed of in landfills and ends up on streets, beaches and in rivers. \u201cHe\u2019s making an incredible change in financial structuring and financial education that perhaps many adults could not have come up with,\u201d said Peru\u2019s environment minister, Luc\u00eda Ruiz, as she joined Jos\u00e9 Adolfo at a recent event in Arequipa. \u201cBy joining that with recycling and the handling of waste, a serious problem in our country, he\u2019s scoring a double goal because he\u2019s not just designing a financial opportunity for children and teenagers but also helping to reduce the amount of waste in the country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very hectic life for a 14-year-old,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Adolfo says. \u201cEven so, I\u2019m passionate about what I do and I always tell people they should do what they like rather than what others believe they should do.\u201d The bank recycles about four tonnes of material a month and has kiosks in seven schools in Arequipa; more are on a waiting list. Increasingly the model is in demand in the rest of Peru and abroad. Meanwhile, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo is studying online as he no longer has time to attend school. \u201cHe\u2019s given up many childhood things \u2013 games, activities, what normal children do \u2013 but he too is a normal child, he just sees things differently and thinks in another way,\u201d says his father, Herbert Quisocala, who left his job a year ago to help his son. \u201cIf he wants to cry, I\u2019m here to help him understand that life is like that and you have to learn to accept the good with the bad.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Are you dreaming of a green Christmas? Households and individuals across the UK are turning their backs on the vulgarity of Christmas consumerism and waste by cutting back on obvious and most visible areas of excess such as unwanted gifts, plastic trees and decorations and unrecyclable wrapping paper. But the scale of our extravagance remains shocking. The Bank of England has calculated that the average UK household will splurge \u00a3800 extra in December on food and drink as well as gifts. Included in this is an average of 17 gifts bought per individual, according to online retailer Amazon. And according to a recent study by waste management company Biffa, the UK creates 30% more waste than usual over Christmas. This includes an estimated 227,000 miles of wrapping paper and 1bn cards that end up in the bin. An estimated 20% of gifts \u2013 some 120m items \u2013 will be headed for landfill on Boxing Day, according to the UK Gift Card &amp; Voucher Association. To make the most of the festive season without costing the earth, there are numerous other steps consumers can take to reduce their mountain of food waste, opt for the most carbon-efficient cooking, lighting and heating and even trim tedious miles spent on the motorway. The charity Oxfam helped blaze a trail with its range of poverty-busting ethical gifts including the \u201cvirtual goat\u201d. Today, there is greater recognition the value of swapping physical gifts for more meaningful and useful experiences, and even investing time in volunteering. Which is more eco-friendly \u2013 a real or an artificial tree? Fresh trees are the more eco-friendly choice, as long as they are from a sustainable source. There are now well over 400 Christmas tree growers across the UK registered with the British Christmas Tree Growers\u2019 Association, where trees are grown to guidelines governing sustainable cultivation. Look also for the FSC certification logo or Soil Association organic certification which means that no pesticides have been used during growing. You could also choose a tree with roots so that it can be replanted and enjoyed year after year. Artificial, plastic trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have less environmental impact than natural alternatives, depending on how they are disposed of. However local charity shops may accept them for resale if they are in good condition. A 2-metre (6.5ft) artificial tree has a carbon footprint equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is burned. Many consumers are also now opting to rent trees \u2013 complete with lights and decorations. Check your local garden centres or plant nursery, which will usually also deliver and collect the tree to save you the hassle. Among alternatives, Waitrose is selling a 30cm-high \u201cedible\u201d rosemary tree, shaped like its traditional counterpart, which can be used as a decoration or a Christmas table centrepiece. Friends of the Earth suggests that in smaller spaces indoor plants such as yucca or palm trees could be perked up with decorations. An estimated 8m trees decorated homes and offices across Britain last year, of which only 10% were recycled. The rest went into landfill, a wasted opportunity to create biomass that would have provided nutrients for depleted soil. Many local authorities and garden centres will be recycling Christmas trees in January. What alternative gifts would be better for the planet? Buy less and buy local. Each Christmas, a staggering 4,000 tonnes of products arrive in the UK by container from China. Presents bought locally means you will be supporting small suppliers and makers, while minimising your carbon footprint. Initiatives such as Small Business Saturday help, but support local retailers at other times too. Through its #AirWeShare campaign the environmental charity Hubbub urges shoppers to consider more environmentally friendly options for online shopping, including switching to a click and collect service to reduce the amount of city centre deliveries. The Carbon Trust says gifts that don\u2019t consume electricity, such as toys and books, tend to have a lower carbon footprint than those that do. Buying good quality toys means they can be passed on to friends, family and charity shops, giving them a second or even a third life. And think whether you have to buy physical gifts? Could you buy an \u201cexperience\u201d instead? Try gift tokens, cinema tickets, museum membership and so on. Sponsor an animal, buy some rainforest to protect, or even have a stab at making your own, including foodie gifts such as chutneys and cookies. Emi Murphy, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cChristmas presents don\u2019t need to cost the earth. By shopping around a little you can find unique gifts that support the fight against the climate crisis, keep plastic out of our oceans and boost tree cover.\u201d Deck the halls with boughs of \u2026 anything eco-friendly? Choose decorations wisely and keep them to use again. As tinsel can\u2019t be recycled, try to limit how much you buy, and keep what you have to use year on year. Most tinsel sold in the UK is made in China (and of dubious quality), although John Lewis\u2019s is made in a factory in Wales (which churns out 12,000km a year, enough if laid end to end to get from the UK to South Africa). Wrapping paper is one of the most wasted materials at Christmas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates that last year\u2019s wasted paper would be enough to wrap up Guernsey. If we all recycled just half the 8,000 tonnes produced we\u2019d save 25,000 trees. When wrapping steer clear of anything shiny, plastic-lined or decorated with glitter, which are not recyclable. Try the \u201cscrunch\u201d test \u2013 anything that doesn\u2019t hold its shape when scrunched into a ball is not recyclable. Use salvageable materials like newspaper, brown paper, textiles, string, raffia (made from bark which regenerates) and vintage ribbon. Wrapping in newspaper (try the distinctive Eyewitness photo double page spread in the middle of the Guardian which my family has been doing for years) looks better than it sounds. Increasingly popular and Instagrammable is wrapping with brightly coloured fabric \u2013 based on the traditional Japanese art of furoshiki. Ditch the commercial Christmas crackers which are typically dusted with glitter (containing microplastics) and contain ghastly plastic toys that nobody wants anyway. Make your own (Lakeland and Hobbycraft do handy packs of \u201cfill your own\u201d) and invite your guests to make their own hats. What\u2019s the best thing to do for homeless people this Christmas? Homelessness has reached epidemic proportions in the UK, where half of the homeless people are in London. Official figures show that at least 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018 \u2013 a 22% increase on the previous year and the largest rise since records began in 2013. Homelessness charities say you can best help by donating directly to them in order to maximise resources. St Mungo\u2019s, for example, says \u00a325 would pay for a health check, \u00a350 could fund a counselling session or \u00a3100 could buy resources for the charity\u2019s Recovery College. Petra Salva, director of rough sleeper services at St Mungo\u2019s, said: \u201cRough sleeping is harmful and dangerous at any time, [but is] increased when temperatures drop dramatically over times such as Christmas. I would encourage people to contact StreetLink to help connect someone with their local service as soon as possible. Giving money and food is a personal choice; we would encourage people to contact charities like St Mungo\u2019s to see how they can help people in the long term.\u201d Where can I volunteer? Check out whether local charities, old people\u2019s homes, homeless shelters and food banks could do with a spare pair of hands. The Trussell Trust welcomes volunteers over Christmas for its 1,200-strong network of food banks across the UK, to help hand out a record number of emergency food parcels. The national food redistribution charity FareShare seeks volunteers at its depots across the UK to help sort food donated by supermarkets and to drive it to recipients such as charities and community projects serving up meals. You can also help FareShare by choosing a green token through its Community Matters \u201cgreen token\u201d scheme on Waitrose.com over Christmas. A similar scheme is FoodCycle, which welcomes volunteers for its 34 projects across the UK. Loneliness is always an issue at Christmas. You can volunteer or donate to Age UK, which says there are 1.4 million \u201cchronically lonely\u201d older people in England alone. What can I do to reduce my carbon footprint in the kitchen? If you are stuck when choosing what to cook, the Carbon Trust points out that turkey has a lower carbon footprint than beef, while vegetarian and vegan options are even lower than that. If you can\u2019t steer clear of red meat make sure it\u2019s British. Don\u2019t overdo the cheeseboard, which has a high carbon footprint. Don\u2019t preheat the oven for too long, or leave it on after the meal is prepared to keep food heated. And eat up those leftovers. What about plastics? It\u2019s hard but not impossible to have a plastics-free Christmas. Food packaging is tricky, but supermarket chain Iceland is offering customers the choice of a plastic-free or reduced plastic packaging Christmas dinner this year. It is selling 18 Christmas products that are completely free from plastic packaging, including stuffing balls and black forest layered pavlova. Selfridges is removing plastic packaging from its own brand range of Christmas food, switching to home compostable alternatives for 90,000 mince pies and 3,000 Christmas cakes. Dispense with plastic cling film by using reusable beeswax-covered cotton cloths, available from Waitrose and Lakeland. And make you sure you recycle aluminium \u2013 popular as mince pie wrappers \u2013 correctly. A new campaign from the Co-op chain aims to stop tonnes of aluminium \u2013 including mince pie wrappers, from being dumped into landfill. Its research shows that more than one in five (22%) of UK adults do not recycle household aluminium and that more than 3,000 tonnes could end up in the general household waste. How can I reduce my travel? Hundreds of thousands of people will be criss-crossing the UK over the holiday, driving significant distances to visit family and friends \u2013 what some environmentalists refer to as \u201clove miles\u201d \u2013 adding to greenhouse gases and congestion. Avoid air travel if at all possible. Where a large number of people are travelling, the Carbon Trust advises people to check to see whether they can share a car or take public transport (though the railways are not for the faint-hearted at this time of year). Use car sharing websites and apps such as Liftshare and GoCarShare \u2013 sharing a journey means a lower carbon footprint for each passenger, less traffic on the roads, splitting fuel costs and hopefully enjoying some company. It urges people to consider a Skype chat rather than a visit. Can I offset my Christmas? Everything seems to be carbon-offsettable these days (you can even offset fake news now by paying to support its antidote \u2013 Guardian journalism). Offsetting Christmas is slightly harder (despite what companies offering opportunities to do so might say). With tree planting all the range now, you could forgo the palaver of getting a Christmas fir and dedicate a tree to a loved one \u2013 it\u2019ll offset some carbon emissions, too. * * * Reading list Turning the Tide on Plastic by Lucy Siegle Veganish by Jack Monroe * * * Useful blogs 21 eco-friendly Christmas tips from Friends of the Earth Plan for a less wasteful Christmas from Recycle Now The Sustainable Christmas Guide from the Sustainable Restaurant Association Organic Gift Guides from the Soil Association",

    "transcript": "There is light drizzle as Vijay Aggarwal and Ajay Mittal manoeuvre their two-wheelers through the labyrinthine alleyways of Kolkata\u2019s Tiljala road slum. Early Sunday morning, the neighbourhood is teeming with activity \u2013 women sit on their haunches washing clothes and utensils; half-soaped children scurry in and out of their baths; towel-clad men wait to brush their teeth. Every 50 metres a community pipe gushes out water \u2013 plastic bottles, jerry cans and metal buckets are lined up to fill. The duo along with their plumber, Ravi Shaw, who rides pillion, make their way to the first huddle of people and get to work. All it takes is a blow and twist of a wrench \u2013 the nozzle pops loose. Shaw fishes out an orange and white tap from his bag and fits it. While Aggarwal hurriedly plasters a Save Water Save Life sticker on to a lamppost, Mittal tells the people to close the tap once they are done and points out the helpline number on the sticker. As the three gather their tools, Aggarwal says: \u201cIt literally took two minutes to install a tap on this pipe \u2013 in return we have just saved the city gallons of water.\u201d It was a casual moment that spurred Aggarwal into action. \u201cIn July last year, I was dropping my son off to school when at a traffic signal, I watched water gush out of a tap-less roadside pipe,\u201d says Aggarwal, who runs a travel and tourism agency. Irked by what he saw, Aggarwal, 40, returned with his friend Mittal, 29. They bought taps at the local hardware store, hired a plumber and fixed 12 pipes on the street. The Fix for Life campaign to conserve water in Kolkata was born. In a country where safe drinking water is a development goal, Kolkata relies on its treatment plants to meet 95% of its needs. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) produces 450m gallons of filtered water every day at its three main treatment plants. Apart from domestic and commercial complexes, KMC also provides potable water to the streets and slums for a few hours every day through an estimated 17,000 roadside pipes. For the 5 million people who reside in the city and 6 million who commute daily from the suburbs for work, this freely available safe drinking water is a life force. However, a recent KMC survey conducted in six of its 144 wards estimates that 30% of the water simply runs down the drain. The survey found about 10% of the wastage was due to these roadside pipes that do not have taps. \u201cWe had installed taps earlier but they are regularly stolen or broken,\u201d says Mainak Mukherjee, the director general of KMC\u2019s water supply department. \u201cA large part of our budget is dedicated to providing clean drinking water. Kolkata is also one of the few cities in India where water is tax-free.\u201d But without taps most of these efforts go to waste. Since July, every weekend members of Aggarwal\u2019s civic society group, Active Citizens Together for Sustainability (ACTS), conduct \u201cwater drives\u201d to fix taps. \u201cIn these last eight months we have conducted over 70 drives in several pockets of the city,\u201d says Mittal. \u201cOn our most productive day we fix about 30 to 35 taps.\u201d The target is to have fixed 1,500 by Sunday, which is World Water Day. But finding these pipes is a challenge. \u201cThere is no official data on the exact location of these pipes. This costs us precious time,\u201d says Mittal. Here, other concerned citizens, community clubs and even police stations have reached out over social media to help accelerate their efforts. \u201cPeople send us photos of pipes in their neighbourhood and we plan our drives along that route,\u201d says Aggarwal, showing a WhatsApp text on his smartphone with photos of open pipes. \u201cWe will fix these this weekend. Our helpline is flooded with such messages.\u201d ACTS has been helped by citizens such as Ashfaq Alam, a shopkeeper in the Tiljala slum, who earlier used his own money to install taps on the pipe that is being fixed. \u201cIt did get stolen but we installed it again. Sometimes you have to take matters in your own hands,\u201d he says. A few years ago, the Lutheran World Service India Trust also ran a similar campaign in Kolkata to tap the pipes in surrounding streets. Some are unimpressed by the efforts. \u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d says Bindu Das as the team fixes the pipe on his street. \u201cThe children in the neighbourhood will break it in a few days.\u201d The solution to this is to use plastic taps. Mittal says: They last but they don\u2019t have much resale value. We also go back and replace stolen or leaking taps if you reach out on our helpline.\u201d Mukherjee concedes that this colossal wastage is mainly due to a lack of civic awareness. As Mittal points out, citizen-led initiatives can only complement the government. \u201cThere are just a few of us and it takes a lot of time to bring up our tally count. If only the government could do this in all the wards in the city, we could solve this problem in a week.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "Barely a day goes by without a new anti-plastic initiative: the Dutch supermarket with a plastic-free aisle; the Bali inhabitants sweeping the island for jetsam, the moves to get plastic out of teabags - and even out of Lego. And that was all just this week. But can we - or should we - aim to move beyond plastics altogether? What are the alternatives to a material that has dominated packaging for 70 years? Promising new technologies are vying for attention, but plastic is so ubiquitous \u2013 and so useful \u2013 that it will not simply disappear. Rob Opsomer, systemic initiatives lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation believes that 50% of plastic packagings could be recycled if they, or after-use systems, were better designed, and 20% could be tackled by reuse schemes. However about 30% of plastics need a fundamental rethink to prevent them ending up in landfill. It\u2019s a sentiment that is gathering pace, with small businesses, laboratory scientists, corporate giants and individual innovators scrutinising every aspect of the plastic problem, from product design to sophisticated new biodegradable bioplastics. New materials Among those exploring alternatives to traditional plastics is Jeffrey Catchmark, professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Penn State University, who is plumbing the potential of naturally occurring polymers. Among the team\u2019s successes are waterproof coatings made from cellulose and chitosan \u2013 the latter a material made by treating the shells of crustaceans. Not only are these coatings compostable, and break down in the environment, but they offer other benefits since they also act as adhesives, making the recycled products even better than the virgin packaging. \u201cIn fact [the waterproof coating] is completely compatible with the processes that the recyclers use to treat the paper pulp in order to prepare that for the next product that is made,\u201d says Catchmark. Israel-based Tipa is one of the packaging companies focussing on bioplastics, and is developing their own flexible packaging. While the company admits their products are more expensive than traditional plastic, the approach could tackle one of the big problems with plastic wrappers, such the films that surround your tomatoes. \u201cThat plastic is not recyclable because it is three different plastics,\u201d said Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at University College London. Tipa claims that its material \u2013 produced from a combination of biological and synthetic materials \u2013 breaks down rapidly in a home composter, unlike most so-called compostable plastics which only properly degrade in industrial treatment facilities. \u201cJust imagine that all flexible packaging will be treated and will behave the same way as organic waste,\u201d said Daphna Nissenbaum, CEO of Tipa. \u201cWhat we offer is a packing solution that on the one hand is similar to conventional plastic, it brings us as consumers the same benefits as plastic, but on the other hand, [it is] fully compostable.\u201d However Miodownik is cautious, noting that for compostables to catch on, the starting materials have to be sustainable or otherwise make use of abundant waste materials, such as waste oil, whereas recycling means resources can be used again and again. Nonetheless, so far Tipa\u2019s flexible packaging has been embraced by businesses including snack-company Snact and fashion designer Stella McCartney. Others, meanwhile, have embraced a golden oldie: cellulose. Made from the plant polymer, cellophane is the wrapping that got us hooked on the idea of \u201cseeing what we buy\u201d but ended up being usurped by cheaper films made of plastic with a host of attractive properties. Now some, including Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Quality Street are going back, using cellulose films from UK-based firm Futamura for their wrappings. Andy Sweetman of Futamura said its NatureFlex range is made from sustainable raw materials and can be industrially or home composted. And while the toxic chemical carbon disulphide is still used in manufacturing, this is now fed back into the system, tackling environmental concerns. Packaging made from seaweed promises another alternative to sachets and wrappers. Jakarta-based Evoware say both food-grade and packaging-grade products are available, with the focus on use in the food and drink, beauty, jewellery and electronic industries. One use, they note, is to package seasonings for instant noodles, with the sachets breaking down in hot water. Seaweed-based packaging has even been deployed for water, with London-based start-up Skipping Rocks Lab developing Ooho: squidgy liquid-filled balls that last for a few days and can be eaten. Among others keen to see their packaging eaten is Peggy Tomasula of the US Department of Agriculture whose team has used proteins from milk to make films which are claimed to be better than plastic at keeping oxygen out. Improved product design From coffee cups to drinks packaging and juice cartons, solutions are proliferating. A host of companies have taken-off, selling reusable alternatives to single-use coffee cups, and many cafes now offer discounts for their use. Others are redesigning single-use products, like the Triocup \u2013 a paper coffee cup which folds over at the top, removing the need for a plastic lid. Triocup co-founder Tom Chan said the ultimate aim was to remove the plastic lining too, making the vessel compostable or recyclable. UK-based FrugalPac, is also looking to tackle drinks packaging, with easy to recycle juice cartons and a coffee cup that, it claims, \u201ccan be recycled in any UK paper mill\u201d. Rather than using paper with a tightly bonded plastic layer, the cup is made from recycled paper that easily breaks down at the mill, while the waterproof plastic lining floats free and can be scooped off, or removed by filters. \u201cWe should be making it a lot easier for consumers to be recycling these products and the way to do it is to redesign them so that they will go in existing recycling streams,\u201d said Martin Myerscough, founder of the company, adding that eventually the team want to replace the plastic lining. Back to basics New materials take time to develop, and the pressing challenge for supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles, or go plastic-free all together, means some are turning to existing alternatives. Iceland has pledged that its own-brand items will be plastic-packaging free by 2023, embracing \u201ca range of packaging comprising paper and pulp trays along with paper bags\u201d. Tesco, which has set its target at 2025, has reduced the amount of plastic in some of its packaging \u2013 including meat trays \u2013 as well as making supportive noises about the much-mooted deposit-return scheme. Plastic water bottles \u2013 possibly the epitome of single-use plastic waste \u2013 have already been replaced in venues, including London Zoo which now uses recyclable aluminium cans. Although still single-use containers, cans are recycled at higher rates than plastic bottles, and each is largely made of recycled metal. \u201cAluminium is the most infinitely recyclable material on the market \u2013 as long as you recycle your can it will come back as another can and sometimes in as little as six weeks,\u201d says CanO Water\u2019s co-founder Ariel Booker. \u201cMost plastic gets downgraded, it can\u2019t be formed into another plastic bottle.\u201d While the resealable cans make use of a plastic lid, these are separated during the recycling process, he adds. But new innovations are also afoot: M&amp;S which already has 90% recyclable packaging is among those looking to find new types of black plastic for its ready meals, since the dyes in current packaging mean it cannot be sorted using existing tech and usually ends up in landfill. Clothes While once the idea that a fleece jumper could be made out of recycled plastic was considered eco-friendly, recent revelations about the extent of microplastic pollution from synthetic fibres has resulted in a u-turn, with the majority of modern clothes guilty culprits. Traditional textiles, including wool, cotton, hemp and flax are all alternatives, however that hasn\u2019t stopped new companies springing up with fresh approaches. Among them is Ananas-Anam, which produces a natural fibre from pineapple leaves, while Bionics makes fibres from reclaimed ocean plastic and wraps them or blends them with natural fibres. There is even a new alternative to leather, made from the grape by-products of the wine industry. In summary, there is no shortage of promising technology in the pipeline.

    "transcript": "When Clare Dubois\u2019s car skidded on an icy road in Stroud, Gloucestershire, a tree prevented her vehicle tumbling into a ravine. It was, she says, a sign. Humanity is nearing a precipice. Trees can stop us going over the edge. This calling was so strong that Dubois, a business life coach, founded TreeSisters with a friend, Bernadette Ryder, to take on a daunting mission: to reforest the tropics within a decade. In 2014, their new charity funded its first 12,000 trees by encouraging western women to make small monthly donations to reforestation projects in the tropics. Today TreeSisters is planting 2.2m trees (average cost: 33p a tree) each year across Madagascar, India, Kenya, Nepal, Brazil and Cameroon. \u201cWe have to make it as natural to give back to nature as it is to take nature for granted,\u201d Dubois says, musing on the need to \u201cshift from a consumer species to a restorer species\u201d. She is not alone. The global elite is embracing tree-hugging rhetoric. It is as if the world has suddenly woken up to the restorative powers of plants. Forests can stop runaway global heating, encourage rainfall, guarantee clean water, reduce air pollution, and provide livelihoods for local people and reserves for rare wildlife. Politicians are waking up to the potential of \u201cnatural climate solutions\u201d \u2013 reforestation and other ecological restoration \u2013 to capture carbon and tackle the climate crisis. Such solutions could provide 37% of the greenhouse gas mitigation required to provide a good chance of stabilising global heating below the critical 2C threshold. In March the United Nations announced a Decade of Ecosystem Restoration and has set a target to restore 350m hectares \u2013 an area bigger than India \u2013 by 2030. India itself has pledged to plant 13m hectares of forest by 2020, Latin America is aiming at 20m hectares and African countries 100m hectares by 2030. China\u2019s aspiration is to plant an area of forest as large as Ireland every year. Trees are increasingly hailed as a solution for climate-stressed cities too, preventing overheating and reducing air pollution. In England, more than 130,000 trees are to be planted in towns and cities over the next two years. But it isn\u2019t as simple as just grabbing seeds and saplings and sticking them in the ground. Non-native plantations can cause problems for biodiversity, local livelihoods \u2013 or both. Grand pledges aren\u2019t always met. Dubois is only \u201cvaguely heartened\u201d by the new mood. She points out that a 2014 UN declaration pledged to halve deforestation by 2020. Instead, record deforestation ensued and in 2018 an area of primary forest the size of Belgium was lost, the third-highest annual depletion since records began in 2001. Technology \u2013 such as tree-planting by drone \u2013 is often hailed as a game changer, but it can be hit-and-miss. \u201cEverybody thinks that smarter technology is going to save us,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cA significant amount of the materials required to be mined for that smarter technology are under the last remaining old-growth forests.\u201d TreeSisters refuses to use drones, \u201cbecause we\u2019re all about the relationship between people and trees\u201d, says Dubois. \u201cIt\u2019s the disconnect between people and trees that drives deforestation. We need people connected with forests.\u201d TreeSisters\u2019 philosophy is different: local, community-based reforestation with native trees in the tropics. \u201cThe tropical forest belt provides cooling and rainfall,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the delivery system for a habitable climate for all of us.\u201d In Madagascar, the charity is helping Eden Reforestation Projects replant lost mangrove and dry deciduous forests on the north-west coast. Mangroves are a wonder-tree for local and global ecosystem services; they protect human communities from coastal floods but also filterriver flows out to sea and prevent soil washing into the ocean and destroying coral reefs. They are also crucial nurseries for juvenile fish. Most importantly, perhaps, studies suggest they can sequester four times more carbon than rainforest. Between 2000 and 2015, the equivalent of Brazil\u2019s annual carbon emissions was released by the destruction of mangrove forests. Eden employs local people to gather and plant mature propagules from mangroves. These seedlings usually fall from the tree and stick straight in the mud or float away until they reach another shore and grow. The mangrove-planters also clear debris from the forest because logs and debris shifted by the currents can destroy seedlings. (The debris is piled in particular spots so it creates wildlife habitat.) At most planting sites, the two-week tide cycle contains a six-day window when planters can canoe into the mangroves, plant propagules and catch the outgoing tide before they get stranded on the mudflats at low tide. \u201cOur goal is twofold: reforestation and poverty alleviation,\u201d says Jamie Shattenberg, international director of Eden Reforestation Projects, Madagascar. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do reforestation and you ignore the human issue \u2013 poverty \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to find success, because the forest is what people turn to last if they have no other sustainable livelihood.\u201d In the project\u2019s first year, eight people planted 100,000 mangroves. Now Eden employs more than 1,000 people to plant trees, with 225m new mangrove trees planted since 2006. Some Malagasy planters were enslaved to local fish barons because they owed money for using their fishing equipment; tree-planting income has enabled them to repay their debts and escape this bondage. Restoring coastal mangroves is not simple. Eden plants mainly on government and community land along the coast, with the support of local villages. Most mangrove is no-man\u2019s land but people still claim rights to establish shrimp farms or raid forests for timber for building and charcoal. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s really now destroying them is charcoal,\u201d says Shattenberg. \u201cOnce a mangrove forest is cut down it takes generations to refill, the mud starts eroding and kills the reef and a negative cycle starts. We\u2019ve had areas tree-poached, and we\u2019ve put guards in. Charcoal is a constant problem, and you can\u2019t change it overnight because so much of Madagascar relies on charcoal for their cooking. It\u2019s like telling England and France \u2018no more gas\u2019. You have to find a different source of fuel and make it affordable.\u201d Then there is a \u201ccharcoal mafia\u201d: \u201cYou get in the way of charcoal directly and you\u2019re in the way of people\u2019s money and people don\u2019t like that.\u201d Shattenberg is optimistic, however, about visible changes to the environment \u2013 and consciousness. \u201cMassive areas are starting to come back and the Malagasy are seeing changes in the fish, crab and wildlife populations. We\u2019re seeing a change in how people feel about the forest. They recognise they can protect it. It\u2019s for Madagascar, for the Malagasy people and it\u2019s for the future of our world.\u201d A similar emphasis on reforestation for local people is driving the restoration of deforested Mount Kenya. TreeSisters is working with the International Tree Foundation (ITF), a charity founded in 1924 by a visionary forester in colonial Kenya called Richard St Barbe Baker. The charity was originally called Men of the Trees. Now it is supporting reforestation led by local women. \u201cOne of the very clear learnings we\u2019ve had is that the more you can work with local organisations that are women-led or driven by women, the better your results,\u201d says Paul Laird, programmes manager at the ITF. \u201cIt is the women\u2019s groups that really drive and motivate, and men are often pleased to have women running it.\u201d Kenya is water-stressed, and dependent on seasonal rains for its water supply. Forest cover can influence rainfall and local humidity and temperature, as well as filter water. The country\u2019s current forest cover is a meagre 7% at best; Kenya\u2019s constitution commits to increasing it to 10%. Kenya has also signed the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) commitment to restore 5.1m hectares of degraded land in Kenya. But such targets are not yet creating much traction on the ground, according to Laird. Below Mount Kenya is a circle of humid montane forest. Google Earth reveals it is decidedly patchy. \u201cWhat happened to the forest? The 20th century happened to the forest,\u201d says Laird. The colonial regime harvested native forest and replaced it with eucalyptus and pine plantations \u2013 non-native monocultures that are \u201ca killer in terms of biodiversity\u201d, according to Laird. After independence, commercial gangs took timber and both rich and poor turned forest into farmland. The ITF is supporting local charities such as Mount Kenya Environmental Conservation to work with local women to establish small nurseries of native trees at the forest fringe. The sales of these tree seedlings provide the groups with an income, which is then distributed as loans to help women\u2019s farms and businesses. Native trees are planted directly into deforested areas, while a new scheme enables local people to temporarily grow potatoes in reforested areas, the cultivation helping native trees grow free of weeds for their first few years. The women also grow high-value grafted trees such as avocado and macadamia nut on their own burgeoning agro-forestry farms. \u201cWomen are the primary caretakers of the household and know their reliance on a healthy forest,\u201d says the Nairobi-based Teresa Gitonga of the ITF. \u201cThey are the people who look for firewood, they are the people who cook so they also look for water. Women are change agents. The only thing they need is to unlock their potential and know that planting trees will make their lives better.\u201d According to Anastacia Njoki, a member of a tree-planting group close to Mount Kenya, she and her fellow agro-foresters share experiences, as well as sing together. \u201cWe are doing it because we are the ones who have to collect the firewood. Instead of cutting a large tree, we are collecting dead wood,\u201d she says. But she recognises the wider benefits of trees to the region and Kenya itself. \u201cThe trees that we are planting are indigenous and we as a community are benefiting in one way or another to conserve our ecosystem and maintain the areas where our water is coming from,\u201d she says. Mount Kenya\u2019s forests, she says, make it their \u201cwater tower\u201d. In western countries, TreeSisters continues to raise awareness of a feminine way of responding to ecological crises and climate change, and the need to balance consumption with restoration. Dubois wants to embed restoration into every financial transaction: in other words, everything we buy must also include \u201ca kickback to nature\u201d. \u201cExtinction Rebellion has blasted through collective denial and there\u2019s suddenly a longing for solutions,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cWe\u2019re saying: \u2018Let\u2019s not wait for the government, we the people are the solution and can drive massive change.\u2019 We\u2019re talking about how we can move from rebellion to restoration.\u201d It may be difficult to measure how awareness is raised, but perhaps it can be guided by the straightforward measurement that is planting trees. As Dubois puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s tangible, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s life-giving.\u201d \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

    "transcript": "SOUTH GLENS FALLS, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 The 710 students from South Glens Falls High School danced for more than a day: Conga lines, \"Gangnam Style,\" giddy-ups, hand jives and the Harlem Shake. Then, flushed and weary, the teens showed why this is a dance marathon with a difference.\n\nStudents cleared a path for a group who walked or were wheeled to the stage set at one end of the gym. One by one \u2014 a woman battling cancer in a stocking cap, mothers of ailing children, car crash survivors \u2014 thanked the teenage dancers, who just raised almost $500,000 to help them tackle life's challenges.\n\n\"When a community comes together to help lift financial stress, which allows a child to get the proper care and have the best chance in life, that's priceless,\" Kate LaFoy told the hushed crowd in a choked voice. Her 15-month-old daughter Alessandra has Turner syndrome, a genetic condition. \"You know how they say it takes a village to raise a child? You're part of our village now. We are forever grateful.\"\n\nSouth Glens Falls High School students donated the hefty sum to LaFoy and 39 other recipients by dancing around the clock this weekend as part of an annual event in this small, weathered village just south of New York's Adirondack Mountains.\n\nThe dance marathon was started in 1978, the age of turntables and disco. It has morphed into a monster event consuming not only the students, but also the community. Kids go door to door seeking donations, sponsor pancake breakfasts and collect bottles, and they lean on family, friends and neighbors to pitch in. Locals \u2014 many who fondly remember their own dancing days \u2014 help direct traffic, donate goods for auction, paint faces or cut hair to raise money.\n\nAnd they open their wallets \u2014 something not so easily done in this village of about 3,500 souls still struggling to find its economic footing. Paper mills once powered by the Hudson River have shuttered, and residents have a median household income of $47,587, lagging behind the national figure of $52,762.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe weekend's record $489,716 easily topped the $395,352 collected last year, maintaining a trend of growing tallies. Some well-heeled colleges raise money into the seven figures with their annual dance marathons but you'd be hard-pressed to find any high schoolers pulling in this kind of dough.\n\n\"You're raised in the South Glens Falls community, you're expected to dance in the marathon dance,\" said senior Carly Weller, a member of the student committee that organizes the dance and selects recipients, all local. \"And after you do it once, you're hooked.\"\n\nThis dance marathon is different from the old endurance contests in which the last exhausted couple on the floor escapes the tap on the shoulder to win. The teenage dancers get a couple of hours to sleep, plenty of food and drinks and some other breaks from Friday night to Saturday night. There are costume parades and opportunities to chill out on the gym floor.\n\nBut it's still grueling.\n\n\"Definitely sleep during sleep break, drink lots of water, (use) deodorant,\" said senior Blake Snyder. \"Deodorant is key. And change your socks every time you can because if your feet are comfortable, you're comfortable.\"\n\nStudents get by not only on adrenaline, but also the knowledge that they are contributing to something larger in their community, said art teacher Tom Myott, an adviser for the marathon. Myott said the marathon's mission has been consistent since he was a student dancer three decades ago. Now it's his daughter's turn: freshman Mackenzie Myott danced her first marathon this weekend.\n\nThe 40 recipients chosen by students this year include children and adults fighting potentially fatal illnesses, a family recovering after a house fire and a local food pantry.\n\n\"The money will come in very handy,\" said Kristina Lemery, whose 4-year-old son Lukas has a brain tumor. \"The bills are still coming in the mail and it seems that it's never ending.\"\n\nAs Lukas bounced around a school room set aside for recipients, Lemery explained that he still faces potential peril and that he is blind in one eye.\n\n\"The tumor might grow back, he might need another surgery. He might need chemo. Right now we just take it day by day. ... So it's really nice that in such hard times, there's something joyful.\"\n\nLemery was among the recipients who lined up in the gym to say a few words to the dancers and the families packing the stands at the end of the marathon Saturday night.\n\nThe thanks were as profuse as the tears.\n\nThen the grand total was announced. The marathon was over and the dancers melted into each other's arms.\n\n\"Physically I'm exhausted. Emotionally I'm exhausted,\" Weller said. \"But I've never been as happy in my life.\"",

    "transcript": "Needless to say that plastic pollution, the accumulation of plastic objects in the Earth's environment, is increasing day by day. And, most importantly, it is adversely affecting wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans at a high rate. Not only land but an increase in plastic waste is also affecting waterways and oceans the most.\n\nHowever, certain people started to look for positive initiatives for changing the current tragic state that we are living in. Yes, there are examples which are proving all hope isn\u2019t lost to save our planet. And, one of those great examples is this Indian couple who operates a school that charges students in plastic instead of money for education and also transforming the entire town. Let\u2019s know more about it!\n\nAbout Indian Couple Who Took This Initiative\n\nSource = Wtvideo\n\nHere we are talking about Parmita and Mazin, one other great couple same as the Brazilian couple who restored a destroyed forest. But here, the story is a little different.\n\nParmita & Mazin is the Indian couple that created this unconventional school in India where students carry bags of plastic every day on their way to school. Shocking but true!\n\nMazin had arrived in India from New York back in 2013 on a different school project. Due to his work, he later met Parmita, who was a Master\u2019s student in Social Work at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). And coincidentally, she was also planning to work in the education sector.\n\nBefore this school was established, most of these children worked as laborers in the local stone quarries. But the founders began to increasingly attract more children to school because of their focused curriculum and a passion for teaching and bringing the community together. They started with 20 children at first, but now they have grown to 110.\n\nAbout Akshar Foundation\n\nAkshar Foundation's revolutionary model gives underprivileged students all the skills they need to build productive lives for themselves.\n\nIt was started in June of 2016 by Parmita Sarma and Mazin Mukhtar in the northeastern Indian state of Assam on the southern boundary of the Himalayas.\n\nApart from regular studies, the foundation teaches students how to take responsibility for their environment and how to improve it.\n\nAnd, this school became the first one where students pay their \"school fees\" in the form of clean plastic waste from their homes. Also, they let students participate in the school Recycling Center while learning environmental science.\n\n\u200bHow They Got the Idea?\n\nSource = Twimg\n\nAccording to Sarma and Mukhtar, the key moments that led to the idea of recycling was when their classrooms would fill with toxic fumes as people nearby would burn plastic waste during the winter to keep their place warm.\n\nThey said that it was common in their area. Families there collect waste, including plastics and then burn piles to keep their place warm during the winter, not knowing of the serious environmental and health harm from such a method.\n\nHence by looking at such a situation, the couple was determined to make a positive change within the community both educationally and environmentally. Hence, they began to encourage their students to bring plastic waste as a form of tuition since many of them struggled to afford the fees required to attend school.\n\nSource = Time8\n\nIn an interview, Mazin Mukhtar, the Co-Founder of the school, mentioned that he & his wife together came up with the idea.\n\n\u201cWe were both already dreaming of starting a new kind of school specifically designed for children in poverty. We formed Akshar that same year we met and we started our school, Akshar Forum, in 2016.\n\nWhen we started the recycling center, parents were not cooperative at first. So we came up with the \u201cPlastic School Fees\u201d idea to compel the parents to recycle. The school was free for years before we started that policy. In reality, it\u2019s more like mandatory homework than school fees but calling it plastic school fees serves to remind the parents: the school is entirely free but the least you can do is help us and help yourselves by sending your clean, dry plastic waste from home.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that, Parmita Sarma, one of the school founders, said,\n\n\u201cWe wanted to start a free school for all but stumbled upon this idea after we realized a larger social and ecological problem brewing in this area. I still remember how our classrooms would be filled with toxic fumes every time someone in the nearby areas would burn plastics. Here, it was the norm to burn waste plastic to keep warm. We wanted to change that and so started to encourage our students to bring their plastic waste as school fees\u201d\n\nHow Do They Work?\n\nSource = Creapills\n\nAs we mentioned earlier that before the school established, most of the children worked as laborers in the local stone quarries. There they would make around $2.50 a day.\n\nHowever, the school can\u2019t pay to children. Hence, they found an alternative. Akshar Foundation allows older students to teach younger ones. Instead of money, those young teachers earn toy currency notes that let students buy snacks, clothes, and papers. Hence, it was a learning experience for the school as well.\n\nMoreover, those young ones can also ask their teachers to buy something online if they need anything from there. So the teachers order anything the student wants from Amazon by changing their earned notes to real money.\n\nMeanwhile, the Akshar Foundation teaches their students and parents about the adverse effects of plastic usage. Parmita said that before the parents got the awareness, they used to burn plastic to warm their homes.\n\nShe added that they were shocked to learn about the hazards they were exposing their children to once the school started educating the community.\n\nSource = Creapills\n\nWhile speaking about the teaching methods at school, Mazin said,\n\n\u201cWe use child labor to fight child labor \u2013 kids in poverty need to earn money to stay in school, learning and earning. We employ children as tutors and social workers. This ensures that younger children receive daily tuition from an older, caring student.\n\nOur students learn more to earn more \u2013 we pay them based on their skills and knowledge, and fine them for bad behaviour. As students move from one grade level to the next, their wages increase. Also, wages increase with teaching skill. Students are strongly incentivised to behave like model students.\u201d\n\nHe added,\n\n\u201cPlace every student directly into a career \u2013 kids stay in school until the school finds a career for them \u2014 via college or apprenticeship in a high skill trade. Teens develop vocational skills, in addition to teaching, during the critical 12-18 age group. Students learn English, Math, and Science, but in secondary school, the curriculum incorporates Carpentry, Embroidery, Recycling, Photography and soon, a more developed Solar Technician course. We are developing a \u201cSchool-to-Career Pipeline\u201d.\n\nCharge them plastic school fees \u2013 teach them to be responsible for their surroundings. If every school does this, it can impact the plastic crisis. Students learn to address the problems afflicting their communities, and they develop machines and inventions as part of their coursework to address the problems.\u201d\n\nSource = Wixstatic\n\nPer week, around 25 pieces of plastic waste every student brings as their contribution to the community.\n\nThey continued saying,\n\n\u201cInitially, most of our teenage boys were dropouts and child laborers. Now, they earn money in school by teaching during school hours and operating our Recycling Center after school.\u201d\n\nAmong all these students, some of the at-risk teens are employed to compress dozens of plastic packets into plastic bottles to make \u201cEco-bricks.\u201d Such Eco-bricks are utilized for construction work by fixing them with cement.\n\nIt can be seen that in the picture of the small tree planter below, they used roughly 200 plastic bottles and 4,000 plastic packets ( half of them were non-recyclable).\n\nSource = Creapills\n\nMazin Mukhtar said,\n\n\u201cNext, we plan on building a dedicated girl\u2019s toilet using a combination of normal bricks and Eco-bricks.\u201d\n\nAt last, Parmita and Mazin, the couple that created this school, said that they aspire to create 100 schools like this across India in the future.\n\nWatch This Video to Learn More about the Foundation:\n\nHats Off to the Couple!",

    "transcript": "A talented farmer has created his own heartwarming tribute to the British National Health System (NHS) by using his tractor to plough a giant rainbow into one of his fields.\n\n33-year-old Jack Pantall used an aerial drone camera connected to his phone in order to map out the huge image of the NHS logo and the \u201cStay Safe\u201d rainbow in appreciation for Britain\u2019s healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe massive image measures in at 60 meters (196 feet) tall and 152 meters (500 feet) wide on his farm near Staunton-on-Wye in Herefordshire.\n\nPantall also managed to capture drone footage of himself creating the masterpiece, which took just 16 minutes to complete.\n\nMORE: New Jersey Teens Take Matters into Their Own Hands to Help First Responders and Small Businesses Amidst COVID-19 Crisis\n\nThe dad-of-two said he wanted to show his support for all of the NHS heroes\u2014particularly since his 31-year-old brother Harry is a paramedic and his sister-in-law works as a doctor.\n\n\u201cI had one field left I could use before my spring planting finished so I decided to do it as soon as a I could,\u201d said Pantall. \u201cMy brother and I had been thinking about it and we saw some other people showing their appreciation in different ways. He said, \u2018yeah why not let\u2019s do it\u2019.\n\n\u201cSomeone else in Exeter had done #NHS into some corn so we were thinking of something more original. My brother suggested putting the Stay Safe rainbow over the top. We decided to give it a go and the worst-case scenario was that it wouldn\u2019t come out right.\n\n\u201cThankfully, however, it did. It turned out beautifully.\n\n\u201cMy drone connects to my phone so I was watching my phone screen \u2026 to see how it was coming out while I was doing it,\u201d Pantall recalled. \u201cSo the video you\u2019re watching is how I was able to draw it.\n\nLOOK: College Student Has Been Sewing Free Face Masks For Communicating With Hearing-Impaired Folks\n\n\u201cI was driving around trying to get it done in a hurry because the drone battery only lasts about 20 minutes and I had to be relatively quick on it,\u201d he added. \u201cI managed to complete it in about 16 minutes, which was just in time, really.\u201d\n\nThe rainbow has become a symbol of support for people wanting to show solidarity with health workers on the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cMy gesture was just something we thought that we could do down at the field. It\u2019s just us showing a small amount of appreciation,\u201d says Pantall. \u201cAt the very least it brings a smile to people\u2019s faces and makes them know we are thinking of them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to broadcasting his message of support to NHS workers, Pantall has also set up a JustGiving page to support hospital staffers\u2014and he hopes his stunt can help raise money and spirits.\n\n\u201cThe NHS workers are the main ones we must thank because they\u2019re right in amongst it,\u201d said Pantall. \u201cIt was all just to say a massive thank you to them.\n\nMORE: Man Uses His Savings to Fill Up Gas Tanks For Dozens of Nurses Heading to Nearby Hospital\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got various friends who live next to us who are all nurses, resuscitation nurses, so they are in the mix of it.

Who are the people I look at and say, 'That's who I want to be'?\" For Demetrio Aguila, a Nebraska surgeon specializing in nerve pain, the answer to his own question is his father, also a physician\u2014and one who loved helping people so much he never complained about his long hours at work. Those genes appear to have been passed down to his son, who's making headlines for an innovative program meant to assist people who can't afford surgery. CBS News reports that Aguila, an Air Force veteran, set up his M25 program at his Healing Hands of Nebraska clinic after he saw patient after patient have to turn down surgery because it cost too much. Six months ago, he decided to do something about it, and his idea was a creative one: Let those who qualify do volunteer work in exchange for any necessary procedures.                                                                            \"We can't ignore the people in our own backyard,\" Aguila tells CBS. Per KMTV, the program's name comes from Matthew 25:40: \"Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.\" About 10% of his patients qualify for the program, which figures out the number of volunteer hours depending on how complex the surgery is; other people can help patients fulfill their hours. Reception so far has been positive. \"There's nothing more depressing than seeing a bill for ... $24,000, and going, 'And how much of this will my insurance cover?'\" patient Jeff Jensen tells CBS, noting that instead he put in 560 hours of volunteering (100 or so people helped) as barter for foot surgery. \"This whole practice is about restoring hope for patients by giving them the opportunity to wrest back control of their health care,\" Aguila says.  \u00a0",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/virtual-visits-finland-remote-care-ageing-population",
    "date": "2019-06-26",
    "transcript": "It\u2019s 11.30am on a midweek June morning in Helsinki, Finland. Duvi Leineberg, a remote care nurse, is doing the lunch rounds. But instead of jumping in a car and visiting each person one by one, she is sitting in an office looking at a large computer screen where she can see into seven people\u2019s homes. Most are sitting at a table preparing to tuck into some food. This is a virtual lunch group, set up to make sure older people receiving home care services in the city eat regularly and at the right time. Leineberg runs the session. She starts by checking everyone has their food and that it is warmed up. Some have soup, others have pre-prepared meals that have been delivered by home care services. People also sip coffee. One screen shows an empty backdrop and she calls the home to check her client is all right. He walks past the screen but says he isn\u2019t hungry and doesn\u2019t want to eat right now. Leineberg then asks everyone if they have any plans for the afternoon. A few reply that they will go out for a walk. A former hospital nurse, Leineberg sees the value of such groups. \u201cFirstly, the client feels like they are a part of a bigger thing. It\u2019s also guaranteed that they eat properly. If I spot anything that seems out of the ordinary, I can call the home care nurses who will pay them a visit if necessary.\u201d Her clients are also fans of the lunch group. Riitta Koskinen, 80, says through a translator: \u201cI\u2019m old and living alone and it\u2019s nice to have the company. We eat at the same time \u2013 food tastes better when you\u2019re with others \u2013 and I\u2019ve really enjoyed it. It makes me eat and it\u2019s good to see other people.\u201d Finland has a rapidly ageing population and recruitment problems in health and care. By 2070, one in three Finns is expected to be over 65. At the same time there has been a huge decline in the birth rate and the number of Finns of working age is expected to fall by around 200,000 by 2050. As a result, the demand for and cost of care services are growing while tax revenues are decreasing, leading politicians to warn that the Nordic model of highly state-funded cradle-to-grave social care will no longer be affordable. Taina Mantyranta, a medical counsellor at the Finnish ministry of social affairs and health, admits: \u201cFinland is facing economic constraints. We have been trying to reform our social and healthcare system for several decades. The need to develop more integrated social and health services has been clearly recognised also from a cost containment perspective. ICT and digitalisation are integral parts of the reform.\u201d The virtual lunch group is one aspect of Helsinki\u2019s remote care \u2013 where clients have a tablet that links up with remote care nurses in a service centre. Remote care appointments are set up to check on clients throughout the day and to make sure they take the relevant medication. There are 800 home care clients, and nurses carry out 24,000 remote care visits a month. By the end of 2019, the service hopes to cater for 1,100 clients. The potential savings are eye-watering. Whereas a physical home visit costs the equivalent of around \u00a340, a remote care visit is just \u00a34.50. Over the course of one shift, a remote care nurse can carry out over 50 visits \u2013 which works out almost 90% cheaper than if they had knocked on each of their client\u2019s doors. Little wonder that the city\u2019s service centre is hoping to start a remote dinner group soon as well as other sessions. They already take clients virtually to concerts and shows. Hanna H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, who works as a planner at the service, remembers when she took 64 clients virtually to a carol concert. A screen was placed on the front row and the priest greeted them while they watched at home on their tablets. She remembers: \u201cThe funny thing is that even if some had memory problems, they knew all the lyrics. That is the power of music and made me see that if there\u2019s a concert, we should be there.\u201d Neighbouring city Espoo is also exploring remote care. By 2027, 8% of its population will be over 75. Roope Lepp\u00e4nen, medical director of Espoo hospital, admits that there aren\u2019t the resources to deal with the increase. \u201cWe see remote care as a possibility. We are only starting but will expand these services quite rapidly in the coming years,\u201d he says. However, he maintains that remote care will never fully replace physical care but that, with advancing technology and future generations that are used to digital life, it will become more and more important. But he doesn\u2019t expect it to totally replace physical care services. \u201cPeople will need physical visits as well. It\u2019s my belief that [remote care] can\u2019t completely replace that, but tech will make [things] even easier in 10 years time.\u201d Both the staff and patients I meet seem to like it. Tiina Kosonen, a remote care nurse, says she is able to build close relationships with her clients. \u201cI like it and the patients get a lot from it. It\u2019s really intensive this contact. We look into each other\u2019s eyes and talk together face to face.\u201d One of her clients, 86-year-old Raimo Uimonen, who has epilepsy and lives alone says: \u201cI get a feeling of security from this service. I also like to talk. This video contact is really important as I get this face-to-face contact and the opportunity to discuss things.\u201d Lepp\u00e4nen adds: \u201cI\u2019ve been on home care visits. You come into a person\u2019s house, take your coat off and sort of intrude. Of course there are some instances where you need to be there, but if we can increase contact with the patient [surely that\u2019s a good thing]?\u201d So could this type of service take off in the UK, where the number of people aged 65 and over is set to increase by more than 40% over the next 20 years? Claire Turner, director of evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better, believes so. \u201cIf you can remotely check in on somebody, see how they are, remind them of medication, that feels like a good and practical solution [as it] enables more time for home visits for people who need physical support,\u201d she says. She adds: \u201cSocial contact is the stuff of life. That\u2019s what is important to us as human beings and it doesn\u2019t change as we get older. If part of the goal of this is to encourage people to have more contact with others who share interests or values, than that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Sarah Johnson\u2019s visit to Helsinki was supported by Business Finland",

It is pretty much like going to a pub, but doing it from your living room or back garden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s keeping communities entertained and friends and family connected together. It is like running an actual pub without the hassle of serving the booze.\n\n\u201cI have to delegate jobs to my team,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve had to ask a friend in Australia to moderate the page throughout the night to make sure there\u2019s entertainment for patrons 24/7.

We have coffee mornings as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a landlady you tend to be a pillar of the community, who people turn to in times of need. You\u2019re there for the good, the bad and the ugly,\u201d pondered Bowtell. \u201cYou almost have a moral obligation, the pub is an extension of the home for most people, but now their homes are the extension of the pub.\n\n\u201cThere are key workers getting in from work at odd hours and it is a way to connect with people.\n\n\u201cWe keep it light-hearted and there\u2019s a lot of banter but I don\u2019t tolerate bad language or derogatory comments. I\u2019m a bit of an old-school landlady like that.\n\nMORE: Watch These Self-Isolating Seniors Stave Off Boredom by Playing Life-Sized \u2018Hungry, Hungry Hippos\u2019\n\n\u201cBut it means I need a team of people to moderate the page, and arrange artists to perform.

    "transcript": "Since seniors have been shown to be particularly susceptible to the risks of COVID-19, nursing homes all over the world are taking extra care to keep their elderly residents safe in isolation.\n\nWith few activities to keep them occupied, the old Texan residents from The Enclave at Round Rock Senior Living have been waiting out the quarantine in boredom.\n\nLuckily, Hollywood A-lister and Texas native Matthew McConaughey offered to help keep them entertained earlier this week.\n\nWATCH: TGIF\u2014Quarantined Dad\u2019s Endearing Video Shows What It\u2019s Like Working From Home With a Toddler\n\nAlthough The Enclave residents have been trying to get McConaughey to visit their nursing home for several months now, the actor respected the rules of social distancing by hosting some rousing games of bingo over a video livestream.\n\nWith his wife and kids watching in delight, McConaughey called out the numbers to the seniors on the conference call until one of the residents got a bingo. As a prize for winning the game, the senior would get to ask McConaughey a question about himself.\n\nNeedless to say, the games were a rousing success.\n\n\u201cOur team members can\u2019t interact with the residents the way we normally do, so we have been doing everything possible to uplift them virtually,\u201d senior home sales director Molly Davis told KEYE News. \u201cThis was a wish come true!\n\n\u201cThe residents absolutely loved seeing Matthew and his family and enjoyed hearing him talk about what he\u2019s doing to get through this crisis. It gave them hope and was the boost that they needed to get through this lonely, challenging time.\u201d\n\nLOOK: Jimmy Fallon Asks Twitter to Change Movie Titles Into Quarantine Editions and the List is Hilarious\n\nOther social media users have taken pleasure in the virtual bingo games as well; since The Enclave published videos of the games to Facebook on Sunday, they have been viewed more than 100,000 times.\n\n\u201cDuring a time when we are all working to make lemonade out of lemons, we are so humbled that Matthew took the time to play our favorite game with us,\u201d wrote the nursing home. \u201cAs Matthew would say, let\u2019s turn this red light into a green light!\u201d\n\nThis is just one of many positive stories and updates that are coming out of the COVID-19 news coverage this week.
